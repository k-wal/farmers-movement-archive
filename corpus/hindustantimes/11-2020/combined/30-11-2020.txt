30-11-2020||News||What the Indian markets don’t tell you | Analysis||India is in an economic recession for the first time in its independent history. Since April, large swathes of the nation were completely shut for three months and only partially open there after. A recession and a pall of gloom over the economy were inevitable. The only surprise would have been if India’s economy had not suffered a deleterious impact. But, for a tiny sliver of India’s elite, it is not gloom but boom times.In the seven-month period between April and October, when businesses were shut and jobs were lost, 274 million rural Indians earned their livelihoods primarily by labouring an entire day to earn a paltry ₹200 under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). Hundred million more people asked for work under MGNREGS this year vis-à-vis last year, reflecting the economic impact of the lockdown.In exactly this sombre period, the top 50 companies in India’s stock market increased their value by $200 billion combined. This is seven times more than the increase in the value of these same 50 companies in the same period last year, when the economy was functioning normally. It defies conventional wisdom that when businesses are shut, and sales are faltering, that the market value of companies should increase so sharply.The market value of most of these companies has risen irrationally because of exuberant stock market activity with utter disregard to the state of the underlying economy or the performance of the companies. Foreign investors flush with money from central banks in their home countries have poured their excess cash into India’s stock markets. A few thousand investors gamble in the stock markets on a daily basis which pushes up the value of companies. Just when millions of rural Indians were toiling in the sun for ₹200 rupees, these investors spent $250bn every day to speculate on the prices of shares, currency, derivatives and other exotic financial instruments in India’s stock markets. Levels of speculative trading (measured as delivery percentage) in the stock markets reached an all-time high, with 50% more buying and selling this year compared to the same period last year when there was no economic shutdown.These 50 companies employ nearly two million workers. A vast majority of these workers did not gain a single rupee from the new wealth added to their companies. Nearly all the gains accrued only to the owners of these companies, their shareholders and people employed in the financial markets sector. Worse, such increase in market wealth did not help to create new jobs in these companies. Instead, some reduced their workforce while many reduced the wages of their employees. There was no tangible benefit to the economy or society from this excessive speculative stock market activity except enriching a select few and widening the economic and social inequality.Excesses of financialisation and financial markets are a real threat to social stability and harmony, not just in India but in many other countries such as the United States and United Kingdom. In the garb of market efficiency and price discovery, financial markets have turned into a den for gambling and a channel for easy wealth for a select few. But their risks are borne by all and protected by governments using taxes and savings of ordinary citizens. The social costs of excessive financialisation of economies now far exceed their perceived trickle down economic benefits. In his recent memoirs, former US President Barack Obama describes his experiences in dealing with the extravagances of the financial sector during the 2008 global financial crisis. He famously shamed the financial sector professionals by calling them “fat cat bankers” and attempted to impose a 90% tax on their financial income above a certain high threshold. None of these measures worked and in the decade since the crisis, the financial sector has only turned even more reckless and shallow. Obama is candidly remorseful that he was unable to tame the beast of financialisation. It may not be an exaggeration to impute that such extreme financialisation of the economy disrupted the social order and fostered the subsequent extreme Left and extreme Right political movements championed by Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump respectively.India’s post Covid-19 economy is like the fire god Agni — two faced with one beneficent and the other malignant. Malignant for a vast majority of Indian families that is experiencing job losses and declining incomes. Beneficent for a minuscule few that have seen their wealth soar, driven by irrational financial markets. The government’s economic response to the Covid-19 crisis has only further aggravated this social disparity through a bountiful monetary stimulus for the financial sector and negligible fiscal aid for ordinary people.It is time to acknowledge that India’s stock markets have no meaning for the larger economy. Gloating over stock market ebullience as an indicator of economic performance is like treating ticket sales of the Indian Derby as an indicator of the larger economy. Covid-19, apart from damaging the health of millions of Indians, may also further rupture India’s economic and social equity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/what-the-indian-markets-don-t-tell-you-analysis/story-j0I63mX5tJ5a5QggToY88J.html
30-11-2020||News||Where India and China differ in the Indian Ocean region||The national security adviser-level trilateral between India, Sri Lanka and Maldives was held in Colombo last week, after a gap of six years, underlining the renewed urgency for cooperation in the region, particularly in the wake of China’s ambitious geopolitical tactics.In the wake of the trilateral, it is important to examine ways to deepen co-operation between India and its Indian Ocean neighbours. One way to do this is strengthening India’s policy of development cooperation and economic diplomacy in the region vis-à-vis China’s engagement track.India’s development cooperation has been a consolidated effort over several decades, across four key verticals. One, housing and rehabilitation projects and high impact community development projects have involved grassroots development and large-scale local participation. Two, education-based tourism programmes and skill-building initiatives such as the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) and the Technology Adoption Project were fully sponsored by the government of India, in coordination with over 68 premier institutions. Three, infrastructure projects have followed the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) policy and aimed to deepen economic and security cooperation with its maritime neighbours. Some key Indian projects in Sri Lanka are the Kankesanthurai harbour in Northern Sri Lanka and the Indo-Japanese East Container Terminal (ECT) at Colombo Port. Similarly, for Maldives, India is assisting with the Greater Male Connectivity Project. And, finally, India is also committed to improving energy infrastructure and helping cope with the climate crisis in the region, aided by its expertise in solar energy.India’s investments have thus been focused on human capital development and deployed largely in employment-intensive sectors. This is in contrast to Beijing’s efforts. China had developed particularly close ties with past regimes in Sri Lanka and Maldives. During the earlier presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena, Sri Lanka had committed to its participation in the Belt and Road Initiative. It was then that China became the largest investor in Sri Lanka and one of its projects, the deep-sea Hambantota Port, was leased to it for 99 years due to staggering debt. Similarly, in Maldives, President Abdullah Yameen’s tenure in office (2013-2018) was regarded as a time of a pro-China tilt for the Maldives. And it was then that large investments in infrastructure were made.Since most of the Chinese investment has been in infrastructure projects, which have long gestation periods, and the majority of the development assistance is in the form of non-concessional loans, Sri Lanka and Maldives find themselves in a debt trap. The Maldives, for instance, has run up a debt of $1.3 billion to China, which is more than a quarter of the GDP of Maldives. The unsustainable levels of debt have made the new governments in both countries wary of foreign participation in large-scale infrastructure projects.However, India can look to increase its engagement in a threefold manner. First, New Delhi can play a much bigger role through climate diplomacy with Maldives and Sri Lanka, since it has taken the lead in promoting two initiatives globally: The International Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI).Second, India could take a leaf out of China’s “sharp power” diplomacy and utilise its information broadcasting capacity to showcase its own global initiatives. This would help soften its “big brother” image in the region.And finally, a key grouping that can play a bigger role in strengthening cooperation with Sri Lanka and Maldives vis-à-vis China is the Quad. Key individual actors — namely Japan, India and United States (US) — are present in both the countries as independent donor nations and can do much more through coordinated actions, to promote soft power and economic diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/where-india-and-china-differ-in-the-indian-ocean-region/story-5PadAB93qB4h7phmPWJtZN.html
30-11-2020||News||From India’s wars, five lessons for the present||Having spent eight years researching and writing in a focused manner on war and conflict in independent India, it is time to distil five big lessons for a diverse constituency of stakeholders in India’s national security matrix. These range from the policymaker and the practitioner to the academic and the common citizen. As India matures as a democracy and its aspirations to emerge as a leading power gains momentum, all these stakeholders must understand the conduct of war and the utility of force as an instrument of statecraft.The first lesson is that contrary to the largely peaceful trajectory of growth envisaged by the drafters of the Constitution, India has been a “reluctantly warring democracy” to protect its sovereignty and internal fabric. It has fought four major wars and one high-intensity but limited conflict with its principal adversaries, Pakistan and China. It has quelled four insurgencies (Mizoram, Tripura, Punjab and Assam), in which the latter two also displayed shades of terrorism. It continues to search for a solution to the longest insurgency in the post-World War-II era (the Naga insurgency) that has merged with another violent expression of ethnic angst in Manipur. Left-wing extremism has shown signs of fatigue, but security forces continue to search for conflict termination before the phase of conflict resolution offers some light at the end of what has been an intense struggle of ideas. In what has been a mother of all struggles, the Indian State continues to grapple with a waxing and waning proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) that has shown chameleon-like shades of insurgency, terrorism and hybrid war.The second lesson is that India has not been averse to the application and demonstration of force outside its geographical boundaries in response to a call for help from neighbours and the global community. The Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) intervention in Sri Lanka; the foiling of the 1988 coup in Maldives; the sustained contribution to United Nations peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations, many of which have led to violent armed confrontations and resulted in casualties; and the resolute action in Doklam, are all examples of India’s willingness to stand up as a responsible international player.The third lesson is a corollary of the first and a consequence of both moral and developmental dilemmas in the Indian strategic DNA. In its quest to emerge as a responsible and restrained power that strives to uphold the ideals of its pioneering leaders, India has often been surprised by assertive and relatively clear-headed adversaries, both at the state and non-state levels. While moral dilemmas have often delayed military responses, developmental dilemmas have resulted in the creation of suboptimal military capabilities.A fourth lesson of realpolitik and umbilical linkages between politics, policy and war in contemporary India emerges from the propositions laid out by Kautilya, the ancient Indian strategist and Clausewitz, the Prussian military thinker of the early 19th century. While the former suggested “hard” and seemingly “amoral” decisions in pursuit of power for the common good, the latter advocated close coordination between political entities, policymakers and practitioners of war as the only way to ensure the successful conduct of war as an instrument of statecraft.These have been clearly validated in India’s experience over the last 74 years. The orchestration of the 1971 War and the occupation of the Saltoro Ridge that overlooks the Siachen Glacier were examples of hard-nosed decisions that went against the grain of conventional Indian statecraft. Similarly, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s decision not to allow Indian forces to cross the Line of Control during the Kargil conflict was another example of political clarity that led to the occupation of a high ground by India that demonstrated that it could balance the application of force with restraint.The fifth and last lesson, based on recent events in the security domain, highlight India’s attempts to shape new policies, strategies and structures to meet contemporary national security challenges. There is clearly a reduced threshold to absorb “first blows” and an articulated aspiration to migrate from diffidence and excessive restraint to a more assertive and proactive response mechanism. India’s recent cross-border strikes on its eastern and western frontiers, its response at Doklam and the firm, albeit delayed, reaction to transgressions by the People’s Liberation Army in eastern Ladakh have demonstrated this clearly. What emerges is that for any significant shift in strategy to be effective, there needs to be a strong bridge that connects politics, policy, strategy, doctrine, structures and capability, much like the Strategy Bridge suggested by the renowned English scholar, Colin Gray. Clearly, it is this bridge that needs significant bolstering at every level.Recent initiatives indicate that this process has commenced in right earnest with a top-down approach; there will be hits and misses along the way as India seeks a “new normal” in its national security and warfighting discourse. Lessons from the past will always offer instructive guidance..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/from-india-s-wars-five-lessons-for-the-present/story-h1nV9Q7nOm13XZeqaxreCI.html
30-11-2020||News||In memory of Frontier Gandhi, a plea for justice for Faisal Khan||It has been exactly a month since the October 29 arrest in Delhi of Faisal Khan, national convener of the Khudai Khidmatgars, an organisation he had revived 10 years ago. Denied bail, he has also not been brought to trial. Moreover, there are troubling reports that, after the arrest, he tested positive for Covid-19.Khudai Khidmatgars — God’s servants — were first organised 90 years ago, in the North West Frontier Province of yore, by that astonishing figure, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, whose people called him Badshah or Bacha Khan. To others, he simply was the Frontier Gandhi. Because they worked for Independence and for Hindu-Muslim partnership, many Khudai Khidmatgars, including the Frontier Gandhi himself, were jailed for long spells. They were among the freedom movement’s greatest heroes, and their presence was an unforgettable rebuke to the pernicious two-nation theory.After reviving the Khudai Khidmatgars in Delhi, Faisal Khan has striven without pause for two goals — communal harmony and relief for the neediest. He is also a wonderful singer of the Tulsi Ramayan. Hindus of all types, from venerated guru to college students, have been charmed by his rendering of the Ramayan’s verses. Keen, as part of his efforts towards harmony, to identify with the traditions of his Hindu friends, Khan, along with associates, recently performed the much-valued Braj Parikrama. On the last day of this 84-km yatra, they went to Mathura’s Nand Baba Mandir, where they were courteously received by the priest.When Khan bid farewell to the priest in order to offer namaaz elsewhere, the priest apparently said, “This is a sacred place. You can read the namaaz here.” Khan did this on a courtyard of the temple premises, along with one of his friends. Three days later, however, the Uttar Pradesh police arrested him in Delhi on charges of hurting relations between communities. It seems that misgivings were caused by a video taken at the temple by one of Khan’s associates, which perhaps was over-enthusiastically circulated. Anyone seeing this video, which includes a glimpse of two men doing the namaaz, can observe the friendliness and respect that marked their visit to Nand Baba, as also the priest’s courtesy to the visitors.A gesture of respect and friendship, which was also a painstaking effort at bridge-building, was later seen or described as an attempt to sow discord, even to pollute a place of worship.The real question here is whether a dedicated individual whose organisation recalls one of the finest chapters in our country’s history, and who himself has been striving to strengthen relations between communities, should continue to be kept behind bars and denied bail. How normal or acceptable is it that an Indian citizen should remain a month or more in detention without an open trial? Not that Khan is the only one caught this situation. Others have been shut away for much longer, which is not a tribute to the police or the judiciary, or to the ministers who control the police.If I add my voice to those of other citizens troubled by this episode, it’s for two reasons.One, I know Faisal Khan and have seen his selflessness, his tirelessness, and his passion for friendship and reconciliation. Second, I also knew Badshah Khan, whom I first met in 1945, when I was 10 and he was staying in our Connaught Circus home above the offices of the Hindustan Times, where my father, Devadas Gandhi, was the editor. I last met Badshah Khan in Mumbai in 1987, a year before his death at the age of 98. Later, I had the chance – and the privilege – of writing Badshah Khan’s biography, where, among other things, I had to address the betrayal meted out in 1947 to Badshah Khan and his Pathans.That India would permit the continuing incarceration of a gallant man who restarted, in Delhi and elsewhere in the country, the work of the Khudai Khidmatgars is not a thought I can easily stomach. I must express my anguish and request the authorities to free Faisal Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-memory-of-frontier-gandhi-a-plea-for-justice-for-faisal-khan/story-Vzto6Dx07UrkVoriCGEHSP.html
30-11-2020||City||Mohali industrial area’s upkeep stuck in red tape||Eight months after the Mohali municipal corporation House unanimously rejected a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for maintenance and development of certain parts of the Industrial Area falling under the civic body’s jurisdiction, the Punjab government has failed to take any decision on it. The handover of the maintenance work of Phases 8A and 8B of the Industrial Area from Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) to the municipal corporation (MC), which began a year ago, has also been caught up in a bureaucratic maze.Both the developments have hit the maintenance of industrial areas, with the condition going from bad to worse.In September last year, an SPV was notified under a Government of India scheme for the maintenance of industrial areas in Phases 4, 5, 7, 8, 8A, 8B, 9 and 9 (extension). To generate the revenue, it was to collect property tax and water supply and sewerage charges, which earlier went to the MC. In the House meeting last December 27, the councillors rejected this, stating that if the proposal is allowed, similar demands would start coming from other bodies.A ray of hope was seen for Phases 8 and 8A earlier this year, but even that has come to naught. “We have handed over a list of 24 employees to the MC. They will work under the MC, which will pay them the salaries,” said a senior PSIEC official. However, MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said the list of employees was incomplete. “We asked PSIEC to give all details, including service records and pay scales, of employees. We are hopeful of starting the maintenance work soon,” he said.It has been almost two decades since industrial focal points were created in Mohali, but basic amenities are still elusive. In absence of proper eating joints and recreational spots in Phases 7, 8, 8A and 8B, which are being projected as an IT hub, most professionals have no choice but to depend on roadside eateries. Roads are in a dilapidated condition and get waterlogged every time it rains. Wild growth is rampant in every nook and corner. Even as ₹12 crore have been collected as property tax in the past three years, only ₹3 crore have been spent on development.Yogesh Sagar, president, Mohali Industry Association, said: “The situation has gone from bad to worse. We held a meeting with the principal secretary, local bodies, who said the MC has been asked to consider the SPV but no response has been received. We urge both the MC and PSIEC to carry out maintenance work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-industrial-area-s-upkeep-stuck-in-red-tape/story-FeSJ9BMvf1vGst7AHNGHAN.html

30-11-2020||Chandigarh||No hike in parking rates in Chandigarh, for now||The imposition of hiked parking charges on hourly basis in Chandigarh is likely to be pushed to December end. With contractors yet to offer all smart features in parking lots, the municipal corporation is preparing to issue fresh instructions, granting them another month. “The contractors have not yet offered all smart features mandated as per terms and conditions. So, they cannot charge new hiked rates. We will be issuing a letter to them on Tuesday in this regard,” said SK Jain, additional commissioner, MC. Earlier, in October, the MC had directed parking contractors to offer all smart features at 89 parking lots being run by them within one month. New parking charges were contingent on that, and were expected to kick in from December 1. “While we will not be charging new parking rates from December 1, we will meet MC officials to discuss the issue on Tuesday. We have installed most of the smart features,” said, Vikas Pandey, manager, Pashchatya Entertainment Pvt Ltd, the contractor for Zone 2. Some of the smart features that are to be offered include e-ticketing, HD night-vision CCTV cameras at exit/entry points, smart card based daily and monthly passes, provision for e-payment, LED display of real-time occupancy at entry points, and online booking of parking space through app. Notably, the MC, succumbing to the contactors’ threat of withdrawing from parking management, in its General House meet held on November 27 had decided to allow licence fee relaxation for September, October and November, ranging from 45% to 65% of actual fee. In the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown, the MC had already given a complete licence fee exemption for April and May. The civic body had then allowed the contractors to deposit 35-45% of the actual allotted fee from June 1 to August 31. Charges depend upon parking durationAfter the new rates kick in, parking fee for the first four hours will remain the same as the flat rates charged right now: ₹5 for two-wheelers and ₹10 for four-wheelers.Thereafter, these will be doubled to ₹10 and ₹20, respectively. The charges will further be doubled to ₹20 and ₹40, respectively, if vehicles are kept parked beyond 12 hours. However, there will be free entry for pick and drop in the first 10 minutes.At Elante Mall, Piccadily Square Mall and Fun Republic, flat rate of ₹20 and ₹40 will be charged for two- and four-wheelers, respectively. All parking lots will also allow day passes for multiple entries besides monthly passes.Parking lots in the city have been divided into two zones: 32 in Zone 1 and 57 in Zone 2. The MC had auctioned both zones for around ₹10 crore annually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-hike-in-parking-rates-in-chandigarh-for-now/story-rIIerWzKzXCGXdo6QzXu9K.html
30-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh sees 20% surge in Covid cases in November||The number of Covid-19 cases saw around 20% jump in November as compared to October, though fatalities dropped by 20% in the same period in Chandigarh.November also accounted for around 17% cases and 18% deaths reported in the city so far.In the first three weeks of the month, the number of cases saw an upward trend, climbing from 549 in the first to 955 in the third week. However, the number dipped to 835 in the last week. In contrast, the number of deaths reported in the last week was highest, rising gradually to 17 from five in the first week.Meanwhile, even as the number of deaths has been on a decline from 106 in September to 64 in October and 51 in November, there has been no dip in the overall fatality rate. “The impact of the infection rise in mid-November may have resulted in more deaths in the last week of the month,” said Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.On the rise in infections in November, he said it was expected, but the numbers are not that alarming.“We can comfortably say that apprehensions regarding the spurt in infection due to festivals did not have much impact on the Covid-19 situation in Chandigarh. There are no widespread infections and no big clusters, and the number is less than what was expected,” he said.Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department, said increased testing has helped contain infection spread.“All containment zones as well as dispensaries have been covered one by one. Hubs of activities, such as bus stations and railway stations, are also being covered for testing,” he said.Sources said the target of conducted at least 35,000 in November has been achieved, which is much more than 6,000 tests conducted in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-sees-20-surge-in-covid-cases-in-november/story-t1Ur6rddinaCJVqk0pR42M.html
30-11-2020||Noida||Man alleges extortion by cops; police deny allegation||A Barola-based man has alleged that he was stopped by two policemen, who extorted ₹5,000 from him for carrying sand in his tractor. The police officials have denied the allegations.The man, identified as Satish Kumar who works as a transporter to supply materials to construction sites, took to social media to allege that a sub-inspector and constable deployed at the Sector 49 police station had extorted ₹5,000 from him before letting him off. He also claimed that police in the area were targeting tractor and mini truck drivers for extorting money.Taking cognisance of the matter, senior police officials ordered a probe in the case and an assistant commissioner of police in Zone 1 was asked to lead the investigation.“We contacted the man who had made these allegations. It appears that the incident had occurred on November 5, although the claims were made yesterday. It seems that the man was only stopped by our cops, who asked him about his destination. No money was exchanged, and after the policemen received answer, they allowed the man to pass,” said ACP 3, Vimal Kumar Singh, who was conducting the probe.He said that allegation of money being extorted is completely false and the sub-inspector and constable were only doing their job. The man has also allegedly denied during questioning that he was asked for money, said the ACP.Police officials said that the victim only made the claims after he was asked by a friend to do so. For now, no action is being taken against Kumar for making false allegations.On November 22 as well, a man on social media had alleged that a cop in Sector 63 was taking bribes from people on two-wheelers. The claims were later found to be false and it was proved that he was issued a challan for not wearing a mask in public and a helmet while driving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/man-alleges-extortion-by-cops-police-deny-allegation/story-IMtvaQpeVoXuKucZjTLSAM.html

30-11-2020||Dehradun||Bickering in Uttarakhand Congress over CM candidate for 2022 polls||Bickering is on in Uttarakhand Congress over who will lead the party as the chief ministerial candidate in the 2022 assembly polls. The Congress, on Monday, issued a statement saying state Congress president Pritam Singh will lead the party in the 2022 Assembly elections. The development came after some senior Congress leaders, including Rajya Sabha member Pradeep Tamta, senior Congress MLA Govind Singh Kunjwal, Dharchula MLA Harish Dhami, former Almora MLA Manoj Tiwari, projected former chief minister and senior Congress leader Harish Rawat as the party’s chief ministerial candidate for the forthcoming assembly polls in 2022. This has not gone well with the Congress state president Pritam Singh and his supporters. Congress state vice president Suryakant Dhasmana issued a statement on Monday, making it clear that Pritam Singh will be the captain of the party in the 2022 elections. “No change is happening in the Pradesh Congress Committee and no leader has been projected as the chief ministerial candidate by the party as of now. Right now, the focus is on strengthening the party at the grassroots level and raising main issues faced by the people in the state like unemployment and price hike”, said Dhasmana. Dhasmana said that Pritam Singh will lead the party in 2022 elections and is already on a tour of the state, working at the forefront, meeting with the party leaders and cadre in different districts. Also read: Indian-American Neera Tanden named in Joe Biden’s top economic team“Our job right now should be to work for making Congress victorious in the elections. Who will be the chief ministerial candidate should be left to the party high command. If we start a debate over this now, it will send a wrong signal to the people that all we care about is who will be the CM candidate”, he said. When questioned about the developments, Harish Rawat said he will do whatever the party high command in Delhi tells him. “If they don’t want me here, I am ready to move away from the Congress affairs in the state. All my actions here are inspired by the doing what is good for the party in the long run,” he said. On him being projected as the CM candidate by some senior party leaders, he said, “This is their view. My job is to work in best interests of the party in the state in the long run”. The infighting in the state party unit is raging ahead of the elections, especially at a time when the party is trying to strengthen itself at the grassroots level. Recently, some Congress leaders even indirectly attacked Harish Rawat, blaming him for the 2017 election loss. Rawat responded by saying, “They are those who were just getting born when I tasted first electoral loss and was then preparing to fight next. However, there are also some old ones, who have never fought any election nor got the Congress win in their wards, but counting my electoral losses… I want to tell them that I have been at the forefront of election campaigns from 2002 to 2019. These statistics masters ought to stop counting my wins and losses and move forward”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/bickering-in-uttarakhand-congress-over-cm-candidate-for-2022-polls/story-5R3p1QJz6mw4XHPEAE7TwM.html
30-11-2020||City||Data centre project will catalyse investments by IT companies in Greater Noida, say officials||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida authority on Monday said that it is flooded with proposals from several IT companies seeking land for their projects in Sector Knowledge Park V since October when it allotted 20-acre plot for a data centre in the sector. Authority officials said that they have readied at least 100 acres of land for the use of IT companies. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, on Sunday had laid down foundation stone for the Rs 6,000 crore data centre project in Knowledge Park V from Lucknow through a virtual event. Greater Noida authority chief executive officer Narendra Bhooshan said that it was a ‘historic event’ as it would attract IT companies to set up their units in the city. “Right after we allotted the land for data centre project, there is an excellent response from IT companies, which want to buy the land and set up units in this city in the same sector. We have readied at least 100 acres of land for the use of IT companies,” said Bhooshan. The officials said that it has readied the land by cancelling the allotment to old companies. “We cancelled the allotment to companies, which were paying the land cost in instalments. We want to allot land to big reputed companies with an aim to generate jobs and fuel local economy. As of now, we cannot disclose the names of big companies as the discussions are underway. But if the negotiations are successful, then projects which are bigger than data centre will be set up in near future,” said Bhooshan. According to the Greater Noida authority, it gives priority to companies in allotment if any company wants to invest more than Rs 100 crore in a project. “If any company’s investment is more than Rs 100 crore, then we allot land in 10 days like we did in the data centre case. The investors should feel the comfort of ease of doing business in Greater Noida,” said Bhooshan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/data-centre-project-will-catalyse-investments-by-it-companies-in-greater-noida-say-officials/story-IgcBLaIaDuTsAGEznUYCjK.html
30-11-2020||Mumbai||Farmers protesting outside national capital are not terrorists: Shiv Sena||Shiv Sena continued its attack on the central government over protesting farmers and said that Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi used farmers to “pave the way” to come into power and now he must “support” them. Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that farmers protesting outside the national capital are not terrorists and the manner in which the force is being used against them, is uncalled for.Farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana have been protesting at Delhi’s borders for five days against the new farm laws. The farmers fear that the new laws will allow the corporates to control prices and take away their minimum guaranteed earnings.Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Raut said that the farmers are protesting in a peaceful manner and it is an example for the world. “If such force would have been used along Line of Actual Control (LAC) then Chinese would not have entered the Indian territory… PM Modi should support the farmers; merely holding talks with them will not help. When you were paving the way to come in to [power] in Delhi, that time your slogans said that injustice against farmers will not be tolerated. Today, what is happening on the Delhi border in Haryana? Farmers are not terrorists,” Raut said.In the Sena mouthpiece Saamana, the party said that using water cannons on protesting farmers when the cold wave is sweeping parts of north India was “cruel”. The editorial also said that the BJP is raking up the Khalistan issue to start their “politics” in Punjab.“Our farmers are being treated as terrorists and are attacked on Delhi borders while terrorists are killing our soldiers on the border in Kashmir. BJP wants to vitiate the atmosphere and it also invites anarchy. Khalistan is a closed chapter for which Indira Gandhi and General Arunkumar Vaidya laid down their lives. BJP is not unnecessarily raking up the Khalistan issue, but it wants to spark the issue and start its politics in Punjab,” the editorial in Saamana said.The editorial published on Monday said that giant statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat will be shedding tears at the treatment meted out against the farmers. It further added BJP is using all tools to destabilise the government of the opponents in all non-BJP ruled states including Maharashtra but the same “determination” is not seen while battling the enemies of the country.Commenting on the use of Central agencies by BJP-government against political rivals in the country, Sena said, “ED (Enforcement Directorate) and CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) should be given an opportunity to prove their valour. Every time bullets don’t work. At Delhi’s border, our farmers are called terrorists, while terrorists are entering the Kashmir border and Ladakh. At such times, ED and CBI should be sent to the borders. There is no other option...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/farmers-protesting-outside-national-capital-are-not-terrorists-shiv-sena/story-ixCDziFtC9mX9rfIrUaFSL.html
30-11-2020||City||Noida: Apartment owners suffer as developer ‘refuses’ to hand over maintenance||NOIDA: Residents of Sunshine Helios in Noida Sector 78 are at loggerheads with the developer over handing over of maintenance to the apartment owners association (AOA)Residents alleged they are suffering for years as the developer has not handed over maintenance, flouting the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh apartment act 2010 despite multiple orders in this regard. But the developer says he has not handed over the maintenance because a dispute among two groups of residents is pending in the Allahabad high court.Residents have now decided to approach the Noida authority and the UP government for justice. According to section 14(2) of the UP apartment act 2010 and section 17(2) of UP real estate regulatory authority, it is the joint responsibility of the promoter and apartment owners to form an association. The promoter will get the association registered when a certain number of apartments necessary to form an association, or 33% of apartments, whichever is more by way of sale, transfer or possession, have been handed over to owners, provided the building has been completed along with infrastructure services and completion certificate obtained from local authority, the rule says.The Noida authority’s group housing department had on November 12 ordered handing over maintenance as per rules to the elected AOA. But instead of obeying the orders, the developer filed an application with the state government’s office in Lucknow, residents said.“The developer misled officials of the industrial department with submitting wrong facts in Lucknow to delay the hand over and continue harassing us. As the per UP apartment act 2010, maintenance should be handed over within a year after AOA gets elected. But the developer is flouting all norms to charge exorbitant fee and make profit,” said GS Sidhu president of AOA of Sunshine Helios in sector 78. In response to a letter of the promoter of Sunshine Infrawell Private Limited on November 26, Anand Kumar Singh under secretary the UP government, asked the Noida authority to submit a report on this issue (of hand over of maintenance) in three days. On Sunday, residents in a meeting decided to meet the authority officials and write to state government over the delay in handover of maintenance. “We will meet authority officials and write to the UP government in this matter because the developer does not want to us have basic amenities, that include electricity supply, drinking water and others,” Sidhu said.According to the authority, the developer had obtained completion certificate in 2017 and started offering possession to apartment owners.“However, it has only executed registry of only 120 flats out of total 406 flats. At least 1,500 people are living in this society and most of them without property title because the developer is yet to pay Rs30 crore financial dues to the authority without which registry cannot take place. The developer is harassing us in multiple ways,” said Ashish Panda, general secretary of AOA Sunshine Helios.Before this, UPRERA had on June 12, 2019, asked the developer to hand over the maintenance to AOA. But the developer allegedly did not follow the order at that time too.The Noida authority too said the developer is not obeying to orders.“We had resolved the matter as per UP apartment act 2010 provisions, asking them to hand over maintenance to AOA. We will send a report on this to the state government as per directions,” said Rajesh Kumar, officer on special duty of the Noida authority.The promoter said he cannot hand over the maintenance to AOA because the matter is sub-judice in the Allahabad high court. “Two groups of apartment owners had last year filed a case in the Allahabad high court over maintenance. And the same matter is still on trial. We cannot hand over maintenance until the court gives a final verdict on the issue. We are happy to hand over as per court orders and as per law. But let the court decide the matter. We are providing all quality services to apartment owners,” said Harendra Yadav promoter of Sunshine Infrawell private limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-apartment-owners-suffer-as-developer-refuses-to-hand-over-maintenance/story-4y1Pp9kmBlfM9SoeqcVV3M.html
30-11-2020||Noida||Delhi Police places concrete barriers at UP Gate to prevent farmers from entering Capital||The Delhi Police on Monday placed reinforced cement concrete barricades at the UP Gate border near Ghazipur in order to prevent any damage to the iron grille barricades by the protesting farmers, who are camping below the UP Gate flyover in Ghaziabad. The farmers led by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) have been camping below the UP Gate flyover since Saturday, when they were stopped from entering the national Capital to protest against the farm bills that seek to liberalize farm trade in the country. There have been nearly six attempts in the past three days, when groups of farmers led by BKU supporters have charged at the iron grille barricades and brought them down in a bid to enter Delhi.Further, BKU supporters have marked the road near the Delhi border with the sign, “Dhaara 288”, which they say indicates that no outside person is allowed in the area where they are protesting. A portion of the road has been cordoned off with limestone dust by the protesting farmers.“Dhaara 288’ indicates that there is no confrontation, and the police as well as the farmers will remain at their respective places. We do not intend to confront the police are waiting for the government for talks. It is likely to take place on December 3. We are not obstructing the traffic and will continue to stay here,” said Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of BKU, told reporters at UP Gate on Monday. He added that they will continue their stay till government holds talks with them along with other farmers’ associations. “The Delhi Police have placed heavy cement concrete barriers which cannot be removed easily as compared to other types of barriers. In Ghaziabad, the protest has remained peaceful and the traffic diversion is already in place. There is no law-and-order situation at the UP Gate and our personnel are deployed at the site,” said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (City 2). The farmers at the site have come from various districts of Uttar Pradesh, including Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Amroha, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and others. In view of the protests near the UP Gate, the district officials have also made provisions for traffic diversions. Commuters coming from Indirapuram, Noida and proceeding towards Delhi have been asked to take the NH-9 flyover at UP Gate, bypassing the protest site.A senior officer of Delhi Police, who wished not to be named, said cement barriers have been placed at Ghazipur border to stop farmers from entering the Capital with their vehicles. “Since the farmers have also called for blocking Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Faridabad borders, adequate measures are being taken to prevent any untoward incident,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/delhi-police-places-concrete-barriers-at-up-gate-to-prevent-farmers-from-entering-capital/story-S1BsqT9MMfPGa5BoG8eQoK.html

30-11-2020||Noida||Noida authority plans to revive Yamuna embankment road project||The Noida authority has planned to revive the Yamuna embankment road project proposed to decongest the Noida expressway, officials said. The authority had deferred work on a 15-km stretch of the Yamuna embankment road due to fund crunch in 2016, said the officials. “In 2016, the authority postponed the work on this project due to fund crunch. Now, the authority may take up the work if all goes well because it will help decongest the existing Noida-Greater Noida Expressway,” said Vijay Rawal, project engineer, Noida authority.According to the officials, the project has become all the more important because the UP government has directed the Noida and Yamuna expressway authorities to find out new routes to provide additional connectivity from Delhi to Jewar, where an airport project is to be completed by 2023-24.This 15-km stretch is part of the 26-km embankment road that starts from Noida’s Sector 94 near Kalindi Kunj barrage (on Delhi-Noida border) till Sector 150 near Noida-Greater Noida border. “The authority may construct it because it is important to provide an additional connectivity to motorists who travel to Noida’s sectors 15, 16, 17, 128, 135, 150, 151, 168, among others, along with some areas of Greater Noida,” said another official, not authorised to speak to media.In March 2016, the authority had sent the detailed project report for this 15-km road project to the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi for financial vetting. The 15-metre wide road had an estimated cost of Rs 275 crore for construction as per the DPR, said the officials. “Since then, the authority has not asked the IIT-Delhi to send its report due to fund crunch. But now due to the proposed Jewar airport, the authority may work on this soon,” said the official, adding that the 11-km stretch of the embankment road was already constructed and opened to public in June 2014.Residents have welcomed the authority’s move to revive the project. “We have been demanding for this additional connectivity for a long time, as we have to face traffic jam during peak hours on the Noida expressway. The proposed road will provide relief from traffic congestion,” said Prempal Singh, a resident of Sector 135.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-plans-to-revive-yamuna-embankment-road-project/story-SKG8cG7JyZ95nXHsoH1tMP.html
30-11-2020||Noida||Old tree guards damaging trees in Indirapuram, environmentalists raise concerns||Ghaziabad:Many full-grown trees planted along footpaths of Indirapuram and other areas are getting damaged and need immediate intervention as the iron grilles of tree guards, which were not removed, have merged with the trunks. Environmentalists say such negligence is causing damage to trees and brings to light the apathy of agencies in properly maintaining and protecting trees. Such trees are found near ATS Advantage high-rise in Indirapuram. Residents of the area have taken to social media, urging authorities to immediately intervene. @TheSPSingh tweeted pictures of several trees and asked the Ghaziabad development authority to remove the “metal cages.” “Such instances are common in the city. It happens when agencies are lax in paying attention towards the environment and trees. It generally happens that once a tree is planted, it is covered with tree guards made of iron grilles. Over a period of time, these need to be removed but it is hardly done. As a result, when the trunk of the tree grows, the iron grilles merge into the trunk, and leads to damage and stunted growth,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. “Another form of damage is caused when the concrete cement tiles are placed close to the base of the tree and it hardly gets any space to grow. Such instances are prevalent across the city. The agencies even do not have a proper tree survey in the city to ascertain the number of trees,” he said. Vikrant Sharma, another city-based environmentalist and a resident of Raj Nagar Extension, said about 250 tree guards were removed by residents with the help of GDA. “These tree guards were about two years old and were hindering the growth of trees. So, we roped in residents and asked them to adopt one tree. The cost of removing the tree guards, getting them repaired and putting them to protect new plantation is about Rs 200-250 per tree. So, this way, we got the old tree guards removed and used them to protect new trees,” Sharma said. He said trees such as neem, sheesham or jamun, etc., generally require tree guards for about three years and thereafter these need to be removed. “But there is hardly any focus of agencies towards these issues. In fact, removal of old tree guards and using them again for new plantation will save a lot of cost. In my opinion, if old tree guards are removed timely and repaired before putting them to protect new plantation, one tree guard can be used for at least three times. I think residents should also come forward for the protection of trees in their vicinity,” he added. Santosh Kumar Rai, secretary GDA, said the issue could be the result of laxity on the part of area inspectors. “I will seek a report from them and ensure that such old tree guards that are damaging trees in Indirapuram are removed at the earliest. We will not only get the issue checked up near the ATS highrise but will also ask our officials to check other areas as well,” he, added. Municipal commissioner MS Tanwar said that he will get the problems checked in areas under the corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/old-tree-guards-damaging-trees-in-indirapuram-environmentalists-raise-concerns/story-6P4iKEXr0Ia0bAojWoJmVM.html
30-11-2020||Noida||Noida: November records nearly 5,000 new Covid cases||NOIDA: If the new Covid-19 cases per month are any indication, the trend of spread of the viral disease since September has been more or less similar in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. However, unlike other months, the number of cured cases is greater than new Covid-19 cases detected in November. According to the district health department figures, as many as 4,854 new positive cases were detected in November, which is greater than the cases detected in October. Even the deaths due to Covid-19 were the same in both the months, i.e. 15. However, as far as the number of cured Covid-19 patients is concerned, it was more than new positive cases in November as 4,933 patients (79 more than fresh cases) were cured in this month. Despite increased sampling this month, the frequency of cases remained more or less same with respect to the new cases detected in October. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said with all economic activities resuming after the nationwide lockdown, the main aim of the administration now is to reduce the case fatality rate (CFR), while simultaneously increasing the scale of testing. “It’s a positive sign that despite increasing the testing, the number of new cases in the district is on a fixed trend. We have adapted ‘track, test and treat’ method for checking the spread of Covid-19. As a result, GB Nagar’s CFR is continuously on a receding trend. It has now gone down to 0.36%, which is much better than national figure of 1.64% and the state’s 1.39%,” Suhas said. Claiming that GB Nagar’s testing rate is the best among all districts of north India, the DM also said that the district’s testing rate per million per day is over 1,750, which is nearly 160 more than other best districts in north India. “All factories and other industrial establishments are strictly following the safety protocols as per the advisory issued by us. Over 10 teams, with the help of district industries department, have been constituted to inspect whether safety protocols are being followed in workplaces and factories,” he said. GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that to check the Covid-19 spread in the district, daily testing has been increased and rapid antigen kit testing camps are being organised regularly at different places in the district. “Besides ramping up testing, the district has stepped up monitoring of patients in home isolation. The health department’s surveillance teams have started implementing stringent containment rules. Early hospitalisation of patients needing medical support and efficient infection control at health care facilities are our top priorities,” Ohri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-november-records-nearly-5-000-new-covid-cases/story-2n49IUSfuGc9UrgjjrIUOM.html
30-11-2020||Noida||Over 12,000 ‘superspreaders’ found Covid positive during focussed testing before Diwali: Data||Focussed testing on “superspreader” groups across Uttar Pradesh before Diwali has revealed that most of the positive cases were found among the staff deployed at chemist shops, nursing homes, religious places, sweets shop, along with street vendors . The officials of the state government on Monday said that they conducted about 8,74,619 tests, of which 12,290 persons were found to be positive. The focussed testing was carried out between October 29 and November 12, which yielded a positivity rate of about 1.41%. The highest positivity was found among the staff members of chemist shops and nursing homes, which had the positivity rate of 2.63%. A total of 62,786 tests were conducted in this group, which resulted in 1,650 positives. Positivity rate among staff members of religious groups stood at 2.12% with 1,14,976 tests which resulted in 2,438 positive cases. Among street vendors, a total of 1,17,767 tests were conducted that revealed 2,275 positive cases with a positivity rate of 1.93%.

The second round of focussed testing after Diwali was ordered between November 19 to November 30. “With focussed testing, we were able to timely isolate people and prevent the further spread of infection. The groups tested during the drive were those who come in contact with a large number of people on a daily basis. All precautions must be observed till the time a vaccine becomes available,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). The lowest positivity, ranging below 1%, was found among other targeted groups, such as fruit and vegetable vendors, restaurant staffers, auto drivers, beauticians, those deployed at malls, electronic shops and automobile workshops. In Uttar Pradesh, a total of 1,93,22,658 samples have been tested since March, resulting in 5,43,888 positive cases till November 30. “Despite a low positivity rate, the focussed testing has helped us to isolate infected people on time. This has also helped in checking the spread of infection. However, we are still taking all precautions and will keep a check on such groups in the coming days. People are also advised to take all precautions while coming in contact with such high-risk groups,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, who, on Monday, also extended the prohibitory orders in Ghaziabad till the midnight of January 20, 2021.“We have also received fresh guidelines on Monday in which there is special focus on containment and surveillance activities. All the directions received in this regard will be strictly followed, considering the ongoing winter season. We have to deal with more cases coming in with symptoms of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness during this time,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. UP government issues fresh containment guidelinesIn fresh guidelines issued on Monday, the state government has also authorised the district administration to impose local restrictions, such as night curfew, based on local assessment in order to contain spread of Covid-19 infection. UP chief secretary, RK Tiwari, issued the guidelines and asked officials to strictly enforce containment plan, surveillance and Covid-appropriate behaviour, including social distancing and mask discipline. The guidelines stated that only essential services will be allowed in containment zones and strict perimeter control will be required to enforce containment. This will be followed by intensive house-to-house surveillance and testing as per protocols. The recently issued directions have also defined that areas having one positive case will be subject to containment for a radius of 50 metres while that in form of cluster will be for 100 metre radius. It is directed that such zones will be subjected to effective surveillance and testing, apart from contact tracing. The chief secretary has also directed that about 80% of the contacts of positive patients should ideally be traced within 72 hours of a person testing positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/over-12-000-superspreaders-found-covid-positive-during-focussed-testing-before-diwali-data/story-qnQ2MXOtBcFAGgysOb6D2J.html

30-11-2020||Chandigarh||Museum of Trees opens on Guru Nanak’s Prakash Utsav||A work in progress for the last 10 years, the Museum of Trees was finally inaugurated in Chandigarh on Monday by Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore. With a unique collection of 12 genetic copies of trees sacred to the Sikh religion planted here, its opening was timed with the 551st Prakash Utsav of Guru Nanak Dev. Built over five acres on the Hallomajra-Panchkula route, the park’s development work began in 2010 by the Chandigarh Nature and Health Society (CNHS), an NGO that received a Rs 69 lakh grant for this purpose from the ministry of culture in 2009. The park, however, will not open to public as yet as some staff members have tested positive for Covid-19.The park is the brainchild of retired IAS officer DS Jaspal, chairman of the CNHS and author of Tryst With Trees – Punjab’s Sacred Heritage.“During one of my postings I first got to know how some gurdwaras are named after trees. Gurudwara Amb Sahib in Mohali is a case in point,” he says.The book features 59 Sikh shrines in India and Pakistan named after 19 species of trees. Unfortunately, however, some of the trees are now very old or not being cared for properly.That is why these have been genetically preserved at the museum. The way it’s done is that first cuttings of the sacred trees are obtained. After taking root these are then transferred to a mist chamber and from there moved to a net house and planted, says Jaspal.The process can take four to five months for a healthy tree and a couple of years d amount of time for old or dying trees.Those taking a round of the museum will see a living sacred trees section with 12 cuttings brought from gurdwaras in Punjab, including the Dukh Bhanjani Ber tree of the Golden Temple and the ber tree of Babe di Ber from Sialkot, Pakistan. The dead sacred tree section has details of the ones that have ceased to exist.The museum also plans to add a cutting from the ber tree planted by Bhagat Singh at his village in Bangey, Pakistan, in defiance of British rule. Jaspal is also attempting to get cuttings from Nagasaki, Japan, and Chernobyl, Ukraine, which have survived nuclear calamities.AAP protests Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has criticised the administration for promoting the museum as a “commercial venture.” AAP member Chandrawati Shukla has said that the building in which the museum is housed will be used for weddings and corporate events according to the administration’s website, a practise which should not be encouraged.When asked to comment, Amanbir Singh, CNHS joint secretary says, “The website was made sometime back and hasn’t been updated. We have never hosted or intend to use this place to host any weddings or engage in any commercial activity which goes against the policy of the UT administration.”Due to Covid-19 safety concerns entry of visitors to the museum is likely to be restricted, adds Jaspal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/museum-of-trees-opens-on-guru-nanak-s-prakash-utsav/story-4w0BGLs0VwOq9VyIMFkWPM.html
30-11-2020||Gurugram||Schools to remain shut till December 10, government to provide tablets for e-learning||The state directorate of school education on Monday issued a directive extending the closure of both private and government schools in the state for students and teachers till December 10. To ensure that students of government schools do not lose out, the state government is mulling distribution of tablets to students of classes 8-12.Haryana home minister Anil Vij on Saturday had said that schools in the state will remain shut for 10 more days in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Previously, the state education department had ordered the closure of all government and private schools in Haryana till November 30 as Covid-19 cases among school students started to spike, after physical classroom sessions for classes 9 to 12 had resumed on November 2. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday had said that the state government had plans to provide free tablets to students of classes 8-12 studying in government schools for digital education in view of Covid-19. Students belonging to various social groups, including minorities and backward groups, would be covered as part of the scheme, Khattar had shared. Under the scheme, tablets with preloaded content such as digital books, test banks, videos and other reference materials for various classes, as per the syllabus of government schools, will be shared with students. The tablets will have to be returned once the student completes class 12. While digital divide has been a challenge across various sectors across the state, its impact was exacerbated in Nuh, which happens to be among the most backward district in the country, as per the NITI Aayog. During the lockdown, the Nuh district education department has started neighbourhood schools in various villages where local teachers are being asked to teach small groups of children, while complying with physical distancing norms in view of the twin challenges of poverty and internet connectivity in the region. Anup Singh Jakhar, district education officer (DEO) Nuh, said that education blocks across the state that were considered backward would benefit from the scheme. “There are certain blocks that are considered backward on the educations front. Nuh is among them. This scheme would benefit students since the lack of smartphones and internet access is a huge setback for online learning here,” said Jakhar. He said while detailed instructions regarding the distribution of tablets had not been shared so far, the district could implement the scheme on the lines of a book bank scheme that was started last year, wherein books were shared with students on a temporary basis. “Last year, we had purchased books for students in classes 9 to 12 and created a book bank. Students used the books throughout the year and returned them at the end of the academic year. We can adopt the same approach for tablets. Students can return the tablets after graduating,” said Jakhar. He said that the step would aid the learning process in the region since physical classes had been suspended once again in view of rising Covid-19 cases. Lack of smartphones and the internet was a major factor behind the disruption of lessons, Jakhar said. “Students are grappling with various issues ranging from the lack of smartphones to internet access. Many children have moved out along with families and connecting with them has been difficult,” said Jakhar. Educationist Gowri Ishwaran said that while the move was a good starting point, implementation on the ground would be a key factor in determining the success of the initiative. “While the lack of internet access can be a limiting factor, having preloaded content is better than having nothing. Right now, private schools are having seamless online classes whereas children in the rural areas are being left behind. The initiative is a step in the right direction and it can be perfected over time to plug gaps,” said Ishwaran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/schools-to-remain-shut-till-december-10-government-to-provide-tablets-for-e-learning/story-LEwzzhZtqhd1xgi1ZvRZ8K.html
30-11-2020||Gurugram||500 cops to enforce mask discipline in residential areas||Police have deployed 550 personnel in residential areas where maximum violations of mask rule in public places are being reported, officials said on Monday.Around 2,000 people across the city have been fined for not wearing masks. A majority of the fines were reported residential areas in Sector 57, Sushant Lok, South City-1, Palam Vihar, Bus Stand, Sadar Market, Sector 5 and Sector 10, said police.Police commissioner KK Rao has directed officials to penalise those found not adhering to Covid-19 protocols in public places. He has asked the personnel to visit all parks and sector market areas to ensure that everyone is following the protocol. “We have been receiving complaints from residents that people are not taking proper precautions and are not wearing face masks. There have been multiple tiffs reported at several parks over this issue,” he said.Police said they have penalised 120,000 people for not wearing masks till Monday.Usha Kundu, the assistant commissioner of police, headquarters (HQ), said, “There have been more than 20 tiffs in different residential areas where people feel offended when asked to wear masks. Many have fought with residents’ welfare association members (RWA) and abused them for asking them to put on masks.”Police have asked RWA members to place masks in parks, markets and community centres for people who are not wearing one. Rao said they have distributed more than 1 million face masks so far and are now giving nearly 200,000 masks to RWAs. These masks have been stitched and are washable.Police have also requested RWAs to announce recorded messages on mask discipline through loudspeakers in the residential areas to spread awareness.There are also 40 teams of city police, comprising 1,600 police personnel, who have been directed to visit banquet halls, restaurants and hotels, where small-scale gatherings are being organised. Area wise, station house officers have been directed to keep an eye on functions and social gatherings. Those found at events without masks are being penalised on the spot, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/500-cops-to-enforce-mask-discipline-in-residential-areas/story-4ClXjf9jOfnvbstjXrcbEJ.html
30-11-2020||Gurugram||Active cases up in Haryana over last month, Gurugram among worst hit||The consistent upward trajectory of Covid-19 cases has put Haryana among five states that are reporting rise in the active caseload, according to the union ministry of health and family welfare. The active transmission was the highest in the National Capital Region (NCR) districts – Gurugram, Faridabad, Rohtak, Rewari, Sonepat and Hisar – in the last one month. Data shows there has been a nearly 45% increase in active cases from October 29 till November 29. Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan are the other worst-affected states.In case of Haryana, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus showed a spike in 22 districts but the ones bordering the National Capital wore worst affected.Data shows that on October 29, the number of active cases in the state was 11,014, which had increased to 19,916 by November 29. This is despite a recovery rate of almost 90%. During the same time, figures collated through the Gurugram health bulletin show that the district contributed 30% to the state’s case load, with 3,303 active cases on October 29. It increased by one percentage point (to31%) on November 29, with active cases doubling to 6,160 cases. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department said, “In the last few days, the state has started showing a decline in the active cases.”At the district level, health officials said reporting of new infections has now reached a plateau. “The number of new coronavirus cases might be high but in one week, we have seen a plateau as cases are fluctuating between 600-800. It can be seen through the declining weekly test positivity rate,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. To lower down the numbers further, the state health department on November 28 conducted a mass testing exercise by administering more than a lakh Covid-19 tests in a day. 25,000 tests were done in Gurugram. Considering the sample size, test results of the last two days show that only 973 new infections have been reported. Until Sunday, test results of 13,087 samples were awaited, including 5,091 collected on Sunday. Going by the district health bulletin, 494 new cases were confirmed on Monday based on the pending samples. At least 5,565 samples were collected on Monday and the test results are awaited for 6,861 samples. With infections currently showing a weekly positivity rate of seven percent, the Covid-19 tally is likely to cross 50,000 this week. On Monday, the count stood at 49, 592. Out of these, 6,265 are active cases. With four new deaths, the toll has also reached 292, of which 224 deaths are due to co-morbidity and 68 without co-morbidity. At least 441 patients are hospitalised and 5,809 are home isolated. Only 15 positive cases are in district Covid care centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/active-cases-up-in-haryana-over-last-month-gurugram-among-worst-hit/story-oaBF9WLppuFM8e5PJjrjVO.html
30-11-2020||Gurugram||State, districts prepare for post-vaccine vigilance||Following recent orders from the ministry of health and family welfare, the state health department has started taking steps to monitor “adverse events”, which may be experienced by recipients of the expected Covid-19 vaccine. As per the Centre’s instruction, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, has been appointed as the nodal authority for adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) surveillance in Haryana. Officials also confirmed that AEFI committees at the state and district level will be revamped to include appropriate experts, including physicians and pharmacologists. The World Health Organisation defines an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) as “any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine.” These may range from minor adverse events (AEs), such as fever, dizziness and muscle pain, which are recorded side effects of vaccines already in use, to moderate or severe AEs that may require hospitalisation, such as seizures or death. The latter, officials and experts pointed out, are extremely rare — and even more rarely associated with vaccine use, given the stringent safety guidelines that govern vaccine trials. “Nevertheless, AEs are to be expected with any medicine or vaccine. Even if a patient experiences redness or swelling where the injection is administered, it is counted as an AE. The task of an AEFI committee, which already exists in Haryana at both state and district level, is to track these occurrences and determine their causal relationship with the vaccine. Usually, minor events are assessed at a district level while moderate and severe events are assessed at a state level every three months, as part of the Universal Immunisation Programme for children and pregnant mothers. However, for Covid-19, district-level committees will be trained to assess moderate and severe AEs locally as well,” said Dr Virender Ahlawat, the National Health Mission’s deputy director for immunisation in Haryana. Given that a large volume of people is likely to receive a Covid-19 vaccine, the number of ensuing AEs is also likely to be higher than in existing immunisation programmes, which are targeted to a much smaller portion of the population. The state AEFI committee typically conducts causality assessments for moderate and severe AEs every three months. However, Ahlawat added that a Covid-19 immunisation campaign would require such cases to be assessed more frequently. “We do not really have a sense yet of what events may be reported after a Covid vaccine is introduced. We have to be more vigilant than usual and will conduct causality assessments monthly. At a district level, task forces have already been created and told to set up AEFI management centres, where vaccine recipients will be able to report any untoward symptoms,” Ahlawat said. Officials also said that AEFI committees in Haryana will be revamped in coming weeks to include appropriate experts. “At the moment, since the UIP is targeted mainly toward children, pharmacovigilance committees feature experts in maternal and child health. Physicians and public health experts who have a broader experience in pharmacovigilance will have to be appointed to these committees. PGIMS, Rohtak, will soon nominate an expert member to the state AEFI committee, following which we will begin training officials in districts,” Ahlawat said. At PGIMS Rohtak, investigators are already carrying out AEFI surveillance among at least 370 people who have received doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, currently in Phase III of vaccine trials. “There are three aspects to such vigilance. The first is we keep the patient under observation after administering the shot. The second is that we monitor them remotely through follow ups. Now, in Phase III, we have also asked the patients to maintain a daily diary in which they log their physical conditions. This is then shared with the data safety management board for scrutiny,” said Dr Dhruv Chaudhry, state nodal officer for Covid-19 management and co-principal investigator on the Covaxin trials at PGIMS Rohtak. He said that so far, among trial participants at PGIMS, no moderate or severe AEs have yet been reported. AEFI surveillance data from the trial will be shared with the pharmacovigilance cell at PGIMS Rohtak, which will appoint an appropriate expert to the state AEFI committee. “Our learnings will be shared with the state health department and we will advise them on creating an AEFI protocol for Covid-19. The finer details will ultimately rest on which vaccine is administered to the public at large,” said Chaudhury.A senior official in the state health, member of Haryana’s AEFI committee, said on the condition of anonymity, “Adverse event surveillance will be a huge challenge. In Haryana, for example, the state AEFI committee is usually running on a backlog of a few months at the least. A lot more manpower will be required to sift through the data when a vaccine for Covid-19 is finally rolled out. It is a positive step that these measures are being taken months before the campaign begins, so that AEFI surveillance can be strengthened to a good degree by then.”Addressing the issue of vaccine distribution, officials said that they will be able to fine-tune protocols for AEFI surveillance on the basis of high-risk groups who will receive the vaccine first, including frontline workers and elderly individuals with comorbidities. As reported on November 28, the district health department has identified at least 24,971 frontline healthcare workers in the district for priority vaccination against Covid-19. With vaccine delivery expected to commence early next year, officials said they are preparing for a scenario in which demand is going to outstrip supply. “It is still too early to say when a vaccine will be readily available for all,” said Dr Naresh Garg, district immunisation officer, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/state-districts-prepare-for-post-vaccine-vigilance/story-RZJZ2rY5XdsO2EkWnEGQQJ.html
30-11-2020||City||Man robbed of his car at gunpoint in Sector 86||Five unidentified armed men allegedly robbed a 35-year-old businessman of his car at gunpoint in Sector 86 after driving him around for over an hour on Sunday night. The police said the suspects intercepted his car and attempted to fire a gunshot in the air to intimidate the victim when he tried to flee with his car, said the police. According to the police, the alleged incident took place around 9.30 pm when the victim, a resident of DLF New Town Heights in Sector 86, was returning home after buying vegetables from a nearby market. The police said he had reached near Kakrola village, when a speeding Maruti Esteem car, in which the five suspects were seated, blocked his path, forcing him to stop his vehicle. Vishal Kumar, station house officer(SHO) of Kherki Daula police station, said that four of the suspects alighted from their car and walked up to the victim’s car— a Maruti Celerio. One of the suspects pointed a gun at the victim and asked him to hand over the keys. “When he objected, two of them pulled him to the rear seat and assaulted him. One of the suspects then got behind the wheel of his car and drove towards Bilaspur. The other suspects in the Esteem followed the victim’s car,” he said. “Four of the suspects took him towards Bilaspur and called his wife informing that her husband had met with an accident and asked her to arrange ₹1 lakh for treatment,” said Kumar. The suspects took rounds of the area for more than an hour and snatched ₹5,000 along with his mobile phone. They then left him in Bilaspur and fled away with his car,” said the police. The police said they are checking the footage from CCTV cameras in the area to identify the suspects. Kumar said the victim has an online business of toys and lives in a rented accommodation in Sector 86. A case was registered under sections 392 (robbery), 379 B (punishment for snatching) and 365 (kidnapping) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) and section 25/54/59 of The Arms Act at Kherki Daula police station on Monday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-robbed-of-his-car-at-gunpoint-in-sector-86/story-Gv4tyj448lnQsUQhJNmKGI.html
30-11-2020||Gurugram||Man beaten to death for demanding salary||A 30-year-old man working at a hotel in Sector 14 was brutally assaulted by his colleagues and employer, when he demanded his salary four days ago, the police said. The victim was taken to a government hospital in Sector 10A, where he succumbed to his injuries on Sunday. No arrest had been made till Monday evening. The police said the deceased was identified as one Hoshiyar Singh, who had come to Gurugram from Bulandsehar in Uttar Pradesh in search of a job. Two months ago he got the job of a cook and cleaner in a hotel in Sector 14 that also provided him with food and lodging. Surinder Singh, station house officer(SHO) of Sector 14, said that Singh did not receive any salary for the past two months. He had requested the hotel owner to pay him as he wanted to send money home. “On November 26 night, after work he once again went to the employer and requested him to pay his salary. This allegedly agitated his employer, who called other employees and asked them to beat him up,” he said. Singh sustained severe injuries all over his body and on head. He was taken to Civil Hospital in Sector 10A and was later referred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. Umesh Singh, elder brother of the deceased, said that his brother lived in a rented room in Rajiv Nagar and his neighbour, who also works for the same hotel, informed him on November 27 that his brother’s condition was critical and that he had been brutally assaulted by the hotel staff and employer. “My brother was harassed and tortured for the past two months. His only fault was that he asked for his salary. We are six brothers and, during Covid-19, we all lost our job and were facing financial issues at home. We hardly have money to make ends meet,” he said. The family reached the hospital on Saturday and found Singh in an unconscious state. The police said the statement of victim could not be recorded as he did not regain consciousness and died while undergoing treatment on Sunday night. A case under sections 302 (murder), 323 (assault), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) was registered against the hotel owner and four staff members at Sector 14 police station. The body was handed over to the family members on Monday after post-mortem examination, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-beaten-to-death-for-demanding-salary/story-gy58GC5YUECEn1csCkLIyI.html
30-11-2020||Gurugram||Fire department decides to deploy fire tenders across nine key spots in city||To reduce response time, ensure swifter dousing of fire and make rescue operations effective, the Gurugram fire department is planning to deploy fire tenders across nine key points in the city, said officials on Monday.Presently, fire tenders are situated in the city’s four fire brigades in sectors 29, 37, Bhim Nagar and Udyog Vihar.Fire department officials said that the four locations do not provide proper coverage of the city, resulting in fire tenders often taking more than 25 minutes to reach far-off locations, such as Golf Course Extension Road, Badshahpur-Sohna stretch, and Dwarka Expressway.Fire department officials have identified Vatika Chowk, Palam Vihar, Rajiv Chowk, Mahavir Chowk, Kherki Daula toll plaza, Hero Honda Chowk, Ghata T-point, Basai Chowk, and Dwarka Expressway as the key spots for placing fire tenders. As per officials, the placement of fire tender at Vatika Chowk is likely to becoming the first such measure.“A private mall in Badshahpur, near Vatika Chowk, has approached us to use their space for positioning a fire tender so that response time in reaching areas along Golf Course Extension Road and Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) is reduced significantly. No formal approval is needed in this matter and we are looking to station a fire tender at the spot by January next year,” said IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer (ADFSO).The lack of quick response has proved to be fatal in the past. In October 2018, it took firemen more than 15 minutes to reach a condominium in Sector 69, located around five kilometres from Vatika Chowk, which resulted in the death of a 33-year-old woman.Kashyap said that at least two firemen and a driver are needed to be stationed near each fire tender in eight-hour shifts.“For the Vatika Chowk initiative, we will allot nine staff members on a rotational basis. However, since we are heavily understaffed, we cannot stretch our resources more than this. A proposal has been sent to the Haryana fire directorate in Panchkula for hiring around 40 new staff members and is awaiting approval. Upon their induction, we will place the newly inducted firemen and existing staff members along with the fire tenders at the remaining key areas,” said Kashyap.As per fire department officials, Gurugram has a requirement of at least 400 personnel to oversee fire rescue operations. The Gurugram fire department currently has exactly half this manpower.Recently, on Diwali, the fire department had adopted a similar strategy of placing fire tenders across various points in the city, which proved to be beneficial.On November 14, a fire tender located at Vatika Chowk reached the site of fire in Sector 50 within three minutes instead of the usual 20-25 minutes.Satyawan Samriwal, assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO), who was transferred to the Sonipat fire department on Friday, had earlier prepared this strategic plan. As per Samriwal, in urban areas such as Gurugram, the response time should not exceed 15 minutes and be ideally be under 10 minutes.“The city has expanded extensively over the past 10 years, especially in the newer sectors (58-115) and areas located along SPR and the Dwarka Expressway. The existing fire brigades are far removed from these areas and the response time is nearly double than the ideal time limit. Hence, a plan had been compiled to place fire tenders at strategic locations to address this problem,” said Samriwal, adding that the fire department had discussed the option of stationing fire tenders at community centres with the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and a few private developers as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fire-department-decides-to-deploy-fire-tenders-across-nine-key-spots-in-city/story-caQ5mpUFVsl8qNWDg3anGM.html
30-11-2020||City||Fatal mishap on Sherpur Chowk prompts NHAI to get cracking on foot overbridge||Nearly two weeks after three persons, including a pedestrian, were killed in an accident near the busy Sherpur Chowk, the National Highway Authority of India has expedited completion of the nearby foot overbridge, which has been hanging in balance for months.The iron structure of the overpass was ready, but gathering dust next to the road for long. Following the fatal mishap, it was recently erected and is expected to be made accessible to pedestrians by December end, to help them safely cross the National Highway-44.“A report on the number of accidents that took place near the Sherpur Chowk in the last three years was tabled before the NHAI officials, following which directions were issued to build a foot overbridge there,” said Navdeep Asija, traffic adviser to the state government, who also carried out a survey on black spots on NH-44, which connects Jalandhar to Panipat.Member of Punjab Road Safety Council, Rahul Verma, said the absence of a foot overbridge posed grave danger to pedestrians wishing to reach either side of the highway near Sherpur Chowk.“Work on the pedestrian overpass was lying unfinished, and after much pressure and persuasion, its completion has started now. Still, it does not feature a ramp for the convenience of the elderly and cyclists. However, we have been told that it will be added to the design,” Verma added.Assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Gurdev Singh had recently also highlighted 91 black spots on NH-44 that require immediate attention. “Among these, 12 black spots are the deadliest, including the one at Sherpur Chowk, where hundreds of pedestrians risk their lives each day to reach either side of the highway. Besides, we had also demanded foot overbridge with ramp on Tibba Road, Jail Road and near Green Land Public School. NHAI has been advised to take certain road safety initiatives for the rectification of black spots,” the ACP said.Apart from these stretches, pedestrian overpasses are also required at various spots in Basti Jodhewal, Khanna and Mandi Gobindgarh that also have the busy highway passing through.For Satish Chauhan, a resident of the Salem Tabri area, risking life is a routine. “We have no option. There is no subway or pedestrian overpass nearby. So, each day we scale the fencing to reach the other side of the highway,” he said.Without giving much details, NHAI project director for NH-44 Virendra Kumar said foot overbridges were coming up at many locations as part of the highway project that started in September 2009.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fatal-mishap-on-sherpur-chowk-prompts-nhai-to-get-cracking-on-foot-overbridge/story-QCitQdUyICqqHSexR0CpMK.html
30-11-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 cases, deaths in November down 50% from October in Maharashtra||Maharashtra on Monday added 3,837 fresh Covid-19 infections to push its tally to 1,823,896 and 80 fatalities to take the state’s toll to 47,151. In November, the state saw a significant drop in the number of cases and deaths in comparison to October (around 50% drop) and September. State health department officials said the positivity rate in November was lower than in April when the first wave was picking up. Active cases, however, are on the rise again in the state, keeping authorities alert.In October, Maharashtra had recorded 293,960 Covid-19 cases, which dropped by 50.5% in November to 145,490. Fatalities reported in October were 7,249, which dropped by 49.09% to 3,690 in NovemberThe drop in cases and fatalities is even sharper when compared to September. In September alone, Maharashtra recorded a whopping 591,905 cases and 12,079 fatalities, which means there was a 75.42% drop in cases and 69.45% fall in deaths in November. “Besides that, the positivity rate in this month [November] was 7.7%, which is lower than April’s positivity rate, which was 8%,” said Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.Of the fatalities reported on Monday, 35 occurred within the past 48 hours, while eight deaths occurred in the past week. The remaining 37 deaths were before a week, the health department said. The case fatality rate (CFR) stood at 2.59%. Mumbai, meanwhile reported 646 fresh Covid-19 cases and 19 deaths to push the tally and toll to 283,467 and 10,884, respectively. The active caseload in the city stood at 15,473. Mumbai’s CFR is 3.84%.The state’s active cases had dipped to 78,272 on November 20 and since then, they have increased. Between November 20 and 30, the active caseload in the state rose by 15.69% to 90,557. The state health department had alerted the district administration earlier this month, warning it of a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections after the festive period. However, so far, there has been no significant increase in the number of Covid-19 cases. The district and municipal authorities, however, remain on guard. “So far, there is no significant increase in cases. Whatever increase is seen it is due to ramped-up testing. Besides that, all districts are testing potential ‘superspreaders’ to get an early sign for a potential second wave,” Awate added.The district and civic authorities are identifying “superspreaders” in the population, or people who have maximum social contact in the community, and are testing such people on priority. These include bus conductors, street vendors, milkman, among others, who are likely to come in contact with 10-15 people daily due to the nature of their work. “Not just in Mumbai and urban centres, all districts are testing a category of people who have a higher contact with people on a daily basis,” he said. Monday’s lower case count was attributed to lower testing on Sunday, which reflected on Monday’s data, Awate said. In the last 24 hours, 51,962 samples were tested, according to the figures of the health department.Pune district reported 522 fresh cases and four fatalities, where Pune city reported 179 cases and one death, while Pune rural parts saw 184 cases and two deaths. Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 159 cases and one death. Nagpur district reported 224 new cases, of which 178 were from Nagpur city. The district reported seven deaths. Nashik district reported 324 fresh cases, with Nashik city clocking 170 cases and three deaths, while Nashik rural reported 152 cases and four deaths. Malegaon reported two cases and one death. Solapur rural saw 156 new cases and five deaths. So far, Maharashtra has tested 10,856,384 samples and has a positivity rate of 16.8%. Monday also saw recoveries of 4,196 patients, taking the total tally of recovered patients to 1,685,122. The recovery rate in the state stood at 92.39%. Currently, 535,530 people are in home quarantine and 6,354 people are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-cases-deaths-in-november-down-50-from-october-in-maharashtra/story-B9JczojyheJu9Xy5OIpk3J.html

30-11-2020||Mumbai||Social activist Dr Sheetal Amte-Karajgi, granddaughter of Baba Amte, dies by suicide in Chandrapur||Social activist Dr Sheetal Amte-Karajgi, 42, granddaughter of legendary social activist Baba Amte, died allegedly by suicide at her Anandwan residence in Chandrapur district, around 125km from Nagpur, on Monday. A medical doctor specialised in disabilities, Amte-Karajgi was the chief executive officer and board member of one of India’s leading non-profit groups, Maharogi Sewa Samiti, Warora. The samiti, founded by Baba Amte, has created livelihood opportunities for several marginalised people, especially for those afflicted with leprosy, orthopedically handicapped, vision and hearing-impaired individuals and tribal populace since 1949. “We are in deep shock. There was a disagreement among trustees of Anandwan ashram. But we had come up with a solution, which was also agreed upon by Sheetal. Her taking the extreme step is unfortunate,” said Magsaysay award winner and Amte-Karajgi’s uncle, Dr Prakash Amte. Amte-Karajgi had recently raised some questions about the functioning of Anandwan ashram and levelled allegations about the certain “irregularities” in Maharogi Sewa Samiti, controlled mostly by her family members, particularly her father, Dr Vikas Amte, and Dr Prakash Amte. She had uploaded a video on social media last week talking about the “irregularities”, but removed it within two hours. A few days ago, the samiti’s trustees removed her from the board. According to people in the know, ashram members were opposed to Amte-Karajgi’s and her husband’s, Gautam Karajgi, an engineer and management expert, ideas of “bringing in a corporate culture” into Anandwan ashram. Last week, trustees of Maharogi Sewa Samiti — Dr Vikas Amte, Dr Prakash Amte (both sons of Baba Amte, a recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award and Padma Vibhushan, who died in 2008) and their wives, Dr Bharati Amte and Dr Mandakini Amte — issued a clarification, saying all allegations levelled by Amte-Karajgi were baseless and misleading. “We are committed to working in strict adherence to the innate values and ethics laid down with which the institution was formed. We abide by legal and moral values through transparency, while carrying forward the works of the ashram,” they said, appealing to people not to believe in “misleading propaganda”. They also claimed that Amte-Karajgi was “mentally stressed and frustrated”. According to sources, on Monday, the doctor was rushed to a civil hospital at Warora, where she was declared dead on arrival. “We have sealed the house and sent the body to Chandrapur Civil Hospital for post-mortem,” said Nilesh Pande, sub-divisional police officer, Warora. Amte-Karajgi was fairly active on social media and had tweeted till around eight hours before her death. In her last tweet, Amte-Karajgi had posted an abstract painting on canvas, titled, “War and Peace”. Amte-Karajgi was also the founder of “Mashaal” and “Chirag”, the exclusive leadership training programme for motivating medical professionals across India. She recently set up a centre called “Nijbal”, which worked towards prevention of disabilities; primary, secondary and tertiary education; vocational training; employment support; various types of counselling; sports, medical and physical rehabilitation services. She was also engaged in an ambitious project of making Anandwan a one-of-its-kind “smart village” in the country, by making it technologically efficient, economically productive and environmentally sensitive. In January 2016, she was selected by the World Economic Forum as “Young Global Leader 2016” and later, was selected as a member of the World Economic Forum Expert Network on Humanitarian Response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/social-activist-dr-sheetal-amte-karajgi-granddaughter-of-baba-amte-dies-by-suicide-in-chandrapur/story-t1AL5aiJqmEBJ3v7gXN1tJ.html

30-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s winter session likely to be curtailed to two days||After the Parliament cancelled its winter session, the Maharashtra legislature, too, is expected to either cancel its winter session or hold it for just two days, down from the traditional duration of two weeks. The state government is also considering holding the budget session in Nagpur and Mumbai, in two parts, so as to fulfil a condition in the Nagpur pact that at least one session of the state legislature should be held in the second capital of the state every year. The pact was announced when Vidarbha region was included in Maharashtra at the time of formation of the state.The final decision over the session is expected to be taken in a meeting of the business advisory committee (BAC) of the state legislature on Thursday or Friday.The state government during the BAC meeting earlier this month decided to not hold the winter session in Nagpur as organised every year, owing to the expected spike in Covid-19 cases in the state. The government had also decided to take a call over dates and the duration of the session by reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state. “The government will have to hold it for at least two days to get the supplementary budget passed for additional burden of health expenditure. In such a scenario, cancelling it altogether would not be possible. The RT-PCR tests [gold standard of Covid-19 detection] for those attending the session will be made mandatory if it is being held even for two days. As such, we will need a couple of days for preparation and it would not be possible to hold it from December 7 as was scheduled earlier,” said an official from Mantralaya.On splitting the budget session into two parts, another official said, “As per the Nagpur Pact of 1953, one legislative session has to be held in the second capital of the state. Although it could be made an exception, holding one of the sessions in Nagpur becomes politically important, especially for parties like Congress, which has a strong voter base in Vidarbha. But holding it for a full duration of five to six weeks in Nagpur would not be possible. By presenting the budget in Nagpur legislature, the remaining business could be shifted to Mumbai by taking a break of a week. The budget session is expected to begin in the second half of February.”“We have made preparations. The date and the duration will be decided during the BAC meeting,” said Rajendra Bhagwat, secretary, state legislature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-winter-session-likely-to-be-curtailed-to-two-days/story-nAfH5cK8nZ8MUKeUZTJhYP.html

He said the central government should hold an interaction with the farmers without any conditions instead of ignoring them as their ongoing movement can cause huge constriction on food grain supply in the country.He criticised the Modi government and said, “BJP’s attitude towards farmers’ protest against the new agricultural laws is not justified. Under these new laws, the government has upset the market system and benefited the capitalists by putting welfare of farmers at stake.”He said that on one side, people are suffering due to Covid-19 pandemic and on the other hand, farmers are suffering due to policies of the central government.“The Centre has pushed the country into a major crisis by imposing anti-farmer laws,” he added.Meanwhile, he expressed concerns over the rising covid cases in Himachal, “Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur keeps patting his own back and making big statements at the time of nationwide lockdown as Himachal did not have a single case of coronavirus.”“When Congress kept asking him to keep strict vigil on the state borders and conduct Covid-19 tests efficiently, he was talking of making Himachal a quarantine destination. And now, because of his ignorance, Himachal has emerged as one of the worst hit state in country,” he said.HPCC also distributed Covid-care equipment at Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Government Hospital, Ner Chowk, Mandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-ignore-the-voices-of-farmers-himachal-congress-chief-rathore-to-centre/story-0C2zXcr03OYwrsjleu9zIN.html

In last week of October, the government had brought some changes in the Jammu and Kashmir Civil Service Regulations. It had decided that the government can, if that was in the public interest, to retire any public servant after he has completed 22 years of qualifying service or attained 48 years of age. The exception to this rule is the employee working on a post which is included in Schedule II of these rules.The authorities will have to give notice to the government servant at least three months before the date on which he is required to retire or three months of pay and allowance in lieu of such notice.The government had said that the broad criteria to be followed by the review committee, while making the recommendations for such retirement, are doubtful integrity of the government servant or if he/she is found to be ineffective in his/her work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-school-board-employee-first-to-get-premature-retirement-notice-under-new-rules/story-EqMGhHpkDGqzAy1oshKPiK.html
30-11-2020||Chandigarh||Meet 25-year-old Syed Areej Safvi, first Ladishah girl from Kashmir||For hundreds of years, Kashmir’s Ladishah, a form of folk genre, was dominated by men till modernity and militancy in the valley triggered its decline. Now a woman has emerged on the scene and caught the imagination of youth.Syed Areej Safvi, 25, has apparently become the first woman in Kashmir to write and perform Ladishah – a form of satire in verse, making commentaries on social and political conditions in the society. It is a type of folk ballad with humour forming an essential part of its presentation.Areej was introduced to this cultural form when she saw Ladishah being broadcast every Sunday on an Urdu TV news channel. It was penned by Kashmiri journalist Rajesh Raina and performed by Rajendra Tikoo. Apart from her love for Kashmir culture and language, the immediate trigger to write and perform Ladishah herself was brought after the constitutional changes which nullified the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year.“I always wanted to do something for Kashmir and its culture and language. I love listening to Ladishah personally. Mostly I would follow Rajendra Tikoo ji performing Ladishah every Sunday. And I wrote my first Ladishah in December 2019 on PSA (Public Safety Act) being used against Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti,” Areej said.“Ladishah has social messaging. It is an alternative opinion about issues in the society and I am very passionate about this and want to do more on public speaking and social activism,” she said.Ladishah is traditionally performed on stage, in street plays wearing traditional dress like a turban and playing an instrument with hands – a small thin iron rod with iron rings which would make a ringing sound. The person would sing critical commentaries using a comical tone and tenor to bring home the point while taking on the establishment or the people. Areej has adopted the content along with the tone and tenor but does not use the instrument so far. While the traditional Ladishah used the platforms of open stage, theatre and then TV and radio, Areej uploaded her videos on her YouTube channel, occasionally wearing a traditional Karakuli cap over her headgear. The videos are becoming popular among the youth.“After I uploaded the videos, I realised that I am the first female to do this. Iwas expecting a huge backlash but on the contrary I got huge support. There have been hate messages, people who try to pull me down but usually I ignore them,” she said.Areej, a resident of Old City’s Alamgari Bazar, graduated in humanities and is pursuing post graduation in psychology. From the very beginning she says that she has been interested in writing, particularly Urdu language and poetry. She has been commenting on issues and writing Gazals before dwelling into the genre of Ladishah.Her themes are not only social but even political, criticising not only society but even the establishment. She has performed Ladishah on arrest of journalists, 4G internet ban, VPN, women’s issues, extravagance in marriages, among others. The only child of her parents, she said that her father and mother have been supportive but there are people in the extended joint family who are not comfortable with her choice.“It needs huge courage and patience to do anything in our society. I love this so nothing can stop me. There are people who are not okay with what I am doing but I am trying to convince them about my choice,” she said.She said that she was getting messages from youngsters particularly women. “There are people who now say that if she can do this we can also pursue our choices. There have been women who texted me and said: ‘Thank you very much, now our parents also think that we can do whatever we like’,” she said.ZareefAhmad Zareef, a 77-year-old satirical poet of Kashmir who retired as cultural officer of J&K government, said that he had only witnessed men performing Ladishah.“I had not seen any woman in Ladishah till now. It is a forward movement. Ladishah has been a traditional character of Kashmir culture and if Areej really wants to turn her interest into an art, if a new chapter of this art form has to begin, she has to wholeheartedly adopt this, including its instrument,” he said.Those associated with writing Ladishah say that it had gone into oblivion due to the situation in Kashmir valley. Zareef, who has been writing Ladishah for Doordarshan and theatre before the militancy erupted in the valley in 1989, said that the art form has been in decline.“Before militancy, we used to have drama as well as Ladishah regularly at Tagore Halland also at drama clubs in old city,” he said.He said that Ladishah has been part of Band Pather – folk theatre of Kashmir performed in open spaces even during the time when Kashmir was ruled by Maharajas. “Band Pather with its live performance and special costumes used to be a form of entertainment for the kings and commons from old times. And when there was a need for a break during the performance, a Ladishah would come out to present its solo performance,” he said.He said that Ladishahs were critical but full of humour. “If people wanted to convey their problems to the king, Ladishah would present it humorously so that it makes him aware of the issue but does not annoy him at the same time,” he said.He said that Ladishahs would go from village to village and visit the city to perform.“In villages, he would be given rice while in cities he would get some bucks for his performance,” he said.Some cultural experts say that Ladishah was hundreds of years old and was impromptu.Dr Rafiq Masoodi, former secretary cultural academy and former additional director general Doordarshan, said that Ladishah is the purest form of Kashmiri folklore.“As per experts like MY Taing, Ladishah is over 1500 years old. It is all unscripted like Wanwun (Kashmiri women singing rhythmically on special occasions like Eid),” he said.He said that it was part of Bhand Pather but later progressed as it developed its own costume.“Ladishah would visit from door to door and compose his creation on the spot depending on the surroundings and then collect offerings. That has been the beauty of Ladishah,” he said. However, he believes that it should not be modified to make it modern. “Acting should not be mixed in it. Things get lost after mixing,” he said. “I saw Areej performing and gave her my blessings. I also gave her some suggestions which she accepted,” he said.Some feel that the reach of new technology is helping these types of traditional practices to reach youth.RajeshRaina, 49, a senior journalist who has been writing Ladishah weekly for a newschannel for the past eight years, said that this art form was dying, particularly after the introduction of TV, radio and cinema.“Ladishah is close to my heart from the beginning but broadcast media like TV and radio gave it a blow. Now there was some interest among the new generation with the percolation of digital media,” he said.He said that his interest in Ladishah was triggered by his fascination for this form since childhood. “I used to watch Ladishah on stage in Akingam which was my maternal home. From childhood it was in my mind and when I joined a TV channel as an editor I decided to introduce it.

The second warmest month was 2010 when the minimum did not drop below 19.4 degrees Celsius. November 2020 equalled the lowest minimum recorded in 2018 of 19.2 degrees Celsius.Also read: ‘Messing up Hindutva’ - BJP on Sena leader’s azan chanting competitionKS Hosalikar, deputy director-general (western region), IMD said, “the minimum temperatures this November did not show any declining trend this year.

It was the auspicious day of Gurpurab, the birthday of the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev Ji.Husain made this painting within a few hours. “My father had gone to the Gurudwara on Guru Purab to pray. Husain got to know about it. So, when my father came back and went to his art gallery, Husain came there and surprised him with this beautiful gift,” shares Sumeet Man Singh, Butalia’s daughter.Sumeet tells us that the painting was kept in their Gallery, Gita Art Gallery, which was set up in 1964, in the Oberoi Hotel, New Delhi. Later, the gallery was moved to the third floor of their home when the hotel was renovating its arcade. It now proudly hangs in their home. “It is the only Guru Nanak Dev Ji painting Husain ever made. My dad was a good friend and he often travelled to Mumbai to meet him,” says Singh.“I had seen him as a kid…at exhibitions, he used to be there and he would be in this space and suddenly he would produce a painting! It would just leave us awe-struck. The strokes were so clear and so fast that it was a sight to see,” adds Singh.The family got many offers to sell the painting but it was a cherished gift that they never thought of giving to anyone. “We got so many offers but there was no question of selling it ever,” says Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-divine-gift-that-will-always-be-treasured/story-WxUTCWCHBbupE7sI3yYXkO.html

30-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana’s khap bodies come out in support of agitating farmers||Amid the ongoing farmers’ protest against the Centre’s new farm legislations, Haryana’s khap bodies have extended support to the agitating farmers and announced plans to reach Delhi on Tuesday. A majority of bodies representing around 90 khaps spread mainly across the eight districts of Sonepat, Jhajjar, Rohtak, Bhiwani, Dadri, Jind, Hisar and Kaithal and dominated by the Jat community have expressed solidarity with the protestors.Surajmal, president of the Sheokand khap, which dominates 22 villages in the Uchana Kalan constituency represented by Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala , expressed his opposition to the farm laws and said they had made arrangements for food, milk and accommodation for the Punjab farmers when they passed through Jind district last week.“Many people associated with our khap have joined the farmers’ protest at the Tikri border and we are conducting village level meetings to appraise people about the consequences of these laws on agriculture. The other khap volunteers will reach the Tikri border in the next two days. We had voted for Dushyant during the assembly polls against the BJP candidate Prem Lata because of the BJP’s anti-farming policies. But after the poll results Chautala switched sides and we were expecting him to speak in our favour but he did not do so. He had reached Parliament on a tractor to protest against the Motor Vehicle Act in 2017, but now he fails to stand by us . I want to ask him as to what happened to him and his tractor,” Surajmal added.Meeting on December 1Bijender Sheoran, head of the Sheoran Khap which dominates 25 villages of Badhra constituency represented by Dushyant’s mother Naina Chautala, said he had called for a meeting of the khap body on December1 at Badhra.“We are farmers first and then heads of khaps. Our group has announced support for the farmers. We disapprove of the BJP leaders’ claim that the protesting farmers are Congressmen. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar is lying when he says that the farmers of the state stayed away from widespread protests and were not marching towards the Tikri and Singhu borders to join the agitation. Despite belonging to the Devi Lal family, our MLA Naina Chautala has not spoken a single word in our favour. Now, we have realised that she and her son have no sympathy with farmers and they want kursi (chair),” he added.Chautala’s Jannayak Janata party is an ally of the BJP in Haryana.Kuldeep Malik, president of the Gathwala khap, said the Centre and the Haryana government were attempting to create hurdles in the way of the agitating farmers“ The Haryana government has stooped to such lows that it has booked over 12,000 farmers all across the state’s police stations for entering Haryana during their Delhi Chalo march . Our khap has full solidarity with the farmers and our people will reach the Kundli border tomorrow. The Union government should hold talks with farmers unconditionally and solve their grievances,” he added. Independent MLA Sangwan resigns from BoardMeanwhile, the Independent MLA from Dadri, Somveer Sangwan, who is supporting the BJP-JJP government in Haryana, has resigned from the chairmanship of the Haryana Livestock Development board.Addressing a meeting of Sangwan Khap at Dadri, the MLA said he had resigned as chairman of the board to extend support to the agitating farmers.“ The people belonging to our khap will reach the Tikri border with a cavalcade of tractor trolleys on Tuesday,” he added.Sangwan is reportedly said to be close to Haryana CM Khattar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-s-khap-bodies-come-out-in-support-of-agitating-farmers/story-GP6MHQiHnia0t5it4J514N.html

30-11-2020||Chandigarh||Shimla’s crematorium overwhelmed by Covid-19 deaths||With Covid-19 deaths on the rise, the funeral pyres burn the entire day at the crematorium at Kanlog on the busy Dhalli-Tutikhandhi bypass near Shimla. Caretakers at the cremation facility are struggling to cope. “I’ve been here for two decades but never have I come across such a situation,” says Jeevan Singh, 34, the caretaker at the crematorium, built 22 years ago by Rotary Club, Shimla, and run by the local Sood Sabha. On an average, three bodies used to be brought daily for the last rites but of late the numbers have doubled. The crematorium has only four platforms to cremate bodies, including the Covid-19 fatalities. As a result, non-Covid dead are cremated before 10am and those who succumbed to the virus are brought after that. Also read: Farmers’ protest: Amid fears of Covid-19 spread, medical camp set up at Singhu border“It’s difficult to handle the rush because it takes four to five hours to cremate a body. Two weeks ago, we had to do the last rites of nine people who died of Covid-19 in single day. Just imagine our plight,” says Jeevan Singh, who lives with his wife and three-year-old son in room adjoining the crematorium. “Now I fear for my life and the health of my family,” he says, donning the personal protection equipment (PPE) kit. NOT PAID FOR THREE WEEKS The Shimla municipal corporation pays ₹1,000 per body cremated to the caretaker. However, the two caretakers at the crematorium say they have not been paid for three weeks. “I believe God sent us for the service of mankind but at the same time the authorities should realise the risk to our lives,”says Bhima Ram, the other caretaker who belongs to Banjar in Kullu district. Till date, 164 patients have died due to Covid-19 in Shimla’s two main hospitals, Indira Gandhi Medical College and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital. Of the total coronavirus deaths, 116 were from Shimla district and the rest were referred to the IGMC and DDU from other districts. “Nearly 90 patients were brought dead or died within 48 hours of admission which don’t come within the purview of the hospital deaths, indicating their delayed coming to hospital and improper referral”, says IGMC senior medical superintendent Janak Raj. A majority of the Covid-19 fatalities were cremated in Shimla. MC’S HELP SOUGHT TO BUILD PLATFORMS The Sood Sabha has written to the Shimla Municipal Corporation, seeking help to build more platforms for the last rites. “I have urged the MC to help build more platforms in the open space on either side of the crematorium in view of the rising Covid fatalities. Otherwise, it will be difficult to handle the situation in the coming days,” says Sanjay Sood, the president of the Shimla Sood Sabha. According to sources, people are hesitant to bring the bodies of their relatives in case of non-Covid deaths, citing improper sanitisation. It is learnt that the sanitation van can’t reach the crematorium’s platforms. GAS CREMATORIUM DEFUNCT In 2007, the Sood Sabha set up a gas-operated crematorium at Kanlog. It cost about ₹60 lakh and was imported from the United States but is lying defunct since 2014 due to a technical snag. A few local residents were trained to operate it but people prefer wood for the last rites hence it lay in disuse for a long time and developed a snag. In view of the rising number of Covid fatalities, the Sood Sabha has now sought the government’s help to fix the gas-operated crematorium. “Last time when it developed a snag, we brought a mechanic all the way from Florida. We had to pay him ₹5 lakh but the machine broke down again. We’ve asked the government if arrangements can be made to repair it locally. We will bear the cost,” Sood said. Almighty Blessings, a non-profitable organisation in Shimla, has volunteered to run the gas-operated crematorium. “We can run the crematorium if the machine is rectified,” says Sarabjeet Singh Bobby of the NGO that does free funerals and runs free canteens at IGMC and Kamla Nehru Hospital. Bobby says some people were so poor that they couldn’t even afford wood for the cremation. It costs between ₹3,600 to ₹5,000 to cremate a body.

30-11-2020||Pune||Skimmer found in co-op bank ATM in Camp, case registered||A case of cheating was registered at Lashkar police station in an incident where a video of a local police inspector warning people of skimming methods was used by fraudsters to rob people’s card credentials. The video showed how machines allow fraudsters to steal your card information exist in plain sight and look just like the slot where a card is inserted. The device that looks like the slot is called a skimmer. The ATM where the skimmer was installed belonged to a local co-operative bank that has an ATM near the Lashkar court located in Camp - merely 500 metres away from the Lashkar police station. “The bank contacted us when they realised there was something wrong. We went there with experts and conducted a search. There was a skimmer on the card slot and a curved surface with a camera in it attached above the panel where you input the PIN. The panel is just the right size to fit the area and the skimmer is just rightly made a little bigger to fit the card slot and if you’re not looking for it, you may never find it,” said senior police inspector Ashok Kadam of Lashkar police station who is investigating the case. The video of the skimmer being pulled from over the actual card slot of senior police inspector Ashok Kadam was shared on social media by the likes of Anil Deshmukh, state home minister; and actor Riteish Deshmukh. Incidentally, just after the video was shared widely, an assistant sub-inspector of Pune police fell victim to card cloning bid and lost Rs 1, 30,000 in the process. The card is believed to have been cloned after the information was stolen through a skimmer in a locally-based ATM. “We have registered a case and are on a lookout for suspects in both these cases,” said PI Kadam. “A few weeks ago, we arrested a person in a similar case. During Diwali, as people shop and spend cash, we had issued awareness warning through various modes which I’m sure has led to some prevention,” said senior police inspector Rajkumar Vaghchaure of cyber police station. These skimmers are mostly seen in ATMs which are remotely located and less frequented by people, according to PI Vaghchaure. If the camera that captures the PIN can be detected in time, further use of stolen data can be prevented. “People have to be very careful while entering their card credentials in places like the ATM, restaurants, petrol pumps - ensure that nobody is looking at or has access to your pin,” said PI Vaghchaure. The ATM card cloning has been a method of cheating people of their hard-earned money for years. Along with card cloning, other forms of cybercrime activity has gone up manifold according to a threat report published by McAfee, a device to cloud cybersecurity company. According to the report, India was among the top 10 countries that were targeted for various kinds of cyber-attacks. Globally, the company’s threat dashboard recorded a 605 per cent increase in Covid-19 related attacks in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. HT INTERVIEWHT spoke to senior police inspector Ashok Kadam on precautions that citizens must take to save themselves from skimming. What is skimming? Skimming happens when the digital data of a card is stolen. That data can be used to make another similar card - cloning. Using the PIN, whoever has access to card information, can withdraw money. The second part is - installing a camera over the space where you input the PIN. How to save oneself from this? Two small things should be followed to save yourself from skimming. Whenever you visit an ATM, the part where the card is inserted, try to move it. If it moves even a little, do not insert your card. It is quite probable that it is a skimmer. And, secondly, to prevent the camera from capturing your PIN, cover your hand while entering the PIN. Why did your video strike such a chord with so many people? There have been a few cases. There was a recent case where a police staff lost over Rs 1 lakh from his bank account even though he had never given his card to anyone and had not shared his pin with anyone. His card had been cloned. There were 24 different transactions. Sometimes, when the withdrawal amount is less than Rs 10,000, you do not get an SMS of the transaction. So, the transactions were of less than Rs 10,000. Common people value their hard-earned money and it is a sensitive issue for them.

30-11-2020||Pune||Udayanraje Bhosale accuses Sharad Pawar of delaying Maratha reservation||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Rajya Sabha member Udayanraje Bhosale said that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar deliberately kept the quota issue pending for decades. Bhosale, a descendant of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji, said that those from earlier generations only looked at the Maratha community as a vote bank and did not bother to give reservation to the community. He said that if the current dispensation cannot resolve the Maratha reservation issue, then those in power should resign. Bhosale was speaking in Satara while addressing a press conference on Sunday. The Supreme Court recently stayed the implementation of the Maratha quota law and referred petitions challenging the law to a larger constitution bench. Bhosale, without naming Pawar, said that the then chief minister during Mandal Commission did not press for inclusion of Maratha community in the OBC category, an issue that is haunting the Marathas today. “If those who are from an earlier generation and were in power when the Mandal Commission recommended reservation to OBCs had recommended the Maratha community then, we would have got reservation,” said Bhosale. It was Pawar who headed Maharashtra between 1988 and 1991 while the Mandal report was implemented in 1990. Bhosale said that those leaders are still in power and should resolve the issue without any delay. “He knows everything about the issue. It is high time that he resolves it,” he added. Plan to march to Mumbai: Maratha outfitsMaratha outfits have decided to step up its protest for reservation to the community in education and jobs. Various Maratha outfits held a meeting in Pune on Sunday where they decided to take out march from December 8 if the MVA government does not resolve the issue of admissions and jobs to Maratha youths. Rajendra Kondhre, convenor, Maratha Kranti Morcha, said that the way government has handled Class 11 admissions and jobs in Mahavitaran was unjust. “We would like to warn the government to resolve the issue of FYJC admissions and recruitment in Mahavitaran by December 6. Otherwise, we will march towards Mumbai (Vidhan Bhavan) and members of the community from each district will join the march,” said Kondhre.As per Kondhre, they plan to march to the Vidhan Bhavan as the government plans to hold the winter session of the assembly during the same period.Reacting to NCP leader and minister in MVA cabinet, Chhagan Bhujbal’s remarks that OBCs will fight the efforts if there are plans to disturb their quota, Maratha outfit leaders said that Bhujbal should restrain from making such statements. Bhujbal, minister for food and civil supplies, on Saturday had said that any move to carve out reservation from the Other Backward Class quota would be opposed. “The OBCs (Other Backward Classes) account for 54% of the population and their reservation should be left untouched. If needed, we shall come together and fight against any move to cut into the OBC quota,” Bhujbal had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/udayanraje-bhosale-accuses-sharad-pawar-of-delaying-maratha-reservation/story-hHsmXQU9YUF8dJP2jMZH1M.html
30-11-2020||Pune||Pune-based SII likely conduct trials for those under the age of 18||Serum Institute of India (SII), which is a front-runner for providing Covid-19 vaccine to India, might begin a separate trial study on those aged below 18 years to understand the safety and efficacy of Covishield vaccine against Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection.During an online interaction with journalists Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer (CEO), SII, said, that the institute might consider initiating separate trials for children which will start only after a few months. “A separate trial study among children and adolescents would likely delay the vaccination process for this age group even after the vaccine is approved for administering among adults,” he said.The safety and efficacy of the vaccine are being studied only in the adult age group.He said, “Not now, but maybe in future we are looking at doing a trial for those under 18 years. We have to do that after the safety and efficacy of the vaccine is proven on adults which is the same for all candidates, be it the US or UK.”Poonawalla said that the vaccine has proven its efficacy. He said, “As we found that there were zero hospitalizations among those who got infected, as in there were no severe symptoms. We also found that the sterilizing immunity as in the infection rate of a vaccinated person who got infected was reduced by 60 per cent which is an indicator of a good vaccine especially against Covid-19 which is highly infective.”Experts stress on the need for a separate trial study for those aged under 18 until which the vaccination for children should not be carried out. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who chairs the Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “The current age group for which the phase two and three trial studies are going on does not include either those below 18 or even those above 60 years of age. There are two schools of thought where one might say that no separate trial is necessary while another might say that it is necessary to understand its efficacy, whether vaccinated kids would act as a transmitter and also if the vaccine would work the same way as it works for adults when it comes to hospitalization or severity of symptoms.”“Currently they do not have any data for that age group and such data needs to come out first which needs to be peer-reviewed by the scientific community before any solid conclusions can be made until then such statements are only superficial,” he said.Dr Tushar Parikh, consultant neonatologist and paediatrician, Motherhood Hospital, said, “It is always prudent to confirm vaccine efficacy and safety in children separately as their immune system is developing and it may not respond in the same way. Side effect profiles may be different. So once the safety and efficacy are confirmed in adults I hope that there will be trials in children to confirm safety and efficacy.”“Fortunately children are less severely affected by Covid -19 so priority is developing adult vaccines. Normally it takes ten years for a vaccine development trial study to be completed. However, in this scenario things are happening at record break timings as multiple processes are being conducted simultaneously and so it would be difficult to say as to how much delay would this cause,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-based-sii-likely-conduct-trials-for-those-under-the-age-of-18/story-PovfutyG9f492iqs67i84K.html
30-11-2020||Pune||Pune dist: Virus shows serious impact on comorbid patients across all ages||A detailed analysis of Covid-19 cases in Pune district who reported comorbidities has shown that the impact of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection has been severe across age groups and not just senior citizens. Among the age groups, it was found that a significant proportion of comorbid patients from the age group of 60 years and above and 45-60 years needed hospitalisation and/or were declared dead as the associated risk factors proved to increase the severity of the symptoms.Experts have now said that the administration must focus on these vulnerable age groups as now they have the data following the state survey.The data visualised as per reporting done by labs and surveillance officers on lab module of Covid-19 India portal showed that of the total comorbid patients who were hospitalised, 46 per cent belonged to the age group of 60 plus years of age while 39 per cent belonged to the 45-60 years of age and 14 per cent were those below 45 years. While among the deceased who had comorbid conditions, 65 per cent of them were from the age group of 60 plus age group, 29 per cent were from the age group of 45-60 years and six per cent in the age group of less than 45 years of age.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee (MCDPCTC), said, “We have seen that comorbidity has a severe impact on Covid-19 patients across all ages. The administration now has extensive data on comorbid patients which was found during the state survey under ‘My family, My responsibility’ which they must use to keep a track of these comorbid patients.”“During the first wave, we found that even those aged below 40 were seriously impacted and had to be hospitalised. The administration needs to also prepare for beds and ventilators according to the number of comorbid people who are more vulnerable than others,” he said.The data also states among the comorbid patients, 65 per cent of them are from the age group of above 60 years while 29 per cent are in the age group of 45-60 years of age. While a major chunk of comorbid deceased is from senior citizens group a significant number is also from the age group of 45-60 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-dist-virus-shows-serious-impact-on-comorbid-patients-across-all-ages/story-VtKIQLdFse6FDmZXrIM06I.html
30-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC to repair century-old Tansa water pipeline at Lower Parel||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has undertaken the mammoth task of repairing leakage in a century-old 1450 mm-wide water pipeline at Gawde Chowk on Senapati Bapat Road in south Mumbai that runs approximately 100 kilometers to bring water to the island city, straight from the Tansa dam in Thane district. The most challenging aspect of repairing the leak is that this water main is buried over 25 to 30 feet under the ground, with a British era storm water drain, a sewage line, and TATA Power’s high voltage power line running right above it, in the middle of a busy street in Lower Parel. The leak in this Tansa main was detected 10 days ago on November 18, after which staff from BMC’s hydraulics department began excavation work around the area. After excavating up to 30 feet, the team spotted the leak on the underside of the pipeline. It was temporarily repaired by driving a wooden wedge and a patch screw jack under it, without shutting water supply through the pipeline to the surrounding areas.Also read | CBI, Enforcement Directorate should be sent to borders: Shiv Sena takes dig“It is not possible to dig any deeper as we have already hit hard rock at approximately 30 feet exactly below the leakage point,” a senior civic officer of the hydraulics department said. Now, permanent repairs to the pipeline will now be undertaken on December 2 and 3, and water supply to parts of Elphinstone Road, Prabhadevi, Dadar, and Mahim will be affected partially during this time.Jeevan Patil, assistant engineer of the water works department (emergency repair cell, Worli) said, “This work is challenging as it needs to be carried out underground. Over the past ten days, we carried out plan A to immediately plug leakage, but beyond a point, it is not possible to fix the pipeline with this method. Now, we are moving to plan B to work inside the pipeline. So far, all the work has been done without damaging any other parallel line such as the sewage line, the storm water drains, or the Tata Power high-voltage live line.”As part of plan B, BMC has now dug two 24-inch manholes on top of the pipeline, at a depth of 15 feet. While submersible pumps will be ascended through one manhole to draw out the water from the pipeline, the hydraulics team will use the other manhole to access the pipeline and repair it.A BMC press release said on Monday, “The main valve on the aqueduct [pipeline] will be closed after 8am on December 2, after which both manholes will be cut and the water in the aqueduct will be completely drained. A full inspection will then be carried out inside the aqueduct. The repair work will be started by estimating the extent of damage to the aqueduct due to the leak and the number of leaks. The work is planned to be completed by 3pm on December 3.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-to-repair-century-old-tansa-water-pipeline-at-lower-parel/story-6RpM9l56svpIUnWBdccL1O.html

30-11-2020||Delhi||RT-PCR tests for Covid could be cheaper. Arvind Kejriwal issues orders||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday ordered bringing down the rates of the RT-PCR tests, the most reliable diagnosis to detect the presence of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“I have directed that the rates of RT-PCR tests be reduced in Delhi. Whereas tests are being conducted free of cost in government establishments, however, this will help those who get their tests done in private labs,” he wrote on Twitter. Kejriwal, however, did not mention details of the revised price category and from when they will become effective. The government had earlier capped the price of all Covid-19 tests, whether from a government or private centre, in Delhi at Rs 2,400. The decision was taken in a DDMA meeting chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, and attended by Kejriwal, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot and other top officials from the Delhi Police, administration and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Prior to the Rs 2,400 cap, the cost of a Covid-19 test was Rs 4,500 if the private labs collected the sample and used their own kits, Rs 3,500 if the government collected the samples and the private labs used their kits to test it; and Rs 2,200 if the government collected the sample and provided the test kit as well. While the government paid these charges to the private labs, residents across Delhi were charged a flat rate of Rs 4,500.The decision to further reduce the test comes at a time when the national capital is logging a little less than 5,000 infections daily. On Sunday, Delhi recorded 4,906 new Covid-19 cases, the second consecutive day the city logged fewer than 5,000 infections, despite conducting more than 64,000 tests, indicating that the third and the sharpest wave of the disease in the Capital could be trending towards a decline.Also, under the revised policy, district administrations are expected to, inside containment zones, to conduct RT-PCR tests on all residents aged above 60, pregnant women, and individuals with comorbidities, irrespective of symptoms or direct contact with active cases, according to senior government officials aware of the new policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-govt-slashes-price-of-rt-pcr-tests-for-covid-19-in-delhi/story-y5JnoRFJ0ocSAI5881BRiK.html

30-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi AQI deteriorates further, stays in poor category at 294||Delhi’s air quality deteriorated to the far end of the poor category on Monday morning. The city’s air quality index (AQI) at 6am was 294. On Sunday, the average AQI was 256. Government agencies have forecast air quality to deteriorate further over the coming days due to a likely dip in temperature and gradual reduction in wind speed. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) have forecast below normal minimum temperatures in parts of north and northwest India, including Delhi, this winter.“The minimum temperature is likely to remain between 6-8 degrees Celsius over the coming week. Usually, such a drop in temperature is observed from December 20-22, but this year it is likely in the first two weeks of the month itself. It may impact air quality, as wind speed is likely to turn calm around December 4-5,” said a senior IMD scientist. The scientist added that the wind speed, which at present is 8-10kmph, is set to reduce from December 2 onwards, which may result in a plunge in the air quality. According to the System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing, the share of stubble burning to the city’s PM 2.5 levels on Sunday rose to 6% from 4% the previous day. “The ventilation conditions are likely to slow down from December 2 onwards and air quality is likely to deteriorate to very poor zone thereafter,” the SAFAR bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-aqi-deteriorates-further-stays-in-poor-category-at-294/story-gSSl5XXknLVO4GGqoXxPYP.html
30-11-2020||Delhi||Capital adds fewer than 5k Covid-19 cases for second day||Delhi on Sunday recorded 4,906 new Covid-19 cases, the second consecutive day the city logged fewer than 5,000 infections, despite conducting more than 64,000 tests, indicating that the third and the sharpest wave of the disease in the Capital could be trending towards a decline.Delhi also recorded 68 more Covid-19 deaths, taking the toll beyond 9,000. The city last recorded a triple-digit figure of deaths in a single day on November 24, with 109 fatalities, according to government data.The test positivity rate on Sunday was recorded at 7.64%, lower than levels over 15% in mid-November. “Number of cases and deaths go further down – it’s going down since 7 Nov. The Delhi government is working very hard. Our doctors, nurses and all other Corona warriors are working round the clock. I urge you all to continue to observe all precautions,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Sunday.According to government records, Delhi recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases in a day (8,593) on November 11, and on November 18, the city recorded the highest number of deaths (131). The overall test positivity rate was 15.33% recorded on November 15 – the highest since June 27 (15.37%) – and it has been on a decline since then. The Delhi government’s bulletins carry data pertaining to tests carried out the previous day.“To understand the peak of the third wave, we should look at the peak positivity rates of RT-PCR tests, antigen tests and overall tests. This happened on Nov 7, when the positivity rate of RT-PCR tests was as high as 30.2%, antigen tests was 8.4% and overall positivity rate was 15.26%. This when the overall tests were quite high at 50,754 on Nov 7 and the number of new cases was 7,745,” a statement by the Delhi government said.“In comparison, although the new cases on Nov 10 was 8,593, it was because the tests reached a record of 64,121 for any day in November, but the overall positivity rate had already declined to 13.4% and positivity rate for RT-PCR tests had also declined to 27.8%. The high positivity rate for Nov 14 (15.3%) was an aberration because of the extremely low testing at only 21,000 tests because it was the day of Diwali and even then, the RT-PCR tests positivity rate on Nov 14 (26.7%) was continuing to show a declining trend,” it added.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said that the current trends suggested that the “outbreak” was on “perpetual decline”, even as he emphasised on increasing RT-PCR testing capacity in the city.Sunday’s health bulletin recorded 64,186 total Covid-19 tests of which 29,839 were RT-PCR tests, considered the gold standard for Covid-19 detection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/capital-adds-fewer-than-5k-covid-19-cases-for-second-day/story-mV9GMNkPNwiUL4EgT30QoI.html

Who would have imagined that it would take a historical necropolis to put up its Delhi adaptation — but in the form of a free reality show.Renovated into a complex of gardens, Sunder Nursery has emerged as a theatre to witness the domestic manners of Delhi’s super-rich—only they can afford full-time maids and nannies to accompany them in their walks and picnics. Unlike in other parks, here they truly display their at-home manners in full public view, to the advantage of those of us who can never crash into their houses.This reportage is drawn from many excursions over several months, at different times, in the garden. One evening a regal-looking (head up, back straight) white-haired lady was walking with what seemed to be her two little grand-daughters, along with two dogs and five other people, who were dressed in grey. These five were obviously members of the household staff. The two men were each carrying a dog. Two of the three women were walking fast to keep up with the little girls. The third woman was carrying the lady’s handbag — which she was obliged to open frequently to hand over the ringing mobile phone to the mistress.One wondered about the lady. How wealthy might she be? One wondered more about her staffers. Are they enjoying the outing, or taking it as part of their day-job’s drudgeries?Another woman seems to be coming to the park every day. Her all-male staff, in dull-coloured safari suits, busily coordinate on phone with the chauffeur to bring the car in front of the gate the instant she exits.Overall, the in-the-park dynamics between the employers and the household staff tends to be mutually respectful. The staffers are identifiable, mostly because of their uniforms, or because they tend to walk a little bit behind their employers. While the employers talk to each other in English, they switch to Hindi when turning to the alert staffers.This weekend afternoon, a young couple is picnicking with their child. Everything is looking expensive about them, from the blue jeans they both are wearing to the kid’s toys, and from the disposable plates to the sandwiches. The couple’s two maids are preempting their every need, including when the man reaches out for the water bottle. As the evening nears, they get up to leave. The couple walks away with the child, while the maids dispose off the garbage in the nearest bin (a task that their male employer did offer to do, but which they politely refused). For the first time in the entire afternoon, they are chatting to each other, and laughing, and looking relaxed. Maybe because their shift is ending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-sunder-s-reality-show/story-yrXFXhOaywCRlLnLcIWFbL.html
30-11-2020||City||Strength of farmers likely to increase on Delhi border||The strength of farmers is likely to increase at the Haryana-Delhi borders in the coming days as the movement of farmers from Haryana and Punjab continued for the fourth consecutive day on Sunday. On Thursday, farmers had broken the barricades put up by the Punjab and Haryana governments on the NH 44. The Haryana government’s subsequent lifting of blockades gave a boost to several other farmer leaders and they have also planned to reach Delhi. “We are uniting farmers from different parts of the state and will soon reach Delhi to give strength to the protesting farmers,” said Ratan Mann, BKU (Tikait) state president. He said the number of farmers will increase in the next two days as hundreds of members and leaders of farmer unions, who were detained by the government earlier this week, have been released and they will also reach Delhi with more farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/strength-of-farmers-likely-to-increase-on-delhi-border/story-aEjPReAvFGdIGzzWVTnHGM.html

We came to know that Burari ground is an open jail, not a ground. The farmers want to protest at the Jantar Mantar. We will block Delhi from five entry points. If we are the terrorists, the workers and leaders of the ruling party should not consume food and milk produced by us,” he added.He said the unions have asked the central government to withdraw these black laws, FIRs registered against them and release farm leaders arrested during the farm agitation.Thousands of farmers protesting the Centre’s agriculture laws stayed put at the Singhu and Tikri border points for the fourth consecutive day on Sunday amid heavy police presence even after being offered a north Delhi ground to hold peaceful demonstrations.Several khap bodies on Sunday held a meeting at Rohtak and decided to reach Delhi on Monday to extend support to the agitating farmers, said Dadri’s independent MLA Sombir Sangwan, who heads the Sangwan khap and is believed to be close to the Haryana CM, has also pledged to support the farmers. “The Haryana government had misbehaved with farmers and we will reach Delhi to support farmers. The union government should intervene into the matter and clear farmers’ doubts,” he added.The farmer union members held a press conference later in the evening and said that they won’t allow any politician to get on the stage during the agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-reject-amit-shah-s-proposal-for-talks/story-MfQBRnydFYgEb4mLkXkoRK.html
30-11-2020||Mumbai||Two businessmen arrested for firing at Mumbai builder for failing to repay loan taken from duo||Bandra police on Sunday arrested two businessmen for allegedly threatening and firing at a 59-year-old builder, who failed to return the money he had borrowed from them. The accused, identified as Farhan Sayyed, 30, and Faiyaz Qureshi, 33, had given the builder, Nasir Shaikh, a loan of Rs45 lakh at 10% interest before the lockdown was imposed in March. Owing to the lockdown, Shaikh was unable to return them the money at the promised time. The complainant told the police that he had sought time to return their money, as he was facing cash crunch owing to the lockdown. On Saturday around 6pm, the two accused asked the builder to meet them at Chapel Road in Bandra (West) and threatened him. The accused, who were carrying firearms, opened fire at the builder to threaten him, said the police. He did not suffer any injuries in the incident. “We recovered two empty cartridges from the spot. After their arrest, the accused claimed that their intention was to threaten the builder and not to kill him,” said an officer from Bandra police station. Shaikh, who filed a complaint against the two businessmen, told the police that he knew the duo for many years. During the demonetisation in 2016, Qureshi had introduced Sayyed to the builder. Shaikh had helped Sayyed exchange his old currency with the new ones. Following Shaikh’s complaint, Bandra police registered a case under sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Indian Arms Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-businessmen-arrested-for-firing-at-mumbai-builder-for-failing-to-repay-loan-taken-from-duo/story-VPhro9WcQa3rlVlHlpKJdM.html
30-11-2020||Chandigarh||Won’t respond to Amarinder’s unconstitutional language: Khattar||Dismissing the language his Punjab counterpart Captain Amarinder Singh reportedly used against him as “unconstitutional”, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday lashed out at the former and said that one CM should not use such language against another CM. Khattar also said that if the Covid-19 pandemic turns into a catastrophic situation due to farmers’ agitation, the Punjab government will be fully responsible for it. A war of words has erupted between the two neighbouring CMs after Khattar said that Capt Amarinder Singh did not respond to his repeated telephone calls, while the Punjab CM had accused Khattar of spreading lies.“The use of unconstitutional language does not suit any chief minister. One chief minister should not use such language about another chief minister,” Khattar said while speaking to reporters in Hisar, pointing out that he does not need to react to such language. “The public is already condemning the language used by the Punjab chief minister on social media. It is not in my values to behave like this,” Khattar added. Responding to queries of mediapersons after a rally organised under the chairmanship of Haryana Vidhan Sabha deputy speaker Ranbir Singh Gangwa in Hisar, Khattar said in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, everyone should fulfil their responsibility. “But it is surprising that at such a time the Punjab government has exhibited irresponsible behaviour and created such a situation,” he said. Reiterating that it was not true that he did not try to speak with the Punjab chief minister, Khattar said the current farmers’ movement was entirely sponsored by the Punjab Congress. He said precautionary measures regarding the protest were taken by Haryana government so that Covid-19 pandemic does not take catastrophic proportions. “The Union home minister has said that he will hold talks with the protesters. As soon as the protesters gather in Burari field, an appropriate solution will be found by negotiating with them,” he added. In response to a query regarding the forthcoming Panchayati Raj elections, the chief minister said that if there is a unanimous decision for filling the posts by direct elections, then the Haryana government is considering a plan to give special grants to the respective areas for development works. It will probably be announced before the election, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/won-t-respond-to-amarinder-s-unconstitutional-language-khattar/story-on32xDa81VUkvw1uyILVQM.html

Now, it is clear that BJP is making attempts to defame farmers’ agitation with the help of its own people. The PM should clarify what relationship he has with the man who is demanding Khalistan.”Sidhu had hit the headlines when a video of him trying to convince the Haryana police to allow them to proceed to Delhi started making the rounds of social media.“Ye inquilab hain. Ye revolution hai. If they don’t understand the seriousness of this matter, it will define the political structure and the geopolitics of India as well as South Asia,” he is heard saying. “It is going to be very sad for them. If you take away farmers’ land then what do they have left? Only debt?”The actor meanwhile said on a digital platform that he has no affiliation with any political party but he had campaigned for BJP candidate Sunny Deol during the parliamentary polls.“I have a close relationship with Deol and I had canvassed for him in the Gurdaspur constituency. I am fighting with my farmer brothers against these black laws,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-accuses-actor-deep-sidhu-of-raising-pro-khalistan-slogans/story-2KnluuZPkm47lOadCJyZVM.html
30-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai court sends Shiv Sena MLA’s close associate to judicial custody till Dec 9 in money laundering case||A city court remanded Amit Chandole, a business associate of Shiv Sena Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Pratap Sarnaik, in judicial custody till December 9 on Sunday. Chandole was arrested on Wednesday by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case related to security services giant Topsgrup – owned by Rahul Nanda. After the completion of his three-day custody, ED officials produced him before the holiday court. However, the court did not agree to ED’s extension of Chandole’s custody and instead sent him to judicial custody. The counsel for the central agency has confirmed the development. ED had in its previous remand application alleged that Topsgrup had obtained a contract for providing security guards for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) projects in collusion with Pratap Sarnaik through illegal means by a “well-thought out strategy”. The agency has claimed that the aim of these illegal manoeuvres was to get additional inadmissible benefit by inflating the number of contracted security guards deployed at the cost of MMRDA and illegal cash gratification to Sarnaik for facilitating this scam. Against this “active role and criminal conspiracy”, Sarnaik used to get 50% profit earned out of the said contract and sometimes, the money used to be transferred to the account of a third person, said ED. Chandole accepted the receipt of cash from Topsgrup for the MMRDA projects, ED claimed. Therefore, part of the amount received by Topsgrup from MMRDA appears to be proceeds of crime, said ED. The Sena leader had termed ED’s actions as an outcome of vendetta politics. “The day I moved a privilege motion against (actor) Kangana Ranaut and (Republic TV editor-in-chief) Arnab Goswami, and spoke about reopening the Anvay Naik (suicide) case (in which Goswami is an accused), I knew what would happen. I am a Shiv Sainik and a fighter who has reached this far. (Chief minister) Uddhavsaheb Thackeray has made me the spokesperson to put forward the party’s views. Today they [ED officers] told him [Vihang] your father speaks a lot on Ranaut and Goswami. I will continue to speak wherever Mumbai, Maharashtra or its police are maligned. I have done nothing wrong in my business,” he has said last week after ED raided his properties and questioned his son. Sarnaik on November 25 quarantined himself citing Covid-19 guidelines after returning to the state from Goa. He has asked ED for a week’s time to join the investigation. The agency said others people linked to Sarnaik’s businesses would also be soon asked to join the probe. Earlier, Nanda had also denied all the allegations. “Pratap is a very old friend and has not invested a single penny in my business or company ever. He or Sena have nothing to do with Tops. This is absolutely absurd,” he said. ED’s money laundering probe is based on a first information report (FIR) registered by Mumbai’s Yellow Gate police on October 28 on the direction of 16th metropolitan magistrate court against Nanda and his family members. The case was recently transferred to the Mumbai Police economic offences wing (EOW) for further investigation. The complainant filed by Ramesh lyer, the former chairman of Topsgrup, alleged that Nanda and others diverted huge funds from the firm’s accounts to various accounts in India and overseas. He further alleged that these funds were utilised by Nanda and others for their personal purposes such as purchasing property. The security firm was thus defrauded of Rs175 crore. Iyer and Topsgrup’s former director of finance Amar Panghal, in their statements, said that in 2014, a contract was signed by Topsgrup Services & Solutions Ltd with MMRDA, according to which 350-500 guards had to be deployed at project sites on a monthly basis. While only 70% of the guards were actually deployed, the firm billed MMRDA for all the guards and charged the authority for their salaries and provident fund, ED stated before the court. The duo reportedly informed ED that huge cash amounts were withdrawn from the bank accounts of Topsgrup Services & Solutions Ltd and given to a former top executive. In financial year 2017-18, an amount of around Rs92 lakh was handed over to the executive and there was an arrangement with two persons, one of whom was Chandole who got a monthly share of profits earned on the MMRDA contracts. In addition, a fixed commission of Rs50,000 per month and Rs500 per guard deployed was being paid to Chandole and the other man by the top executive, said ED. As per the details provided by lyer, from May 2017 to June this year, the amount aggregating to Rs2.36 crore has been shared as commission. Of the said amount, Rs90 lakh was paid through bank transfers to Chandole and the other man. As per lyer, all these amounts are still being paid from Topsgrup’s bank accounts and a commission of around Rs7 crore has been paid to the duo since 2014 when the contract with MMRDA was initiated. During the course of investigation, the top executive’s statements were recorded on November 24 and 25, in which he purportedly said that Nanda acquired a United Kingdom (UK)-based firm, Shield Guarding Company Limited, in 2014 for around Rs200-250 crore. On the pretext of meeting the expenses of overseas company, Nanda used to allegedly siphon off money from the Indian company for his and his family’s personal expenses, including buying several immovable properties in Dubai and the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-sends-shiv-sena-mla-s-close-associate-to-judicial-custody-till-dec-9-in-money-laundering-case/story-XUdqLM4ApZsHZFW0J6qvCJ.html
30-11-2020||City||Maharashtra CM reviews Mumbai coastal road work; tunnelling to begin in January||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday reviewed the ongoing coastal road project between Princess Street Flyover and Worli. Thackeray was accompanied by Mumbai suburbs guardian minister and state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray and urban development minister Eknath Shinde. The CM directed officials to complete the project within the deadline of July 2023.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, workers are currently lowering India’s biggest tunnel boring machine (TBM). Around 20% of the work for the coastal road has been completed. “CM visited three sites and inquired about the progress of the coastal road project. He directed us to complete the work on time and was satisfied with the overall progress. The actual tunnelling work for the project is expected to start by the first week of January and is likely to get completed by the start of the year 2023,” a BMC official said.The TBM will drill the 3.4-kilometre (km)-long twin tunnels partially running under the sea between Girgaum and Malabar Hill, as part of the 9.98-km-long coastal road between Priyadarshini Park and the Worli-end of the Bandra Worli Sea Link.The TBM will operate 25 metres (m) below the surface at Girgaum and 75m below the surface at Malabar Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-cm-reviews-mumbai-coastal-road-work-tunnelling-to-begin-in-january/story-D0wHkjpu6IgYyVysMetq5M.html
30-11-2020||City||Has Maharashtra Congress failed to capitalise on advantage?||A year after forging alliance with the Shiv Sena, along with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to form the government in Maharashtra, the Congress’s state unit sees an opportunity to regain its lost ground. However, the party organisation seems to be lacking in its efforts to regain ground. The Congress’s performance in the government, too, has been lacklustre, observers believe. After bagging 17 seats in the 2009 Lok Sabha from the state, its tally dropped to two seats in the 2014 general elections. It further reduced to a single seat in the next general polls. Likewise in the Assembly elections, the Congress came down to 44 seats in 2019 from its tally of 82 seats in the 2009 state elections. Its worst performance was in 2014 when it won just 42 seats in the state. Its tally in Vidhan Sabha had never dropped below 50 in the state’s 14 Assembly elections, where the grand old party was formed 135 years ago. Party workers and leaders were demoralised and did not expect any good to happen. Just ahead of the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls last year, its prominent leaders such as Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Harshavardhan Patil defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for greener pastures. In 2019 state polls, the party managed to retain its seats, but was pushed to the fourth position, with the NCP winning 12 seats more than the Congress. Then came an offer from the Sena and the NCP to join hands to form government in Maharashtra. State Congress leaders convinced the national leadership that joining the coalition government would give them a chance to regain lost ground and rebuild the party organisation in Maharashtra. However, one year later, this does not seem to be happening. The only benefit the Congress got is that its legislators did not join the BJP. A senior NCP minister, making his observations, said, “The ministers from the Congress hardly have any impact in their respective departments, as compared to the ministers from the NCP and Sena. The blunder by energy minister Nitin Raut from Congress on the excessive electricity bills is expected to cost the government dear. Its other ministers, including relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar and medical education minister Amit Deshmukh could have performed better during the natural calamities (the flood and Cyclone Nisarg) and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The party also lacks coordination among its own ministers.” Former chief minister (CM) and current public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan recently said in an interview that Raut should have restrained from making announcements of waiver from excessive bills. He had to take a u-turn after the state decided against any such waiver. Political analyst Pratap Asbe said, “The party should have better coordination with its other two allies and must also understand that it has an opportunity to gain the lost glory.” Maharashtra Congress chief and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat refuted the claims that the party is in slumber. “The decision about reducing the stamp duty has helped in the real estate sector’s revival and we had record registrations of properties. As far as the electricity bills are concerned, the cost of waiver was between Rs1,000 and Rs2,400 crore, which was beyond capacity for the state exchequer to bear. We have better coordination between the three ruling parties and raising concerns over the share from the budgetary allocations could not be termed as clashes.” Congress leaders feel that they had held effective agitations over the farm laws recently and have been pushing for state’s own law to negate the ‘anti-farmer’ provisions in the central laws. The party has also decided to focus on regaining power in local bodies, which has been the strength of its base in rural parts of the state. After 2014, the Congress had lost power in many district councils, municipal corporations and other local bodies. In terms of the corporators in the district council, the party had slipped to the third position. It now aims to regain the councils. The state leadership also believes that power helps in maintaining control of the cooperative sector. As many as 27 of the 34 district councils and 15 of the 27 municipal corporations will go into polls in the next two years. Thorat said any political party’s ultimate aim is to gain power, as it helps strengthen the party base and empower the workers. “We will benefit in the district council and municipal corporation elections to be held in next two years because we are in power in state,” he said. After Congress’s poor show in the Assembly polls in Bihar, especially in the Muslim-dominated Simanchal, the Maharashtra BJP claimed that the grand old party had to face defeat owing to its alliance with the Sena in Maharashtra. There are questions being raised if the party will face a similar reaction from the Muslim voters in Mumbai in the upcoming BMC elections. “I don’t think that results in Bihar elections had anything to do with the alliance in Maharashtra. In fact, Muslims are happy that Sena has fallen apart from BJP. This will help the Congress,” said Asbe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/has-maharashtra-congress-failed-to-capitalise-on-advantage/story-Nb7evodpPeApsArJqkX5yJ.html
30-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid-19 forced drug cartels to change modus operandi, say anti-narcotic agencies||The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted drug trafficking and forced international drug cartels to change their modus operandi to send drugs in India, said officials in central and regional anti-narcotics agencies.The pandemic and the subsequent lockdown in many countries across the globe have directly impacted the drug cartels in their international movement as air traffic between many countries have still not resumed.“The logistics of drug cartels and its syndicates have changed considerably since the pandemic. In the pre-Covid era, the Colombian or other drug cartels were using carriers from South American countries such as Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil and Colombia. They were using people from these countries as cocaine is basically produced in this belt of South America,” said a senior official from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) requesting anonymity. Earlier they would send mules from these countries to Sao Paulo in Brazil and then to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, from there the drugs used to be pushed into Mumbai, added the official.Now, as there are lesser flights due to pandemic, the cartels are using people from countries like as Guinea, Malawi and Ghana and are sending them to Addis Ababa and then to Mumbai.“One of the prime reasons is that the cartels are finding it tough to arrange visas and other logistics for carriers from South American countries, and have switched their operations to West Africa,” added the official.The official further said that earlier the rackets were sending mules who would conceal the drugs stuffed in capsules in their body. Last year dozens of foreigners, mostly women, were arrested by officials of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and Air Intelligence Unit (AIU) at the Mumbai airport while smuggling drugs inside their body. Now the trend has been to meticulously conceal drugs in cavities made in the baggage or trolleys.“The cartels have also increased the quantity for smuggling drugs because their other routes are closed. The recent arrests of a Malawian national and Republic of Guinea national and subsequent seizure of cocaine worth ₹24 crore from them is the biggest seizure of cocaine being smuggled in India through air route this year. There are less flights operating, so they are smuggling in huge quantity to recover the losses they faced during lockdown,” the senior DRI official said.Cargo-related drugs trafficking have also been impacted as cargo movement has slowed down because of Covid-19, he added.KPS Malhotra, deputy director (operations), NCB, said the pandemic has drastically changed the functioning of drug cartels. “As there were restrictions on air passengers, cartels have increased their operations through couriers and maritime routes. As a result of this, there was surge in successful crackdown by anti-narcotics agencies involving drug trafficking through couriers. For bigger quantity, they smuggle through the sea and for smaller quantity they use couriers,” Malhotra said.“The business for drug traffickers has become very lucrative now, as after months of lockdown, there is high demand of drugs in the market. And the cartels are desperately looking for opportunities as their stocks are lying as it is,” Malhotra said.A DRI official said another modus operandi which drug cartels have recently started is to identify poor people who have medical conditions and wish to travel abroad for treatment. “Under the guise of medical tourism, cartels have started using people who face medical conditions to smuggle drugs,” said another DRI official. “It becomes easy for racket members to use people looking for medical tourism as their carriers, as chances of them getting caught or coming under scanner is less considering their genuine medical history,” added the official.NCB officials also said that the pandemic has thrown challenges for anti-narcotics agencies when it comes to deal with domestic drug cartels. “There has been spike in cases of seizure cannabis and opium sourced from the states like Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Due to lockdown, inward drug trafficking has increased by many folds. Huge quantities, such as 10,000 kilograms of cannabis, are being seized every month,” Malhotra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-covid-19-forced-drug-cartels-to-change-modus-operandi-say-anti-narcotic-agencies/story-iYTzfh89HhT1H7mFSsSkRM.html
30-11-2020||Mumbai||Has Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar regained position in NCP a year after failed coup?||After his first and an unsuccessful attempt to split the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) a year ago, Ajit Pawar returned to the party fold and was also made deputy chief minister within a month Before his failed coup, he was seen as a political heir of NCP chief Sharad Pawar. He was also undisputed number two after the senior Pawar. Despite his attempt to sabotage the new political coalition, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was formed and the partners are now celebrating one year office. The question doing the rounds is – Has Ajit Pawar regained his old position? Opinions are divided in the NCP as well as in political circles, although there is consensus among all that the NCP chief’s authority remains intact not just in the party but also the MVA. Analysts say Ajit’s mistake was forgiven by the NCP supremo, but no legislator will leave the party along with him until Pawar is politically active. They also say that senior Pawar is clearly in control of the party and directly communicates with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on various matters, rendering Ajit’s role to that of just another minister from the NCP. Ajit’s close aides in the party, however, insist there is no change in his position in the party as he was convinced to come back and given deputy chief ministership, the second position after the chief minister in the state government. He is also part of all decisions taken by the party leadership. On November 23, 2019, Ajit Pawar brought what was called a political earthquake in Maharashtra by extending support to the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and swearing-in with Fadnavis as his deputy, at a time when his political mentor and uncle Sharad Pawar was planning to form a three-party government by bringing Shiv Sena and Congress on board. The government lasted barely 80 hours as most of the NCP legislators refused to side with the rebel faction led by Ajit Pawar and expressed their loyalty to the party chief. Ajit, too, returned to the party and a month later was sworn-in again in the same position in the Thackeray led MVA government. He could extend support to the BJP as he was elected as leader of the legislative party unit, thus was replaced by Jayant Patil, state NCP president, soon after the revolt and is yet to get back the position even after a year. “He (Ajit Pawar) is still number two in the party, if not, he wouldn’t have been appointed as the deputy chief minister. He got the portfolio of his own choice and is leading the party in the state government. Even after his revolt, he was convinced to come back and most senior leaders were involved in that process,” said a close aide of Ajit. “He also ensured that two of his close confidantes — Sanjay Bansode and Dattatray Bharne — were made ministers. Bansode was also part of the rebel faction that had extended support to the BJP last year,” said another NCP leader, requesting anonymity. Ajit came to prominence when around 60 out of 62 MLAs signed a letter extending their support to him for the post of deputy chief minister in 2010, forcing Chhagan Bhujbal to vacate the position. Ajit remained in that position till 2014, when the Congress and NCP lost to the BJP-Shiv Sena. His popularity in the party can be gauged that he was welcomed by NCP leaders on his return. He also addressed a gathering of all the legislators at YB Chavan on the very first day on November 27. “He (Ajit Pawar) made a mistake by leaving the party but rectified it and was forgiven by the NCP chief. But his mistake also brought an advantage to MVA partners as the President’s rule was lifted overnight. If he (Ajit Pawar) wouldn’t have made that mistake, the President’s rule would have continued for another two-three months and an elected government would not have to come to power so early,” said Nawab Malik, party spokesperson and state minority affairs minister. Political analyst Pratap Asbe said, “There is no doubt that Ajit Pawar has got his position back in the party and his popularity has also not gone down. But he will have to live with a blot on his image forever. It has also become clear that no legislator will leave the NCP along with him, if he makes another attempt, until (Sharad) Pawar is politically active. No one knows what is going to happen after that.” “Pawar made him the deputy chief minister but he himself is playing a crucial role in deciding major policies of the MVA government by discussing them directly with the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. With this, he has limited Ajit Pawar’s role to another cabinet member in the Thackeray government. In contrast, Ajit Pawar was de-facto in the previous Congress-NCP regime during 2009-14,” said Abhay Deshpande, political analyst.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/has-maharashtra-deputy-cm-ajit-pawar-regained-position-in-ncp-a-year-after-failed-coup/story-tBu0MwiHyj08StbPbiqDcM.html
30-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cracking down on peddlers will not stop drug supply, say experts||Since August 26 when the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) registered a case to probe the drug angle into Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, the agency has continued its crackdown against the usage of drugs in the film industry. Meanwhile, the recent Supreme Court (SC) ruling, that confessions under section 67 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act is not admissible as evidence, could prove to be the Achilles’ heel for NCB when the cases reach trial stage. This, in turn, would hinder the efforts of the agencies to crack down on the supply chain or producers who supply drugs to Mumbai. Legal experts opine that a case cannot stand trial on the basis of a confessional statement alone, and the agency will have to corroborate every arrest with substantial evidence. “Confession statements of co-accused have to be corroborated with other substantial evidence. On its own it cannot be considered as evidence against another accused. With this recent Supreme Court ruling, agencies have to gather other supporting evidence, without which the case would become weak,” said Pradeep Gharat, noted criminal lawyer and special public prosecutor in various high-profile cases. Incidentally, an NDPS court in Mumbai, while releasing Paul Bartel, an Australian national arrested by NCB, on bail, noted, “In the absence of any substantial material, taking into account the fact that no contraband was recovered from the accused and except the statements of co-accused and WhatsApp messages, there is no substantial evidence to treat the accused as peddler/supplier of drugs.” Gharat said that WhatsApp chats, too, cannot be considered as a material of evidence. “Both the confession statement and WhatsApp chat have to be independently corroborated,” Gharat said.Senior counsel Mihir Desai opined that the police have a right to arrest any accused on the basis of a prima facie evidence gathered during the process of investigation. “Confessional statement and WhatsApp chat can be considered as prima facie evidence but they are not enough. It has to be independently corroborated. The agency has to gather further strong supporting evidence while submitting a charge sheet for trial. In the absence of which, the case would become weak and may not yield positive results for prosecution,” said Desai. Only time will tell if the cases registered by NCB against the likes of actor Rhea Chakraborty will stand the test of trial. “Little is known about the corroboratory evidence NCB has gathered to arrest Rhea Chakraborty and others. Chakraborty’s case will be decided by the trial court based on the merits of the evidence gathered by the investigating agency,” said a retired SC judge on condition of anonymity. Senior police officers are clear that arresting small time peddlers will not root out the drug menace prevalent in the city. “Law enforcement agencies have not achieved any major success in busting an entire supply chain or unearthing a link to drug trafficking cartels operating out of Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh which primarily focus on producing weed or hashish,” said a senior IPS officer, requesting anonymity. “When it comes to hashish, the supply chain is primarily controlled by the Russian or Israeli drug mafia. Hashish fetches a lot of money unlike marijuana whose production and supply is controlled by locals from different parts of the country. Unless we dismantle these drug syndicates, the supply in to the city will continue,” he added. “If a well-coordinated major crackdown doesn’t happen on the drug’s supply chain or the core source unit of drug manufacturers, then the flow of drugs into the city will continue as always,” said former Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) chief KP Raghuvanshi. He added, “A peddler is a very small unit. They are rather the victims. Most of them start as consumers and end up as peddlers. They peddle primarily to fulfil their need to consume and then to make small monetary gains.” Former director general of Maharashtra Police, PS Pasricha, also said that peddlers are the last unit in the drug chain before the consumers. “They don’t run the drug business. Police agencies should focus more on busting the entire supply chain. Only then, the actual supply of drugs would stop in city. But city police’s often don’t prefer going after suppliers as they work in set format and are bound with too many restrictions, jurisdictional issue being the biggest reason.” Central agencies such as NCB and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) are entrusted with going after the big fish of the narcotics industry. In India, majority of domestic as well as international narcotics syndicates, especially those trafficking cocaine and heroin, penetrate metros like Delhi and Mumbai. Delhi and Mumbai have always been their hot favourites.In Mumbai, cocaine is ferried mostly by persons of African origin who are hired by Colombian and other South American drug cartels. Most cocaine peddlers and smugglers who have been arrested in Mumbai by NCB and anti-narcotics cell (ANC) belong to African countries, especially Nigeria which is known to be a key transit point for Colombian drug cartels, said an IPS officer from the Mumbai Police. KPS Malhotra, deputy director, operations, NCB, said, “Narcotics trafficking is a network crime. To bust a supply chain, law enforcers keep on looking for intelligence thread linked to the entire chain at any level — right from consumers to the manufacturer or cartel runners. The majority of cartels, especially the domestic ones, keep on changing their methods, locations while the members stay off the radars of NCB or other law enforcing agencies. The groups would set up some makeshift facilities in interiors, cook drugs and then dismantle everything. Despite this, efforts are always put to derail their plans.” Explaining the challenges faced by law enforcers with respect to taking on cartels operating domestically and trafficking synthetic drugs, a senior DRI official said, “Busting cartels or factories manufacturing synthetic drugs is challenging because India’s chemical-pharmaceutical industry is very huge and monitoring is not rigorous. Drug prepared in factories does not require state of the art equipment or set up. Ephedrine and mephedrone can be prepared using basic chemicals and equipment and the raw material required for their preparation are legally available in both chemical and pharmaceutical industries.” Data or intelligence sharing is another serious problem because of which drug cartels manage to remain off the radars. “The pace at which data or intelligence is shared among all the stakeholders of anti-narcotics works and the pace at which cartels run, there is a considerable gap,” the DRI official said. The Central government has shown their intent to work in this direction and recently revamped the NCORD (Narco Coordination Centre). The government has also constituted an apex committee under the Union home secretary to support the coordination mechanism under NCORD to enable focused resolution of policy and operational issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-cracking-down-on-peddlers-will-not-stop-drug-supply-say-experts/story-yaYRKKtqP8QFWTAR8ALP8M.html
30-11-2020||Patna||Grand Alliance likely to contest Rajya Sabha by-election in Bihar: Report||The opposition Grand Alliance in Bihar is likely to throw its hat in the ring for the Rajya Sabha seat, which has fallen vacant upon the death of former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, sources in the five-party coalition said on Sunday.The BJP-led NDA, of which the late leader’s Lok Janshakti Party has been a constituent, has fielded former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who will file his nomination papers on December 2.Paswan’s son Chirag, who currently heads the LJP and had burnt his fingers recently by going solo in the assembly polls, sought to downplay the cold-shoulder received from the NDA, saying “the seat belonged to the BJP. It is for the party to decide whom to field in the by-election”.Paswan had got elected, unopposed, in a by-poll last year necessitated by his cabinet colleague Ravi Shankar Prasad winning the Patna Sahib Lok Sabha seat.However, the RJD, which heads the Grand Alliance, had on Saturday indicated that it was not willing to give a walkover to the NDA.In a statement, the party’s spokesman Shakti Yadav had said “the BJP has acted out of spite (‘khunnas’) by denying the seat to the LJP. Had the late Ram Vilas Paswan’s party been allowed to contest, we would have considered supporting their candidate even though his party is not our alliance partner”.Meanwhile, sources in the Grand Alliance said the feelers have been sent to Chirag that he consider fielding his mother Reena Paswan from the seat and assured him of its “full support”.The offer appears to have put the 37-year-old LJP president in a bind as agreeing to the offer would be tantamount to burning his bridges with the BJP, to which he claims to remain loyal despite his brinkmanship, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for whom he expresses unreserved admiration.The LJP chief has been maintaining that his misadventure in the recent elections stemmed from the conviction that there was resentment in the state against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his JD(U).Numbers in the state assembly, too, appear to be in favour of the NDA, which now includes smaller parties like VIP and HAM. The ruling coalition has 125 MLAs in the 243-strong assembly as against only 110 of the Grand Alliance.The opposition coalition, which hopes to rally along parties like Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM which has five MLAs, is of the view that such a contest would be a win-win situation as even if Reena Paswan were to lose, the NDA would end up angering a large section of Dalits.Sources in the Grand Alliance also said that if Chirag did not come out with a positive response, the coalition might still go ahead and field its candidate for the seat, engaging in yet another trial of strength with the ruling NDA.Filing of nomination papers will come to a close on December 3. The last date for withdrawal of nominations is December 7 and voting is scheduled on December 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/grand-alliance-likely-to-contest-rajya-sabha-by-election-in-bihar-report/story-34r2W9txX5iHn9rxJYHQkK.html

Also read: Covid-19: Private doctors await help from Maharashtra governmentA senior officer from the state health department said, “The government is identifying ‘super-spreaders’ in the population, or people who have maximum social contact in the community, and is testing such people on priority. These include hoteliers, vendors, street vendors, state and city bus conductors, who are likely to come in contact with at least 10 to 15 people per day due to the nature of their occupation.”Regarding further scaling up daily testing the in the state, the officer said “The government does not have a target as such, but plans to conduct enough tests to gauge even the slightest increase in cases in the state.”State health minister Rajesh Tope said on Saturday that district authorities have been directed to go for aggressive testing in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. “We have asked them to conduct tests at their full capacity. We want to take the daily testing to 150,000 tests,” he said. Despite the increase in daily tests, the number of Covid-19 infections reported daily has not seen a dramatic spike. The officer quoted above said, “The state’s daily positivity rate is hovering around 7%. The number of cases has shown some increase due to Diwali, but they have not increased proportionately to the increase in number of tests. In fact, before Diwali, Maharashtra had a daily positivity rate of around 10%.” State health officials have attributed this to people following Covid-hygiene to a “large extent”, and to herd immunity.

30-11-2020||Mumbai||Year after losing 2-month-old son in Mumbai hospital mishap, UP couple welcomes child||A year after losing their child in a mishap at civic-run King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital at Parel, Pannelal Rajbhar and his wife found a reason to celebrate in the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. In August, the Rajbhars welcomed their second child. But even as the family is trying to restart their lives, the horror of the past continues to haunt them. It was in first week of November last year that Uttar Pradesh (UP) resident Rajbhar had brought his two-month-old son Prince to KEM Hospital after he was diagnosed with a congenital heart disease and pneumonia in his home town Varanasi. Prince was kept on oxygen support at the hospital’s paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and electrocardiogram (ECG) nodes were attached to his chest. On November 7, early in the morning, the nodes of the ECG machine caught fire owing to a short circuit. The fire burnt the infant’s left hand and left side of his face. The child sustained 22% burn injuries and his left arm had to be amputated. He died on November 22, 2019, during treatment. After the death of their son, the couple returned to their hometown. Meanwhile in January, the Rajbhars found a new hope after the couple learnt of a second pregnancy. As the fear of losing their second child played in their minds, the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic across the country in March only added to their anxieties and worries. “We were extra careful this time. We followed up with doctors every month to avoid any pregnancy-related complications and to ensure better health of the child,” said Rajbhar, who is now at Varanasi, taking care of his three-month-old son, with his wife Sandhya. The couple have christened their second child Shashank after consulting a priest for his safety. “Though, we are trying to move on with our lives, last year’s horror continues to haunt us. Sometimes, I wake up at night to check on my son. Even if he sneezes, I rush him to a hospital,” said Rajbhar. HT had reported that Rajbhar regretted and mourned on the fact that the family did not have a single photograph with Prince. This time though, Rajbhar captured several photos with his second son since his birth. Though the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had given them a compensation of Rs10 lakh, the family is still waiting to get justice. Bhoiwada police had registered a first information report (FIR) under section 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life) of the Indian Penal Code and then added section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) to the case after Prince died. However, the police submitted a closure report in court in October this year, stating that they did not find any conclusive evidence to place responsibility on anyone for the incident. A police officer from Bhoiwada police station said, “We had sent the equipment for analysis but we didn’t find any fault with it. We have filed a report on it.” The National Human Rights Commission is yet to submit their verdict on the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/year-after-losing-2-month-old-son-in-mumbai-hospital-mishap-up-couple-welcomes-child/story-3ecxSC0CLeaqnMPxYQyiNO.html
30-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fuel price hike hits motorists in the absence of local trains||Petrol and diesel prices continued to surge with petrol price inching towards ₹90 for one litre on Sunday. The rise in the fuel price is affecting citizens more as they are depending more on own vehicles in the absence of local trains. In Mumbai, petrol was priced at ₹89.02 for each litre while diesel cost ₹78.97 a litre on Sunday.The gradual rise in fuel prices in the city started from November 21 and it may cross ₹90 per litre in the coming week. On November 21, one litre of petrol was priced at ₹88.09 and diesel was priced at ₹77.34. On Saturday, petrol and diesel were priced at ₹88.81 and ₹78.66 for each litre, and on Friday these were priced at ₹88.58 and ₹78.38, respectively.Petrol Dealers Association stated they expect fuel prices to decrease in the coming days. “Earlier, fuel prices used to fluctuate on crude oil prices, but now the government has kept the policies aside. The government wants money and the fastest-earning money is through petrol pumps. We expect the prices to decrease in the coming days. During the entire lockdown period till November 15, the prices remained constant but now started increasing,” said M Venkatrao, president, Petrol Dealers Association. “The constant increase in the prices of fuel is not justified. The government should immediately work on controlling the prices. If it keeps increasing this way, then fuel prices will soon cross ₹90-mark.” said Dr Charu Jain, a Byculla resident.Citizens have also pointed that the price came when they have to depend on personal vehicles in the absence local trains. “Local train services are shut for the general public. One does not have a choice but to travel by personal vehicle. The government should work on controlling the price as people are already suffering financially due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Aamir Shaikh, a Bandra resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-fuel-price-hike-hits-motorists-in-the-absence-of-local-trains/story-M5vMw0Pjm1SF4QXaOMBStI.html

30-11-2020||Delhi||Final station: Pulp fiction on its last legs, say sellers||Back in the 1980s, most train journeys in north India were spent with Sudhir, Sunil, Vijay, or Keshav Pandit solving perplexing crime riddles or with stories about complex human relationships that were the mainstay of the fascinating Hindi pulp fiction created by its most notable authors such as Surendra Mohan Pathak, Ved Prakash Sharma and Gulshan Nanda. Published mostly on recycled thick paper, the novels were low-priced with outlandish titles and kitschy cover art. Long before the mobile phones came to the scene and water started selling in plastic bottles, these books were among the essential travel companions, especially on long train journeys. Besides their amazing popularity, these books had one more thing in common --majority of the sales used to come from book stalls on railway platforms. The genre, however, was struggling to survive with online entertainment taking the centre stage, but with train journeys becoming scarce due to restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, it seems to have received the final blow. The publishers of these books, who are based in Delhi and Meerut--- once the capital of Hindi pulp fiction—say their sales have dropped by 90% compared to pre-pandemic levels. “The coronavirus crisis could mean the end of our story; it was the long railway journeys that had given rise to this genre of fiction in the first place,” says Manish Jain, owner, Ravi Pocket Books, a firm set up by his father in 1965 during the heydays of the Hindi pulp fiction -- mostly racy noir thrillers peopled by spies, corrupt cops, conmen, seductresses, and heist-masters. These railways stalls had helped the publishers like Manish Jain sell millions of copies every year till the early 1990s, keeping the printing presses in east Delhi’s Shahdara busy day and night before the growing popularity of TV soap operas in the 1990s began to severely dent their sales. Over the past two decades, the number of publishers in Meerut and Delhi has come down from over 35 to about eight. Before the pandemic hit, the surviving publishers were bringing out roughly 7 lakh copies a year --- some new, but mostly old bestsellers. “Most of our readers were from UP, Bihar, Punjab, Haryana and MP, who travelled in general train compartments. We were selling about 6,000 copies a month of various titles before the pandemic. No long rail journeys mean no sale for us,” says Rakesh Jain, proprietor of Meerut-based Dheeraj Pocket Books, who has been publishing pulp fiction since 1962. According to Delhi Division of the railways, the combined footfalls at Old Delhi, New Delhi and Hazrat Nizamuddin have come down from 9.75 lakh daily before the pandemic to about 3.2 lakh — a fall of almost 70% . The situation in other parts of the country is much worse, with platforms, once a hive of activities, lying deserted. On Friday afternoon, there were a couple of customers browsing through books at Pankaj & Company, a bookstall at New Delhi railway station. There were a few passengers waiting for special trains on an otherwise empty platform. “ Our sales are down by 80%. I have run a bookstall at the New Delhi railway station for past 38 years, but have not seen platforms so deserted, ” says Manoj Jain who runs the bookstall. The stall has a shelf devoted to Hindi pulp fiction. “Earlier, I used to sell 200 titles every day, now I am lucky if I sell 200 in a month. I have hardly sold a dozen titles in the past few months,” he adds. Somit Banerjee, executive vice president, AH Wheeler, a British-era company which has over 325 stalls across the country on railway stations, says, most of their stalls have remained closed as there is hardly any business. “Many publishers such as Chandamama and Amar Chitra Katha, grew with us. There is no doubt that publishers of pulp fiction too thrived because of us. But now we are focusing on quality fiction,” says Banerjee. “There are about 5,500 people employed with our stalls”. The publishers say they are sitting on a large pile of unsold books. “Before the pandemic, we sold most of our pulp fiction titles on railway platforms in cities such as Lucknow, Varanasi, Ranchi, Patna, Mathura. We were managing to survive somehow, but now we are not sure how long we can continue to publish Hindi pulp fiction titles,” says Manoj Gupta, owner, Raja Pocket Books, a Delhi-based publisher. Gupta becomes cheerful as he takes a trip down the memory lane. “ I remember we had sold about 4 lakh copies of the Kanoon ka Beta by Ved Prakash Sharma in a couple of weeks. In fact, till the 1990s, we routinely sold about 2-3 lakh copies of our top writers, a figure many stalwarts of Hindi literature could not match,” says Gupta. The company set up by his father in 1967 has published some of the biggest names in pulp fiction such as Gulshan Nanda, Rajhans, Ved Prakash Sharma, Surinder Mohan Pathak. In the 1980s, his publishing house, he says, used to bring out 100 new titles. This was made possible by the prodigious output of pulp fiction writers. Most writers, Manoj Jain, says produced anything between 4 to 12 books in a year. “Some of them could deliver a manuscript on demand in 15 days flat,” says Jain. Delhi-based Anil Mohan has 259 titles to his credit. He admits the railway station and, to some extent bus terminals, helped writers like him survive. Like most writers of pulp fiction, he has many railway anecdotes to share. “Until the 1990s, whenever I travelled in north India, I would see many people reading my book in the compartment, and that is what kept us going,” says Mohan. Most of these writers do not get any royalties on the sale as they had sold their manuscripts for one-time payment that could range anything between Rs 50,000 to 3 lakh. “I got paid at least 50,000 for most of my books. I think the railway platforms book stalls had introduced books to millions who would otherwise never visit a bookstall and read a book. They created mass readership for our books,” says Mohan, who in the last week of November announced his new book, his first after five years. Railway vendors say with sale at stalls down like never before, they are finding it difficult to survive. “Our license fee should be revised and charged according to the footfalls at the stations for as long as the pandemic lasts,” says Ravinder Gupta, president, Akhil Bhartiya Railway Khan-Pan Licensees Welfare Association, an association of platform vendors, which also covers bookstalls. “Railway divisions have been asked to revise license fees for all catering stalls, including bookstalls as per decline in a number of outward passengers and trains. Bookstalls have been permitted to sell miscellaneous items, including Covid-related items such as sanitizers,” says Deepak Kumar, Chief Public Relations Officer (CPRO) Northern Railways. In the meanwhile, it is a bright sunny Saturday afternoon, and Anil Mohan is at his writing desk working on novel number 260. “The pandemic may have stopped trains, but my journey as a writer is far from over,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/final-station-pulp-fiction-on-its-last-legs-say-sellers/story-oDh6GoUK2ulHfCME7rSI9J.html
30-11-2020||Delhi||Covid has left students with uncertain future||Rising vaccinationalism, industry wars, and the use of unpublished interim data to declare vaccine successes are fuelling uncertainty about the safety, efficacy and affordability of potential coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines on which the world has pinned its collective hope to reboot businesses, education and travel sooner than later.Prime Minister Narendra’s Modi’s visit to three Covid-19 vaccine production centres in Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Pune will help reassure people that more than one vaccine will be available in India by early next year. “Vaccine development is in the final stage but we must not lower our guard… Our priority is to save every life. Once we have the vaccines, we will ensure they are delivered to everyone,” said Prime Minister Modi.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia last week said that schools in the Capital are unlikely to open until there is a vaccine. Schools and colleges countrywide have been shut since March because of the pandemic, which has led to irrevocable loss of study time for children, more so for those with no or limited access to digital learning tools.Four in every five children reported facing obstacles to learning, and three in four said they were stressed because of an uncertain future, ambiguity over going back to school, and loss of family livelihoods, according to a report by Save the Children titled A Generation at Stake: Protecting India’s Children from the impact of Covid-19, released on Friday.The report polled parents and children from 46 countries including India, where 1,598 parents and 989 children between ages 11 and 17 years from 11 states and two Union territories (Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir) were surveyed to identify their needs to help fill the gaps. The states included Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka and Telangana.Among migrants, 91% of households reported loss of income and 60% households reported they had no money to pay for food, which led to insecurity and domestic violence. Around 11% of children in the general group and 17% children in the migrants’ group reported violence at home during the pandemic.Economic setbacks for families led to one in 10 children saying they would not return to school or do not know whether they would return to school once the institutions reopen. “Our findings show that the economic shocks endured during the pandemic have led to a rise in violence against both adults and children, increase in domestic chores and caring duties, particularly for girls, and reduced mental health and well-being. The most vulnerable children are becoming the biggest victims of its social and economic impacts,” said Sudarshan Suchi, CEO, Save the Children.The report recommends providing psycho-social support to vulnerable children to help them catch up with learning levels and ensure continuity of education for all after schools reopen. Protection programmes, including schemes announced during the pandemic, need to be made accessible to eligible families and children, with special focus on migrant families irrespective of their native place or place of work, the report said.The developmental impact of school closure on children cannot also be ignored. “Beyond academics, schools provide a space for a child’s social and mental development. Schools are where we meet peers, make friends, learn to form relationships, negotiate, enjoy, support, compromise, find ourselves. Social interactions are essential for social and emotional development, this is where we form a large part of our value system. We must consider schooling holistically, in the context of academics and the development of life skills. Online education has addressed the academics part of it, but it’s the peer interface aspect where we are still struggling. This will continue till students come back to school,” said Dr Samir Parikh, director, mental health and behavioural sciences, Fortis Healthcare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/closure-of-schools-during-the-pandemic-has-caused-seriously-affected-learning/story-MncNNJFHwI6nOS6omiicdP.html
30-11-2020||Delhi||Agencies crack down on Covid-19 home isolation violators||A man who was isolating at home after testing positive for Covid-19 was found missing from his house in West Delhi’s Mohan Garden when a civil defence team checked on November 20. His family told the team that the man was out distributing invitation cards for a relative’s wedding. He is yet to be traced. Around 5km away, in Bindapur, at least two members of a family of four, who were supposed to be in home isolation, were allegedly found shopping in the local market. When the civil defence team found them on November 17, they said they had been cured. They had tested positive less than 10 days earlier and the nodal officer said there was no record of them being tested a second time. In Uttam Nagar, near Bindapur, a Covid-19 positive man was found missing from home isolation on November 20. When the field visitor questioned his mother about his location, the patient’s mother allegedly misbehaved with them.The police have registered first information reports (FIRs) against all these alleged violators under section 188 of IPC (disobedience to an order by government servant) which carries a maximum punishment of one month or fine of Rs200 or both.While the Delhi government did not share total figures pertaining to instances of violation of home isolation rules, senior officials in the revenue department asserted that such instances are negligible in proportion to the total number of people isolating at home which has helped the government keep the burden off hospitals even when the capital has witnessed three waves of Covid-19 surge.So far, around 250,000 people in Delhi have recovered in home isolation and as on Sunday 21,337 active Covid-19 patients in Delhi were in home isolation, government records showed.Among few other instances in October, a patient in Dwarka was found attending office in Gurugram, three patients from a family in Palam were found leaving home for evening walks in a local park, and in Janakpuri, a house with three Covid-19 patients was found locked.“The Covid-19 crisis in the city has also led to the formation of neighbourhood groups which are often helpful to patients with delivering essentials and also flag violations at the local level. Most violations are sorted out at the local level and some are flagged to the government officials. In some cases, government officials come across violations on their own during field visits. Generally, first-time minor violators are left with a warning. Cases of repeated violations and those of severe nature have led to FIRs,” said a senior official of the revenue department who did not wish to be identified.Currently, Covid-19 patients in Delhi are assigned 17 days of home isolation, during which teams of the district health department are supposed to periodically check on their health and location – both through phone calls and visits to their homes.Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot told HT: “Lakhs of people in Delhi have recovered in home isolation so far and several thousands are currently under home isolation. The home isolation model has succeeded in keeping the burden low on hospitals. People are aware of these facts and instances of violations are very few compared to the humongous scale of the model.”“To further strengthen the model, we ensure that teams call up patients and check on their health as well as the location from time to time. Teams are also entrusted with conducting physical checks occasionally. Such checks and balances were further scaled up earlier this month in the light of the spike in cases,” said Gahlot.Santosh Kumar Meena, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), under whose jurisdiction several cases have been filed in the recent days, said that such FIRs are registered whenever the district magistrate’s team brings such violations to the police’s notice. “The DM’s teams have a list of Covid-positive patients. They checks on these people and report violations to us. We take action in all such cases which are brought to our notice,” said Meena. But a lot many similar violations aren’t even brought to the police’s notice, allowing infected patients to visit crowded locations and mingle with unsuspecting people, said senior police officials. A journalist based in south Delhi’s Greater Kailash said when she and her family tested positive last month, they also got a carpenter tested since he was working for them. “Later, during a casual conversation, he revealed that he was going out to work just two-three days after being infected. He said that he did not show symptoms and needed to make the most during the wedding and the festive season,” said the woman who didn’t want to be identified. Resident Welfare Associations (RWA) said that it is not uncommon for them to come across such violations.“The discontinuation of the poster system has given patients the licence to not alert their neighbours about their infection. Earlier, relatives of patients were venturing out during infection period, now patients themselves are walking out,” said Rajiv Kakria, convenor of ‘Save Our City’ campaign, a collective of RWAs, NGOs and activists.Initially, the government used to stick posters outside residences of Covid-19 patients in home isolation. In October, the government had done away with the practise in the light of a petition filed in the Delhi high court which asserted that the posters were in conflict with right to privacy and often led to vigilantism by local resident welfare groups. The government had also sought opinions from experts and they had said that doing away with posters would reduce the stigma attached to the coronavirus disease.On November 3, the Delhi government told the high court that it does not paste such posters any longer.Kakria, who is also a member of the Greater Kailash-1 RWA, said that he himself had seen an infected person loitering out in the neighbourhood during a period he was to be in home quarantine. “It was only after he recovered that he casually mentioned to me that he was infected and assigned home isolation. Until then, we didn’t know of his infection and he was roaming outside carefree,” said Kakria. Jugal Kishore, director and professor of community medicine at Safdarjang Hospital, said the trend was “very dangerous”. “If they could go out while being infected, we could as well tell them that they have been given treatment and they can get back to work. They need to understand that this is a communicable disease and they are exposing others to risk. If word of legal action against a few such offenders goes out, it can help control this problem,” said Kishore.He said that the noticed pasted outside homes of patients was a double-edged sword. “Patients and professionals had rightly pointed out the stigma attached to the measure. But now we are seeing how the absence of such a measure means the neighbours are not able to keep a watch,” said Kishore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/agencies-crack-down-on-covid-19-home-isolation-violators/story-GMKUM0vVInnfHJ0imLRQYI.html
30-11-2020||Delhi||Farmers announce blocking highways connecting Delhi with Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Faridabad||Agitated over the allotment of Sant Nirankari Ground for their protest, instead of Ramlila Maidan, farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders on Sunday announced that they will gherao the capital by blocking three highways connecting the capital to Gurugram, Ghaziabad and Faridabad. Till Sunday, only Singhu border and Tikri border were blocked by the farmers. The farmer groups from Punjab and Haryana, who had marched up to Delhi on Friday but were not allowed to enter the city, have been camping at Singhu (Delhi-Haryana) border and Tikri border for the past three days. On the same day, the police offered the protestors Sant Nirankari ground to continue their agitation but the farmers refused the offer asking for Ramlila Maidan, which is closer to the Lutyens’ Delhi.On Sunday, holding a press conference at Singhu border, farmer leader Surjeet Singh Phul said they have decided that instead of going to the Burari ground, they will block three other highways leading to Delhi -- Jaipur-Delhi highway that connects Gurugram to Delhi, Hapur-Delhi highway that connects Delhi with Ghaziabad and Mathura-Delhi highway that connects Faridabad to Delhi.Phul said, “Burari ground is an open jail and we will never accept to assemble there. On Sunday, a group of farmers from Uttarakhand who had reached Delhi were taken by the police to Burari ground when they said they want to go to Jantar Mantar. We refuse to go to Burari. We have enough ration to survive for at least four months,” he said.Phul also said that the farmers will allow none of the political leaders to use their stage to politicise their cause. “Regardless of the party, we will allow no politician to address from our platform. We’ve been agitating in Punjab for the past two months and we did not allow any political leader to interfere even there,” he added.A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said concerned district units have been informed about farmers’ plan to gherao city. “Proper arrangements are being ensured to minimize the inconvenience to the public. Our teams are assessing the situation and a traffic advisory will be issued to alert commuters, if required. The developments are being closely monitored,” the officer said.Senior police officers at Singhu border interacted with the farmer leaders on Sunday. Joint commissioner of police (northern range) Surender Singh Yadav said, “We requested the farmer groups to remain peaceful as they have been for the past two days. Law and order arrangements are being adequately maintained,” Singh said.At the Burari ground, tents were erected and lights were installed, making space for the protestors to come there and continue their agitation. Small groups of protestors even visited the site on Sunday but returned after seeing less than 100 farmers there.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya, under whose jurisdiction the Sant Nirankari Ground falls, said a police control room has been set up at Sant Nirankari ground in Burari, to facilitate the farmers and ensure proper arrangements. “We have over 500 Delhi Police officials and paramilitary personnel deployed here. Proper arrangements have been made to facilitate farmers who reach here,” Arya said.The border blockage also resulted in traffic snarls in many parts of Delhi. Traffic police posted real-time traffic situations to alert commuters. In one of its advisories issued Sunday evening, traffic police tweeted, “Singhu border is still closed from both sides. Please take alternate route. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk and GT Karnal Road.Traffic is very very heavy. Please avoid outer ring road from Signature bridge to Rohini & vice versa, GT Karnal Road, NH 44 and Singhu borders.” (sic)Alerting about the situation due to the blocked Tikri border, traffic police tweeted, “Tikri border is closed for any Traffic Movement. Available open borders to Haryana are following -- Jharoda, Dhansa, Daurala Jhatikera, Badusari, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-announce-blocking-highways-connecting-delhi-with-ghaziabad-gurugram-and-faridabad/story-zK7dWGC3DJfIqb1EFRPvAP.html
30-11-2020||Delhi||Blocked borders fuel concerns of rising price of essential items in Delhi||Barricades, clashes, and a group of determined farmers blocking Delhi’s borders with Haryana, waiting for their grievances to be heard, has hit supplies of fruits and vegetable to the Capital. Traders, however, said there is no shortage yet. But the ripples of the protest is likely to show in the coming days, they warn.It is mostly wholesale supply that has taken a hit with hundreds of trucks not being able to enter the city. According to the Azadpur Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Azadpur, supply in the market dropped by 50-60% in the last two days with trucks from Punjab and Haryana unable to reach the market. Aadil Ahmad Khan, chairman of Azadpur APMC, said, “We usually get 2,000-3,000 trucks in the market. But only 666 trucks arrived on Friday and around 1,000 on Saturday. The supply has been affected by 50-60% in the past few days and will be impacted further if the protest is not called off. The government should talk to the farmers and find a solution. The problem is the same at Okhla mandi as well.”Traders at Azadpur market said the supply of potato, apple and other seasonal fruits has been affected, as these largely come from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. Trucks with fruits and vegetable supply are stuck at NH-1  and NH-10, the two main links between Haryana and Delhi, at Singhu and Tikri borders, hitting supplies of essentials in Delhi.Meeta Ram Kriplani, president of the Chamber of Association of Fruits and Vegetable traders at Azadpur, said, “Vegetable supply has fallen by 50% and fruits by 70%. The goods are stuck on the highway. These are all perishable items. Vegetables and fruits are supplied all across the country from here. It will impact the business.”While some traders said they are getting supply from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and trying to get bring in goods stuck at the borders using smaller vehicles, others said these perishable items wouldn’t last long. Delhi gets most of its milk and vegetable supplies from Haryana and the situation is likely to get worse in the coming days if the farmers’ agitation continues.“Vehicles are parked on both sides of the road, stretching out for nearly three kilometres,” says Naresh Kumar, a truck driver from Himachal Pradesh. His truck, loaded with apples, has been stranded near the Kundli border for the past two days.Charan Singh, CEO of the Rohtak Vita Milk Plant, said farmers were supplying them 1.10 lakh litres of milk every day as before. However, after consumption of 50 ,000 litres per day at the Rohtak plant, the remaining 60,000 litres sent to the Kundli plant for making milk powder was instead being sent to Pehowa in Kurukshetra because of the blockades. “Our transportation cost and other expenditure has increased,” he added.However, even as an advisory was issued by Sonepat police sometime back asking travellers to avoid NH44 as farmers had blocked it and use NH-71A to reach Delhi via Gurugram, Buana, Narela and Safiyabad, Rajshree Singh, Haryana IGP traffic, told Hindustan Times that there was no blockade anywhere from Ambala to Rai. Police personnel, however, had been monitoring the situation after traffic jams had been reported from Rai, she added.Mohd Sayeed, who deals in potatoes and apples at Okhla Agriculture Produce Market Committee , said that apples are anyway in short supply this year due to the Covid pandemic. “We were expecting supply last week, but the trucks got stuck due to snowfall. Now due to the farmers’ protest, it is going to get further delayed.”Onion trader at Okhla, Haji Yamin, too voiced apprehensions. “Currently, there is no problem at , although we are getting 10-15% less stock. We source onions from Alwar. The ongoing protest has scared the farmers in neighbouring states, who earlier used to come to the mandi directly to sell their produce. Very few farmers from Rajasthan and other neighbouring states are coming to Delhi, as they fear that they will get stuck at the Delhi borders,” Yamin, who is the president of the onion traders’ association at Okhla APMC said.But some traders at APMCs in Delhi are working to maintain the supply chain. Nand Gopal, a trader at Azadpur APMC, said, “Trucks are taking a detour and entering Delhi from Gurugram and other borders. This will not affect the cost of the goods much. But if the situation persists, then it will lead to a problem.” At Ghazipur mandi, traders said the supply of potato and other vegetables has dropped. “If the situation continues, it will be a huge problem. For the past two days, supply in the market is down by 30-40%,” said Ashok Khera, a vegetable trader at Ghazipur. So far there has been no increase in retail prices of fruits and vegetables, as there is currently no shortage of fruits and vegetables in the Capital. Suraj Singh, area manager of Honey Money Top, “We were anticipating shortage of fruits and vegetables in the mandis. But so far it hasn’t happened. Therefore, there is no increase in retail price.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/blocked-borders-fuel-concerns-of-rising-price-of-essential-items-in-capital/story-LoE9mAmLUayo5BHNzLEeSL.html
30-11-2020||City||Andolan belongs to entire country, not just Punjab, says Charuni||Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU, Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni, who had led the Haryana farmers marching towards Delhi to protest against the three Central farm laws, said the ongoing agitation is not just of the Punjab farmers and belongs to the farming community throughout the country. “Farmers from several states are participating in the protest. We have had to face several difficulties and criminal cases were registered against us but it is worrisome that some farmer leaders from Punjab are saying that this agitation is being led by farmers of Punjab only,” the BKU chief said.Urging farmer leaders not to ignore the struggle of farmers from Haryana, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, who are camping in Delhi for the past couple of days and facing FIRs to reach Delhi on the call of Sayunkt Kisan Morcha, Charuni said, “Terming this national-level movement as Punjab’s agitation will only weaken this Andolan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/andolan-belongs-to-entire-country-not-just-punjab-says-charuni/story-MjYsHwu1PcQel5SaJWHTsM.html
30-11-2020||Chandigarh||Khattar’s ignorance towards farmers’ movement shocking, disturbing: Hooda||Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday described as “shocking and disturbing” chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s reported statement that Haryana farmers were not involved in the current agitation against the farm laws. “The chief minister should clarify if he does not consider the agitating farmers as residents of Haryana? If the farmers of Haryana are not part of the movement, then who did the government lathi-charge in Pipli? Who are the people who were detained by Haryana Police before their Delhi march? Who where are the thousands of farmers against whom the Haryana government has filed cases,” Hooda questioned. The former CM said “the ignorance of Khattar towards such a big movement is shocking and disturbing” and that the state government should know that the farmers of Haryana and Punjab have stood shoulder to shoulder in this movement. “They are also getting support from the farmers of UP, Rajasthan and other states. Ignoring them is an insult to those who work hard to ensure food on our tables. As a responsible Opposition, we fully support the demands of the farmers,” said Hooda.Meanwhile, Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) president Kumri Selja demanded the withdrawal of cases registered against the agitating farmers and the release of all detained farmers. The HPCC chief said the Centre should hold unconditional talks with the farmers. Haryana Congress leaders said the entire nation stands with the farmers and will fight till the government concedes to the genuine and lawful demands of the farmers. “Until the farmers win this battle, we stand firmly with the demands of the farmers. The attitude adopted by the government to crush the movement is completely undemocratic as every citizen and every class has the right to demonstrate peacefully for their just demands in democracy,” Hooda said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/khattar-s-ignorance-towards-farmers-movement-shocking-disturbing-hooda/story-YdgVKnNW6zBUh7mPYWyfoI.html
30-11-2020||Chandigarh||Blockade of Haryana highways hits supplies to Delhi||The blockade of National Highway (NH) 1 and NH10, the two main links between Haryana and Delhi, at Singhu and Tikri borders for the past two days, has hit supplies of essential commodities, especially vegetables, fruits and milk to the Capital.As Delhi gets most of its milk and vegetables from Haryana, the situation is likely to get worse in the coming days if the farmers’ agitation continues. This will also affect the connectivity of northern states to the national capital. Hundreds of vehicles, carrying essential items, are stuck in the jams on the borders and have been unable to reach Delhi.“Vehicles are parked on both sides of the road, stretching out for nearly three kilometres,” says Naresh Kumar, a truck driver from Himachal Pradesh. His truck, loaded with apples, has been stranded near the Kundli border for the past two days.Delhi’s largest wholesale fruit and vegetable market, Azadpur mandi, has also been impacted by the blockade.“On Friday, we received 2,800 tonnes of fruits instead of regular supplies of 5,500 tonnes; and 5,600 tonnes of vegetables instead of regular supplies of 6,500 tonnes,” said Adil Ahmad Khan, chairman, Azadpur Agriculture Produce Market Committee, while interacting with the media in Delhi. Now most people are travelling on link roads and expressways from Rai in Sonepat district to reach Delhi, but police officials say that people traveling on the expressway are also encountering long traffic jams and it may turn worse in the coming days as farmers from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have also started their movement to join their counterparts from Punjab and Haryana.“After waiting for two days in Chandigarh, we have to reach Delhi by traveling about 100km extra via Mathura road,” said Vikash Verma of Delhi, who had gone to Amritsar along with his family.Meanwhile, at Ambala, things are yet to return to normal as police blocked two borders at Shambhu (Ambala-Patiala) and Sadopur (Ambala-Chandigarh) on Thursday and Friday. Trucks remained lined up on both sides of NH-44.Several migrant groups from Ludhiana were also forced to cross over to Ambala to catch trains and private buses from the Cantonment.HT had spoken to a family of 10 members, including four children, who remained stranded at the border after missing a train for Lucknow.An elderly woman from Ambala who was crossing the border from Patiala on Thursday, said, “They don’t care what people like us have to face.”The borders, however, were opened for farmers and commuters. Talking to Hindustan Times, Haryana IGP Traffic Rajshree Singh said that there is no blockade on NH44 from Ambala to Rai. But now there reports of traffic jams near Rai of Sonepat and cops have been deputed to monitor the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/blockade-of-haryana-highways-hits-supplies-to-delhi/story-lJcQyyHnozNZ2JJPFNYjWI.html

30-11-2020||Gurugram||Old Tehsil building — a link to the colonial era — to turn into Mewati Museum||Located along the erstwhile Delhi-Alwar Road, the colonial-era Old Tehsil building in Nuh is expected to get a fresh lease of life with deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala announcing plans to turn the heritage structure into a ‘Mewati Museum’. Chautala had shared plans for the building last Sunday, while addressing a farmers’ gathering in Nuh. The building was constructed by the British in 1872 and is currently being used as an administrative space by patwaris (rural registrars). In 2018, the state department of museums and archaeology had also initiated the process of taking the structure under protection, but the process is yet to be completed. While the preliminary notification was issued two years ago, the final notification is yet to be issued. Once converted, this will be the first government museum in both Nuh and Gurugram. Banani Bhattacharyya, deputy director, Department of Archaeology and Museums, said that the Old Tehsil building is a heritage structure dating to 19th century and demonstrated colonial-era architecture. “The building was constructed in 1872 during the colonial period, as per the details mentioned in records. The construction unit comprises stones and lakhori bricks, whereas lime-surkhi has been used as mortar and plaster. Lakhori bricks have been used in the construction of the building in the central portion and along the arches towards the entrance, whereas stones are used in the bottom,” said Bhattacharyya. The building served as the administrative centre for five tehsils — Gurgaon, Firozpur Jhirka, Nuh, Palwal and Rewari — since its construction. The then-Gurgaon district was rearranged into the five tehsils in 1861, as per the district gazetteer. Locals say that an inscription bearing the year of construction of the structure, placed at the entrance gate, has now disappeared. Over the years, the premises of the tehsil have been whitewashed and a number of modifications made. Two years ago, efforts of demolishing the structure were stopped after a civil suit seeking a permanent injunction on construction and demolition activities was filed.Matloob Khan, 65, the petitioner, said that plans were afoot to demolish the building and make way for newer constructions. “Through newspaper reports, I learned that the government wanted to come up with flats on the premises of the tehsil. As a responsible citizen, I decided to approach the courts so that the destruction of this historical place could be averted. Eventually, the department intervened and the district administration was asked to ensure that the place is left as it is,” said Khan, a professor who lives in the vicinity of the tehsil. The building has fallen into disrepair over the years, due to poor upkeep. Many markers of the building’s heritage ]have been damaged by humans and nature alike. A huge wooden gateway that served as the entrance to the premises was removed in the early 1990s. “There used to be a massive wooden gate at the entrance. I remember seeing it. At some point in time, it was removed. The overall security apparatus existed for a long time. Santris (guards) used to sound a bell/alarm every half hour until a few decades ago,” recalls Khan. The building is spread over 12 kanals and 8 marlas (roughly 2 acres), as per local records. It comprises 30-40 rooms spread across the perimeter of the building. Arches are a recurring element across the rooms and the buildings. The central portion of the building used to serve as the treasury during the British rule and remains locked at present. This portion also houses a jail. In one of the rooms, an abandoned old boat sits like a souvenir from the past. Locals claimed that the boat was used for rescue efforts during floods in 1976. The original court structure where magistrates used to carry out proceedings is also intact. While the interiors of the building are replete with such objects, the outer portion gives a clearer picture of the original architecture, with trees growing through its walls. Most locals in the area said that steps need to be taken for the upkeep of the building. Umar Mohammad, 60, a resident, said that the government could preserve the memorabilia associated with the building. “There used to be a huge wooden gate at the entrance, some 15 feet tall. A massive hand-held curtain used to be present at the court earlier. The government can showcase such remnants to make people understand the history of the region,” said Mohammad. Khan said that the building was a witness to the colonial past and needed to be preserved for the future generations. “It should become a heritage building or a museum with antiquities from the region. Mewat doesn’t have a museum. Turning the building into one can start a conversation around the history of the region.” Bhattacharyya said that the department had been apprised about the proposal of converting the building to a museum. Welcoming the move, she said that the building was an important component of Mewat’s history and needed to be preserved. “The tehsil building is a part of history. It holds an important place in the history of Mewat. Besides, the history and culture of the region can be demonstrated if a museum is made,” said Bhattacharyya. Bhattacharyya said that the department had earlier proposed that conservation plans for the tehsil building could focus on children, particularly girls. “There is a paucity of good schools and libraries in Nuh. We had earlier suggested that whenever the tehsil building is refurbished, we could keep the focus on children. If a museum is made, it can be imagined as a museum for children with libraries and other aspects. This would also encourage awareness and curiosity among children towards their area history,” said Bhattacharyya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/old-tehsil-building-a-link-to-the-colonial-era-to-turn-into-mewati-museum/story-pVVzPfWiaMXgb67ASZkgSK.html
30-11-2020||World||Moderna vaccine 94.1% effective, seeks US, EU||Moderna will apply for US and European emergency authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine after full results from a late-stage study showed it was 94.1% effective with no serious safety concerns, it said.Moderna also reported that its vaccine’s efficacy rate was consistent across age, race, ethnicity and gender demographics as well as having a 100% success rate in preventing severe cases of a disease that has killed nearly 1.5 million people. The filing sets Moderna’s product up to be the second vaccine likely to receive US emergency use authorisation this year following a shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech which had a 95% efficacy rate.“We believe that we have a vaccine that is very highly efficacious. We now have the data to prove it,” Moderna Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks said. “We expect to be playing a major part in turning around this pandemic.”Of the 196 people who contracted Covid-19 out of over 30,000 volunteers, 185 had received a placebo and 11 got the vaccine. Moderna reported 30 severe cases, all in the placebo group, which means the vaccine was 100% effective against severe cases. In addition to filing its US application, Moderna said it would seek conditional nod from European Medicines Agency, which is reviewing its data.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted on Monday it would do everything possible to find the animal origins of Covid-19. “We want to know the origin and we will do everything to know the origin,” he said, urging critics who have accused the UN agency of handing the reins of the probe to China to stop “politicising” the issue.“We need to know the origin of this virus because it can help us to prevent future outbreaks,” he said. “There is nothing to hide. We want to know the origin, and that’s it.”He also urged Brazil to be “very, very serious” about the worrisome rise in virus cases.US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci, meanwhile, warned that America should prepare for a “surge upon a surge” in coronavirus cases as millions of travellers return home after the Thanksgiving holiday. “We may see a surge upon a surge” in two or three weeks,” he told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-vaccine-94-1-effective-seeks-us-eu/story-Ik1FAv4bEksRDbw7Ok9dKO.html

The rally, held at a makeshift venue after the government blocked most parts of Multan, also saw the political debut of Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, the youngest child of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, representing her brother Bilawal, who has been self isolating after testing positive for Covid-19. Aseefa said she would stand by her brother “every step of the way”.She called the Imran Khan government a “selected” government. “Despite the cruelty and oppression by the selected [government], so many of you have gathered here. This selected [government] will have to go!”PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz welcomed Aseefa into politics and said the entry of women was a good sign for Pakistan. Earlier, speaking to a local TV channel, Maryam attacked Prime Minister Imran Khan, calling him a “puppet prime minister” who should have “some courage” to question the country’s top spy agency – Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) – as to why it is tapping his telephone calls. She was responding to Khan’s admission that he was aware that the agencies tap his phone calls. “The ISI taps phone of the prime minister and others. If any guts left in this puppet (Imran Khan) he should take on the ISI on this matter,” she said.Pakistan’s cultural capital Lahore has once again topped the list of world’s most polluted cities. “Lahore ranks the most polluted city in the world,” according to air pollution data released by the US Air Quality Index on Monday. Lahore reported a particulate matter (PM) rating of 423. Pakistan’s financial capital Karachi ranked at 7 on the AQI. New Delhi came in second with a PM of 229, while Nepal’s capital Kathmandu ranked the third-worst city with a PM of 178.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joint-oppn-holds-rally-maryam-chides-imran/story-GxqyxyPH2OuvPITZRUIwvM.html
30-11-2020||World||Iran official alleges Israel ‘remotely killed’ scientist||A top Iranian security official on Monday accused Israel of using “electronic devices” to remotely kill a scientist who founded the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear programme in the 2000s.Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the country’s Supreme National Security Council, made the comment at the funeral for Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, where Iran’s defence minister General Amir Hatami separately vowed to continue the man’s work “with more speed and more power”. Israel, long suspected of killing Iranian nuclear scientists over the last decade, repeatedly has declined to comment on the attack.Fakhrizadeh headed Iran’s so-called AMAD programme, which Israel and the West have alleged was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency says that “structured programme” ended in 2003. US intelligence agencies concurred with that assessment in a 2007 report.Israel insists Iran still maintains the ambition of developing nuclear weapons, pointing to Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and research into other technologies. Iran long has maintained its nuclear programme is peaceful. Shamkhani’s remarks drastically change the story of Fakhrizadeh’s killing on Friday. Authorities initially said a truck exploded and then gunmen opened fire on the scientist, killing him. State TV’s English-language broadcaster Press TV reported earlier Monday that a weapon recovered from the scene of the attack bore “the logo and specifications of the Israeli military industry.” State TV’s Arabic-language channel, Al-Alam, claimed the weapons used were “controlled by satellite,” a claim also made on Sunday by the semi-official Fars news agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-official-alleges-israel-remotely-killed-scientist/story-Ik9fBaOa4NRoT9ib2GAxnN.html

30-11-2020||World||‘Need to know origin of novel coronavirus, let’s not politicize probe’: WHO chief Tedros||The World Health Organization insisted Monday it would do everything possible to find the animal origins of Covid-19, insisting that knowledge was vital to preventing future outbreaks.“We want to know the origin and we will do everything to know the origin,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.He insisted the UN health agency was intent on getting to the bottom of the mystery, and urged critics who have accused it of handing the reins of the probe to China to stop “politicising” the issue. “WHO’s position is very, very clear. We need to know the origin of this virus, because it can help us prevent future outbreaks,” Tedros said.The United States, which with more than 262,000 deaths is the country hardest hit by the pandemic, has been harshly critical of the WHO’s handling of the crisis and has accused it of kowtowing to China and of dragging its feet on investigating how the outbreak first started.Other critics have also voiced concern that the agency may have allowed China to dictate the terms of an international investigation into the origins of the virus, which first surfaced in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Since then, more than 1.46 million people have died and nearly 63 million have been infected worldwide.The WHO has for months been working to send a team of international experts, including epidemiologists and animal health specialists, to China to help probe the animal origin of the novel coronavirus pandemic and how the virus first crossed over to humans.The organisation sent an advance team to Beijing in July to lay the groundwork for the international probe.But it has remained unclear when the larger team of scientists would be able to travel to China to begin epidemiological studies to try to identify the first human cases and their source of infection.Last week, the WHO’s emergencies chief Michael Ryan said the agency was hoping to send the international team to Wuhan “as soon as possible”.Tedros meanwhile rejected on Monday criticism over lacking transparency on the probe, stressing that the names of the experts on the team and the terms of reference had been made public.“There is nothing to hide. We want to know the origin. I don’t want to have any confusion on that.”Scientists initially believed the killer virus jumped from animals to humans at a market selling exotic animals for meat in the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected late last year.But experts now think the market may not have been the origin of the outbreak, but rather a place where it was amplified.It is widely assumed that the virus originally came from bats, but the intermediate animal host that transmitted it between bats and humans remains unknown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/need-to-know-origin-of-novel-coronavirus-let-s-not-politicize-probe-who-chief-tedros/story-Y8oY6sE49RKeu4jSXwFRwM.html
30-11-2020||World||Joe Biden, Kamala Harris to receive first intelligence briefing Monday||President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will begin receiving the nation’s most sensitive secrets Monday as they prepare to assume office on Jan 20.The pair are to receive the highly classified Presidential Daily Brief, a summary of the most important information collected across the US intelligence community that is prepared and delivered by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Outgoing President Donald Trump approved the briefings for Biden last Tuesday, a day after his administration approved the formal transition process to his successor.It was not immediately clear how Biden and Harris would receive the briefing, which is tailored to the needs and interests of its top recipient. For Trump, that has meant a focus on visuals and a preference for paper. His predecessor, Barack Obama, came to embrace the briefing being presented on a modified secure tablet. Given its sensitivity, the leather-bound briefing is usually delivered in person by a career member of the intelligence community, though Trump has increasingly let that process lapse.“On a given day, I might read about terrorist cells in Somalia or unrest in Iraq or the fact that the Chinese or Russians were developing new weapons systems,” Obama wrote in his memoir. “Nearly always, there was mention of potential terrorist plots, no matter how vague, thinly sourced, or unactionable—a form of due diligence on the part of the intelligence community, meant to avoid the kind of second-guessing that had transpired after 9/11.”He added that his wife, Michelle, called it “The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.”Much of the information in the PDB requires no immediate response, Obama wrote, “The goal was to have a continuously up-to-date sense of all that was roiling in the world, the large, small, and sometimes barely perceptible shifts that threatened to upset whatever equilibrium we were trying to maintain.”The PDB, as it is known, is just one component of the intelligence briefings presented to an incoming administration. Biden and Harris will also be able to receive in-depth subject matter briefings from intelligence experts, as well as a run-down of extremely classified covert operations underway during the Trump administration, the latter necessary to determine if they want to maintain or modify those operations once they assume office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-kamala-harris-to-receive-first-intelligence-briefing-monday/story-KxsXudmIn8sNLynx9C0QsM.html

The White House led the news media on a tour of the decor on Monday before a reception for the volunteers.“Over the past four years I have had the honor to travel to some of our nation’s most beautiful landmarks and meet some of the most compassionate and patriotic American citizens,” the first lady said in a written statement. “From coast to coast, the bond that all American’s share is an appreciation for our traditions, values, and history, which were the inspiration behind the decorations this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/america-the-beautiful-is-white-house-theme-for-christmas/story-OFCS5GuiK9zsOt8eAcceNI.html

The official spoke on condition of anonymity as the official was not authorized to publicly discuss the trip.Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates cut ties to Qatar in June 2017 as part of a wider political dispute over Doha’s support of Islamists, its relationship with Iran and other matters. The four countries also launched an economic boycott, stopping Qatar Airways flights from using their airspace, closing off the small country’s sole land border with Saudi Arabia and blocking its ships from using their ports.Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The country is also home to the sprawling Al-Udeid Air Base, which hosts some 10,000 American troops and the forward headquarters of the US military’s Central Command.This may be Kushner’s last trip to the region as President Donald Trump has only a few more weeks in office.

30-11-2020||World||The first pets of America: From Kennedy horses to Obama’s dogs||President-elect Joe Biden will be bringing with him the first shelter dog to White House come January, news which has lifted the spirits of all dog-loving Americans, maybe even across party lines. Pets have always been a bipartisan topic and it started trending again on Monday after news of Biden injuring his foot while playing with his dog Major surfaced online.Here are some other pets who spent time at the White House:Barack Obama’s dogs Bo and SunnyObama in his 2008 victory speech kept his word to his daughters by giving them the pet he had promised if his campaign won. “I love you both more than you can imagine. You have earned the puppy that is coming with us!” Obama jokingly announced to an exuberant crowd at Chicago’s Grant Park. Four years later, after he won his re-election bid, the Obamas welcomed another canine to the White House. Michelle Obama in her eponymous podcast has also talked about living vicariously through her daughters as pets were not allowed in her childhood home.George Bush’s cat IndiaAccording to the presidential pet museum archives, President George Bush and First lady Laura Bush adopted India sometime in late 1991. Bush owned the Texas Rangers baseball team and their beloved black cat was named after Texas Rangers player Rubén Sierra, who was dubbed as ‘El Indio’. The name created quite the furore in Kerala in 2004, where protestors burned an effigy of the President over his choice of name. India passed away just two weeks before the Obamas were scheduled to move into the White House.George HW Bush’s dog RangerBush senior loved pets just as much as his son. The former president’s dog Ranger was known at the White House for having the best puppy dog eyes that showed up when begging for treats. Ranger was much loved by the White House staff and had to be put on a weight loss program. Bush Senior sent out a memo to his staff asking them to refrain from feeding Ranger. In the letter, the late president wrote that all offices should take a “formal pledge”. “WE AGREE NOT TO FEED RANGER. WE WILL NOT GIVE HIM ANY BISCUITS. WE WILL NOT GIVE HIM FOOD OF ANY KIND,” the pledge read. Ranger was also given his own escort to help him stick to his weight reduction program.President Kennedy’s horsesThe Kennedy family had a rather unusual collection of pets. Jacqueline Kennedy was an equestrian and she loved riding on the White House grounds. John F Kennedy’s daughter Caroline had her own pony Macaroni, and according to the John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, the president of Pakistan gifted Kennedy a horse named Sardar sometime in 1962.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-first-pets-of-america-from-kennedy-horses-to-obama-s-dogs/story-wik8zeuUkjayTv44amNHlJ.html

The outgoing president asked why Brian Kemp, a Republican, didn’t use his “emergency powers” to overrule the decision of the secretary of state. “Why won’t Governor @BrianKempGA, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes. It will be a “goldmine” of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state....,” Trump tweeted. Why won’t Governor @BrianKempGA, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes. It will be a "goldmine" of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state....The tweet was flagged by Twitter, saying “this claim about election fraud is disputed” as it has done to many of Trump’s posts in the past.The Republican leader suggested officials check the number of envelopes against the number of ballots, claiming that they “may just find” more ballots than envelopes received. “So simple, and so easy to do. Georgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done!” he added.In the run-up to the 2020 presidential elections, Trump vehemently opposed mail-in ballots on the basis of unproven claims of election fraud. As compared to Republicans, more registered Democrats had requested for postal ballots for the elections in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.It directly reflected on the results when counting of mail-in ballots pushed Joe Biden ahead of Trump in key states, helping the Democrat reclaim the “Blue Wall”. Since then, Trump and his allies have been crying foul over the election results.

Payments will also be made to improve animal health, focusing initially on fighting disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-to-pay-farmers-for-sustainable-farming-methods-after-brexit/story-d9KyQK7WD2FxSTMC09KUBL.html
30-11-2020||World||Scotland Yard probes role of British mercenaries in fight against LTTE||Scotland Yard’s War Crimes Team, which is part of its Counter-Terrorism Command, has launched an investigation into the role of British mercenaries in fighting the LTTE rebels in Sri Lanka during the 1980s. The Metropolitan Police said it has received a referral in March concerning alleged war crimes leading to a scoping exercise, which has now been expanded into an investigation. It follows revelations that a private security company, Keenie Meenie Services (KMS), trained an elite unit of the Sri Lankan police called the Special Task Force (STF) in the 1980s to fight the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels. The references emerged in a book by UK-based investigative journalist Phil Miller earlier this year, based on declassified UK government documents and freedom of information requests. The book, ‘Keenie Meenie: The British Mercenaries Who Got Away With War Crimes’, had also claimed that the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) received air support from some of these for-hire UK pilots. “We can confirm that the Met’s War Crimes Team - part of its Counter Terrorism Command – received a referral in March concerning war crimes alleged to have been committed by British Mercenaries in Sri Lanka during the 1980s,” a Met Police statement said. “Following receipt of the referral, the War Crimes Team began a scoping exercise into the matter and have subsequently launched an investigation. We are not prepared to discuss any further details of what remains an active and ongoing police investigation into this matter,” it said. Keenie Meenie, from the title of the book, is thought to be an Arabic slang for covert activities and was run by a retired colonel, Jim Johnson – a former Special Air Services (SAS) commander, who had conducted secret missions in Yemen and Oman. Johnson’s counter-insurgency experience came to the attention of then Sri Lankan President Junius Jayewardene at the start of Sri Lanka’s civil war in 1983, when the Anglophile leader was looking for British aid to defeat the Tamil Tigers. Britain refused to officially send troops to help Jayewardene, fearing it would have jeopardised “substantial commercial and defence” deals. “I welcome this police investigation which is long overdue. Much of the evidence against KMS is contained in British Foreign Office files which were kept classified for 30 years, allowing some senior KMS figures to pass away without ever facing justice,” said Miller, in reference to the Met Police probe. “More evidence is coming to light that shows KMS were linked to atrocities not just against Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority but also against the Sinhalese majority, so there are lots of questions to be asked about the extent of this British company’s role in Sri Lanka’s turbulent history,” he said. The Tamil Information Centre (TIC) in London had sent a detailed dossier of evidence to the Met Police earlier this year. “War crimes committed by the Sri Lankan state, ably assisted by British mercenaries caused death, displacement and massive suffering to the Tamil people. “All of those who committed those war crimes should be brought to justice. We hope that this investigation is the first step to ultimately a successful prosecution,” said Anuraj Sinna, a director of the Tamil Information Centre. The KMS personnel are alleged to have flown helicopter gunships that were involved in attacks on Tamil civilians. The company’s staff also trained Sri Lankan paramilitaries and commandos as well as giving operational advice at the highest level. Paul Heron, a solicitor at the Public Interest Law Centre which is representing TIC, said: “This is the first investigation that we know of into British mercenaries operating overseas and alleged to have committed war crimes. The KMS was involved in covert activities across the planet, from Nicaragua to Sri Lanka.” The KMS came into being in the 1970s with battle-hardened British veterans and, according to Miller’s book based on previously classified accounts, were active in controversial operations around the world with the UK governments of the time unable to fully control them. The IPKF is believed to have received air support from these for-hire British pilots, despite Indian diplomats publicly condemning the presence of UK mercenaries in Sri Lanka. According to the book, India’s secret use of British mercenaries lasted for four months after the Indo-Lanka accord was signed between former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Jayewardene in 1987. The book also traces the involvement of British mercenaries in atrocities against Tamil civilians that occurred prior to the arrival of the IPKF. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) ran a military campaign for a separate Tamil homeland in the northern and eastern provinces of the island nation for nearly 30 years before its collapse in 2009 after the Sri Lankan Army killed its supreme leader Velupillai Prabhakaran. Sri Lanka’s human rights record, particularly over the impunity enjoyed by law enforcement officers, has been the subject of international condemnation. The UN Human Rights Council has called for an international probe into the alleged war crimes during the military conflict with the LTTE. According to the government figures, around 20,000 people are missing due to various conflicts including the 30-year-long separatist war with Lankan Tamils in the north and east which claimed at least 100,000 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scotland-yard-probes-role-of-british-mercenaries-in-fight-against-ltte/story-UqZtv96CmMB8dIugspgQ0M.html

30-11-2020||World||Joe Biden looks to fill out economic team with diverse picks||President-elect Joe Biden is expected in the coming days to name several of his most senior economic advisers, a group that includes several liberal economists and policy specialists who established their credentials during the previous two Democratic administrations.Biden, who has placed a premium on diversity in his selection of Cabinet nominees and key advisers, is looking to notch at least a few firsts with his economic team selections.The Biden campaign has not yet announced the picks, but these are some of the individuals he’s expected to select to high-profile positions on his economic team, according to people familiar with the transition process who were granted anonymity to speak freely about the president-elect’s deliberations:JANET YELLEN, Treasury secretaryYellen became Federal Reserve chair in 2014 when the economy was still recovering from the devastating Great Recession. In the late 1990s, she was President Bill Clinton’s top economic adviser during the Asian financial crisis. Under Biden she would lead the Treasury Department with the economy in the grip of a surging pandemic.If confirmed, Yellen would become the first woman to lead the Treasury Department in its nearly 232-year history. She would inherit an economy with still-high unemployment, escalating threats to small businesses and signs that consumers are retrenching as the pandemic restricts or discourages spending.NEERA TANDEN, Office of Management and Budget directorTanden is the president and CEO of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress. She was the director of domestic policy for the Obama-Biden presidential campaign, but she first made her mark in the Clinton orbit.Tanden served as policy director for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. Before that, she served as legislative director in Clinton’s Senate office and deputy campaign manager and issues director for Clinton’s 2000 Senate campaign. She also served as a senior policy adviser in the Bill Clinton administration.If confirmed, she would be the first woman of color and the first South Asian woman to lead the OMB, the agency that oversees the federal budget.But confirmation could prove difficult. Late Sunday a spokesman for GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas tweeted that Tanden “stands zero chance of being confirmed.” And Josh Holmes, a political adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also tweeted that confirmation was unlikely. Republicans hold the edge in the current Senate, although next year’s majority won’t be decided until Jan. 5 runoffs in two races involving GOP incumbents in Georgia.BRIAN DEESE, director of the White House National Economic CouncilDeese, a former senior economic adviser in the Obama administration and now the managing director and global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock, would be the top economic adviser in the Biden White House. He worked on the auto bailout and environmental issues in the Obama White House, where he held the title of deputy director of both the NEC and the OMB.CECILIA ROUSE, chairwoman of the Council of Economic AdvisersRouse is a labor economist and head of Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. She served on the CEA from 2009 to 2011, and served on the NEC from 1998 to 1999 in the Clinton administration.Notably, she organized a letter earlier this year signed by more than 100 economists calling for more government action to mitigate the fallout for Americans caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Rouse, who is Black, would be the first woman of color to chair the CEA.Biden is also expected to name Heather Boushey, the president and CEO of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, and Jared Bernstein, who served as an economic adviser to Biden during the Obama administration, to serve on the council.

30-11-2020||World||Dictionary.com picks ‘pandemic’ as its 2020 word of the year||On Dec. 31, China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin to the World Health Organization. By Jan. 31, WHO declared an outbreak of a novel coronavirus a global health emergency. Come March 11, the world was facing down the Covid-19 pandemic.Parents sat children down to explain what a pandemic is. Related terms usually restricted to medicine and science stormed into everyday conversation. Over time, we were pandemic baking and pandemic dating and rescuing pandemic puppies from shelters.All of which led Dictionary.com on Monday to declare “pandemic” its 2020 word of the year.Searches on the site for the word spiked more than 13,500% on March 11, senior research editor John Kelly told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of the announcement.“That’s massive, but even more telling is how high it has sustained significant search volumes throughout the entire year. Month over month, it was over 1,000% higher than usual. For about half the year, it was in the top 10% of all our lookups.”Another dictionary, Merriam-Webster, also selected pandemic as its word of the year earlier Monday.Kelly said pandemic beat out routine lookups usually intended to sort more mundane matters, such as the differences between “to, two and too.”“That’s significant,” Kelly emphasized. “It seems maybe a little bit obvious, and that’s fair to say, but think about life before the pandemic. Things like pandemic fashion would have made no sense. The pandemic as an event created a new language for a new normal.”Lexicographers often factor out routine lookups when evaluating word trends.The pandemic, Kelly said, made us all worthy of watercooler chatter with Dr. Anthony Fauci as our knowledge grew about aerosols, contact tracing, social distancing and herd immunity, along with the intricacies of therapeutic drugs, tests and vaccines that can help save lives.“These were all part of a new shared vocabulary we needed to stay safe and informed. It’s incredible,” said Kelly, who works with a team of lexicographers to come up with words of the year based primarily on site traffic.Asymptomatic, furlough, non-essential, hydroxychloroquine and a host of other pandemic-related words saw massive increases in lookups as well.Jennifer Steeves-Kiss, chief executive officer of Dictionary.com, said one key ingredient in the hunt for the site’s word of the year is sustained interest over time. Pandemic met that standard.“This has affected families, our work, the economy,” she said. “It really became the logical choice. It’s become the context through which we’ve had dialogue all through 2020. It’s the through line for discourse.”The word pandemic has roots in Latin and the Greek pandemos, meaning “common, public.” Breaking it down further, “pan” means “all” and “demos” means “people.” As evidenced in a medical text by a Dutch-born physician, Gideon Harvey, pandemic entered English in the 1660s in the medical sense, Kelly said. He noted that “demos” is also the basis for the word democracy.A pandemic is defined by Dictionary.com as a disease “prevalent throughout an entire country, continent, or the whole world; epidemic over a large area.” Its broader sense, as evidenced in its roots, can be used thusly: “A pandemic fear of atomic war.”Dictionary.com also noted other worthy search trends beyond the pandemic. After the May 25 death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, words around racial justice experienced spikes, including fascism, anti-fascism, defund and white fragility.“There was no way for us to leave that out of the conversation this year,” Kelly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dictionary-com-picks-pandemic-as-its-2020-word-of-the-year/story-W5ozQfgCcegEdGiNQnFdGJ.html
30-11-2020||World||French health body says nursing homes should get Covid-19 vaccine first||France’s top health advisory body said on Monday it had recommended Covid-19 vaccinations should target retirement homes residents and their staff first when doses reach the country.Haute Autorite de la Sante (HAS) suggested rolling out the campaign in stages and on a voluntary basis, like in many other countries.President Emmanuel Macron said last week that vaccines could start to be administered as soon as the end of the year in France, if approved by regulators, after hopes were raised of a quick roll-out following promising results from trials of several candidates.After those in nursing homes, amounting to around 840,000 people in France, a second phase would target those aged 65 and over, as well as some health workers, the HAS said.Three other stages would follow, aimed at people with underlying conditions such as diabetes, other exposed professionals and then adults with no known other conditions.“These recommendations will evolve other time as we get more data. We call for vaccination on a voluntary basis,” the head of HAS Dominique Le Guludec told reporters.The French government is due to detail in the coming days how it will handle its vaccines campaign. The European Union has so far secured deals with Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, CureVac, Pfizer and BioNTech as well as Moderna.With 1.9 billion doses expected at this stage to reach the EU, France aims to secure about 295 million doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-health-body-says-nursing-homes-should-get-covid-19-vaccine-first/story-gkGyK1bx14T2lXWV18MPWN.html

Several cases cropped up among the Syrian envoys during a previous round of talks.Nearly a decade into Syria’s war, Pedersen acknowledged Sunday “challenges” in moving forward talks on the constitution, which notably do not include extremist factions that control some parts of Syria -- notably much of northwestern Idlib province.He said overcoming “deep mistrust” would take a long time, but hoped that work toward possible exchanges of detainees and the establishment of common “principles” in the discussions could help to overcome it.“I hope that what we have achieved is actually the beginning of starting to build trust between the parties and that this building of trust could then be a door opener to a broader political process,” he told reporters on Sunday.The meeting, involving 15 people from each delegation, is the fourth among the so-called Constitutional Committee. Another meeting is planned for January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-hosts-latest-round-of-talks-on-syria-s-constitution/story-g049NJ5om5iFH7u1yCyfYI.html

Pakistan’s financial capital Karachi ranked at 7 on the AQI. New Delhi came in second with a PM of 229, while Nepal’s capital Kathmandu ranked the third-worst city with a PM of 178.The United States Environmental Protection Agency regards air quality satisfactory if the AQI is under 50. Lahore’s AQI fell in the range of 301 and higher, which has been classified as “hazardous”. According to environmental experts and an earlier report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the cause of smog remains years-long pollution caused mostly by the transport sector and industries, and not just crop burning. Trans-boundary pollution is also not the main reason as the Met Department has confirmed that Punjab primarily experiences a westerly wave during winter.Out of the 162 brick kilns still operating on the old technology, around 80 were converted to zigzag recently, while work was under way on the others. Out of the 80 zigzag kilns, 30 have been newly built and the remaining converted.Brick kilns were shut down on November 7 till December 31. Even as the government claims to be cracking down on kilns, several of them were still operating, some even overnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lahore-again-tops-list-of-world-s-most-polluted-cities-delhi-is-second/story-U68MVlLH6stoYnLFT5mwYO.html

30-11-2020||World||Russia under renewed pressure to explain Navalny poisoning||Russia came under renewed pressure Monday to explain the nerve agent attack on opposition figure Alexei Navalny as the annual meeting of the global chemical weapons watchdog got underway amid measures aimed at reining in the spread of coronavirus.Navalny fell ill on August 20 during a domestic flight in Russia, and was flown to Germany for treatment two days later. His allies accused the Kremlin of poisoning its fiercest opponent. Tests carried out by labs in Germany, France and Sweden and by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons established that Navalny was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.The organization’s director-general, Fernando Arias, told Monday’s meeting that according to the Chemical Weapons Convention, “the poisoning of an individual through the use of a nerve agent is a use of a chemical weapon.”A group of 56 nations issued a statement as the start of the annual meeting of the OPCW’s member states urging Moscow to disclose “in a swift and transparent manner the circumstances of this chemical weapons attack.”Russia, which denies involvement in Navalny’s poisoning, reacted bullishly in its written statement to the conference.“Instead of trying to look into what had happened, Germany and its allies resorted to megaphone diplomacy, unleashed a mass disinformation campaign against Russia and started to demand some ‘independent international investigation’ under the auspices of the OPCW,” Moscow’s statement said.In October, Moscow asked for OPCW experts to visit Russia to provide “technical assistance” in its investigations. Arias said talks are underway to define “all the legal, technical, operational and logistical parameters in order for this visit to take place.”The European Union has imposed sanctions on six Russian officials and a state research institute over the poisoning. Moscow responded earlier this month by announcing that it had adopted sanctions against a number of German and French officials.The OPCW’s annual meeting has been broken into two parts amid the coronavirus pandemic. Two days of talks this week will focus on approving the proposed 71.74 million euro ($86 million) annual budget for 2021. The second half of the meeting will take place next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-under-renewed-pressure-to-explain-navalny-poisoning/story-IqRjcOL974N9UyyBDSBNdL.html

In a seven-point plan to beat Covid-19, the Biden-Harris administration has promised several measures, including access to regular, reliable, and free testing, and equitable distribution of treatments and vaccines.However, the distribution of the vaccine has to be prioritised because of the limited supply of doses immediately after the vaccine candidates get the required authorisation. Dr Celine Gounder, a member of Biden’s coronavirus advisory board, said that the president-elect will let the health experts decide on the prioritisation.Speaking to CNN, Dr Gounder admitted that the prioritising for a vaccine will be tricky, given the varying degree of risk associated with different groups. She said that health care workers, doctors, nurses, teachers, people working in food and meat processing industries, drugstores, and grocery check-out counters will be given priority as soon as a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available.Also Read | Beware of Covid-19 scams as vaccine approaches FDA approvalThe US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) has proposed a five-phase approach for an equitable allocation of a vaccine to US residents.Here is how it may work out:Phase 1: Health care workers and first responders.Phase 2: People with underlying conditions that put them at significantly higher risk of severe Covid-19 and older adults in overcrowded settings. Phase 3: Critical workers at high risk of exposure, teachers and school staff, people in homeless shelters and prisons, older adults not included in phase 1 and 2, and people with underlying conditions that put them at moderately higher risk.Phase 4: Young adults, children and essential service workers at increased risk of exposure not included in phase 1 and 2.Phase 5: All remaining US residents.Pfizer has applied to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization for its vaccine, BNT162b2, after phase 3 trial met all of the study’s primary efficacy endpoints. The biotech firms said that the study indicated a vaccine efficacy rate of 95 per cent, close to the efficacy rate found in early trial results of Moderna’s vaccine candidate. An independent panel of experts is scheduled to meet on December 10 to discuss the application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-frontline-workers-to-all-residents-how-us-5-phase-covid-19-vaccination-may-work/story-wW6KPkotG7LmVljC93M2iI.html
30-11-2020||World||After ban on China’s Huawei, UK to diversify 5G suppliers||The UK government on Monday confirmed the complete removal of Chinese telecom giant Huawei from Britain’s existing networks by 2027 and announced a strategy to diversify 5G suppliers so that the country doesn’t rely too much on a select few providers.The government had decided earlier this year to exclude high-risk vendors from those parts of the 5G and full-fibre networks that are critical to security and also from sensitive locations, and limit their presence in the periphery of those networks, capped at 35%.In July, in response to further US sanctions against Huawei, the UK government went further by setting a timetable to remove Huawei from 5G networks by the end of 2027. ZTE, another Chinese company, is also considered by London to be “high risk”.British operators have been told that they should stop procuring Huawei equipment affected by US sanctions by December 31, 2020 and remove Huawei 5G equipment from the network by the end of 2027 at the “absolute latest”.Culture secretary Oliver Dowden said, “We are taking bold steps to implement one of the toughest telecom security regimes in the world. A central part of that is combating high-risk vendors, and I have set out an unambiguous timetable for the complete removal of Huawei equipment from our 5G networks no later than 2027.”He added, “That decision is the right one, but it also risks leaving us overly reliant on too few suppliers. That is a dilemma faced by countries across the globe - and it is one the government is confronting head-on through the publication of this strategy.”Following the decision to remove Huawei equipment from future networks, the UK is now reliant on two mobile access network equipment suppliers: Nokia and Ericsson. This, the official statement said, represents an “intolerable” resilience risk.“Therefore, it is essential that we create a more diverse and competitive supply base for telecom networks. A more competitive and diverse supply market will increase quality, innovation and the resilience of our networks,” the statement said.The 5G supply chain diversification strategy is expected to help mitigate the resilience risks to 5G networks, and includes an initial fund of £250 million to begin work to create a more diverse, competitive, and innovative supply market for the telecom sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-ban-on-china-s-huawei-uk-to-diversify-5g-suppliers/story-goG9YvsoJ4Xj97gfRBMTzH.html
30-11-2020||World||Beware of Covid-19 scams as vaccine approaches FDA approval||The coronavirus vaccine inching toward approval in the US is desperately anticipated by weary Americans longing for a path back to normal life. But criminals are waiting, too, ready to use that desperation to their advantage, federal investigators say.Homeland Security investigators are working with Pfizer, Moderna and dozens of other drug companies racing to complete and distribute the vaccine and treatments for the virus. The goal: to prepare for the scams that are coming, especially after the mess of criminal activity this year with phony personal protective equipment, false cures and extortion schemes.“We’re all very excited about the potential vaccine and treatments,” said Steve Francis, assistant director for global trade investigations with Homeland Security Investigations. “But I also caution against these criminal organizations and individuals that will try to exploit the American public.”No vaccine has yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has approved the first treatment for Covid-19, the antiviral drug remdesivir. With vaccines and treatments both, it has warned about the potential for fraud.“The FDA is particularly concerned that these deceptive and misleading products might cause Americans to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious and life-threatening harm,” the agency said in a recent statement.The drug companies are to have safeguards and brand-protection features in place to help avoid fraud, but that may not be available until the second generation of vaccine because everything is operated on such an emergency basis, said Karen Gardner, chief marketing officer at SIPCA North America, a company that works as a bridge between the government, businesses and consumers. She said that makes it more important to educate health care providers on what the real thing looks like.“When you have anything in high demand and limited supply, there is going to be fraud,” she said. Desperation will drive people around normal channels.Meanwhile, investigators are learning about how the vaccine will be packaged and getting the message out to field agents, creating a mass database of information from more than 200 companies, so they can be prepared to spot fakes and crack down on dangerous fraud. They are monitoring tens of thousands of false websites and looking for evidence of fake cures sold online.Earlier this year as cases exploded, hospitals and governments grew short on masks, gloves and other protective gear. Scams grew, too. Tricksters preyed on unwitting citizens to hand over money for goods they’d never receive.Homeland Security Investigations started using its 7,000 agents in tandem with border, FDA and FBI officials to investigate scams, seize phony products and arrest hundreds of people. The effort is headquartered at the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, a government watchdog aimed at enforcement of its international trade laws and combating intellectual property theft.The agency has already analyzed more than 70,900 websites suspected as being involved in some type of Covid-19 fraud. Millions of fake or unapproved personal protective equipment products and antiviral pharmaceuticals were seized. Homeland Security Investigations made more than 1,600 seizures of products worth more than $27 million and made more than 185 arrests.Home test kits, for example, were only recently made available to the public in the past few weeks. But investigators seized tens of thousands of fake kits in the months before. On the dark web, scammers were selling domain names like “coronaprevention.org,” attractive to counterfeiters. In the US alone, more than 1,000 fake websites a day have been removed during the pandemic.A vaccine can’t come fast enough, as virus cases have topped 13 million in the US and many cities have started restricting movement again as the country heads into winter. The pandemic has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide, more than 266,000 of them in the US, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. But Francis and other investigators are worried that desperation will make Americans more susceptible.If the FDA allows emergency use of a vaccine, there will be limited, rationed supplies before the end of the year.Gen. Gus Perna, in charge of the government’s efforts to distribute the vaccine, said on CBS’ “60 Minutes” the government was prepared to distribute the vaccine within 24 hours of approval. There’s a stockpile of the prospective vaccine itself plus kits of needles, syringes and alcohol swabs needed to give the dose. The secret stash is watched by armed guards.“We have taken extraordinary precaution in this area,” he said. “It’s such a commodity to us, we’re taking the full steps to make sure that the vaccine’s secure.”Who is first in line has yet to be decided. But Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the hope is that enough doses are available by the end of January to vaccinate adults over age 65, who are at the highest risk from the coronavirus, and health care workers. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious-diseases expert, said it may take until spring or summer before anyone who is not high risk and wants a shot can get one.States already are gearing up for what is expected to be the biggest vaccination campaign in U.S. history. First the shots have to arrive where they’re needed, and Pfizer’s must be kept at ultra-cold temperatures — around minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 70 degrees Celsius. Moderna’s vaccine also starts off frozen, but the company said it can be thawed and kept in a regular refrigerator for 30 days, easing that concern.Governments in other countries and the World Health Organization, which aims to buy doses for poor nations, will have to decide separately if and when vaccines should be rolled out broadly.Meanwhile, Homeland Security investigators and others are trying to send the message now to the public before the vaccines are approved and begin distribution. They say people should only get a vaccine from an approved medical provider. They shouldn’t respond to calls seeking personal information. And they shouldn’t click on social media posts purporting to sell cures.“If it sounds too good to be true, it is,” Francis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beware-of-covid-19-scams-as-vaccine-approaches-fda-approval/story-phVMknGIYDID1hCmRLWVeO.html
30-11-2020||World||‘Afghan lives matter’: China tells Australia, refuses to say sorry for controversial tweet||China on Monday refused to apologise after a Chinese diplomat posted a graphic image depicting an Australian soldier with a bloodied knife next to an Afghan child, a post described by Prime Minister Scott Morrison as “repugnant” and “false”.Following Morrison’s criticism, Australian media has called the photo fake though Twitter hasn’t taken it down yet.It marks the continuing escalation of tensions in China-Australia ties on issues ranging from human rights violations and trade policies.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, posted the photo seemingly depicting an Australian soldier next to a child, who is seen holding a lamb. The controversial post comes in the backdrop of an ongoing police investigation into a recent disclosure by Australia’s defence establishment that said the country’s soldiers had committed war crimes in Afghanistan. Recently, an inquiry report claimed to have learnt that from 2009-2013, about 25 Australian soldiers had been involved in the killings of 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners.“Shocked by the murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable,” spokesperson Zhao tweeted the caption.PM Morrison issued a strong statement against the tweet, asking the social media platform to remove the photograph.He described Zhao’s tweet as “truly repugnant, deeply offensive, utterly outrageous” and that the “Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world’s eyes”.“It is a false image and terrible slur on our defence forces,” Morrison said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, on Monday brushed aside the criticism and instead asked Australia to do some “soul-searching” in the face of the war crimes investigation.“The Australian government should do some soul-searching and bring the culprits to justice, and offer an official apology to the Afghan people and make the solemn pledge that they will never repeat such crimes,” Hua said on Monday.“Earlier, they said the Chinese government should feel ashamed, but it is Australian soldiers who committed such cruel crimes. Shouldn’t the Australian government feel ashamed? Shouldn’t they feel ashamed for their soldiers killing innocent Afghan civilians?” Hua argued.Hua added, “The Australian side is reacting so strongly to my colleague’s Twitter - does that mean that they think the cold-blooded murder of Afghan innocent civilians is justified while other people’s condemnation of such crimes are not justified?”“Afghan lives matter,” she added.Australia has criticised China for its handling of the Uighur minority living in the remote Xinjiang province, and has also called for an international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.China’s list of complaints includes Canberra’s decision to block Chinese investment projects, ban Chinese tech firm Huawei from its 5G tender, and “incessant wanton interference in China’s Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan affairs,” as per a list circulated by the Chinese embassy in Australia.Last week, China announced that it will impose taxes on Australian wine of up to 212%.The Chinese commerce ministry said these were temporary anti-dumping measures to stop subsidised imports of Australian wine.Beijing has targeted other Australian imports in recent months, which include coal, sugar and barley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-lives-matter-china-tells-australia-refuses-to-say-sorry-for-controversial-tweet/story-A2fMZzPj7PFEzytLGkeiyK.html

Those burst out into street protests in 2014 and again last year, prompting a harsh crackdown from authorities.Also Read | India seeks answers from China on Ladakh peace plan. It is a make-or-break questionThe US has imposed sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials over the passage of a National Security Law that imposed strict penalties for critics of the Beijing-backed government that has ruled the former British colony since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.The sanctions ban the officials, including the head of Hong Kong’s local government, Carrie Lam, from traveling to the U.S. and freezes all dealings with American financial institutions.Hua told reporters Monday that “the relevant US practices blatantly meddle in Hong Kong affairs, grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs, seriously violate the international law and basic norms governing international relations.”“The US should immediately cease interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs and avoid going further down the wrong path,” Hua said at a daily briefing.Hong Kong is just one area where tensions between Washington and Beijing have risen over recent years.The Trump administration has cut off Chinese tech giant Huawei’s access to most US components and technology on security grounds, part of a feud over trade and technology that has led the White House to press the Chinese owner of video service TikTok to sell its US operation, which American officials say is a security risk.US accusations of Chinese human rights abuses, particularly against Muslim minority groups in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, have resulted in frequent angry exchanges between the sides. Frictions have also built over Washington’s support for Taiwan, which China claims as a breakaway province to be recovered by force if necessary, along with China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sanctions-leaders-of-us-groups-over-hong-kong-actions/story-0WOmzxMub28tItwApvJ8OM.html
30-11-2020||World||Time is running out for Brexit trade deal, UK minister says||Britain and the European Union are running out of time to clinch a Brexit trade deal but if good progress is made this week then the talks could be extended, Environment Secretary George Eustice said on Monday.With just over four weeks left until the United Kingdom finally exits the EU’s orbit on Dec. 31, both sides are demanding concessions from the other on fishing, state aid and how to resolve any future disputes.“We really are now running out of time, this is the crucial week, we need to get a breakthrough,” Eustice told Sky. “I really do think we are now in to the final week or 10 days, of course if great progress were made this week and you’re nearly there it’s always possible to extend those negotiations,” he said. Britain formally left the EU on Jan. 31 but has been in a transition period since then under which rules on trade, travel and business remain unchanged. From the start of 2021 it will be treated by Brussels as a third country.The two sides are trying to strike a trade deal on goods that would safeguard nearly $1 trillion in annual trade and buttress peace in British-ruled Northern Ireland.Talks between EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and British chief negotiator David Frost continued on Sunday. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was a very significant week for Brexit.“David Frost had made clear that we’re continuing the negotiations because we still think there is a prospect that we can get an agreement and while there is we should persevere with those,” Eustice said.FISH Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a deal could be done this week, but there needed to be give and take on both sides.On fishing, Britain dug in its heels. While fishing alone contributed just 0.03% of British economic output in 2019, it is an emotive subject as many Brexit supporters see it as a symbol of the regained sovereignty that leaving the EU should bring. Combined with fish and shellfish processing, then the sector makes up 0.1% of UK GDP.Britain wants “zonal attachment” to agree a total allowable catch for the United Kingdom’s waters - a step that would give it a much larger quota share than if the fish maths were worked out on the EU’s proposals.“All we’re asking for ... is there to be annual negotiations based on the science and also for there to be a move towards a fairer, more scientific sharing methodology which is called zonal attachment which is broadly where the fish are to be found,” Eustice told BBC radio.“Under that analysis we currently only have access to about half of the fish in our own waters, that is profoundly unfair on our fishermen, we’ve been clear throughout that needs to change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-is-running-out-for-brexit-trade-deal-uk-minister-says/story-BfMVbYLbG2S0wVrtWoOgmM.html
30-11-2020||World||Iran says Israel remotely killed military nuclear scientist||A top Iranian security official on Monday accused Israel of using “electronic devices” to remotely kill a scientist who founded the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear program in the 2000s. Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the country’s Supreme National Security Council, made the comment at the funeral for Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, where Iran’s defense minister separately vowed to continue the man’s work “with more speed and more power.”  Israel, long suspected of killing Iranian nuclear scientists over the last decade, has declined to comment on the attack. Fakhrizadeh headed Iran’s so-called AMAD program, which Israel and the West have alleged was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency says that “structured program” ended in 2003. U.S. intelligence agencies concurred with that assessment in a 2007 report.Israel insists Iran still maintains the ambition of developing nuclear weapons, pointing to Tehran’s ballistic missile program and research into other technologies. Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful.Shamkhani’s remarks drastically change the story of Fakhrizadeh’s killing Friday. Authorities initially said a truck exploded and then gunmen opened fire on the scientist, killing him. State TV’s English-language Press TV earlier reported a weapon recovered from the scene of the attack bore “the logo and specifications of the Israeli military industry.” State TV’s Arabic-language channel, Al-Alam, claimed the weapons used were “controlled by satellite,” a claim also made Sunday by the semiofficial Fars news agency. None of the outlets immediately offered evidence supporting their claims.“Unfortunately, the operation was a very complicated operation and was carried out by using electronic devices,” Shamkhani told state TV. “No individual was present at the site.” Shamkhani also blamed the Iranian exile group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq as well for “having a role in this,” without elaborating. The MEK did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Monday’s service for Fakhrizadeh took place at an outdoor portion of Iran’s Defense Ministry in Tehran, with officials including Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami, the Guard’s Quds Force leader Gen. Esmail Ghaani, civilian nuclear program chief Ali Akbar Sahei and Intelligence Minister Mamoud Alavi. They sat apart from each other and wore masks due to the coronavirus pandemic as reciters melodically read portions of the Quran and religious texts.Defense Minister Gen. Amir Hatami gave a speech after kissing Fakhrizadeh’s casket and putting his forehead against it. He said Fakhrizadeh’s killing would make Iranians “more united, more determined.” “For the continuation of your path, we will continue with more speed and more power,” Hatami said in comments aired live by state television.Hatami also criticized countries that hadn’t condemned Fakhrizadeh’s killing, warning: “This will catch up with you someday.” Overnight, the United Arab Emirates, which just reached a normalization deal with Israel, issued a statement condemning “the heinous assassination.” The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, warned it “could further fuel conflict in the region.” Last year, the UAE found itself in the middle of an escalating series of incidents between Iran and the US. Though long suspicious of Iran’s nuclear program, the Emirates has said it wants to de-escalate the crisis. The UAE just started passenger air service to Israel and Israelis are expected to vacation in the country over Hanukkah in the coming days.Hatami also called the nuclear arsenal of the US - and the stockpile of atomic bombs Israel long has been suspected of holding - “the most dangerous threat against humanity.” Mourners later buried Fakhrizadeh in the courtyard of Imamzadeh Saleh mosque in north Tehran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-israel-remotely-killed-military-nuclear-scientist/story-u9GCVE3jgJrO6mLzKRDLhI.html

In a statement released on Monday, the embassy tried to draw the attention of the Indian government and people towards Fakhrizadeh’s “outstanding role in peaceful scientific projects in Iran” and accused Israel of conspiring to “incited chaos” in the region.“Iranian people expect that the international community condemn state terrorism and build a consensus to counter tension and adventurism in the region,” the statement read.The embassy praised the slain scientist for his contribution to the “national efforts in curbing the Covid-19 pandemic”. It further said that several top Iranian scientists and national heroes have been targeted over the past years, stressing that evidence “clearly indicates” foreign hands behind such attacks.“The recent assassination of the senior Iranian nuclear scientist also bears the clear hallmark of cowardly acts committed by the terrorist regime of Israeli, which has already assassinated a large number of scientific elites in Iran and all over the region,” the embassy added.Also Read | Iranian scientist killing could trigger serious confrontation with Israel. Here’s whyFakhrizadeh was long suspected by the West of masterminding secret nuclear programme for the country and in 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said, “Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh,” while warning about a secret atomic warehouse. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspected the alleged atomic warehouse site in February 2019 and found traces of uranium.The United States, Russia, China, Germany, Britain and France entered a deal with Iran in 2015, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA). In 2018, US President Donald Trump announced Washington’s withdrawal from the deal and imposed unilateral sanctions on Tehran as a part of its “maximum pressure” campaign. The Iranian embassy has also accused Israel of persuading Washington to leave the nuclear accord.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-embassy-tries-to-draw-india-s-attention-to-killing-of-its-top-nuclear-scientist/story-m9Q4uEVMrcnVyvc75VV9VN.html

He behaves like a Frequent Flyer,” said Amir Khalil, a Four Paws vet.“The flight was uneventful, which is all you can ask for when you transfer an elephant.”Cher had written songs pressing for Kaavan’s release from grim, isolated conditions at Islamabad Zoo and she had spent the last few days with him in Pakistan.The multi award-winning singer has been with a film crew documenting Kaavan’s story and said she was proud to be part of an effort to free an elephant she said had been shackled to a shed for 17 years. Dozens of wildlife workers and experts led by Four Paws used a winch and rope to pull the sedated elephant into the crate before he was loaded onto the Russian-built cargo plane. Kaavan’s handlers took more than 200 kg (441 lbs) of food including bananas and melons to keep him busy on his journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kaavan-pakistan-s-lonesome-elephant-starts-new-life-in-cambodia/story-US0afKuYwV63SELV7ZxJnK.html
30-11-2020||World||Uproar in France over proposed limits on filming police||French activists fear that a proposed new security law will deprive them of a potent weapon against abuse — cellphone videos of police activity — threatening their efforts to document possible cases of police brutality, especially in impoverished immigrant neighborhoods.French President Emmanuel Macron’s government is pushing a new security bill that makes it illegal to publish images of police officers with intent to cause them harm, amid other measures. Critics fear the new law could hurt press freedoms and make it more difficult for all citizens to report on police brutality.“I was lucky enough to have videos that protect me,” said Michel Zecler, a Black music producer who was beaten up recently by several French police officers. Videos first published Thursday by French website Loopsider have been seen by over 14 million viewers, resulting in widespread outrage over police actions.Two of the officers are in jail while they are investigated while two others, also under investigation, are out on bail.The draft bill, still being debated in parliament, has prompted protests across the country called by press freedom advocates and civil rights campaigners. Tens of thousands of people marched Saturday in Paris to reject the measure, including families and friends of people killed by police.“For decades, descendants of post-colonial immigration and residents in populous neighborhoods have denounced police brutality,” Sihame Assbague, an anti-racism activist, told The Associated Press.Videos by the public have helped to show a wider audience that there is a “systemic problem with French police forces, who are abusing, punching, beating, mutilating, killing,” she said.Activists say the bill may have an even greater impact on people other than journalists, especially those of immigrant origin living in neighborhoods where relationships with the police have long been tense. Images posted online have been key to denouncing cases of officers’ misconduct and racism in recent years, they argue.Assbague expressed fears that, under the proposed law, those who post videos of police abuses online may be put on trial, where they would face up to a year in jail and a 45,000-euro ($53,000) fine.“I tend to believe that a young Arab man from a poor suburb who posts a video of police brutality in his neighborhood will be more at risk of being found guilty than a journalist who did a video during a protest,” she said.Amal Bentousi’s brother Amine was shot in the back and killed by a police officer in 2012. The officer was sentenced to a five-year suspended prison sentence. Along with other families of victims, in March she launched a mobile phone app called Emergency-Police Violence to record abuses and bring cases to court.“Some police officers already have a sense of impunity. ... The only solution now is to make videos,” she told the AP. The app has been downloaded more than 50,000 times.“If we want to improve public confidence in the police, it does not go through hiding the truth,” she added.The proposed law is partly a response to demands from police unions, who say it will provide greater protection for officers.Abdoulaye Kante, a Black police officer with 20 years of experience in Paris and its suburbs, is both a supporter of the proposed law and strongly condemns police brutality and violence against officers.“What people don’t understand is that some individuals are using videos to put the faces of our (police) colleagues on social media so that they are identified, so that they are threatened or to incite hatred,” he said.“The law doesn’t ban journalists or citizens from filming police in action ... It bans these images from being used to harm, physically or psychologically,” he argued. “The lives of officers are important.”A “tiny fraction of the population feeds rage and hatred” against police, Jean-Michel Fauvergue, a former head of elite police forces and a lawmaker in Macron’s party who co-authored the bill, said in the National Assembly. “We need to find a solution.”Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti has acknowledged that “the intent (to harm) is something that is difficult to define” and the government appears ready to back revamping part of the proposed law.Activists consider the draft law one more step in a series of security measures passed by French lawmakers to extend police powers at the expense of civil liberties.A statement signed by over 30 groups of families and friends of victims of police abuses said that since 2005, “all security laws adopted have constantly expanded the legal field allowing police impunity.”Riots in 2005 exposed France’s long-running problems between police and youths in public housing projects with large immigrant populations.In recent years, numerous security laws have been passed following attacks by extremists.Critics noted a hardening of police tactics during protests or while arresting individuals. Hundreds of complaints have been filed against officers during the yellow vest movement against social injustice, which erupted in 2018 and saw weekends of violent clashes.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said out of 3 million police operations per year in France, some 9,500 end up on a government website that denounces abuses, which represents 0.3%.France’s human rights ombudsman, Claire Hedon, is among the most prominent critics of the proposed law, which she said involves “significant risks of undermining fundamental rights.”“Our democracy is hit when the population does not trust its police anymore,” she told the National Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uproar-in-france-over-proposed-limits-on-filming-police/story-2fq42hR7sNdUhpQ1GTcl8L.html
30-11-2020||World||EU starts debate on how best to improve post-Trump US relations, officials say||The European Union will begin discussions on Monday on how best to improve transatlantic relations after the departure of US President Donald Trump, EU officials said.Ambassadors from the 27 EU countries are due to consider five broad policy areas on which they see greater opportunities for cooperation with President-elect Joe Biden after four strained years with Trump.Those areas on health, notably fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, boosting the economic recovery, combating climate change, promoting peace and security and upholding shared values, including a belief in multilateral rules.EU leaders are expected to debate transatlantic relations when they convene for a summit on December 10-11.Charles Michel, the former Belgian prime minister who heads the grouping of EU nations called the European Council, has invited Biden to an in-person summit in the first half of 2021, with a virtual summit perhaps soon after he takes office.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the United States and the European Union need to forge a new transatlantic alliance in areas such as climate change and the digital economy.Many European leaders watched with shock as Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate change agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, slapped tariffs on EU goods and spurned multilateral bodies that America has backed for decades.Von der Leyen said the EU was looking forward to the United States rejoining the Paris agreement, which Biden has said he will do.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-starts-debate-on-how-best-to-improve-post-trump-us-relations-officials-say/story-QyzJxtsZEYROp6bflA2PzH.html

30-11-2020||World||Janet Yellen to forge US economic comeback as Biden’s treasury pick||President-elect Joe Biden will take a significant step this week toward addressing the damage to the US economy inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic, as he names an economic team led by his choice for Treasury secretary, former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.In Yellen, Biden will have a battle-tested policy maker who can draw on her nearly two decades at the Fed to help rebuild an economy in dire need of government cash and confidence. Biden has called for trillions of dollars in new stimulus to aid the small and mid-size businesses that are the nation’s jobs engine.Yellen’s expected to champion what she’s called “extraordinary fiscal support” to support the pandemic-ridden economy -- deficit spending that she says is affordable given extraordinarily low interest rates.Others in Biden’s economic policy team are also expected to be unveiled this week. People familiar with the process said longtime Democratic policy staffer Neera Tanden had been picked to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Cecilia Rouse, formerly of the Obama administration and currently dean of Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs, would head the Council of Economic Advisers. Both roles require Senate confirmation.At the top of their to-do list will be to break a deadlock in Congress over additional relief spending, an effort that would be far easier if Democrats win two Georgia Senate seats in runoff elections next month to wrest control of the chamber from Mitch McConnell’s Republicans.Yellen is seen winning easy confirmation in the Senate. While she occasionally sparred with Republican lawmakers as Fed chair, she’s widely respected, and some GOP senators publicly complimented her selection, which Biden has yet to make official.At 74, she will be the oldest Treasury secretary in recent memory, and the first woman to lead the agency.She would be the second person in the modern era to serve as both Fed chair and Treasury chief, after Jimmy Carter appointee William Miller, and the only one to also have led the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which she did in the Clinton administration.“Biden made a clever pick with Yellen,” said economist Marc Sumerlin of Evenflow Macro in Washington. “She’s non-partisan, has earned everybody’s respect, and can give intellectual heft to the stimulus argument more than anyone else could have.”Here’s a look at her challenges ahead.StimulusThe US economy is showing signs of further erosion as coronavirus cases spiral and some states begin to shutter businesses again in a bid to slow the spread. The US outbreak threatens to be a drag on the nascent labor market recovery, with jobless claims ticking up and payroll gains forecast to slow further.Nine months into the pandemic, more than six million people still claim extended unemployment assistance.Key for the Biden administration is passing a fiscal stimulus package that bolsters consumer finances and supports additional spending. The Fed is set to maintain an accommodative monetary policy to help drive growth.History suggests Yellen will be sworn in by early February. Among her first tasks will be to decide what to do about the Fed’s pandemic lending programs. Outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said some will sunset on Dec. 31. She may find a way to extend them, which is the Fed’s preference, or perhaps redesign them since many remained largely untapped.Market StabilityInvestors predict that with a less volatile boss than her predecessor, Yellen can be a stabilizing force on Wall Street.President Donald Trump’s practice of policy making by tweet sowed unpredictability for businesses and investors. Yellen’s tenure at the Fed -- as chairman, vice-chairman, governor, and San Francisco Fed president -- means that she’s keenly aware of the market impact of her words, a stark contrast with senior Trump administration officials.“The markets love this appointment because being the former Federal Reserve chair, there’s no surprises about her thinking,” said Peter Mallouk, chief executive officer of Creative Planning.Yellen comes as something of a relief to Wall Street after talk of Biden choosing Senator Elizabeth Warren, a nemesis of big banks with a preference for stronger financial regulation, as his Treasury chief.But it’s the influence of progressive Democrats like Warren that steered Biden away from current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. Before Election Day, Brainard was a favorite for Treasury secretary among Biden’s advisers. Biden’s allies have since asked that Brainard remain at the Fed, where she’s the lone Democrat on the board.Financial RegulationThe party’s liberal wing appreciates Yellen for her support of tighter financial regulation, for which she’ll be the point person in the Biden administration. That will thrust her into anticipated policy battles between progressives and moderates over the policing of Wall Street.The most liberal lawmakers want to restore and even toughen post-financial crisis rules weakened during the Trump administration. But centrists may push for a more cautious approach, arguing that it would be a mistake to clamp down on banks at a time when the economy is imperiled.As Treasury chief, Yellen will lead the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the powerful group of regulators that tries to identify and rein in emerging threats posed by the industry. Since it was created through the Dodd-Frank Act, FSOC has become a forum for agencies like Treasury, the Fed and the US Securities and Exchange Commission to collaborate on oversight.Yellen’s record indicates she may use the position to push for new rules on so-called shadow lenders, such as money-market mutual funds and investment banks that are outside the Fed’s reach.In recent years she’s sounded alarms in particular about leveraged lending -- loans extended to businesses that are already highly indebted -- due to concerns that the economy could suffer significant job losses if the corporate borrowers start defaulting. Shadow banks are very active in leveraged lending.Foreign RelationsWhat’s less clear about Yellen is whether she’ll embrace the Treasury secretary’s role as an occasional economic aggressor. While international economic diplomacy will be part of her purview, taking her to Group of 20 meetings that she participated in as Fed chair, she’ll now play a much larger role in US foreign policy.Part of her new remit will be to work with the State Department and other national security agencies to manage the vast US sanctions portfolio. But as Biden indicated during his presidential campaign, his early agenda will include repairing ties with allies damaged by Trump’s “America First” position.Mnuchin and predecessors including Hank Paulson played central roles in managing trade policy and relations with China. It remains to be seen if Biden will hand Yellen the same power.The new administration will also need to decide whether to scrap, keep, or escalate the billions of dollars in tariffs levied against Chinese imports, and whether to stick to the partial trade deal Trump signed with Beijing in January or seek to renegotiate it.Yellen also will be involved in determining whether to continue sanctions imposed on Chinese officials for their crackdown on human rights, and she’ll inherit Trump administration restrictions aimed at cutting off Chinese technology companies’ access to American intellectual property.Yellen has spoken in favour of liberalizing trade and has publicly disagreed with Trump’s position that China’s management of its economy swelled the US trade deficit. She said in February that “we haven’t seen” any evidence that duties on Chinese goods made US manufacturers more competitive or more likely to hire.At Treasury, Yellen would also decide whether to continue branding China as a currency manipulator in biannual reports. The US label has no practical effect, but adds to tensions between the world’s two largest economies.While not singling out Beijing, Yellen said in 2019 that it was “really difficult and treacherous” to determine when a country is massaging its currency to gain a trade advantage. A weaker exchange rate, she said, may just be a byproduct of looser economic policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/janet-yellen-to-forge-us-economic-comeback-as-biden-s-treasury-pick/story-k0VktDvxidKnVvCwv5Y8yM.html
30-11-2020||World||Christmas, coronavirus and fear of no-deal Brexit push Europe’s warehouses to the limit||Retailers worldwide have never had more reason to pack warehouses to the brim and keep stock closer to shoppers who continue to buy a record number of items online.As well as stocking up for Christmas and any potential coronavirus-related lockdowns, Europe and the UK will soon have Brexit to deal with.British companies are bringing as much as possible into the country before potential disruptions in January, while their European counterparts are piling up goods in pan-European distribution hubs close to ports like Hamburg or Rotterdam.E-commerce management platforms including ZigZag and Global-e-- which serve Forever 21, Boohoo, Gap, Selfridges and Hugo Boss --- said around 30-35% of UK retailers’ sales are to customers in continental Europe. Brands popular in the UK like Chinese e-commerce retailer Shein or American sportswear brand Under Armour are currently stocked exclusively in the EU, ZigZag CEO Al Gerrie said. The rise in e-commerce throughout the year as a consequence of the pandemic had already pushed warehouse space to the limit.“Most carriers already operated at Christmas volumes during the first wave. If you now add the Christmas effect on top, it’s just getting even more challenging,” CFO of European e-commerce retailer Zalando, David Schroeder, said in November.Demand for storage space after Brexit could shoot up even further as retailers seek to avoid customs checks and, if no deal is struck, tariffs.“Retailers won’t want to be caught out again,” said Nick Cook, head of Europe for warehouse owner GLP, referring to the potential supply shocks Brexit could bring. Their warehouses, covering 3.3 million square metres in continental Europe and 700,000 in the UK leased to companies including H&M, Amazon and DHL are currently 97% occupied.Stocking up In the UK, leasing volumes for commercial warehouse space are at record levels of 32.5 million square feet and projected to grow to 40 million by the end of the year, according to real estate advisory firm CBRE.Logistics operator Europa Worldwide Group, which delivers goods for retailers and third parties like DHL and Amazon, is holding 60% more e-commerce products than this time last year, the company said.Shoe producer Vivo Barefoot said it was shipping as many shoes as possible from its Portugal manufacturing site to its UK warehouse ahead of December.M&S, Next, and Primark said earlier this year their warehouses were still holding unsold summer clothing. Even after the pandemic, demand for warehouse space is expected to remain high as customers now used to ordering online continue to do so. E-commerce generally requires around three times as much warehouse capacity as physical retail, according to figures from Prologis.Spreading outWarehouse developer Panattoni Chief Executive Robert Dobrzycki said pandemic border closures spurred retailers to separate stock by country instead of stocking for several countries in one shared warehouse space.“We’re seeing a move away from just-in-time logistics strategies and increasingly towards just-in-case,” said Andrew Jones of property firm Londonmetric in a November earnings call. “Not only in the period we’re all living through at the moment, but also the period we’re going to live through post-Brexit.” Retailers could also seek to split logistics operations across the UK and EU to avoid charges.Even with a deal, cross-border traders will have to pay charges on goods travelling between the UK and EU and track every order with commercial paperwork. Britain’s logistics industry estimates that 250 million customs declarations a year will be needed for EU trade.Holding stock in both markets would eliminate that problem and is a solution the biggest players have opted for. Amazon said in July that from December 28 onwards it would no longer distribute goods for merchants between the UK and the EU – instead, they would have to send their stock separately to fulfilment centres in both regions.Meanwhile other industry players are beginning to discuss options like converting agricultural buildings, empty space on run-down high streets or vacant basements into warehouse space, according to research by firms including Savills and JLL.But the construction and conversion process is slow and has been hit by delays during the pandemic and many plans are still a pipe dream.“At this point, you may just need to choose your market,” Tim Crighton, head of EMEA at real estate advisory Cushman & Wakefield, said. Parker Lane Group, a UK-based returns facility with offices in Barcelona and Warsaw, said some clients were positioning goods to mitigate tariffs but others said very few of their customers had made any arrangements yet.“Retailers haven’t pulled the trigger just yet, because of the uncertainty around Brexit,” Al Gerrie of ZigZag said.By the time they do, there may not be much space left to lease.“If people want warehousing today, you’re looking at older, second-hand, more functionally awkward space, without the same height or loading doors of newbuilds,” Paul Weston, head of Prologis for the UK, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/christmas-coronavirus-and-fear-of-no-deal-brexit-push-europe-s-warehouses-to-the-limit/story-unanfJgG7QLTZxTs7ArJ2K.html

30-11-2020||World||Twitter suspends Thai royalist account linked to influence campaign||Twitter has suspended a Thai pro-royalist account linked to the palace that a Reuters analysis found was connected to thousands of others created in recent weeks spreading posts in favour of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and the monarchy.The Reuters review found tens of thousands of tweets that an expert said appeared to be from accounts amplifying royalist messaging in a push to counter a months-long protest movement that has swelled from opposing the government to breaking a longstanding taboo by challenging the monarchy.Internal army training documents reviewed by Reuters showed evidence of a coordinated information campaign designed to spread favourable information and discredit opponents.The pro-monarchy @jitarsa_school account was suspended after Reuters sought comment on Wednesday from Twitter on the recent royalist campaign on the social media platform, where protesters have long had a strong presence.Protesters and royalists have cited the importance of social media in propelling the protest movement, which has become the biggest challenge in decades to the monarchy as well as the government of former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha.Created in September, the @jitarsa_school account had more than 48,000 followers before its suspension.“The account in question was suspended for violating our rules on spam and platform manipulation,” a Twitter representative said on Sunday. She said the suspension was in line with the company’s policies and not a result of the Reuters request for comment.The account’s profile had said that it trained people for the Royal Volunteers programme, which is run by the Royal Office. A Facebook page for the Royal Volunteers School, which posts pro-monarchy videos and news of the programme, also identifies the Twitter account as its own.Neither the school nor the Royal Volunteers headquarters responded to requests for comment on the suspension. The “Volunteer Spirit 904” programme was established during the current king’s reign, which began in 2016, to build loyalty to the monarchy.The palace did not respond to a request for comment. It has a policy of not speaking to media and has not commented since the start of protests in July that initially targeted the government before breaking taboos by calling for curbs to the king’s powers.Royalist Fightback In recent weeks, royalist hashtags have begun trending on Twitter, an important platform for opponents of the government even before protests began in July.The Reuters analysis found that more than 80% of the accounts following @jitarsa_school had also been created since the start of September. A sample of 4,600 of the recently created accounts showed that all they did was promote the royalist hashtags - an indication of the kind of activity that would not be associated with regular Twitter users.A sample of 559 retweets of the account’s tweets were virtually all from accounts with bot-like characteristics, according to research by social media consultancy Drone Emprit for Reuters.“Government forces have been trying to counter the protesters,” said Saijai Liangpunsakul of the independent Social Media Monitoring for Peace group. “Twitter has taken down some accounts, but there are many more.”Hashtags promoted by the suspended account, usually alongside pictures of the king and other royals, included those that translate as: #StopViolatingTheMonarchy, #ProtectTheMonarchy, #WeLoveTheMotherOfTheLand, #WeLoveTheMonarchy and #MinionsLoveTheMonarchy.Royalist group leader Warong Dechgitvigrom declined to comment on the account’s suspension, saying he was unaware of it.He told Reuters there were more pro-monarchy messages on Twitter because royalists increasingly recognised the need to counter protesters’ messages and had encouraged each another to join the platform. “Pro-monarchy hashtags are authentic, born out of true feelings,” he said.Protesters accused by Royalists Royalists have accused protesters of inauthentic activity on Twitter, with coordinated campaigns around hashtags.But Parit “Penguin” Chiwarak, one of the protest leaders, said protesters using the platform were genuine and he welcomed the suspension of the pro-royalist account.“They’re not recruited to trend hashtags like the army and they don’t use taxpayers’ money,” he said.Although not directly linked to the @jitarsa_school account, a 28-page army document reviewed by Reuters showed an organised information operation to target “opponents” and spread pro-monarchy messages on Twitter. The document says 17,562 Twitter accounts run by 9,743 army officers are split into a “White Team” and a “Grey/Black Team” that were instructed to tweet with coordinated hashtags, as well as to like, retweet and follow one another.The document suggests measures to appear more like authentic accounts.The army on Saturday acknowledged the document is genuine, saying in a Facebook post it was used in a training session to strengthen the army’s public relations efforts. In early October, Twitter announced it had taken down 926 accounts linked to the Thai army for violating its platform-manipulation policies by amplifying pro-government content and targeting political opposition figures. The army at the time denied that the accounts belonged to army officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-suspends-thai-royalist-account-linked-to-influence-campaign/story-MgTzOmu5Vss505ISu7SYJK.html
30-11-2020||World||Covid-19 crisis widens gap between Russia’s richest and poorest regions||The coronavirus pandemic is set to widen the gulf between the richest and poorest parts of Russia as the government pushes the country’s far-flung regions to fend more for themselves.The federal authorities are pushing regional governments to borrow more to help pay for rising health care and other social costs during the pandemic. Regions will increase their net borrowing by 400 billion rubles ($5.3 billion) next year, compared with almost zero in 2020, according to estimates from NKR, Russia’s national credit ratings agency. Moscow will borrow a similar amount on its own.“The strongest regions will win out, the weakest will get even weaker,” said Stanislav Ponomarev, who invests in regional debt as a money manager at Transfingroup in Moscow. “Credit quality will decline.”Wealth inequality is already so high between different parts of Russia that a worker in Moscow can expect to earn four times more than someone in one of the four poorest regions. The gap has been exacerbated by the pandemic, which had a devastating impact on areas with underfunded health care.Russia’s 85 regions get a share of the money collected through taxes and other levies based on their spending requirements, and many face strict limits on how much they can borrow after taking on too much debt. Those rules will be reviewed in 2021, most likely to allow more borrowing.“Until recently the regions could rely on transfers from the center,” said Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance in Washington. “Regional governors are suddenly finding themselves in a position where they need to support local economies and become business friendly if they want to get any revenue to spend.”Russia’s Recovery Has Lost Momentum, Further Decline Is LikelyBudgets across the country have been hurt by a drop in tax revenue after incomes sank 4.3% this year. Regions that rely on tax revenues from the energy sector have also lost out. S&P Global Ratings estimates that regional budgets will run the widest deficits in two decades this year.St. Petersburg raised its borrowing limit several times in 2020 to 127 billion rubles to cover budget losses, according to the city’s government. The ceiling will increase to 225 billion rubles next year. The city was hurt by a tourism slump during the pandemic.Public debt has ballooned this year in the mountainous republic of Ingushetia, one of Russia’s poorest regions. The republic, rocked by years of violence following the wars in neighbouring Chechnya, is dependent on transfers from the federal budget, which this year failed to cover excess spending fast enough to help fight the pandemic.“Regions have more responsibilities than opportunities in terms of their own policies,” said Sofya Donets, chief economist at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. “Those with a larger service sector will be hit harder by the pandemic and the disparity of regional revenue will grow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-crisis-widens-gap-between-russia-s-richest-and-poorest-regions/story-uzgpCWIrOb9MNiyKmWifVO.html
30-11-2020||World||QAnon’s ‘independent and self-sustaining’ rise in Japan shows the conspiracy theory’s global spread||QAnon’s days as a solely US phenomenon are over.The conspiracy theory’s foothold in Japan -- home to one of its most active networks outside the US-- demonstrates how the movement can be made palatable in a range of countries as it gains popularity from Europe to Brazil.Research by social media analytics firm Graphika Inc. shows the Japan-based QAnon community is among the most developed international chapters, with distinct terminology, influencers, and behaviours -- such as idolizing Michael Flynn, a former US national security adviser in the Trump administration.“What we’re seeing now is an adaptation of US QAnon taking root in European countries, whereas in Japan and Brazil, it does seem to be slightly more independent and self-sustaining as an ideology,” said Melanie Smith, head of analysis at Graphika. She attributes the increasing prominence of QAnon to the US election and the pandemic.This internationalization presents an uphill battle for social media companies already facing increased pressure from governments to combat disinformation on their platforms in English, let alone myriad other languages. President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede the election to Joe Biden has prompted many of his supporters to say without proof that the election was stolen. Lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign and its GOP allies have failed in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona as the legal team has failed to produce any evidence of widespread fraud that would change the results. However Trump supporters’ accusations continue, potentially giving fresh life to conspiracy theories such as QAnon after the president leaves office.Like its US counterpart, Japan’s QAnon community centers on an unsubstantiated belief that Trump is battling to save the world from a cabal of pedophiles, including Democrats and “deep state” agents. While it’s hard to estimate the size of QAnon’s following in any country given its lack of official membership and overlap with other conspiracy communities, data from Google Trends show a sharp rise in Japanese interest in QAnon from late March to early April before tailing off somewhat.Japan’s community is perhaps most notable for its reverence of Flynn. He only served in the Trump administration for 24 days and resigned after acknowledging he had misled Vice President Mike Pence over communications with the Russian ambassador; he later pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents about their conversation and was pardoned by Trump last week. The Japanese group even styles itself QArmyJapanFlynn after the former general who popularized “digital soldiers,” a term many Q supporters use to describe themselves.Flynn follows several Japanese QAnon accounts, including @okabaeri9111 -- the Twitter linchpin of the community. The handle run by Eri Okabayashi has more than 80,000 followers, and says it is both the founder of QArmyJapanFlynn and sole official translator of Q content into Japanese. The most popular video translation of Q content on an associated Youtube account had more than 200,000 views before it was removed for violating the site’s content policy. By comparison, two Brazilian accounts Graphika described as “highly followed” in its August report had 54,400 followers and 16,800 followers at that time. The UK Facebook groups highlighted in the report had 10,000 to 11,000 members.In an email interview, Okabayashi described herself as a university graduate from “a medium-sized city in Japan” who has never lived abroad but taught herself English by watching US television shows. A few months after starting a Twitter account in January 2019, she was invited to join “a group of well-known QAnons” and became a follower.“Flynn was in the group” but stopped participating in about June last year, she said, without providing evidence. Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, didn’t respond to a request for comment.Okabayashi said her interest in QAnon stemmed in part from deep-seated doubts about Japan’s approach to women and motherhood. Economists have long warned that Japan’s low birth rate and shrinking population could spur a demographic crisis, as the labour force diminishes in a country with one of the world’s longest life expectancies.“I was convinced that a country that does not allow women in their twenties of childbearing age to focus on childbirth and child rearing will eventually die,” she said. Japanese female workforce participation has historically lagged other developed nations, but that is changing: a record 71% were employed in 2019, in part as a result of one of the world’s most generous parental leave laws.Okabayashi also expressed belief in domestic conspiracy theories, such as the baseless claim that Japan’s political and business elite -- including the Prime Minister -- are foreigners intent on exploiting and ultimately exterminating the Japanese race. She also said in a Twitter post that she is friends with QAppAnon, the pseudonym of former Citigroup Inc. employee Jason Gelinas, and has created a Japanese version of the popular QAnon website QMap.pub that he ran before it was shut down in September. Gelinas declined to comment.Other Japanese QAnon followers have also incorporated domestic issues. Some accounts have suggested without evidence that Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s early high approval ratings were fabricated by the media. The list of influential figures accused of belonging to the cabal includes Emperor Emeritus Akihito, and conspiracies have also circulated about the atomic bombings during World War II and the 2011 nuclear disaster that followed a devastating earthquake and tsunami.Adherents have even suggested, without evidence, that Japanese hit movie “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,” which involves demons eating people, is meant to acclimate people to QAnon conspiracies about pedophilia and cannibalism. Graphika also saw hashtags opposing a Japanese artificial-intelligence bill trend among the country’s QAnon accounts, a stance often linked to unfounded concerns about 5G mobile networks.While some Japanese QAnon accounts and posts are no longer available, major influencers like @okabaeri9111 continue to share prolifically. A spokesman for Japan’s Public Security Intelligence Agency declined to comment.No Japanese politician is seen by QAnon adherents as a hero -- none is aligned closely enough with the US president’s ideology. “Trump is pretty much the only political figure,” said Smith from Graphika, who noted that Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro was an exception. “The major challenge particularly for social media platforms is going to be being able to distinguish what is a QAnon account from what is a generally Trump account, from an anti-establishment account.”Both Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. are rolling out responses designed to limit the amplification of problematic posts, ranging from content warnings to removing certain posts. Facebook highlighted a public statement on its QAnon policy that outlines a full list of measures, saying “QAnon messaging changes very quickly and we see networks of supporters build an audience with one message and then quickly pivot to another.”A spokesperson for Twitter -- the more dominant platform in Japan, where it has more users than any other country outside the US -- said: “We have strong and dedicated teams of specialists who provide 24/7 global coverage in multiple different languages, and we are building more capacity to address increasingly complex issues.”Besides Japan, QAnon in Brazil has also developed a highly independent ecosystem, according to Graphika. European communities, by contrast, tend to more closely mirror US QAnon: German followers, for instance, often use English hashtags while applying the movement’s ideas to their own governments.The spread of QAnon globally could have real-world consequences such as decreased uptake of Covid-19 vaccines as more and more people see public health advice as part of “some kind of larger sinister plot,” said Chloe Colliver, head of digital policy and strategy at the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue.“Broadly, the spread of QAnon and conspiracies run the risk of diminishing trust in national and international institutions in any context in which it activates,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qanon-s-independent-and-self-sustaining-rise-in-japan-shows-the-conspiracy-theory-s-global-spread/story-CVb5fhGmshio6oirI4qwfP.html
30-11-2020||World||China stirs trouble with plan to hike retirement age from 60||China is making a new push to raise one of the world’s lowest retirement ages as it tries to cope with a rapidly aging population, a move that’s already fueling public discontent and will test the Communist Party’s ability to implement reforms.The ruling party alluded to the change earlier this month when it released an outline of its five-year economic plan, which included a recommendation to “implement postponing the retirement age.” China’s retirement age has remained unchanged for more than four decades at 60 for men and 55 for female white-collar workers, even as life-expectancy has risen. In places like Japan and Taiwan, most men and women can retire and start drawing a pension at 65. The global average was 62.7 years for men and 61.3 years for women, according to an analysis of 70 countries by insurer Allianz SE.The Communist Party’s statement produced a fierce backlash domestically, with tens of thousands of angry comments posted on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter. Top among the complaints were from those closest to retiring, expressing anger over the prospect of delayed access to their pensions. Younger people argued that an increase in older workers would reduce their employment opportunities.Even so, China is pushing ahead with the plans. “Delayed retirement is approaching,” the state-run China Business News said on its front page on Monday. It cited unnamed officials as saying that a “gradual and flexible approach,” had emerged as a consensus among policy makers.Shrinking PopulationExperts say raising the age at which workers are eligible for state-supported pensions is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of the retirement system. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think-tank, estimated in a report last year that the main pension fund for urban workers will peak at 7 trillion yuan ($1 trillion) in 2027, before declining to zero by 2035. The balance in 2019 was 4.3 trillion yuan.Raising the retirement age would also help China maintain economic growth, by slowing the rate at which the working-age population shrinks as a result of falling birth rates. Beijing estimates the number of people aged 60 or more will approach 487 million by 2050, compared with 254 million last year.China experienced a baby boom in the early 1960s, resulting in more than 200 million people who will reach 60 in the next decade. As a result, China’s leaders will have no option but to increase the pension age during the next five-year plan that begins in 2021, said Wang Feng, a demographer at the University of California, Irvine.“A massive number of people will reach this age during the next five years,” he said. “If they don’t act now that would impose a tremendous fiscal burden.”Read more | China’s factory activity expands at fastest pace in over three yearsEarlier ProposalsChina’s elderly dependence ratio, which compares the number of retired people to those in the workforce, will rise to nearly 33% by 2035, from about 17% this year, economist Cai Fang told reporters at a government briefing on Friday.A public backlash derailed a previous proposal to increase the pension eligibility age in 2012. China’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, which oversees pensions, included a recommendation for raising the retirement age during the current five-year plan period through 2020, but it wasn’t implemented.While the ministry will be charged with developing detailed proposals for implementation, the Communist Party’s most senior leaders would need to sign off on retirement reform, Wang said. Officials are likely to implement reforms gradually in an attempt to reduce public discontent, such as by applying the changes to some professions or regions before others, he said.Wang Xinmei, a pension economist at Zhejiang University, cited several other options that could be adopted as well.“We can start from some easy steps, for example, allowing competent people who want to work more to work more years voluntarily,” she said. One proposal is to increase the age by a year each year, though that is “much too fast,” she said. “We could increase faster in the early stage then slowly in the later stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-stirs-trouble-with-plan-to-hike-retirement-age-from-60/story-wQcGLplXJ8jjFVOct4Q3tO.html

30-11-2020||World||Nepal ties with India are warming up. China could complicate the situation | Analysis||Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s government is keen to move forward on its relationship with India and could take a positive view on a travel air bubble with India and the Pancheshwar multi-modal project after foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla’s two-day visit, people familiar with the matter said. Shringla had a 50-minute one-on-one conversation with PM Oli on November 26 that saw the two countries focusing on steps to normalise relations hit hard due to the Lipu Lekh boundary row.“They are keen to move forward on the relationship and will send some positive signals in this regard. But they also want the boundary issue to be discussed,” a senior official said. As the first step to deepen bilateral cooperation, the two countries could set up the travel air bubble and revive negotiations over the Pancheshwar multi-modal project. Foreign minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali is expected to be India in December for which the dates are being worked out.Relations between the two neighbours had nosedived this year after Nepal opposed an 80 km-border road to Lipulekh region that is claimed by Nepal. Kathmandu responded by issuing a new map that showed Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal.Also Read: In Nepal, how domestic politics is colliding with geopoliticsFor the last few months, the two countries have been taking quiet steps to restore the ties. India does not want to vacate the space in Nepal and allow China to create additional leverages in the Himalayan Republic.But diplomats in New Delhi and Kathmandu suggest there is some concern that China, which does appear to wield influence over Nepal’s politics and economy, could hold back Kathmandu.The continuing political flux in Nepal and the battle between the two co-chairs of Nepal Communist Party (NCP) - KP Sharma Oli and PK Dahal aka Prachanda - has added to the uncertainties around the ruling party, and created an opportunity for China to intervene.President Xi Jinping’s Communist Party of China has been keen that the Nepal Communist Party formed in 2018 after the merger to Nepal’s two communist parties - Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) (CPN-UML) and Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) - does not split. Chinese ambassador Hou Yanqi has been reported to have stepped in to bridge the divide between the two factions led by PM Oli and Prachanda in the past.Diplomats say the timing of Chinese Defence Minister General Wei Fenghe on Sunday was indicative of Beijing’s focus on Kathmandu and reinforcement of its multiple messages to PM Oli’s government and the opposition. During his day-long visit, General Wei held meetings with PM Oli, President Bidya Devi Bhandari and Nepal Army Chief Purna Chandra Thapa before leaving for Pakistan in the evening.PM Oli is believed to have suggested to ambassador Hou Yanqi at their meeting earlier this month that he is capable of handling challenges within his party without any assistance from other countries. But it is unclear if he can stand his ground.Beijing wants the Nepalese Communist movement to remain united so that the country remains antagonistic towards India. The other option in play is to squeeze PM Oli, who wants a rapprochement with India, out of the party and the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-signals-ties-with-india-are-warming-up-but-china-keeps-them-on-the-edge/story-aHG7Qabnim5cqjW6cUTU4K.html

Police spokesman Ajith Rohana said inmates created “unrest” at the Mahara prison located about 15 kilometers north of Colombo and prison officials took steps to control the situation.The incident comes as pandemic-related unrest has been growing in Sri Lanka’s overcrowded prisons. Inmates have staged protests in recent weeks in several prisons as the number of confirmed Covid-19 positive cases spiked in the country’s overcrowded jails. “The incident was started by a set of remand prisoners when they tried to force open a door and escape following which the authorities had to use force,” Rohana said.He said during the entire incident at least 37 more, including two jailors, were injured and all of them were transferred to the nearby Ragama hospital.The residents near the prison said smoke was coming out of the premises due to fire.Prisons authorities said the rioters had set fire to the kitchen and a record room of the prison.An attempt by the rioting inmates to take the jailors hostage was thwarted, officials said.Rohana said the detainees wanted them to be transferred elsewhere as the Mahara prison has detected over 175 Covid-19 infections among the inmates.From the mid of this month, prisons across the island went into a lockdown as infections were reported both among inmates and guards.Over 1,000 cases have been reported among those connected to prisons.In a similar unrest last week, an inmate was killed. Another prisoner died in March.Sri Lankan prisons are highly congested with more than 26,000 inmates crowded in facilities with the capacity of 10,000.Sri Lanka, which has been taking tough measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus, has reported 22,988 cases and 109 deaths due to the contagious virus, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-inmates-killed-37-others-injured-in-sri-lankan-prison-riot-report/story-GnGwdwP0psXdONQDqPoRGL.html

China’s Commerce Ministry called on US authorities to stop its investigation, while also disputing the preliminary finding.“The move seriously violated relevant international rules,” China’s ministry said in a statement on its website Saturday, citing an unidentified official. “We hope the US Department of Commerce will fully consider the evidence and counter opinions submitted by the Chinese side and correct the relevant wrong practices and conclusions.”Read more | China’s factory activity expands at fastest pace in over three yearsThe claim by the US that the yuan’s exchange rate to the dollar was undervalued by 5% in 2019 is “completely wrong” and isn’t supported by any analysis, the ministry said.

30-11-2020||World||Left bankless by sanctions, Hong Kong leader has ‘piles of cash’||Hong Kong’s chief executive Carrie Lam says that she has “piles of cash” at home because she is denied basic banking services due to US sanctions.In a television interview, Lam said the Hong Kong government has to pay her in cash because she does not have a bank account following sanctions imposed by the US on her and other officials for what it called their role in undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy from mainland China, including imposing a national security law on the city at the end of June.“Sitting in front of you is a chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR (special administrative region) who has no banking services made available to her,” Lam told Hong Kong International Business Channel. “I’m using cash every day, for all the things. I have piles of cash at home because the government is paying me cash for my salary because I don’t have a bank account.”US President Donald Trump imposed the sanctions in August on Chinese and Hong Kong officials including Lam; Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of China’s State Council; and Chris Tang, commissioner of the city’s police. Among other things, the sanctions mean any banks that do business with them risk penalties that would threaten their access to the US financial system.In October, the State Department sent a similar list to Congress naming 10 officials including Lam. US. since then has started a 60-day countdown to identify banks that have business with those people, putting lenders at risk of being sanctioned.Even China’s largest state-run banks operating in Hong Kong have had to comply to preserve their access to crucial dollar funding. Major lenders with operations in the US including Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp., and China Merchants Bank Co. have turned cautious on opening new accounts for the sanctioned officials, including Lam, Bloomberg News reported in August.Lam, who earns about HK$5.2 million ($672,000) in the year of 2020, said she only withdraws part of her salary, with the remaining kept in the treasury and she will take back her unpaid salary “at a point in time,” in comments to the South China Morning Post.“It’s very honorable in this set of circumstances to be so unjustifiably sanctioned by the U.S. government. It’s an honor,” Lam said. She has repeatedly blasted the US sanctions as unjustified interference in Hong Kong’s internal affairs.The new national security law, which criminalized subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, has enabled authorities to clamp down on Hong Kong’s political opposition, arresting pro-democracy activists and banning lawmakers from running in legislative elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/left-bankless-by-sanctions-hong-kong-leader-has-piles-of-cash/story-idbpaLGyhtT0o56zX74ouK.html
30-11-2020||World||US Congress returns with virus aid, federal funding unresolved||After months of shadowboxing amid a tense and toxic campaign, Capitol Hill’s main players are returning for one final, perhaps futile, attempt at deal-making on a challenging menu of year-end business.Covid-19 relief, a $1.4 trillion catchall spending package, and defense policy — and a final burst of judicial nominees — dominate a truncated two- or three-week session occurring as the coronavirus pandemic rockets out of control in President Donald Trump’s final weeks in office.The only absolute must-do business is preventing a government shutdown when a temporary spending bill expires on December 11. The route preferred by top lawmakers like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is to agree upon and pass an omnibus spending bill for the government. But it may be difficult to overcome bitter divisions regarding a long-delayed Covid relief package that’s a top priority of business, state and local governments, educators and others.Time is working against lawmakers as well, as is the Capitol’s emerging status as a Covid hotspot. The House has truncated its schedule and Senate Republicans are joining Democrats in forgoing the in-person lunch meetings that usually anchor their workweeks. It’ll take serious, good-faith conversations among top players to determine what’s possible, but those haven’t transpired yet.At a bare minimum, lawmakers need to keep the government running by passing a stopgap spending bill known as a continuing resolution, which would punt $1.4 trillion worth of unfinished agency spending into next year.That’s a typical way to deal with a handoff to a new administration, but McConnell and Pelosi are two veterans of the Capitol’s appropriations culture and are pressing hard for a catchall spending package. A battle over using budget sleight of hand to add a 2 percentage point, $12 billion increase to domestic programs to accommodate rapidly growing veterans health care spending is an issue, as are Trump’s demands for US-Mexico border wall funding.Read more | Donald Trump says 2020 election was probably least secure everGetting Trump to sign the measure is another challenge. Two years ago he sparked a lengthy partial government shutdown over the border wall, but both sides would like to clear away the pile of unfinished legislation to give the Biden administration a fresh start. The changeover in administrations probably wouldn’t affect an omnibus deal very much.At issue are the 12 annual spending bills comprising the portion of the government’s budget that passes through Congress each year on a bipartisan basis. Whatever approach passes, it’s likely to contain a batch of unfinished leftovers such as extending expiring health care policies and tax provisions and continuing the authorization for the government’s flood insurance program.Democrats have battled with Republicans and the White House for months over a fresh installment of Covid relief that all sides say they want. But a lack of good faith and an unwillingness to embark on compromises that might lead either side out of their political comfort zones have helped keep another rescue package on ice.The aid remains out of reach despite a fragile economy and out-of-control increases in coronavirus cases, especially in Midwest GOP strongholds. McConnell is a potent force for a smaller — but still sizable — package and has supplanted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as the most important Republican force in the negotiations.Pelosi seems to have overplayed her hand as she held out for $2 trillion-plus right up until the election. The results of the election, which saw Democrats lose seats in the House, appear to have significantly undercut her position, but she is holding firm on another round of aid to state and local governments.Before the election, Trump seemed to be focused on a provision that would send another round of $1,200 payments to most Americans. He hasn’t shown a lot of interest in the topic since, apart from stray tweets. But the chief obstacles now appear to be Pelosi’s demand for state and local government aid and McConnell’s demand for a liability shield for businesses reopening during the pandemic.At stake is funding for vaccines and testing, reopening schools, various economic “stimulus” ideas like another round of “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses especially hard hit by the pandemic. Failure to pass a measure now would vault the topic to the top of Biden’s legislative agenda next year.A spat over military bases named for Confederate officers is threatening the annual passage of a defense policy measure that has passed for 59 years in a row on a bipartisan basis. The measure is critical in the defense policy world, guiding Pentagon policy and cementing decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, military personnel policy and other military goals.Both the House and Senate measures would require the Pentagon to rename bases such as Fort Benning and Fort Hood, but Trump opposes the idea and has threatened a veto over it. The battle erupted this summer amid widespread racial protests, and Trump used the debate to appeal to white Southern voters nostalgic about the Confederacy. It’s a live issue in two Senate runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the chamber during the first two years of Biden’s tenure.Democrats are insisting on changing the names and it’s not obvious how it’ll all end up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-returns-with-virus-aid-federal-funding-unresolved/story-G11wHoG1l5gMuBpWZFC5qJ.html
30-11-2020||World||Brazil’s Bolsonaro suffers wave of defeats in mayoral races||President Jair Bolsonaro suffered big losses in Brazil’s just-completed municipal elections, with only five mayoral candidates he supported winning their races and none of them in the most important cities.The president’s worst rebuff came in his hometown of Rio de Janeiro, where Mayor Marcelo Crivella was battered in a runoff election Sunday, losing to his center-right predecessor, Eduardo Paes, by 64% to 36%. Crivella, an evangelical pastor, repeatedly used the president in his campaign to try to turn his fortunes.Another big defeat for Bolsonaro came in Fortaleza, Brazil’s fifth most populous city, where little known center-left candidate Sarto Nogueira topped Wagner Gomes, the president’s favorite, 51.5% to 48.5%. Gomes had led opinion polls before the campaign began and often displayed Bolsonaro’s support, but he sought to distance himself in the campaign’s waning days.A Bolsonaro candidate also lost in Belem, one of the capitals of the Amazon, though it was a close vote. Leftist Edmilson Rodrigues edged Everaldo Iguchi and will be the city’s mayor for a third time.The poor showing by Bolsonaro’s candidates began shaping up in the first round of municipal elections two weeks ago.Sao Paulo, a metropolis of more than 12 million people that is Brazil’s biggest city, gave just 10% of its vote to Bolsonaro’s candidate, Celso Russomanno, who finished fourth. Sunday’s runoff was between two critics of the president, and resulted in center-right Mayor Bruno Covas easily winning reelection over socialist Guilherme Boulos by 60% to 40%.Other candidates supported by Bolsonaro also failed to make it into Sunday’s runoffs in losing by wide margins in populated state capitals like Belo Horizonte, Recife and Manaus. His candidate also lost in Santos, one of the most important cities of Sao Paulo state.Of the 78 candidates who even ran by adding Bolsonaro’s name to their own on the ballot, only one won and that was one of the president’s sons, according to Brazil’s top electoral court. Carlos Bolsonaro, a key member of his father’s social media team, kept his seat on the Rio council with more than 71,000 votes — though that was fewer than the 106,000 he got four years ago.“Bolsonaro is clearly the biggest loser of the mayoral races,” said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University. “He failed to start a party, he failed to make his candidates stronger. It was almost as if he ignored these elections, but they gave a lot of leverage to parties he will have to talk to in congress. He is a weaker president because of these defeats.”The five Bolsonaro mayoral candidates who won did so in mid-size cities.In the first round two weeks ago, two candidates endorsed by the president won outright. Francisco de Assis de Moraes Souza, better known as Mao Santa (Holy Hand), won in Parnaiba, a city of 150,000 people in the impoverished state of Piaui. Gustavo Nunes was elected in Ipatinga, a prosperous city with an iron-ore based economy and 263,000 residents.The three who won their runoffs Sunday received the president’s endorsement only after the first vote. Tiao Bocalom won in Rio Branco, a state capital of 400,000 people near the border with Bolivia. Roberto Naves was elected in Anapolis, a city of 360,000 in central Brazil. Nelson Ruas dos Santos won in Sao Goncalo, a city of 337,000 outside Rio.Some of the winners Sunday who weren’t backed by Bolsonaro sent messages that their allies took to be aimed at the president.“It is possible to be in politics without hatred,” Sao Paulo’s incumbent mayor said after his victory. “There are only a few days left for denialists and obscurantism.” Sao Paulo Gov. Joao Doria, the main sponsor of Covas’ candidacy, is a potential bidder for the presidency in 2022.Eduardo Paes, the winner in Rio, said his triumph was “a victory of politics over radicalism.”After voting in Rio, Bolsonaro did not reply about the poor showing of his candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-bolsonaro-suffers-wave-of-defeats-in-mayoral-races/story-6rVBxhlfB5KIADjS1ViikK.html
30-11-2020||World||Pandemic: Merriam-Webster’s word of the year not a shocker||If you were to choose a word that rose above most in 2020, which word would it be? Ding, ding, ding: Merriam-Webster on Monday announced “pandemic” as its 2020 word of the year.“That probably isn’t a big shock,” Peter Sokolowski, editor at large for Merriam-Webster, told The Associated Press.“Often the big news story has a technical word that’s associated with it and in this case, the word pandemic is not just technical but has become general. It’s probably the word by which we’ll refer to this period in the future,” he said.The word took on urgent specificity in March, when the coronavirus crisis was designated a pandemic, but it started to trend up on Merriam-Webster.com as early January and again in February when the first US deaths and outbreaks on cruise ships occurred.On March 11, when the World Health Organisation declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, lookups on the site for pandemic spiked hugely. Site interest for the word has remained significantly high through the year, Sokolowski said.By huge, Sokolowski means searches for pandemic on March 11 were 115,806 per cent higher than lookups experienced on the same date last year.Pandemic, with roots in Latin and Greek, is a combination of “pan,” for all, and “demos,” for people or population. The latter is the same root of “democracy,” Sokolowski noted. The word pandemic dates to the mid-1600s, used broadly for “universal” and more specifically to disease in a medical text in the 1660s, he said.Also Read | India’s daily Covid-19 tally drops to 38,772; total recoveries nearing 8.9 millionThat was after the plagues of the Middle Ages, Sokolowski said.He attributes the lookup traffic for pandemic not entirely to searchers who didn’t know what it meant but also to those on the hunt for more detail, or for inspiration or comfort.“We see that the word love is looked up around Valentine’s Day and the word cornucopia is looked up at Thanksgiving,” Sokolowski said. “We see a word like surreal spiking when a moment of national tragedy or shock occurs. It’s the idea of dictionaries being the beginning of putting your thoughts in order.” Merriam-Webster acted quickly in March to add and update entries on its site for words related to the pandemic. While “coronavirus” had been in the dictionary for decades, “Covid-19” was coined in February. Thirty-four days later, Merriam-Webster had it up online, along with a couple dozen other entries that were revised to reflect the health emergency.“That’s the shortest period of time we’ve ever seen a word go from coinage to entry,” Sokolowski said. “The word had this urgency.” Coronavirus was among runners up for word of the year as it jumped into the mainstream. Quarantine, asymptomatic, mamba, kraken, defund, antebellum, irregardless, icon, schadenfreude and malarkey were also runners up based on lookup spikes around specific events.Particularly interesting to word nerds like Sokolowski, a lexicographer, is quarantine. With Italian roots, it was used during the Black Death of the 1300s for the period of time a new ship coming into port would have to wait outside a city to prevent disease. The “quar” in quarantine derives from 40, for the 40 days required.Spikes for mamba occurred after the January death of Kobe Bryant, whose nickname was the Black Mamba. A mass of lookups occurred for kraken in July after Seattle’s new National Hockey League franchise chose the mythical sea monster as its name, urged along by fans.Country group Lady Antebellum’s name change to Lady A drove dictionary interest in June, while malarkey got a boost from President-elect Joe Biden, who’s fond of using the word. Icon was front and center in headlines after the deaths of US Rep. John Lewis and US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg.The Merriam-Webster site has about 40 million unique monthly users and about 100 million monthly page views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-merriam-webster-s-word-of-the-year-not-a-shocker/story-4cG9jITBdIxwTCVVK3kBGJ.html
30-11-2020||World||Joe Biden suffers ‘hairline fractures’ in foot, will need walking boot: Doctor||US President-elect Joe Biden suffered “hairline fractures” in his right foot and will likely require a walking boot for several weeks, his physician has said, after the Democratic leader slipped and twisted his ankle while playing with his dog.“Initial X-rays did not show any obvious fracture, but his clinical exam warranted more detailed imaging,” Dr Kevin O’Connor said in a statement on Sunday.“Follow-up CT scan confirmed hairline (small) fractures of President-elect Biden’s lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones, which are in the midfoot. It is anticipated that he will likely require a walking boot for several weeks,” said O’Connor, Director (Executive Medicine) in GW Medical Faculty Associates, on Biden’s imaging results.Biden, 78, twisted his ankle on Saturday when he slipped while playing with Major, one of his two German shepherd. He was examined by an orthopedist “out of an abundance of caution”.In order to avoid disrupting regularly scheduled appointments on Monday, arrangements were made for President-elect Biden to receive an x-ray and then an additional CT Sunday afternoon, with the expected delays involved when opening closed offices and giving personnel time to set up, a Biden spokesperson said. On Sunday evening, President Donald Trump tweeted, “Get well soon!” Biden would be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on January 20 next. He would be the oldest person to be sworn in as the US president. Biden’s last health record was released in December 2019 by Dr O’Connor, an associate professor of Medicine at George Washington University.The physician said Biden is “healthy, vigorous” and “fit” to be the president. Biden does not use tobacco or drink alcohol and exercises five days a week. He is taking blood thinners and medication for acid reflux, cholesterol and seasonal allergies, said the health report.“Biden did spend a good deal of time in the sun in his youth. He has had several localized, non-melanoma skin cancers removed with Mohs surgery. These lesions were completely excised, with clear margins. He continues to receive close dermatologic surveillance,” it said. The Bidens adopted Major in 2018, and acquired their first dog, Champ, after the 2008 election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-suffers-hairline-fractures-in-foot-will-need-walking-boot-doctor/story-O5A8DRY4wnWuH1XfzLVA1I.html
30-11-2020||World||Support for Suga in Japan slides as Covid-19 wave worsens||Support for Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government slid for the second straight month, as the premier struggled to balance controlling the country’s worst-yet coronavirus outbreak with shoring up the economy.The premier’s support fell five percentage points to 58% -- a new low -- in a survey carried out by the Nikkei newspaper and TV Tokyo between Nov. 27-29. About 48% of respondents said they disapproved of his government’s handling of the virus, up from 35% a month earlier, the survey released Monday showed.Public approval could play into when he’ll call the next election, which must be held in less than a year, and dictate whether he can parlay his stop-gap position into a longer term in Japan’s top job.Also Read | Japanese travel campaign sparks debate on links to coronavirus spreadSuga is unlikely to opt for a January election so that he can focus on virus control, the Nikkei newspaper reported Saturday, after a week in which he was forced to suspend part of a travel incentive program aimed at bolstering regional economies because of spreading infections. While Japan’s total death toll, at just over 2,000, is by far the lowest among Group of Seven major economies, the country’s 7-day average of new cases is at its highest since the pandemic began.Summer is now the earliest likely option for the election, according to the Nikkei. Given Suga’s determination to stage the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics between July and September 2021, he could be forced to hold the vote in a narrow window before the end of the lower house term in October, a scenario that has played out badly for other Japanese leaders.His Liberal Democratic Party’s ruling coalition is set to retain power with the opposition mired in single-digit support rates. But Suga’s LDP could lose seats, raising questions about his longevity as leader and weakening his government’s hand as it pushes for priorities such as administrative reform and maintaining his predecessor Shinzo Abe’s ultra-easy monetary policy.Previously Abe’s right-hand man during his record run as premier, Suga scored the third-highest support rate for a prime minister on record when he was installed in September after his boss’s sudden resignation due to illness.Suga, the taciturn son of a strawberry farmer, was buoyed by his reputation for hard work and focus on pocket-book issues like reducing mobile phone charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/support-for-suga-in-japan-slides-as-covid-19-wave-worsens/story-C7DhNsMcXOpGYOXc7K7g2K.html
30-11-2020||World||Volcano in eastern Indonesia erupts, thousands evacuated||A volcano in eastern Indonesia erupted Sunday, sending a column of ash as high as 4,000 meters (13,120 feet) into the sky and prompting the evacuation of thousands of people.Nearly 2,800 people from at least 28 villages were evacuated from the slopes of Mount Ili Lewotolok, which is located on Lembata island of East Nusa Tenggara province, as the volcano began erupting, said Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Raditya Jati. There were no reports of deaths or injuries from the eruption.The Transportation Ministry said a flight warning had been issued after the eruption and a local airport had been closed as ash rained down on many areas of the island.Mount Ili Lewotolok has been erupting off and on since October 2017. The Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center raised the volcano’s alert level to the second-highest level on Sunday after sensors picked up increasing activity.The 5,423-meter (17,790-foot) mountain is one of three currently erupting in Indonesia along with Merapi on Java island and Sinabung on Sumatra island.They are among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines around the Pacific Ocean.After the eruption, the Disaster Mitigation Agency advised villagers and climbers to stay 4 kilometers (2.4 miles) from the crater and be aware of the peril of lava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/volcano-in-eastern-indonesia-erupts-thousands-evacuated/story-0aZl547EFYBddlyEhAFbpM.html
30-11-2020||World||Australia demands China apology for ‘repugnant’ Afghan tweet||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was seeking an apology from China after a diplomat in Beijing tweeted an image purporting to show an Australian soldier holding a knife to the throat of an Afghan child.The tweet, posted by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, was “repugnant,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra on Monday. The Australian premier said the image was doctored and called for Twitter to remove it.“The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post,” Morrison said. The tweet will diminish China’s global reputation, he said.Morrison’s calls for an apology further ramps up tensions between the nations, following China’s decision to impose crippling anti-dumping duties on its wine over the weekend. Diplomatic ties have plummeted this year after Australia called for independent investigators to be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origin of the pandemic, leading to a series of trade reprisals.Zhao’s boss later dismissed Morrison’s demand for apology, asking at a briefing in Beijing whether the Australian leader “lacks a sense of right and wrong.” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters that it was the Australian side that should apologize to Afghanistan and denied any link between the tweet to the broader dispute between the two sides.“That is totally unrelated with other issues between China and Australia -- it’s a matter of principle,” Hua said. “There are other issues between China and Australia, but the root cause for that is that Australia goes against basic norms of international relations and took wrong measures on issues bearing on China’s core interests.”Australian special forces soldiers serving in Afghanistan were allegedly involved in 39 unlawful killings of prisoners, farmers and other civilians, a government-commissioned report found earlier this month. Following a four-year inquiry, the report found there was credible information that 25 personnel may have been complicit and 36 matters should be referred to police for criminal investigation.General Angus Campbell, the head of the Australian Defense Force, said he “sincerely and unreservedly” apologized to the Afghan people when he announced the results of the probe.Zhao, who has more than 175,000 followers on the social network banned in China, has a reputation for stirring diplomatic disputes with Twitter posts. In March, he floated a conspiracy theory that the U.S. Army may have had a role in spreading the coronavirus in China, escalating a blame game in which President Donald Trump started referring to the disease as the “Chinese virus.”In his latest tweet, Zhao said he was “shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners” by Australian soldiers. “We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable,” he said.The tweet includes an image that purports to show a soldier standing on the Australian flag and holding a bloody knife to the throat of a child clutching a lamb. The child’s face is covered with a blue cloth. The text beneath the photo reads: “Don’t be afraid, we are coming to bring you peace!” Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, &call for holding them accountable. pic.twitter.com/GYOaucoL5DZhao is closely associated with “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy, a more confrontational approach named after a nationalistic Chinese action film series of the same name. The Wolf Warriors have come to the fore amid debates about China’s early efforts to contain the coronavirus and policies to suppress human rights in places like Hong Kong and the predominately Muslim region of Xinjiang.Australia is the world’s most China-dependent developed economy and finalized a free-trade agreement with Beijing in 2015. Relations have been fraught since 2018, when Canberra barred Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network.Ties went into free-fall earlier this year after Canberra’s call for the virus probe, a move that bruised China’s pride and unleashed a torrent of criticism that Australia is a puppet of the U.S. China has accused Australia of souring bilateral ties by interfering in its internal affairs, including criticism of Hong Kong’s national security legislation and the internment of Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic group living in Xinjiang.“There are undoubtedly tensions that exist between China and Australia, but this is not how you deal with them,” Morrison said of the tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-official-tweets-doctored-image-of-alleged-australian-war-crime-in-afghanistan-morrison-demands-apology/story-cuO9NCkncepfCycmww7KNL.html
30-11-2020||World||Biden to name Indian-American Neera Tanden to Cabinet in a historic first for Democrats||US President-elect Joe Biden is expected to name Neera Tanden director of the Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the administration’s budget and federal agencies, making her the first Indian-descent American to be appointed to a cabinet position in a Democratic administration.Tanden, who currently heads Centre for American Progress, a think tank, is expected to be named by Biden along with former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen as treasury secretary and Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton University economist, to chair the Council of Economic Advisers, according to The Wall Street Journal.Although Tanden will be the first Indian-American in the cabinet of a Democrat president, if confirmed by the Senate, she will be second overall for the community. Nikki Haley was the first as President Donald Trump’s US ambassador to the UN, a cabinet-rank position that was downgraded for her successors.“Big job and a real important first in the Cabinet. She has a great story (single mother, knows what it is to be poor) but went to Harvard and is the most well-versed person in progressive economics I have ever met,” said Shekar Narasimhan, a top fundraiser for Biden, and a close adviser to the campaign and the transition team who has known Tanden for a long time. He added, “I am (a) huge Neera fan!”Tanden, who went to Yale, was born in Massachusetts in 1970 to parents from India, who divorced when she was five. Tanden and her brother were brought up by their mother, as Narasimhan said. Tanden has spoken of her family relying on food coupons to get by. “On the heels of Kamala Harris set to become the next vice-president, it is great to see another well qualified Indian-American woman be nominated for a Cabinet level position,” said MR Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, an advocacy group for the community. “It is gratifying to see someone who has dedicated herself to public service be recognised for this important role to manage the budget of the country.”Biden, who injured an ankle while playing with one of his dogs on Sunday, also announced a path-breaking all-women press team for his White House with Jen Psaki as the most visible face of the team as press secretary. She is a veteran from the Obama administration and is well known and regarded among reporters covering the White House.Two more Indian-Americans are in the mix for other cabinet positions. Vivek Murthy, a physician and former surgeon general, is a leading contender for secretary of health and human services, a possibility that has been boosted by his appointment by Biden as co-chair of his advisory board on combating Covid-19, which, the president-elect has said will be his first task after assuming office in January. Others in the race are Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Hispanic governor of New Mexico, and Jeffery D Zients, director of former president Barack Obama’s National Economic Council.The second Indian-American among Cabinet potentials is Arun Majumdar. He is reported to be in the running for secretary of energy, to head a department whose key mandate includes the upkeep - not deployment or use - of America’s nuclear arsenal. The department traces its origin to the Manhattan Project.Majumdar, an alumnus of IIT Bombay, heads Stanford University’s Precourt Institute for Energy and is up against Ernest Moniz, Obama’s energy secretary who had played a key role in shaping the Iran nuclear deal, a signature foreign policy achievement of the Obama-Biden administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-name-indian-american-neera-tanden-to-cabinet-in-a-historic-first-for-democrats/story-4yg1EH6A4pJ8tax6VsMOLN.html
30-11-2020||World||New York City to reopen schools, even as Covid spread intensifies||New York City will reopen its school system to in-person learning, and increase the number of days a week many children attend class, even as the coronavirus pandemic intensifies in the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday.The announcement marks a major policy reversal for the nation’s largest school system, less than two weeks after de Blasio announced that schools were shutting down because of a rising number of Covid-19 cases in the city.Some elementary schools and pre-kindergarten programs will resume classes Dec. 7, a week from Monday, the mayor said. Others will take longer to reopen their doors.School programs serving special-needs students at all grade levels will open to in-person learning starting Dec. 10, de Blasio said.The plan for reopening middle and high schools is still being developed, de Blasio said.“We feel confident that we can keep schools safe,” he said.Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, said he supports de Blasio’s school reopening plan.“I think that’s the right direction,” the governor said in a conference call with reporters. “We do have new facts and information on schools.”New York City’s public schools opened to in-person learning starting in September for students whose parents had chosen bricks-and-mortar schooling. School buildings closed again Nov. 19 amid rising Covid-19 infections in the city.Also Read: US colleges mull new virus protocols for students’ returnMasks and social distancing were mandatory during the weeks that schools were open, and class sizes were a fraction of the pre-pandemic average of up to 25 to 30 students.About 190,000 students will be eligible to return to classrooms in the first round of reopening, just a fraction of the more than 1 million total pupils in the system. The great majority of parents have opted to have their kids learn remotely by computer.De Blasio said that many of those returning in person will be able to attend five days of class a week, up from one to three days previously.Students attending in person will be required to undergo frequent testing for the virus. Previously, the city had set a target of testing 20% of teachers and students in each school building once a month. Now, the testing will be weekly.The mayor said the city was doing away with its previous trigger for closing schools, which was when 3% or more of the virus tests conducted in the city over a seven-day period came back positive.“The idea of the hard number made a lot of sense back in the summer when we had not yet experienced all this,” de Blasio said.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicSince then, de Blasio suggested, relatively low numbers of positive coronavirus tests at schools show that it’s possible to keep schools open even with a citywide test positivity rate over 3%.Schools that are in Covid-19 orange zones designated by Cuomo because of rising infection rates will reopen according to rules set by the governor, de Blasio said.De Blasio said at a news briefing that he had discussed his reopening plan with Cuomo. “We all agree that we have a different reality than what we had in the summer and that this is now the way forward and the best way to protect everyone,” he said.Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the union supports the reopening plan as long as stringent testing is in place.“This strategy — properly implemented — will allow us to offer safe in-person instruction to the maximum number of students until we beat the pandemic,” Mulgrew said in a statement.Mark Cannizzaro, the president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, which represents principals, said school leaders “deeply understand the need for children to learn in person as regularly as possible, so long as all safety protocols are based on the guidance of medical professionals.”A parents group called #KeepNYCSchoolsOpen praised the mayor’s reopening plan but said it doesn’t go far enough. “Our schools never should have closed, and we are thrilled that 190,000 kids will be back in school next week,” the group said in a statement. “But the mayor has left behind 145,000 kids in grades 6-12, without any explanation or timeline for reopening. We will not rest until they are back in school, where they need to be.”New York City exceeded the 3% threshold early in November, and things have slightly worsened since then. More than 9,300 New York City residents have tested positive for the virus over the past seven days.Rates of positive coronavirus tests at school sites have remained low, however. A spokesperson for de Blasio said that more than 160,000 students and school staff members have been tested and that only about 0.25% of the results were positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-to-reopen-schools-even-as-covid-spread-intensifies/story-6TJ7Ox53EYf302NggFyrbM.html
30-11-2020||World||Baby born with antibodies in Singapore||A Singaporean woman, who was infected coronavirus in March when she was pregnant, has given birth to a baby with antibodies against the virus, offering a new clue as to whether the infection can be transferred from mother to child.The baby was born this month without Covid-19 but with the virus antibodies, the Straits Times newspaper reported on Sunday, citing the mother. “My doctor suspects I have transferred my Covid-19 antibodies to him during my pregnancy,” Celine Ng-Chan told the paper. Ng-Chan had been mildly ill from the disease and was discharged from hospital after two-and-a-half weeks, the Straits Times said.The World Health Organization says it is not yet known whether a pregnant woman with Covid-19 can pass the virus to her foetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the active virus has not been found in samples of fluid around the baby in the womb or in breast milk. Doctors in China have reported the detection and decline over time of Covid-19 antibodies in babies born to women with the coronavirus disease, according to an article published in October in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.China, meanwhile, said import applications from Chilean seafood producer Pesquera Isla Del Rey SA will be suspended for one week after a test on the packaging of a batch of frozen crab showed positive results for the pathogen.South Korean authorities announced a ban on year-end parties and some music lessons on Sunday and said public saunas and some cafes must also close after coronavirus infections surged.Hong Kong has reported 115 new infections, the first time it has seen cases in the triple digits since August 2. The government on Sunday announced that classes at kindergarten, primary and secondary schools will be shut for the rest of the year in light of the situation.In the US, San Francisco followed Los Angeles in imposing tighter restrictions as the country added 153,035 new cases on Saturday. New York City authorities shut down an illegal nightclub where almost 400 people broke social distancing rules to party. A mink farm in Oregon reported Covid cases in some staff and at least 10 mink.Police in London said on Saturday that they had made 155 arrests as they tried to break up anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine protests.

30-11-2020||World||At least 64 dead as Afghanistan violence spirals||Afghanistan witnessed its worst violence in recent months, with two suicide bombings killing at least 34 people, mostly soldiers in a military base. At least 30 members of Taliban were killed in separate clashes with troops.The suicide bombings targeted a military base and a provincial chief, officials said.There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the attacks, which took place as Afghan government representatives and the Taliban hold face-to-face talks in Qatar for the first time to end the country’s decades-long war.In eastern Ghazni province, 31 soldiers were killed and 24 others wounded when the attacker drove a military humvee full of explosives onto an army commando base before detonating the car bomb, according to an official in Afghanistan’s National Security Council. Ghazni’s provincial health department chief, Zahir Shah Nikmal, also confirmed the death toll and casualty figures from the attack.“Such terrorist attacks will create an atmosphere of fear, terror and pessimism among the Afghan people and will harm the peace process,” said Abdullah Abdullah, who is leading the overall peace process in Afghanistan. “The increase in violence is not acceptable to people... and runs against the peace process, negotiations and reconciliation.”In southern Afghanistan, another suicide car bomber targeted the convoy of a provincial council chief in Zabul province, killing at least three people and wounding 21 others, including children. Interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said a suicide bombing took place, without giving further details.At least 30 members of the Taliban, including six commanders, have been killed and 17 others injured in clashes in eastern province of Laghman, the Afghan government army’s eastern division, known as the 201 Selab Corps, said on Sunday.According to the army, insurgents attacked the Afghan security forces in the province’s Dawlat Shah district on Saturday. The security forces repulsed the attack, which also resulted in the arrests of six other local commanders and the Taliban’s intelligence chief for the district.The Ghazni attack comes just days after two bombs killed 14 people in the historic city of Bamiyan, ending years of calm in the isolated town.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-64-dead-as-afghanistan-violence-spirals/story-jKHReQPZc0K7XfyVjsf9LN.html
30-11-2020||World||US court tosses suit on mail-in votes||The US state of Pennsylvania’s supreme court dismissed another legal challenge to the election by supporters of President Donald Trump on Saturday, further reducing his already near-impossible odds of overturning the results.A Republican lawsuit had sought to invalidate mail-in ballots in the battleground state that President-elect Joe Biden won by about 81,000 votes - or to throw out all votes and allow the state’s legislature to decide the winner. The court dismissed both claims in a unanimous decision, calling the second one an “extraordinary proposition that the court disenfranchise all 6.9 million Pennsylvanians who voted in the general election.”The lawsuit argued that a Pennsylvania law from 2019 allowing universal mail-in voting was unconstitutional.The judges said that their November 21 challenge to the law was filed too late, coming more than a year after it was enacted and with the election results “becoming seemingly apparent.”Pennsylvania officially certified Biden’s victory there on November 24. The lawsuit had also sought to stop certification.Saturday’s decision follows a long line of similar ones, including a ruling the day before in which a federal appeals court flatly dismissed Trump’s claim that the election was unfair and refused to freeze Biden’s win in Pennsylvania.Trump has refused to give up on his claims of fraud in the November 3 election despite his repeated court defeats, tweeting bizarre conspiracy theories .He isn’t abandoning his drive to overturn the election results in Wisconsin, despite state officials announcing a recount in Milwaukee county had only added to Democrat Joe Biden’s lead. “The Wisconsin recount is not about finding mistakes in the count, it is about finding people who have voted illegally, and that case will be brought after the recount is over, on Monday or Tuesday,” tweeted Trump on Saturday.Speaking to reporters at a holiday market in Washington, Kamala Harris made a scoffing sound when asked whether she and President-elect Joe Biden would be prepared to run against Trump again.“Please,” said the vice president-elect, and laughed before thanking reporters and walking off. Trump had hinted he may try his luck again in 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-tosses-suit-on-mail-in-votes/story-vEzmIA6r8uqbrIgFfzauWJ.html
30-11-2020||World||Rockets hit Eritrea as Ethiopia says its forces defeated Tigray rebels||Rockets launched from Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region targeted the capital of Eritrea several hours after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed declared military operations in the region were over.The Ethiopian government launched a manhunt on Sunday for Tigray rebel leaders after announcing federal troops had taken over the regional capital and military operations were complete. Ahmed’s government has been trying to quell a rebellion by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), a powerful ethnically-based party that dominated the central government from 1991 until Abiy came to power in 2018. He said on Saturday evening federal troops had taken control of the Tigrayan capital Mekelle within hours of launching an offensive there, laying to rest fears of protracted fighting in the city of 500,000 people.The prime minister, who refers to the three-week-old conflict as an internal law and order matter and has rebuffed international offers of mediation, said federal police will try to arrest TPLF “criminals” and bring them to court.However, TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters in a text message on Saturday evening that TPLF forces would fight on, raising the prospect that the conflict could drag on. Thousands of people are believed to have been killed and nearly 44,000 have fled to Sudan since the fighting began on November 4. The conflict has been another test for Abiy, who took office two years ago and is trying to hold together a patchwork of ethnic groups that make up Ethiopia’s 115 million people. The flow of refugees and attacks into neighbouring Eritrea have threatened to destabilise the Horn of Africa region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rockets-hit-eritrea-as-ethiopia-says-its-forces-defeated-tigray-rebels/story-DSb1GqIecuVXgByw6OoycL.html

Six were wounded in the attack and eight remained missing as of Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigeria-at-least-110-farmers-killed-by-boko-haram-some-beheaded/story-NX9cnNvMwjUctF7cmA0KcJ.html
30-11-2020||World||Fire ban in Australia after hottest Nov night||Parts of Australia, including Sydney, sweltered through the hottest November night on record with temperatures likely to stay high on Sunday, prompting authorities to issue a total fire ban.Sydney CBD surpassed 40 degrees Celsius on Saturday while swathes of western New South Wales, South Australia and northern Victoria baked through even higher temperatures nearing 45 degrees.Temperatures are expected to cross 40 degrees for a second straight day on Sunday while the Bureau of Meteorology has predicted a five or six-day heatwave for parts of northern New South Wales and southeast Queensland.The predictions for soaring temperatures prompted the Australian Energy Market Operator to say demand may exceed supply in New South Wales on Sunday afternoon.Australia has been experiencing hotter and longer summers with last season dubbed “Black Summer” by Prime Minister Scott Morrison due to unusually prolonged and intense bushfires that burned nearly 12 million hectares, killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion animals.The Rural Fire Service issued a total fire ban for most of eastern and northeastern NSW for Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-ban-in-australia-after-hottest-nov-night/story-fUDWdFj02YlorDRmiE1MdI.html
30-11-2020||World||Sikh separatists, politicians in Canada, UK wade into farmers’ protest row||Jagmeet Singh, the leader of Canadian Federal Opposition New Democratic Party (NDP) has waded into the controversy surrounding the ongoing farmer protests in India.In a tweet, Singh described the “violence perpetrated” by the government against “peacefully protesting” farmers as “appalling”. Stating he stood in “solidarity” with the farmers, he called upon the Indian government to “engage in peaceful dialogue” with them.His brother Gurratan Singh, an MLA in the Ontario assembly also joined in, tweeting he felt the “pain and struggle of farmers protesting laws that threaten their livelihoods.”Pro-Khalistan separatist groups in Canada have also joined the chorus of opposition to the farm laws against which the protests are being held. Sukhminder Singh Hansra, the senior member of Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) Canada branch, wrote to Canada’s foreign minister François-Philippe Champagne, seeking intervention to protect the “fundamental rights” of the protesting farmers, adding that the Canadian Sikh community was “monitoring the situation very closely.” Hansra, one of the leading proponents of Khalistan in Canada, framed the matter in terms of self-determination.The separatist Sikhs for Justice has announced plans to open call centres in US, Canada, UK, France and Germany to take online applications to “reimburse” farmers for their losses, while also trying to leverage that promise into registering them for the Khalistan Referendum. The SFJ has been forced into postponing the so-called Referendum 2020 to next year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Meanwhile, the farmers’ protests resonated in the UK too. Labour MPs of Indian origin criticised the alleged police measures against the farmers, while many Sikhs held a car rally in Southall recently in support of the farmers.Preet Kaur Gill, Labour MP from Birmingham Edgbaston and chair of the All Party Parliamentary Party for British Sikhs, reacted to images of protests from Delhi: “This is no way to treat citizens who are peacefully protesting over the controversial Farmers Bill in India”.“Shocking scenes from Delhi. Farmers are peacefully protesting over controversial bills that will impact their livelihoods. Water cannons, and tear gas, are being used to silence them,” she added.Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Labour MP from Slough, posted images from the protests on social media and said: “It takes a special kind of people to feed those ordered to beat and suppress them. I stand with farmers of the #Punjab and other parts of #India, including our family and friends, who are peacefully protesting against the encroaching privatization of #FarmersBill2020”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sikh-politicians-separatists-in-canada-wade-into-farmers-protest-row/story-Ls6no8yBl3HDqREIEydbhL.html
30-11-2020||World||Hundreds of Honduran migrants set out for US amid pandemic||About 2,000 Honduran migrants hoping to reach the United States entered Guatemala on foot Thursday morning, testing the newly reopened frontier that had been shut by the coronavirus pandemic.Guatemala’s president quickly vowed to detain them and return them to Honduras, saying the migrants represented a threat to the health of Guatemalans amid efforts to contain the pandemic.“The order has been given to detain all those who entered illegally, and return them to the border of their country,” President Alejandro Giammattei said in a broadcast address to the nation. “We will not allow any foreigner who has used illegal means to enter the country, to think that they have the right to come and infect us and put us at serious risk.”Giammattei issued an order that would suspend some constitutional rights in the provinces they were expected to pass through, apparently in order to facilitate detaining them.”Authorities had planned to register the migrants as they crossed earlier Thursday and offer assistance to those willing to turn back, but the group crossed the official border at Corinto without registering, pushing past outnumbered Guatemalan police and soldiers who made little attempt to stop them.In one group were four teenagers, all friends and neighbours from San Pedro Sula, from which hundreds of migrants had set out the previous night. The teens decided to leave after seeing others organize on Facebook.The youngest, 15-year-old Josty Morales, said he wanted to live the “American dream” and was looking for a way to support his 6-month-old son at home.“There’s no work. The necessity strangles you,” he said.Within hours of the border crossing, Guatemalan authorities reported the first migrant death. A person tried to climb aboard a moving flatbed trailer, but fell under its wheels. Authorities did not immediately provide any additional details.Central American migrants began travelling in large groups in recent years, seeking safety in numbers and in some cases avoiding the cost of smugglers. Calls for a new migrant caravan to leave Oct. 1 had circulated for weeks on social media.The odds of a large migrant caravan reaching the U.S. border, already low, have grown increasingly slim over the past year. Under pressure from the United States, Mexico deployed its National Guard and more immigration agents to break up attempted caravans last year. They dispersed large groups of migrants attempting to travel together in southern Mexico. Actually crossing into the U.S. legally is virtually impossible now with pandemic, and entering illegally is as difficult as ever.The departure of the new group was reminiscent of a migrant caravan that formed two years ago shortly before U.S. midterm elections. It became a hot issue in the campaign, fuelling anti-immigrant rhetoric. While the caravans draw attention, they really only account for a small fraction of the daily migration flow by small groups that pass unnoticed through Central America and Mexico.By mid-afternoon the migrants who crossed into Guatemala on Thursday had strung out in small groups for miles (kilometers) along the highway, as some caught rides and others walked under the hot sun.Christian Martínez, 19, saw leaving as a way out when few other options were apparent in Honduras. “If we stay what is left for us is to become criminals because there’s no way to survive,” he said.Already halfway to Guatemala City, Martínez and his companions had advanced on foot and with the occasional ride. They said they all carried masks but weren’t worried about the pandemic.The larger group that set out Wednesday night appeared to be mostly young men, though there were the occasional small children being pushed in strollers.At the border, Guatemalan officials were asking the migrants to provide documents showing a negative Covid-19 test — even though last week they said they wouldn’t require a test for those spending less than 72 hours in the country.But about 2,000 migrants hustled through without registering. In addition, AP journalists saw others crossing the border illegally near the formal crossing. There were no reports of violence.Guatemala’s military said it was establishing interior checkpoints to review migrants’ documents. In the past, authorities have set up roadblocks deeper in the country to winnow down larger groups. A regional agreement allows citizens of Honduras to transit through Guatemala.Governments throughout the region made it known they were watching Wednesday.Mexico’s immigration agency said in a statement that it would enforce “safe, orderly and legal” migration and not do anything to promote the formation of a caravan. The U.S. Embassy in Honduras said on Twitter Wednesday that migration to the U.S. was more difficult than ever right now — and more dangerous because of the coronavirus.But the factors driving migrants to leave Central America certainly haven’t eased during the pandemic. As economies have suffered, there are ever fewer jobs to be had, and the struggle for families to put food on the table has only worsened. Some migrants also cited the ever-present high rate of crime.The U.N.’s International Labor Organization said Wednesday that at least 34 million jobs have been lost in Latin America due to the pandemic. The ILO lists Latin America and the Caribbean as the worst-hit region in the world in terms of lost working hours, with a drop of 20.9% in the first three quarters of the year.The flow of migrants north from Central America had slowed dramatically during the pandemic as countries throughout the region closed their borders. Most migrant shelters along the principal routes closed their doors to new arrivals as they tried to keep the virus from spreading to vulnerable populations. Mexico and the United States deported hundreds of migrants back to their home countries to try to empty detention centres.Guatemala has now opened all of its borders, including the one with Mexico. But the U.S.-Mexico border remains closed for non-essential travel, and the U.S. government effectively shut down the asylum system at its southern border during the pandemic.Mexico tried to bus asylum seekers stuck at its northern border to other parts of the country and back to their home countries. Mexico has typically offered migrants the opportunity to seek asylum there, but many have their minds set on the United States. Migrants are also likely to find it more difficult to find work in Mexico now as the economy is expected to contract 10% this year due to the impact of the pandemic.

30-11-2020||India||Govt invites Kisan Union for talks on Dec 1 at Vigyan Bhawan: Narendra Singh Tomar||Amid ongoing protests by farmers against the new farm laws, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday invited leaders of the farmer unions for talks on December 1.The meeting will be held at 3 PM at Vigyan Bhawan here, the minister said.“On November 13 we decided to conduct next round of talks on December 3 but Farmers continued their protest and with the Covid situation and with winters we decided that we needed to talk before December 3 and resolve the situation. That is why on December 1 at 3 pm in Vigyan Bhawan all Kisan Unions are invited who were present in the first round of meeting,” Tomar told ANI here.Tomar said that farmers were under some misunderstanding regarding the newly enacted farm laws and the government is committed to have talks with the kisan unions who were present in first round of meeting with the government.“Under Modiji leadership, in the last six years, for farmer income increase many historic work was done. When the new farm amendment laws came, farmers had some myths in their mind. We conducted two sessions of meeting with Kisan Unions, the first on October 14 at at the Secretary level and on November 13 I was there with Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash and spoke to Kisan Unions,” Tomar added.The farmers had rejected the Centre’s ‘conditional’ offer to hold talks, saying that they will not accept any conditional dialogue and threatened to block entry points to the national capital.Farmers from different states have gathered at north Delhi’s Burari ground while others are camping at the borders to the national capital. The agriculture minister also requested the farmers to leave the agitation and come for the talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-invites-kisan-union-for-talks-on-dec-1-at-vigyan-bhawan-narendra-singh-tomar/story-wAjGI4gUXindQKUUeH6ClL.html
30-11-2020||India||Karnataka High Court says BJP MLC cannot be appointed minister||The Karnataka High Court on Monday ruled that nominated legislative council member AH Vishwanath cannot be appointed as a minister as his disqualification was still operative.Vishwanath a former President of the state unit of Janata Dal (S), who was an MLA from Hunsur, was one of the 17 ‘rebels’ from Congress and JDS who resigned from assembly membership and helped topple the JDS-Congress coalition government last year.The then speaker Ramesh Kumar had disqualified him as well as other legislators. However, while all the other defectors got re-elected to the assembly on BJP tickets, two of them - MTB Nagaraj and Vishwanath were defeated. Another ‘defector’ R Shankar chose not to contest the by-poll.While Nagaraj and Shankar were elected to the legislative council, Vishwanath was nominated under the ‘litterateur’ category by the Governor to the upper house on the recommendation of the state government as he is the author of a few books.Hearing a bunch of public interest litigation petitions, a division bench of the Karnataka high court headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Vishwajit Shetty ruled that “The Governor will take into consideration the disqualification incurred by Vishwanath, while the disqualification ceased to be operative in case of Nagaraj and Shankar as they were elected to the legislative council, if a recommendation is made by the Chief Minister to appoint them as ministers.”While others have been accommodated with ministerial berths, Vishwanath, Shankar, Nagaraj and Munirathna who was recently elected in the recent bypolls have been waiting to be inducted into the cabinet. Chief minister Yediyurappa in turn is waiting for the party high command’s nod before expanding his cabinet. Karnataka can have a maximum of 34 ministers including the CM and currently there are seven vacancies.The ruling by the HC means that Vishwanath’s often repeated ambition to be ‘recognized for sacrifice made and rewarded with ministry’ may not fructify for the present. While Vishwanath was not reachable for comments, a BJP spokesperson said, “What is there for us to comment, it is a court ruling and everybody has to follow it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-high-court-says-bjp-mlc-cannot-be-appointed-minister/story-yHqujwFnbg6HsOI0V11HoO.html
30-11-2020||India||Businesses get 4 months to implement QR code-based payment system||Businesses with turnover of Rs 500 crore or more have been given a four-month window until March 31, 2021, to implement QR code-based digital payment system without attracting penalty, two officials said. The move will promote digital India and check rampant misuse of fake invoices to misappropriate input tax credit under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.The government had also instructed tax officials to verify deemed GST registrations granted to business entities without Aadhaar authentication between August 21 and November 16 this year to ascertain that they are undertaking genuine business activities and not using these firms to generate fake invoices, the officials said requesting anonymity.The decisions have been taken at a high-level meeting in the Department of Revenue (DoR) recently, which is an arm of Union finance ministry that administers matters related to direct and indirect taxes, they said.“It was decided to give a one-time waiver on penalty provisions for four months period till March 31, 2021, on the condition that the stakeholders would set up necessary process during this period to go-live with QR code on invoices by April 1, 2021, thereby enabling GST on UPI [Unified Payments Interface],” one of the officials said.Also read: BJP leaders meet again, say govt ready for talks as farmers remain defiantIn order to create a cashless society, on March 21, 2020, the government mandated the issuance of invoices with dynamic QR code by registered business entities with turnover exceeding 500 crore. The system was to be effective from December 1 this year. The system requires dynamic QR codes for issuing invoices to customers or unregistered persons to track transactions.The Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (CBIC), an arm of the DoR, is taking several measures to check tax evasion through fake invoices, a second official said. “One such move is verifying business activities of all such entities that have been granted deemed GST registration,” he said.It was noticed that many unscrupulous people were misusing the easy GST registration system to con the exchequer by generating fake invoices and misappropriating ITC, he added. Currently, the GST law permits deemed registration after 21 days of application.An entity having deemed registration where the applicant has not opted for Aadhaar authentication has to go for mandatory physical verification of the premises, he said. “In cases where the physical verification is difficult, certain additional documents may be called for verification by the tax officer before deciding upon grant of registration,” he added.The CBIC has also come out with standard operating procedure (SOP) for officers to carry out physical verification of entities that have been granted a deemed GST registration without Aadhaar authentication, he said.“This SOP would effectively curb the menace of fake invoices and ITC frauds while at the same time this would ensure proper facilitation of ease of doing business for the genuine applicants/entities without any overreach,” he added.Meanwhile, the government has also intensified its nationwide crackdown against fake GST invoices. The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has so far arrested 92 persons for availing or passing on ineligible ITC fraudulently through fake invoices and have booked 994 cases against more than 3,161 fake GST registered, the second official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/businesses-get-4-months-to-implement-qr-code-based-payment-system/story-X6a6couScgBRueNwQcULdO.html

30-11-2020||India||Nagaland Governor shoots down NSCN’s demand for separate flag, Constitution||Nagaland Governor and Centre’s interlocutor for Naga peace talks, RN Ravi on Monday said the government of India is absolutely clear that there shall be only one national flag and Constitution in India. “Anyone talking anything contrary is peddling preposterous lies. They are trying to confuse and mislead the people,” he said in his message to the people of the state on the eve of Nagaland’s 58th statehood day. His message drew condemnation from the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM), the largest Naga rebel group. The governor’s reference to the flag and constitution comes against the backdrop of the demand of a separate Naga flag and Constitution by the NSCN (IM) which has been holding talks with the government of India for the past 23 years.Maintaining that India’s territorial integrity and sovereignty is supreme, Ravi stated that the Centre has never ever talked, much less negotiated with anyone on the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. “Any misadventure to disintegrate this great nation shall not be tolerated,” he said, while pointing out that ‘the right decision taken today will determine our future and the destiny of our coming generations’. He mentioned that with common understanding having been reached on all the issues on the table and conclusion of talks on October 31, 2019, the people of Nagaland are anxiously waiting for a new dawn. However, he went on to allege that there are some people who are standing as “a roadblock” to the aspirations of the people of Nagaland.“I urge these people to see the writings on the wall, to come out of their make-believe echo-chamber and listen to the voice of the people and in a true democratic spirit respect their wishes,” the governor said. Ravi said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dynamic and visionary leadership, fundamental anomalies and distortions in the ongoing peace process have been corrected by making it truly inclusive.Stating that Nagaland state is an abiding testimony to the triumph of the politics of peace over the politics of bloodshed, he maintained Naga political issue belonged to the Naga people and no single entity should claim the sole franchise over it.“Nagas have existed and survived through centuries through their customary and traditional institutions. The traditional village institutions and the tribal bodies are the primary stakeholders in the Naga political issue. Their freely expressed wishes and decisions are paramount in any settlement. They have clearly expressed their mind. They demand conclusion of the endless peace process without any further delay,” Ravi said. He said disrespecting the primary stakeholders was an insult to the people of Nagaland, therefore, any attempt to intimidate or threaten them will invite the wrath of the people and full might of the laws of the land, he added.The governor paid tributes to the leaders of the Naga Peoples’ Convention, martyrs and countless Nagas whose blood, toil, sweat and sacrifices he said had led to the birth of the 16th state of the Indian Union with extraordinary constitutional safeguards for their unique identity and interests.The NSCN-IM issued a statement condemning governor Ravi’s stand on the peace talks.“Naga people are fully aware of the divisive, extraordinary involvement of Nagaland state Governor RN Ravi behind this commemoration program in order to justify his all out efforts to protect the 16 Points Agreement at all costs,” the statement said.The group made it clear that the history of Naga political struggle and the ongoing political talk is a living testimony that the present Nagaland state was the brainchild of a few treacherous Nagas that showed up in the name of Naga People’s Convention hijacking the Naga issue without the concern of the bona fide “freedom fighters”.“The Convention without the consent, support and participation of the Naga people arrived at an agreement called the 16 Points Agreement that was responsible for the creation of Nagaland as the 16th state of the Indian Union. This fragmented the Indian-occupied Naga territories by placing them into different administrative units of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh,” the NSCN-IM said. It stated that the Naga people would never allow another political hijacking to take place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-governor-shoots-down-nscn-s-demand-for-separate-flag-constitution/story-CXEpXS0DKNAzUwUxGNXWGM.html

Those arrested have been identified as Akram Ali alias Abdul Qadir, Lalit Mishra and Keshvanand Mishra alias Rinku. Rakesh Singh (45), who was working for a local newspaper, and his friend Mithlesh Sahu (36), suffered serious burns in a fire at his house in Kalwari village, Balrampur.While Sahu died on the spot, Singh suffered 90 per cent burns and was referred to a Lucknow hospital where he succumbed to injuries, the police said.The Balrampur police had constituted four teams to solve the murder mystery. Balrampur superintendent of police (SP) Dev Ranjan Verma told media persons that alcohol-based sanitizer was used to set the journalist and his friend on fire. “First the culprits served liquor to Rakesh Singh and Mithlesh Sahu. When the two were under the influence of liquor, the culprits set them on fire with the help of alcohol-based sanitizer,” Verma told media persons. Commenting on the motive behind the murder, Verma stated that personal enmity was behind the murder and the investigation was still going on to ascertain all facts. He denied the use of explosives in the incident. “The culprits had tried to frame the murder as a mishap and fled away from the spot after committing the crime,” added Verma. According to the district police chief two more persons were involved in the crime who will be arrested soon. Earlier on Sunday, the district administration handed over a cheque of Rs 5 lakh to the wife of the deceased journalist, officials said.In a statement, police said that the cheque was handed over to the family of the deceased by legislator Paltu Ram.The administration will also ensure that the two daughters of Rakesh Singh get free education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanitizer-used-to-burn-scribe-to-death-in-up-s-balrampur-3-held-police/story-S9lga0W2VpZf3lMkE3A3VP.html

Shop owners and employees living in containment zones shall not be allowed entry into marketplaces, it stated.According to the SOPs, COVID-appropriate behaviour in marketplaces may be regulated by market associations through a number of measures, including creation of a sub-committee for each market to facilitate and monitor implementation of such behaviour in marketplaces.It also suggested setting up mask dispensing kiosks at government-approved rates at entry points of markets and parking lots, establishing hand washing stations in public utility areas while recommending use of foot operated taps and contactless soap dispensers.It also sought for providing mass thermal screening provisions at the entry and access points to the market, procuring thermal guns, sanitizers, disinfectants for sanitization of public utility areas and placement of IEC materials and signages regarding COVID appropriate behaviour in prominent locations. “Where self-regulatory approach fails or lacks impact, the planning shall also entail taking enforcement actions, wherever warranted. This may include levying of fines/penalties on defaulters for not wearing mask/face cover, or for not following physical distancing norms. “Exploring the option of allowing markets/shops to open on alternate days and closure of markets in case larger number of cases are getting reported which are found to be having epidemiological links with the market by the administration,” the SOPs stated.The ministry said market places are visited by a large number of people. With gradual opening of economic activities, markets are witnessing high footfalls, it said. “Such large gatherings, without observance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour have the potential to spread coronavirus infection,” the SOP document stated.It also suggested strategies that can be worked out by the law enforcing agencies in collaboration with market associations to manage crowd such as engaging civil defence volunteers, home guards and volunteers to regulate crowd, accessing control at parking lots for limiting vehicle entry and exploring staggered time of shops and utilities, thereby allowing them to remain open for longer duration.“Crowd density does not remain the same throughout. It usually peaks during evening hours on weekdays. On weekends and holidays, marketplaces are crowded for most of the day till late in the evening. Planning should specifically factor-in requirement for these peak days/hours,” the document noted.According to the guidelines, at the entry point of shops, all employees and visitors should undergo mandatory hand hygiene and thermal screening and only asymptomatic employees and visitors shall be allowed inside shops while a face-cover or mask has to be worn at all times inside and outside shops.To prevent the risk of transmission of coronavirus, it is crucial that healthy environment is maintained at marketplaces, the SOPs said and recommended sanitization by shop owners prior to resumption of daily activities.Market associations shall facilitate maintaining healthy environment of public utility areas and open spaces through their own means and through local urban bodies and civic agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fines-for-not-wearing-masks-discounts-for-shopping-during-lean-hours-among-centre-s-sops-for-markets/story-WDsmX3T4Lc9sVK0oUojXiP.html

Union of India”.The plea also sought directions to the government to take appropriate action to ensure implementation of the recommendations made in the 2014 report, by the Expert Committee on issues relating to transgenders acting under aegis and directions, in compliance with the direction of the Supreme Court.It sought the formulation of appropriate rules and laws that will govern the protection of rights of the marginalized transgender community in the prisons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-delhi-high-court-to-classify-transgender-as-third-gender-in-ncrb-s-prison-statistics/story-avwiYfbB7P6Lydws1vAnZM.html
30-11-2020||India||Expelled BJD MLA in Odisha faces heat as CID starts probe into job scam||Expelled Biju Janata Dal MLA Pradeep Panigrahy may face trouble as the crime investigation department (CID) of Odisha police on Monday started their investigation into the alleged involvement of Akash Pathak, son of tainted IFS officer Abhay Pathak in a job scam in Ganjam district, officials said.Abhay Pathak and his son Akash were arrested on November 27 and have been remanded in judicial custody till December 9Panigrahy, 57, was expelled from the primary membership of the regional party on Sunday on charges of indulging in anti-people activities. The party, however, did not specify the charges which led to the summary expulsion of the three-time MLA who was once the blue eyed-boy of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. Soon after the expulsion, the police put barricades outside Panigrahy’s house.On Monday, S Dharmaraj Reddy of the Congress who contested against Panigrahy from Gopalpur in 2019 and lost, lodged an FIR with local police seeking action against Panigrahy for defrauding 68 youths of the area promising them jobs through fake appointment letters.“Panigrahy through Akash Pathak (who was due to marry Panigrahy’s daughter next month) collected crores of rupees from the unemployed youths promising them jobs but left them high and dry. He also collected money from local sand exporters. The MLA has been terrorising the youths when they asked about the jobs,” the Congress leader alleged in his FIR.Officials said if some of the youths of Gopalpur who were allegedly conned by Akash Pathak with the promise of jobs in Tata Motors lodge complaints with CID and local police it may end up embroiling the former BJD leader.“If some of the defrauded youths lodge a complaint that Panigrahy acted hand in glove with Pathak, he may be arrested. It seems quite improbable that Akash Pathak would have defrauded so many people of Gopalpur area without the complicity of a local politician. A detailed investigation would surely bring out the truth,” said a CID official.Assembly Speaker Suryo Patro said if Panigrahy has to be arrested in a case involving cognisable offence, the police need not seek his permission. “The police just need to inform the Speaker after the arrest,” he said.The state government is also looking at possible corruption angle of Panigrahy while he was minister of state for rural development and minister of state higher education and science and technology between 2014 and 2017. Sources said the vigilance department would soon scan the files of the rural development department as well as the higher education department.Panigrahy claimed he was paying the price for writing several letters to chief minister Patnaik on Covid-19 mismanagement as well as other issues related to the pandemic.“The state government was initially not in favour of bringing back the migrant workers following the outbreak of Covid-19. It seems that I am now paying up the price for writing to the Chief Minister. I also raised the issues of mismanagement in Covid centres as well as the treatment procedures of Covid patients,” said Panigrahy.Post-expulsion, the three-time BJD MLA is now an unattached MLA. If he defects to some other party he would lose his MLA seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expelled-bjd-mla-in-odisha-faces-heat-as-cid-starts-probe-into-job-scam/story-YkhFQxcIp2Sibp3i7HbKRK.html
30-11-2020||India||India refuses to support China’s Belt and Road project at SCO meet||India on Monday didn’t join other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in backing China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which New Delhi has consistently opposed as a key part of it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). BRI or the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, President Xi Jinping’s flagship programme for trade and connectivity, was backed by Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in a joint communiqué issued at the end of the SCO council of heads of government meeting hosted by India. The communiqué said the other countries, while “reaffirming their support for China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ (OBOR) Initiative (BRI), note the ongoing work on joint implementation of this project, including efforts to bridge construction [between] The Eurasian Economic Union and OBOR”. The council of heads of government is SCO’s second highest body and is responsible for handling the trade and economic agenda. This was the first time India hosted a meeting of the body since it was admitted into the eight-member grouping in 2017. India has repeatedly said it will not join BRI because it does not offer a level playing ground to the country’s businesses. It has also opposed BRI because a key component – the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) – passes through PoK. New Delhi’s trade concerns related to Beijing were a key factor behind India’s decision not to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the trade deal recently signed by the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and Australia, China, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash noted that the SCO meeting was held at a time when India is decoupling from China and it was “no longer business as usual” between the two countries. There is also an “unholy alliance” between China and Pakistan that will thwart India’s initiatives, he said. One of India’s main objectives for joining SCO was the desire to forge deeper ties with Central Asian states but the country now needs to assess whether these “efforts were commensurate with the results”, Prakash said. During Monday’s meeting, the heads of delegations said SCO has established itself as an effective platform for cooperation for strengthening multilateralism, rule of international law and the UN Charter, and ensuring “equal, mutual, indivisible, comprehensive and reliable security [and] sustainable socio-economic development”. The heads of delegations called for deepening of cooperation to support a transparent, open, inclusive, fair, non-discriminatory multilateral trading system based on principles and rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and to promote an “open world economy”, the communiqué said. The SCO members also stressed the need to reform WTO, including by improving its key functions such as negotiations, monitoring and dispute resolution. They also pointed to the importance of using international and multilateral organisations to form a “space of broad, open, mutually beneficial and equal interaction in Eurasia”. India proposed the creation of a special working group on innovation and start-ups and an expert working group on traditional medicine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-doesn-t-join-sco-members-in-endorsing-china-s-belt-and-road-project/story-CBH22ODWVImRFpwkkhehWI.html

Without naming the Congress party, the Prime Minister said that the statue would have come back to its original home in Varanasi if such efforts were made earlier.Also Read :India giving befitting reply to anti-national forces, PM Modi says in VaranasiWhile talking about legacy and inheritance, PM Modi said for him the country’s heritage rests only in its culture and values, unlike many others in this country, who value family above all. “It is true that if so much effort was made earlier, the country would have got back many such idols. But some people have different thinking. For us, heritage means the country’s heritage but for some people, heritage means their name and their family’s name. For us, heritage means our culture, our faith. For them, heritage means their own statues, their family photos,” he said while taking part in the Dev Deepawali celebrations in his parliamentary constituency.Also read:Doubts being spread against farm reforms, this has become a new trend: PM Modi in Varanasi“It is due to your blessings that Kashi’s inheritance is coming back.

When Kashi decided that Vishwanath Corridor would be built till Baba’s court, the protesters had a lot to say about it too, but today the glory of Kashi is being revived by the grace of Baba.

30-11-2020||India||Farmers protest impact: Supply of vegetables, fruits from other states impacted||The supply of vegetables and fruits to the city from other states has been impacted and it has been halved at Azadpur Mandi, one of Delhi’s largest wholesale market, owing to the protest by farmers at the Singhu and Tikri border points of the national capital for the last five days. Vendors in other parts of Delhi said due to curtailed supply, the wholesale rates of seasonal vegetables has gone up by Rs 50- Rs 100. They said the roadblock at Singhu and Tikri border has impacted supply of vegetables and fruits from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.The arrival of vegetables and fruits to Delhi’s largest wholesale market at Azadpur has been reduced by half due to the closed borders, said Adil Khan, chairman Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee at Azadpur. “During normal days, around 2,500 trucks of vegetables and fruits used to arrive at Azadpur Mandi from other states. The number has come down to around 1,000 trucks now and if the borders remained closed for a few more days, the situation will worsen,” Khan said.He, however, said the rates have not registered any significant rise so far because local produce and stocks are being sold.Some other vendors said the wholesale rates of seasonal vegetables has already gone up by Rs 50- Rs 100 due to the short supply.They said due to obstructions at the border, the trucks are finding it difficult to reach Delhi and those somehow managing to do so are getting delayed by several hours.  “The supply and rates will have further impact if the borders are not opened and traffic is brought back to normal,” they said.Gopal, a wholesale commission agent of green pea at Azadpur market, said supplies have drastically reduced. Normally 40-45 trucks of peas from Punjab’s Amritsar-Hosiarpur belt would arrive on a given day in winters but it has reduced to 15-20 trucks now, he said.“The rates have gone up due to reduced supply and hike in transport charges that have increased by around Rs 10,000 per truck,” he said.The trucks from Punjab carrying fruits and vegetables that would normally take around 9-10 hours for a trip to Delhi, now takes 12-14 hours due to closure of Singhu border, said another wholesaler.The reduced supply has also pushed retail rates in the markets of the city. The rates of potatoes, tomatoes and onion that were already high, have relatively been less affected, said the wholesalers.“The major supply of potatoes and onions to Delhi are from states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and MP and the routes to these states are not affected by the farmers’ stir. “However, supply of vegetables and fruits from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir has been affected,” said Hakim Rahman, a wholesaler at Okhla Mandi.Some wholesalers said the supply was badly impacted for two days of the farmers’ protest but now it has been restored as the trucks were using alternate entry points and routes to enter the city from other states.“The supply had reduced initially for two-three days as the farmers blocked the Singhu and Tikri borders. But, now, the trucks are using other roads and avoiding highways although it has resulted in longer hours of travel and increased transportation charges,” said a vegetable commission agent Srikant Mishra at Azadpur Mandi.He said the supply of new crop of potatoes has also been hit.A fruit wholesaler at Azadpur Mandi, R K Bhatia, said the supply of fruits like apple and Kinnow was hit but rates were more or less the same. Apple in Kashmir was not good this season, so rates were already high and demand was less, he said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Pravin Kapoor claimed that availability of vegetables and fruits is getting short in Delhi and requested Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to pay attention towards the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-impact-supply-of-vegetables-fruits-from-other-states-impacted/story-wIQGh39KR9ocDDz9LAcFUK.html
30-11-2020||India||BJP leaders brainstorm for second day, say govt ready for talks with farmers||Eager to break the deadlock with famers who are agitating for scrapping the new farm laws, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership held meetings for a second consecutive day on Monday and sent out the message that the Union government is ready for talks. Union home minister Amit Shah met Union minister for agriculture, NS Tomar earlier in the day to discuss the strategy to break the logjam. A senior party functionary said, “The message from the top is clear that the laws are not anti-farmers and that the farmers are being misled. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reiterated that laws will offer better opportunity for the farmers.” The functionary said the government is ready to sit across the table and discuss the new laws and “address whatever concerns” the farmers have. Speaking in Varanasi, the PM on Monday said the laws have given farmers new options and legal protection. He lashed out at the opposition for “misleading” the farmers and said earlier decisions of government were opposed now rumours have become the basis for opposition and propaganda is being served even though the laws favour the farmers. The party has also opted for a cautious, measured response to the agitation. Even though it is pinning the blame on the opposition for provoking the protest, it is taking care not to rile the farmers. “The farmers are innocent. They are being misled by those with vested interests. The laws have barely been implemented and their impact is yet to be ascertained, so how can people rush to call these anti-farmers,” said Rajkuamr Chahar, head of the BJP’s Kisan Morcha. He said the Punjab unit of the Morcha has been communicating with the farmers’ representatives and has relayed the government’s willingness to address their concerns. On Monday, even as the party tried to diffuse the anger against the bills, its ally the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) joined the chorus for the rollback of the laws. Rajasthan lawmaker and RLP chief, Hanuman Beniwal, shot off a letter to Shah, seeking the reversal of the laws. “….In view of the countrywide sentiment in support of the ongoing farmers’ movement, the recently introduced three bills related to agriculture should be immediately withdrawn. (The Centre must) implement all recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, and immediately hold dialogue with farmers in Delhi,” he said. The BJP, however, played down the ally’s demand. Its national spokesperson on economic issues, Gopal Krishna Agarwal said, “We assure all, including our NDA partners that farmers’ well-being and welfare are in our heart. Large scale market reforms are needed and that has always been the consensus.” He went on to add that while the BJP opposes misgivings about the APMC mandis being dismantled and MSP being withdrawn, the opposition is politicizing the issue along with the Arhtiyas (commission agents) and middleman. “We have offered all the basic facilities to farmers, drinking water, toilets, shelters and medical facilities. They have been given permission to protest and also been invited for dialogue. We are open for all discussions on the merits or demerits of the three bills. If farmers have certain serious concerns, we are ready to listen to them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-brainstorm-for-second-day-say-govt-ready-for-talks-with-farmers/story-Cp7MfBpPiWb90PSE5iVEMM.html
30-11-2020||India||PM Modi to chair all-party meet to take stock of Covid-19 pandemic||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to chair an all-party meeting on December 4 to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the country said a person aware of the details. The Prime Minister will meet the floor leaders of all parties that have more than five MPs in Parliament to assess the situation on the ground. At the meeting, which will be held through video-conferencing, the PM is likely to take up the issue of the government’s preparation for the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. The PM has so-far interacted with six companies involved in the producing the vaccine. On Monday, over video conferencing he interacted with teams from Gennova Biopharma, Biological E and Dr. Reddy’s. A statement issued by the PM’s office said, “The PM appreciated the efforts being taken by the scientists in these companies to come out with a vaccine solution to tackle Covid-19. The potential of various platforms for vaccine development was also discussed.” Modi also asked the companies to come out with their suggestions and ideas regarding the regulatory processes and related matters and suggested they take extra efforts to inform the general public in simple language about the vaccine and related matters such as its efficacy etc., the PMO said. “Matters relating to logistics, transport, cold chain etc in respect of delivering the vaccines were also discussed…The PM advised all the departments concerned to engage with the manufacturers and seek to resolve matters so that the efforts by these companies bear fruit in order to serve the needs of the country and the entire world,” the statement said. The all-party meeting comes close on the heels of the Prime Minister’s meeting with a group of chief ministers on November 24. In that meeting the Prime Minister had underlined the need to collectively curb the transmission of Covid-19 and bring the positivity rate under 5%. The Prime Minister had reiterated the need to guard against the spread of the virus and had asked the states to set up task forces or steering committees at district and block levels to prepare for the Covid vaccine programme. Last week, the Union home ministry also released guidelines for surveillance and containment to consolidate the gains that have been achieved against the spread of the virus. The new guidelines which will come into force from December 1, empower the states to impose local restrictions including night curfew to check the spread of the virus. In April the Prime Minister had interacted with the floor leaders of all the parties through video conference. At that meeting he had suggested that it may be necessary to extend the 21 day lockdown that was imposed in March and spoken about the government’s priority to save lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-chair-all-party-meet-to-take-stock-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-mn9S9UhvntN83h7FOrnhwN.html
30-11-2020||India||‘Messing up Hindutva’: BJP on Sena leader’s azan chanting competition||Shiv Sena’s South Mumbai zonal head Pandurang Sakpal’s announcement to hold azan chanting competition on the lines of Gita chanting competition has led to a controversy with the BJP alleging that the party is trying to appease Muslims. Hitting out at the Sena, its former ally, the BJP accused it of having given up on Hindutva advocated by late Bal Thackeray for the sake of vote bank politics. “Sakpal has given Balasaheb Thackeray’s reference while advocating his attempt to appease Muslims. Balasaheb had opposed the use of loudspeakers in masjids for namaz. Today, the party has messed up with the Hindutva for the sake of vote bank. Sakpal is known to be a close confidant of Sena leader Sanjay Raut, who has been compromising with the fundamental ideology of the party just to save the government,” said leader of opposition and party leader Pravin Darekar said.The azan chanting competition will be held for the school going Muslim students from South Mumbai, said Sakpal. The purpose, said the Sena leader, is to encourage the students from the community for the holy chanting. He said that the azan chanting sounds melodious and he has always been inquisitive about it.“Many students from the community chant azan very skilfully. I think the competition is a first attempt of its kind. It is an age old tradition among the Muslims and nobody should oppose it. Azan is as holy as Mahaarati among Hindu citizens,” he said.The competition will be organised by the Sena and the prizes will be given out to the winners after their selection by a panel of maulanas.Azan is the call to ritual prayer made by a muezzin from the minaret of a mosque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/messing-up-hindutva-bjp-on-sena-leader-s-azad-chanting-competition/story-qPeLuiqiHORf3BOGA4KJjP.html

30-11-2020||India||TN, Assam allow opening of educational institutions; Rajasthan closes all till Dec 31||Tamil Nadu and Assam on Monday announced that some higher education institutions would reopen from December as Covid-19 cases have started coming down in these states. Rajasthan, on the other hand, closed all schools till the end of December to prevent spread of the disease.The educational institutions were supposed to open from the first week of November but most states postponed the reopening as the Covid-19 cases were rising. Only a few states have announced the re-opening of the educational institutions so far.Tamil Nadu government on Monday allowed reopening of classes for all final year undergraduate students from December 7 across arts and science, technical, engineering and agricultural programs.In a statement, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said the state will continue to remain in Covid-19-induced lockdown till December 31 but announced some relaxations. Classes for undergraduate and postgraduate students in medicine-related courses will resume from December 7 but classes for first-year students who have been admitted in the 2020-2021 academic year will begin only from February 1, 2021.Assam’s health and education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday said that classes in elementary schools from kindergarten to Class 6 will resume from January 1 and hostels in residential schools and colleges will start in a limited manner from December 15.Also read: Delhi government caps price of RT-PCR test by private labs at Rs 800“The Covid-19 situation in Assam is satisfactory and under control. But keeping in mind the situation in other parts of India and the world, we are on the alert,” he said.Till Sunday, Assam had recorded 212,617 Covid cases with 981 deaths. At present, there are 3,350 active cases in the state. The recovery rate is 98 per cent while the death rate is at 0.46 per cent. Sarma said the number of positive cases has continuously gone down in November starting from 325 average daily cases in the first week of November to 158 cases daily in the last week.Though Assam had allowed the resumption of offline classes from Class 7 and above earlier, the junior classes had not started in schools. Sarma informed that classes will start in a staggered manner and detailed SOPs will be announced within the next few days.Students will be allowed to attend classes based on written consent from parents while students staying in hostels will be allowed entry only after they undergo Covid-19 tests.In Rajasthan, the government announced that all educational institutions will remain closed till December 31 as the state imposed lockdown in containment zones and extended the night curfew to 13 districts from earlier eight. Night curfew will not be applicable for industry factories having night shifts, pharmacies and marriages.“Rajasthan is at a critical juncture in its fight against Covid-19. Over the last few weeks, the number of new cases has been rising. The confluence of certain factors, such as recent festival season, the onset of winter and laxity in the observance of the Covid-19 guidelines, pose the risk of the situation becoming aggravated, thus putting a strain on the health infrastructure,” said Abhay Kumar, principal secretary, home, while issuing the new guidelines.The order also said that in areas outside containment zones, schools, colleges, educational and coaching institutes will remain closed till December 31. Also, cinema halls, theatres, entertainment parks, social or religious, or any large congregation will not be permitted to function.Rajasthan has recorded over 2.65 lakh Covid-19 cases and death of 2,292 people with the daily average of over 3,000 cases since Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-assam-allow-opening-of-educational-institutions-rajasthan-closes-all-till-dec-31/story-8aJOl48vQe2Cv6Zyy1xFbP.html
30-11-2020||India||Superspreader protest? As experts worry about Covid-19, farmers say new laws bigger threat to their survival||The shadow of the pandemic looms large and experts warn their agitation could well be a Covid-19 superspreader but farmers, some in masks and many without them, protesting in Delhi and at gateways into the city say the new farm laws pose a greater threat to their survival. As thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana but also from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, protest at the national capital’s border points and in north Delhi’s Burari ground for the fifth day on Monday, Covid-19 continues its spread. There have been few signs of social distancing during the protests that started last week with the farmers, banded under various organisations, leaving their homes and moving towards Delhi. “A protest is a mass gathering and thus from a public health perspective, I would urge protective and preventive behaviour against the spread of coronavirus infection, failing which a superspreading event might set in,” cautioned Dr Samiran Panda, head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases division at the Indian Council of Medical Research. Seeking strict compliance with norms, he said It is important to note that SARS-COV-2 is a transmission efficient virus and such gatherings are conducive to its spread.Many of the farmers, threatening to block all five entry points into the capital, said they are aware the infection is still raging but the Centre’s new farm laws are a bigger threat. Gurmeet Singh from Faridkot in Punjab, for instance, has been at the Burari ground, one of the largest in the city, for three days and counting. And he has no intention of moving. For him, and hundreds of other farmers at the North Delhi ground where they were allowed to congregate, the three contentious farm laws are a bigger disease.“We may even survive corona, but how will we survive this cruel law that will take away our bread and butter,” Gurmeet told PTI.In another corner of the sprawling ground, a team of seven medicos from Delhi’s AAP government has tested over 90 farmers for Covid-19 since November 28.“There have been no positives as yet,” said a medical officer on the condition of anonymity.“We tested 40 people on the 28th, then another team took over, and today we have tested 50 people so far,” the officer said. Several e-rickshaws roamed the ground to create awareness of the disease and the necessity of wearing masks and maintaining hand hygiene. But the message appeared to be getting drowned out in the slogans, protest songs and speeches. Gursharanjeet Singh from Bilaspur, Uttar Pradesh, said his family is entirely dependent on produce from their six-acre farm. “If we stay careful we won’t get corona, but if we don’t protest against these farm laws and this government we will definitely die of hunger,” he said.His desperation finds resonance at the Singhu and Tikri border points, where farmers have been camping in large numbers. Some volunteers were distributing masks to the protesting farmers. As the farmers, many who came in tractor-trolleys and trucks in preparation for a long haul, continued their protest, two doctors, Sarika Verma and Karan Juneja, were at Singhu, urging farmers to wear masks and maintain social distancing.“We are also offering treatment if anybody faces any problem or injury,” Verma said. Delhi has already been witnessing a spike in Covid-19 cases post Diwali celebrations and with pollution levels increasing. On Sunday, the city recorded 4,906 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday and 68 fatalities, taking the total number of cases to 5,66,648 with 5,22,491 recoveries. The number of India cases is 94,31,691 with 38,772 new infections, according to Union Health Ministry data on Monday. Dr K K Aggarwal, president of the Confederation of Medical Association of Asia and Oceania (CMAAO) and former IMA president, said the farmers’ agitation should not have been allowed by the government.Politics should never get precedence in a pandemic, he said. “Government has the powers under the Diseases Epidemic Act to take control of any situation which can spread the infection,” he said.“The farmers’ agitation will end up in superspreading events which will not only be a danger to Delhi but also to the whole country,” he asserted. As experts worry at the lack of safeguards to prevent the infection from spreading, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said the farmers fear they will lose their livelihoods. “The new farm laws brought by the (Narendra) Modi government are a bigger threat than coronavirus…,” the farmer leader told PTI over the phone. Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher asked why coronavirus posed a serious threat to life only during the farmers’ agitation, and not during the recent Bihar assembly polls. “When Bihar elections took place, where was Covid-19? When any political gathering takes place, where is coronavirus?” he asked, an apparent reference to the election rallies. He claimed the issue comes up only when farmers begin an agitation for their rights.A spokesperson for the BKU’s Haryana unit led by Gurnam Singh Charuni said farmers are trying their best to keep Covid-19 at bay. “As much as we can, we are trying to follow the guidelines. But at the moment thousands of farmers are saying that getting the Centre’s farm laws rolled back is the first priority as these will anyway destroy them,” he said. He said it is now up to the Centre to accept their demands. When asked if they fear that the infection may spread as thousands have gathered over a large area, he said, “No farmer fears this disease at the moment. All they have on their minds is to get these laws rolled back.” At the Sonipat border, a Haryana Health Department official said they have so far distributed 5,000 masks to the protesting farmers. “Also, after every kilometre we have stationed an ambulance,” he said. Mobile toilets have also been installed at various points and sanitisation is being regularly carried out, he added. The health department also plans to carry out random tests for Covid-19. The contentious laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Unions have expressed apprehension that the new agri-marketing laws enacted at the Centre will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving farmers the mercy of big corporates. The government, however, says that the new laws give farmers options to get higher prices for their crops and the MSP regime will still continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/superspreader-protest-as-experts-worry-about-covid-19-farmers-say-new-laws-bigger-threat-to-their-survival/story-GdzBJEjurcybjPtwwWrEBJ.html

Some of the accused inteh gold smuggling case had visited the port on several occasions and they used their proximity with the higher-ups to get the shipments released,” said a senior official, who did not want to be named. He also said that clearing officials and agents will be questioned soon. He said details of all recent shipments from Persian Gulf countries have been sought from port authorities and Customs. The central agencies are also planning to probe some of the former officials of the Cochin Port Trust and Customs. The senior official said more information emerged after retrieving vital data from the destroyed phones of some of the accused in the gold smuggling case. Investigators also traced a private phone reportedly used by Sivasankar. The gold smuggling racket came to light on July 5 after the seizure of 30 kg of yellow metal from a consignment addressed to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in the state capital. Thirty-four people have been arrested so far in the case. One of the alleged key funders Rabins Hameed was extradited from the UAE last month and another key suspect Faizal Fareed will be brought from the UAE next week, the official said. The NIA is also planning to slap the UAPA against Sivasankar, former secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Smuggling was included in the list of anti-national activities with an amendment to the UAPA last year. Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate raided the Uralungal Labour Co-operative Society headquarters in Vadakara north Kerala on Monday and sought details of some of the works being carried out by the society. It is learnt that the raid was in connection with the ongoing investigation against the CM’s additional private secretary C M Raveendran. But society president Ramesan Paleri said it was not a raid and officials were given details that they sought. The Labour Co-operative Society which is involved in construction business, is very close to the ruling CPI(M) and most of its office-bearers are party workers. The ED is also planning to summon Raveendran in a couple of days, the official said. He was summoned last month but he could not appear before the central agency after he tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cochin-port-comes-under-scanner-as-kerala-gold-smuggling-probe-expands/story-mTTO1Jrz3ERuPG6cLrupgL.html

The nation is giving a befitting reply to the expansionist forces, to those trying to infiltrate into India or those trying to break India from India,” he said ar Raj Ghat in his parliamentary constitution of Varanasi.The Prime Minister also talked about the ancient idol of Goddess Annapurna, stolen from a temple in Varanasi and smuggled out of the country in 1913, which will be brought back to India from Canada. “There is another special occasion for Kashi. More than 100 years ago, the idol of Mata Annapurna that was stolen from Kashi is now coming back again. Mother Annapurna is returning home once again. It is a matter of great fortune for Kashi,” he said.The Prime Minister said these ancient idols of our gods and goddesses are a symbol of our faith as well as our priceless heritage. It is also true that if such effort had been made earlier, the country would have got back many such statues. But some people think in a different way, he said. “For us heritage means the country’s heritage. While inheritance means for some people, their family and their family name. For us heritage means our culture, our faith, our values. For them, heritage means their idols and family photos,” he said.“Today, along with the banks of Ma Ganga, Kashi is celebrating Dev Deepawali and with the blessings of Mahadev, I also got an opportunity to take dip in the light of the festivities,” he said in his address.The Prime Minister lit a lamp at Raj Ghat in Varanasi during the Dev Deepawali, a festival of light and fervour in Varanasi celebrated on the full moon of the Hindu month of Kartik 15 days after Diwali. The stairs at the ghat have been decorated with flowers and a red carpet and artists have created rangolis and painted pots. Officials have been said 1.1 million earthern lamps will be lit on the banks of the river.Before this, PM Modi offered prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple along with chief minister Yogi Adityanath. He also launched the Pawan Path website which will provide information about temples of Kashi. The Prime Minister also inaugurated the six-lane widening project of the Handia in Prayagraj to Varanasi’s Rajatalab section of National Highway 19 during his visit. The 73-km stretch of the newly widened and six laned NH19, made with a total outlay of Rs 2,447 crore, is expected to reduce the travel time between Prayagraj and Varanasi by one hour, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.Modi said during one of his speeches that farmers, who have been protesting the three farm laws, said they they were being misled and reiterated that the deregulation would benefit them. “The new agricultural laws have been brought in for benefit of the farmers. We will see and experience benefits of these new laws in the coming days,” he said and blamed the opposition for spreading rumours about the future of farmers.As PM Modi concluded his speech, he said that the stream of development will keep flowing like Ma Ganga. He will go to Sarnath and would watch a light and sound show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-giving-befitting-reply-to-anti-national-forces-pm-modi-says-in-varanasi/story-DqppzueB8AHE0rr2ydAniO.html

SCO charter has a provision that one country cannot hold up cooperation in areas and allows member countries which are interested to take it forward with the exclusion of one country that is opposing,” MEA secretary Vikas Swarup said.Swarup said that India considers SCO as an important regional organisation to promote cooperation in the areas of peace, security, trade, economy and culture. “We are committed to deepening our cooperation with SCO by playing a proactive, positive and constructive role,” the MEA secretary said.Also read: PM Modi, Imran Khan to skip SCO summit todayEarlier in the day, India indirectly cornered Pakistan for using terrorism as an instrument of state policy and called for collective efforts to combat the menace during a meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government.Vice president M Venkaiah Naidu, who chaired the virtual meeting of the council, hurled the attack without naming Pakistan and said, “India condemns terrorism in all its manifestations.

30-11-2020||India||Our ‘Go South’ policy blends with India’s ‘Act East’: Taiwan’s representative tells HT||In his first interview to the Indian media since he took over as head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in New Delhi in September, Taipei’s de-facto ambassador Baushuan Ger said convergence on new security threats, such as disregard for shared norms and values by other nations and Covid-19, can add momentum to efforts to upgrade cooperation between India and Taiwan. Ger said Taiwan is looking to India, as chair of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) executive board, to ensure the body takes a “leave no one behind” stance when considering Taiwan’s participation in WHO and related meetings and mechanisms. Here are the excerpts from the interview: Q. As you begin your term in India, what are your priorities for taking forward India-Taiwan relations? A. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of our respective representations in New Delhi and Taipei. Taiwan and India are reliable and natural partners to each other. Our two countries share fundamental essential values such as freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. Markedly, there is a vast intersection between India’s “Act East Policy” and Taiwan’s “New Southbound Policy”, which aims to enhance Taiwan’s relations with targeted 18 countries in Southeast Asia, South Asia and Oceania. During my tenure, I will focus on people-to-people exchanges across areas such as trade and investment, science and technology as well as education and culture. We are witnessing the restructuring of global supply chains that have created a lot of opportunities for Taiwan and India to further enhance our links in the area of manufacturing. We should, therefore, carefully appraise our respective positions and make policies to forge a stronger partnership. Also read: Novel coronavirus may enter brain via nose, study saysQ. With bilateral trade crossing $7 billion and recording growth of 40 per cent during 2017 and 2018, what more can be done to drive economic ties and investment? A. A major factor driving rapid trade development are Taiwanese businesses integrating their supply and production chains with emerging opportunities in India to secure efficient production and low-cost benefit. In India, Taiwanese businesses operate comprehensive industrial chains that focus on various products, such as medical devices, auto parts, machinery, steel, electronics, construction, engineering etc., most of which are ICT products. Closer trade and investment will benefit Indian industries and facilitate their partnership to connect with supply chains globally. In terms of our industrial structures, Taiwan and India are very complementary. Therefore, I can see tremendous business opportunities and potential in our future cooperation. Taiwan and India should continue to engage with greater effort in building resilient supply chains across key sectors, increasing the value addition of industry, and leveraging Taiwan’s hardware production to link with India’s software service. Q. There are reports that three Taiwanese suppliers of Apple Inc are planning to invest $900 million in India in the next five years. Are there plans to boost investments? Does Taiwan have plans to join India’s ‘Make in India’ initiative and to support India’s plans to become a hub for global supply chains? A. Taiwan excels at hardware manufacturing while India’s expertise and competence lies in software development. India enjoys a demographic dividend as well as a perfect location with respect to market access in East Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Responding to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have noticed that India has doubled down on its ‘Make in India’ initiative and Self-Reliant India (Atmanirbhar Bharat) to boost the economy and attract foreign investment. India, therefore, is invigorated to put more effort to attract Taiwanese businesses. Taiwan’s industries, especially ICT and electronics, have become technologically autonomous. We are glad to see India continue to improve its investment environment, as this benefits Taiwanese businesses looking to expand investment in India. Taiwan’s “Go South” synchronises with India’s “Act East”, creating a win-win for both. Also read: Delhi government caps price of RT-PCR test by private labs at Rs 800Q. You are beginning your tenure at a time when both Taiwan and India face challenges due to the actions of China. Is there scope for India and Taiwan to work together to overcome such challenges? Commentators in Taiwan and India have called for redefining the relationship between the two countries and making them more comprehensive. Should relations between the two sides be upgraded? A. Enhancement of bilateral relations shall be based on the mutual interests of both countries rather than consideration of other external factors. In the past 25 years, both Taiwan and India have greatly benefited from the ever-growing trade and investment, education exchanges and technological collaborations. Now it is time for us to redefine our mutually beneficial objectives and the strategies to achieve them. Promoting economic connections and social exchanges remain the priority, but other new areas shall be taken into consideration. Economic diplomacy is the mantra. New security threats such as Covid-19, disobedience [of] shared norms and values, environmental disasters, as well as cybersecurity, are also becoming our common concerns. I believe a convergence of such new security interests could further create the momentum to upgrade the cooperation framework between our two sides. India plays a key role in the stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region and Taiwan is an essential partner in achieving the goal. Q. How grave is the threat currently posed to Taiwan by China? Is the world community doing enough about this situation? A. China’s attempts to intimidate Taiwan militarily have never ceased. It continues to dispatch military aircraft and vessels to circle Taiwan and provoke us. Since January this year to date, the PLA has dispatched more than 300 military aircraft to intrude into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ). Intrusions by a range of Chinese warplanes have become almost a daily occurrence. In response to the intrusions amid escalating cross-Taiwan strait tensions, Taiwan’s Air Force scramble jets to chase off the intruding Chinese aircraft, issue radio warnings and mobilise air defence systems to monitor their movements. The US recently approved a sale of defensive weapons package worth US $600 million to Taiwan. The weapons will help Taiwan further enhance its ability to maintain cross-strait peace and regional stability. We are committed to upholding cross-strait stability, but this is not something Taiwan can shoulder alone; it is the joint responsibility of the international community.

Can India and Taiwan cooperate on international platforms such as the World Health Organization (WHO) as the global community explores ways to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and similar challenges in future? Would Taiwan expect countries such as India to back its efforts to become a member of WHO? A. Taiwan sincerely congratulates India on its new role as chair of WHO’s Executive Board earlier this year. As the most important international organisation guiding the development of global public health and defending the right to health, WHO should welcome participation by all stakeholders, including Taiwan. As viruses like Covid-19 acknowledge no borders, we hope, India will help ensure WHO maintains a professional and “leave no one behind” stance when considering issues related to Taiwan’s participation in the WHO and its related meetings, mechanisms and activities. Q. How can India and Taiwan cooperate to overcome the health and economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis? Is Taiwan looking to India for help with vaccines? A. The Covid-19 pandemic has generated the worst global health, economic and social crises. No country, no economy, and no society can combat and counter this pandemic alone. Currently, the world is tackling another wave of the virus. The pandemic remains our most important issue to tackle. Taiwan and India can work together to achieve a strong, resilient, green and inclusive recovery when fighting and containing the virus. We must continue to adopt all necessary measures and technologies to protect public health. Strong multilateral action is needed to match the level of ambition of national responses. International cooperation will be key to developing and distributing vaccines at large and to support countries and regions in need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-go-south-policy-blends-with-india-s-act-east-taiwan-s-representative-tells-ht/story-4eEEQhDuUuv03V6HLkQ4DP.html

Beniwal also demanded that the Centre implement the recommendations of the Swaminath Commission and hold dialogue with farmers in Delhi in the right spirit.Hanuman Beniwal, who was once in the Bharatiya Janata Party, floated his party before the 2018 state elections and became part of the National Democratic Alliance right before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Beniwal won the Lok Sabha election from Nagaur in 2019. His party had won 3 seats in the state elections the previous year and had put up a tough fight in quite a few others.The jat leader’s threat to consider exiting the NDA is seen to indicate the discomfort within the regional party over the protests that erupted against the three farm laws enacted by the BJP-led coalition at the Centre that change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government-controlled agricultural markets.The laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled “mandi system”, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior ministers have tried to dispel concerns around the three laws, telling that these had opened up new opportunities for cultivators.But leaders of farmers who have been marching to national capital Delhi against the law aren’t convinced and have insisted that their agitation will continue. Thousands of farmers have been camping on the borders of Delhi and in the city’s Burari grounds since November 27, a day after their Delhi Chalo agitation was launched from Punjab. The protests have since then spread to pockets in other states as well.In a string of tweets that he followed up with a letter to Amit Shah, Hanuman Beniwal said his party would be forced to reconsider its alliance if prompt action is not taken since farmers and the youth formed the core support base of his party.In a video message earlier, Beniwal said the RLP had protested the three farm laws through social media and on the streets. “Today, I have written to Shah that if the laws aren’t withdrawn, then we will reconsider our alliance with NDA,” he said.“We are with the farmers and if required will march to Delhi. The PM and Shah should hold dialogue with farmers, and provide space to hold dharna in the capital. If any kind of ill-treatment is done with the farmers, then the farmers of the entire country will be on streets to gherao Delhi,” he said.Beniwal’s tweets came a day after chief minister Ashok Gehlot wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding withdrawal of the farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/withdraw-farm-laws-says-bjp-ally-in-rajasthan-threatens-to-quit-alliance/story-0eCwMBWrKvwGcbJP08sGEO.html

30-11-2020||India||Covid-19 stops outsiders, only locals allowed for Kartik Poornima bath in Haridwar||The administration in Haridwar allowed the local people to take ritual baths in the various ghats of the Ganga on the occasion of Kartik Poornima on Monday after the Akhada Parishad, Ganga Sabha, priests and trader organizations insisted that bathing for locals be allowed.The administration had earlier ordered a blanket ban n the festivities due to a surge in Covid-19 cases in Uttarakhand. Usually lakhs of people arrive for the ritual baths, but this time due to curbs because of the Covid-19 pandemic, only around 40,000 to 50,000 local people showed up.As soon as the news of the waiver spread, local people started thronging the Ganga ghats from the morning. At the sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri and adjacent Ganga ghats local pilgrims were seen bathing in the river.According to district magistrate C Ravi Shankar local people were allowed with strict adherence and guidelines of social distancing norms at Ganga ghats. The Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad and Ganga Sahha had condemned the state government move to impose a blanket ban on Kartik Poornima festive bath for devotees. A delegation of Ganga Sabha and local traders had also met Uttarakahnd’s urban development cabinet minister Madan Kaushik to press their demand.“Kartik Poornima is a major festive bath in Hindu festive calendar dedicated to Lord Vishnu. It is also the last festive bath of the year. Earlier Somwati Amawasya festive bath and Kanwar fair was canceled by the administration. While election rallies are allowed, why only religious spiritual occasions are being targeted?” said Akhada Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj. While the locals were fortunate to take a dip in the Ganga, police turned away pilgrims from other states heading for Haridwar to take a ritual bath.Uttar Pradesh-Uttarakhand border posts at Chidiyapur, Kali Nadi, Mandawar, Narsain were barricaded all day.“As Kartik Poornima bath has been cancelled no pilgrims from other states were allowed to enter the district area. Only those people who were coming for some other purpose having documents to substantiate, patients, official work and those for marriages were permitted,” said Shyampur’s station house officer (SHO) Deepak Kathait. Ganga Sabha also ensured pilgrims adhere to social distancing and wearing masks compulsorily. “We thank the administration for allowing local pilgrims and those from other states coming for immersion of ashes and pre-scheduled religious events. Approximately 40 to 50 thousand pilgrims arrived at Har-Ki-Pauri, Malviya ghat, Subash ghat , Vishnu ghat, Kushawrat ghat, Nai Sota and adjacent Ganga ghats,” said Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha. Superintendent of city police Kamlesh Upadhyay said that a meeting was held at Har-Ki-Pauri police post Sunday evening with Ganga Sabha office representatives, teerth purohits , police officials and local traders regarding restrictive Kartik Poornima festive bathing amidst social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-stops-outsiders-only-locals-allowed-for-kartik-poornima-bath-in-haridwar/story-SNFWb4lPCiTggyTnqAnn6O.html
30-11-2020||India||UP’s new Covid-19 guidelines authorise districts to clamp night curfew||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday issued a fresh set of guidelines, authorising the districts’ administration to impose local restrictions, including night curfews, depending on the assessment and requirement of the situation in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to a circular issued by chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari.The chief secretary has, however, clarified that no lockdown outside the containment zones can be imposed without the prior permission from the Central government.The guidelines with regard to social and other gatherings, including marriage parties, outside containment zones will remain the same as issued by the state government on November 23.The new instructions that are largely a reiteration of the Union home ministry’s November 25 guidelines will come into effect on December 1 and will remain in place till further orders.Issuing the circular, the chief secretary has asked commissioners, district magistrates and other officials to strictly enforce the fresh guidelines for surveillance, containment and caution against Covid-19 infection.Also read: Delhi government caps price of RT-PCR test by private labs at Rs 800The chief secretary said though the number of positive cases had declined in most of the places, the positivity rate had increased in some cities and this, he added, called for extreme caution and alertness since the virus may further spread due to festive gatherings and the cold weather.Citing the new guidelines, the chief secretary said depending on their assessment of the situation and the requirement, the DM could clamp down night curfews and also impose Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) even outside a containment zone to contain the spread of the virus.He also asked them to ensure demarcation of containment zones at the micro-level in line with the Centre’s call for “dynamic containment zones.”“It has to be ensured that no movement of people in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and for maintaining the supply of essential goods and services, is allowed,” the chief secretary directed the officials.“The surveillance teams made for this purpose will necessarily do intensive monitoring of each house under the containment zones and quick isolation of Covid-19 patients (will be) ensured,” he said.Tiwari said the protocol related to social distancing, washing of hands and wearing of masks must be enforced strictly as before. He asked officials to penalise people who were found without a mask on their face in public places.The new guidelines advise the vulnerable, including people above 65 years age and those with co-morbidity, pregnant women and children below 10 years of age, not to step out of their home unless it is essential to go out for a medical emergency.The DMs and other officers concerned have been asked to ensure social distancing in workplaces by considering staggered timings.“In cities, where the weekly case positivity rate is in more than 10 per cent, the officers concerned will consider implementing staggered office timings and other suitable measures, with a view to reducing the number of employees attending office at the same time, thereby ensuring social distancing,” the chief secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-s-new-covid-19-guidelines-authorise-districts-to-clamp-night-curfew/story-CNDPxCWW2bbz9YJpUeCnPN.html
30-11-2020||India||Moderna to seek US, EU emergency authorization Monday after Covid-19 vaccine 94.1% effective||Moderna Inc said it will apply for US and European emergency authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine on Monday based on full results from a late-stage study showing its vaccine was 94.1% effective with no serious safety concerns.It also reported a 100% success rate in preventing severe cases. The filing sets Moderna’s product up to be the second vaccine likely to receive US emergency use authorization this year.“We believe that we have a vaccine that is very highly efficacious. We now have the data to prove it,” Moderna Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tal Zaks said in a telephone interview. “We expect to be playing a major part in turning around this pandemic.”Zaks said he was emotional after seeing the 94.1% result over the weekend: “It was the first time I allowed myself to cry. At this level of effectiveness, when you just do the math of what it means for the pandemic that’s raging around us, it’s just overwhelming.”Moderna’s announcement follows news from Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE that their vaccine, which also uses a new technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA), was 95% effective. Pfizer has applied for emergency use authorization, putting it about a week ahead of Moderna.Read more | UK secures 2 million more doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccineIn addition to filing its US application, Moderna said it would apply for conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency, which has already begun a rolling review of data, and would continue to talk with other regulators conducting rolling reviews.Moderna’s latest efficacy result is slightly lower than an interim analysis released on November 16 of 94.5% effectiveness, a difference that Zaks said is not statistically significant.Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines proved more effective than anticipated and far superior to the 50% benchmark set by the US Food and Drug Administration.Britain’s AstraZeneca has announced an average efficacy rate of 70% for its vaccine and as much as 90% for a subgroup of trial participants who got a half dose first, followed by a full dose. But some scientists have expressed doubts about the robustness of the 90% efficacy figure for the smaller group.Still, the past few weeks of positive vaccine results have ignited hopes for an end to a pandemic that has battered economies and claimed more than 1.45 million lives worldwide. It comes as new infections and Covid-19 hospitalizations are at record levels across the United States.Independent advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration are scheduled to meet on December 17 to review Moderna’s trial data and make a recommendation to the FDA. They will meet on December 10 to review Pfizer’s data.Shortly after gaining emergency use authorization, Moderna expects the vaccine to be shipped to designated distribution points throughout the United States by the government’s Operation Warp Speed program and McKesson Corp, a drug distributor contracted by the US government.Its distribution is expected to be easier than Pfizer’s because while it needs to be stored in a freezer, it does not require the ultra-cold temperature needed by Pfizer’s vaccine.Of the 196 volunteers who contracted Covid-19 in the more than 30,000-person trial, 185 had received a placebo versus 11 who got the vaccine. The company reported 30 severe cases - all in the placebo group - which means the vaccine was 100% effective at preventing severe cases. The trial included one Covid-19-related death in the placebo group.Moderna said the vaccine’s efficacy was consistent across age, race, ethnicity and gender demographics. The 196 cases included 33 adults over 65 and 42 volunteers from racially diverse groups, including 29 Latinos, 6 Blacks, 4 Asian Americans and 3 multiracial participants.Click here for complete coverage of Coronavirus pandemicZaks said the vaccine has been developed during a period of “political acrimony” and having a highly effective vaccine may go a long way toward erasing some of that distrust.“This is as black and white as an effect on a population will be. Your chances of actually being sick if you’ve been vaccinated are decreased 20-fold,” he said.Moderna reported no new side effects since its interim analysis on November 16. Based on that analysis, the most common side effects were fatigue, injection site redness and pain, headache and body aches, which increased after the second dose and were short-lived.Zaks said the vaccine caused significant flu-like symptoms in some participants, which, he said, “goes hand-in-hand with having such a potent vaccine.” But it has not caused any significant safety concerns so far.Moderna plans to start a new trial to test the vaccine in adolescents before the end of the year, followed by another trial in even younger volunteers early in 2021. The company hopes to have the vaccine available for adolescents by September of next year, Zaks said.Other vaccine makers have said they are studying their vaccines in young people as well.Moderna said it was on track to have about 20 million doses of its vaccine ready to ship in the United States by the end of 2020, enough to inoculate 10 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/moderna-to-seek-us-eu-emergency-authorization-monday-after-covid-19-vaccine-94-1-effective/story-udPItjIyHptm1MxRWqoH0M.html

The information on these people will be digitally fed in the common database on national immunisation programme-related activities.Also read | Delhi government slashes price of RT-PCR test to Rs800“As you are aware, Government of India has initiated preparations for introduction of Covid-19 vaccine, upon its availability. As part of the preparations, one of the activities is creation of database of health care workers (HCWs) who will be prioritised for Covid-19 vaccine. This database of HCWs is to be uploaded on Covid-19 vaccine intelligence network (CoVIN),” read the letter sent by Vandana Gurnani, additional secretary, Union ministry of health.“In this regard, it is reiterated that the potential vaccinators among the HCWs need to be identified for support during the Covid-19vaccination drive..,” the letter further read.The health ministry has formed a list of categories who would qualify as potential vaccinators and will be trained accordingly. Among the categories defined by the experts are MBBS doctors, BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) doctors, staff nurses (those who have BSc. Nursing), Auxillary Nurse Midwives of different grades, pharmacists, those students who are interning during their MBBS course, and also BDS (dentists) interns.These people will be considered for administering Covid-19 vaccine, provided that they are actively involved in day-to-day provision of clinical care to patients and have experience in administering injections through intramascular (into a muscle), intradermal (superficial injection), and subcutaneous (into the skin) routes.The Centre is preparing to vaccinate at least 250-300 million people, including healthcare and frontline workers, against Covid-19 in the first phase by July next year. Of the 300 million people, close to 30 million are Corona warriors involved in outbreak management in the country.Apart from them, people above 65 years of age, and those between 50 and 65 years of age, and people who are 50 years and less but suffering from comorbidities form a part of the government’s priority list. All states are gearing up for the mass vaccination drive that is likely to start by either January or February next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-train-vaccinators-from-among-health-workers-on-priority-centre-to-states/story-gEjNJwpKVOawUZCnWCL2iM.html

30-11-2020||India||Nitish says farmer’s agitation due to misconception, favours talks||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said that the farmers’ protests are taking place because of misconceptions and favoured dialogues between the government and farmers’ bodies. “The Central government wants to talk to farmers to dispel the fear of issues in the procurement mechanism. So I believe that dialogue should take place. The protests are happening on account of misconceptions,” said Kumar on the sidelines of a function in Patna. Kumar backed the farm bills passed by Parliament by recalling that his government had abolished the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Act in 2006 and commenced public procurement. “Farmers will not face any problem in procurement as it happened in Bihar,” said the Bihar CM. Also read | Congress launches social media campaign to garner support for agitating farmersHe said when the farmers come to the table for talks, their misconceptions will be dispelled. “In Bihar, farmers are not facing any problem. This year too, we have kept the target of procuring 3 million tonnes of foodgrains,” he said. Kumar had earlier lent support to the farm bill, maintaining that there was nothing wrong in replicating such a model across the country and had alleged that misinformation was being spread about The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Supporting them, he had said that these bills are in the interest of the farmers. The Bihar government replaced agriculture markets with roadside wholesale markets where farmers sell their produce directly to private players. The local municipal bodies, which set up these markets, charge 1% of the selling price each from the farmer and the buyer as a facilitation fee. Kumar had remarked, “In 2006, we abolished it (Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Act). Then, we started the procurement process. So, the situation in Bihar is different.” Farmers have been protesting at various places in Delhi and Haryana and have rejected the Central government’s offer to hold talks on December 3, saying that imposing conditions for starting a dialogue is an insult to them. Around 32 farmer organisations, mostly from Punjab, and some from Gujarat and Maharashtra managed to reach Delhi on Friday and assembled at the borders where they have continued to protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-says-farmer-s-agitation-due-to-misconception-favours-talks/story-upwMTLpxuKy1D7cKG1AzPM.html

Does he want to be named Pappu? I don’t call him Bhaipo. I call him khokababu (kid). Those people who gave their sweat and blood for the party are now outcast whereas he got everything on a platter,” said Dilip Ghosh, state BJP president.Also read | Abhishek Banerjee targets Suvendu Adhikari, TMC flexes muscle on ex-minister’s turfBanerjee had tagged Ghosh as a ruffian and mafia while addressing a rally in the former’s constituency in South Parganas on Sunday. On Monday Ghosh, through a lawyer, sent a legal notice to Banerjee demanding an unconditional apology.The BJP leadership also continued to attack the TMC, alleging that under the latter’s regime, terrorists were using the state as a corridor to disrupt peace across the country and that the ruling party was trying to transform West Bengal into West Bangladesh.“It is because of West Bengal that peace is being disturbed across India. Activists from al-Qaeda, SIMI and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen enter West Bengal and then fan out across the country. These infiltrators and Rohingyas are connected to every bomb blast,” Ghosh said.“The maximum property has been damaged in West Bengal. Infiltrators from Bangladesh are sitting here and damaging property of the country. Didi has made them voters and if you say anything against them, you would be tagged as communal,” he added“We were stripped of our belongings when we were coming to India. My sister who was coming with my parents was taken away. We never saw her again. A conspiracy is going on to make West Bengal into West Bangladesh and bring those days back,” he said.The TMC hit back, saying that it was one of the many irresponsible statements made by Ghosh and that the TMC is not taking it seriously. “As usual, Ghosh has made yet another irresponsible statement. West Bengal will remain as it is, no matter what Ghosh says. It’s a habit of the BJP to speak about infiltrators every time. We are rubbishing such statements,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP.Other political parties, including the Congress and the CPIM, also lashed out at the BJP. “It is strange that despite having the RAW, IB and NIA, the Centre knows nothing about this conspiracy of transforming West Bengal into West Bangladesh but Ghosh came to know about it. The Parliament and country should know about this. The politics of infiltration from Bangladesh has become stale. The BJP maintains different stands on such issues in different states,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha.“Ghosh had earlier said that the BJP would transform West Bengal into Gujarat. West Bengal would neither become Gujarat nor West Bangladesh. It would remain the way it is,” said Md Salim, CPIM politburo member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mp-abhishek-banerjee-like-a-kid-got-everything-on-a-platter-says-bjp-bengal-president/story-gcv3EtYNaPeyylGzPqU0rK.html
30-11-2020||India||No land to extend Dehradun airport’s runway except forest: Uttarakhand govt to Centre||Over a month after the Centre asked Uttarakhand government to search for alternate land for extension of the runway at Dehradun airport, the state government has replied saying that no such land was available for the exercise.In October, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) had written to the state government. The letter had mentioned that the state government “may explore alternatives for the proposal such as acquiring area lying north of the existing runway…the entire proposed forest area for diversion falls within the Shivalik Elephant Reserve and elephant corridors within its 1 km radius. Moreover, the notified Kansaro-Barkot Elephant Corridor is located within 5 km radius. The State Government should consider avoiding these sensitive areas and explore alternative lands.” Officials privy to the matter said that a reply from the Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA) on technical queries has been submitted, while reply by the forest department will be sent on Tuesday. Rajiv Dhiman, divisional forest officer of Dehradun forest division said, “We have learnt that UCADA has submitted a reply in this matter already. We will be submitting a reply in this matter on Tuesday.” Meanwhile, a senior forest official, on condition of anonymity said, “The existing runway in the Dehradun airport needs to be expanded towards a side which is feasible and in this case it is the forest side. With alternate land, a completely new airport will have to be built.” Ashish Chauhan, chief executive officer of UCADA said, “We have replied to the technical queries asked by the Centre regarding the project. Our reply was mostly about documentation required for the process.” In September, the state government had sought the union environment ministry’s approval under the Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for non-forestry use of 87.0815 hectares of forest land for “Expansion of the Jolly Grant Airport.” On November 24, the Uttarakhand State Wildlife Advisory Board approved the denotification of Shivalik Elephant Reserve as an elephant reserve to pave way for the expansion of Dehradun airport project. Harak Singh Rawat, state forest minister said, “The state wildlife board during its 16th meeting approved the de-notification of Shivalik Elephant Reserve as there is no law to define an elephant reserve. In the late 90s and early 2000, the state government had sent a proposal to the Centre seeking a clarification regarding the said area, after which it was notified as an elephant reserve in 2002. But as per the norms of the central government, there is no law or Act yet under which the legal status of an elephant reserve is defined.” He said the state government will issue an official order within a few days in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-land-to-extend-dehradun-airport-s-runway-except-forest-uttarakhand-govt-to-centre/story-guyAAwiLz6sBt55RTrszXK.html

The trial is a randomised double-blind placebo control trial, in which half the volunteers will be administered the vaccine and half will be given a placebo that does not contain the active substance that affects health, said sources associated with the trial. Since the trial is double-blind, the vaccinated volunteers will not know if they were given the vaccine or a placebo, to rule out bias in issues related to treatment and statistical analysis.The placebo-vaccine ratio was 1:3 in the first phase trial that focused on safety. It was not given in the second stage, but would be given in 1:1 ratio in the third stage, said sources. Also read | Plan to vaccinate around 25-30 crore people by July-August, says Harsh Vardhan“We hope to begin enrolling healthy volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age from December 2 and commence the third phase trial tentatively from December 5 or 6,” said Dr CM Singh, superintendent of AIIMS,Patna, who is also the principal investigator of the trial.Volunteers will be given two shots of the vaccine at an interval of 28 days. For the next 194 days, there will be regular follow-ups by medical experts. “The follow-up sampling to check the level of immunogenicity (amount of antibody produced in a healthy body to fight against the SARS CoV-2 virus, which causes the disease) has to be done on day 14, 28, 42, 104 and 194,” added Dr Singh. The third phase will exclude volunteers in the first two phases of the trial, they said. As many as 46 volunteers had enrolled here out of the total 375 across different centres during the first phase trial. In the second stage, 44 volunteers enrolled at AIIMS, Patna, out of the 750 across India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patna-aiims-to-enrol-1-000-volunteers-for-covaxin-trial/story-kISuAVby8lfnRu6BonWa9H.html

The home collection of samples will cost Rs1,200. At present, people have to spend Rs 2,400 for the RT-PCR test at private labs.CM Kejriwal had announced the move in a bid to help those who want their tests done in private labs, which are carried out free of cost at the government hospitals. “I have directed that the rates of RT PCR tests be reduced in Delhi. Whereas tests are being conducted free of cost in govt establishments, however this will help those who get their tests done in pvt labs,” Kejriwal had tweeted earlier on Monday.Adopting an aggressive approach of contact tracing and testing, the Delhi government has carried out RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Test to detect novel coronavirus in the national capital. Both tests are done free at government testing centres and hospitals, but not at private clinics or hospitals.The government had earlier capped the price of all Covid-19 tests, whether from a government or private centre, in Delhi at Rs 2,400. The decision was taken in a District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, and attended by Kejriwal, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot and other top officials from the Delhi Police, administration and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).The move to cap the price of RT-PCR test comes as Covid-19 cases in Delhi have reached 5.6 lakh and death have crossed the 9,000 mark. Delhi on Sunday reported 4,906 new Covid-19 cases, taking the cumulative toll of positive cases reported so far this year to 5,66,648. In the last 24 hour, the national capital witnessed 68 deaths, adding to the total deaths. The city had recorded its highest single-day spike of 8,593 cases on November 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-government-caps-the-price-of-rt-pcr-test-by-private-labs-at-rs-800/story-VNkclW0rC2i4jvmyeBI0ZI.html
30-11-2020||India||Congress launches social media campaign to garner support for agitating farmers||The Congress on Monday launched a social media campaign to muster support for the farmers protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws with party leader Rahul Gandhi saying, when farmers raise their voice, it resonates across the country. “The Modi government has persecuted the farmer - first it brought black laws and then used lathis against them, but it forgot that when the farmer raises his voice, it resonates throughout the country. You also raise your voice against the exploitation of farmers and join the #SpeakUpForFarmers campaign,” Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.“The farmer of the country has come to Delhi in the cold, leaving his home and fields, to voice his protest against the black agriculture laws. In this battle of truth and untruth, with whom do you stand - the ‘Annadata’ (food-giving) farmer or the PM’s capitalist friends,” Gandhi said in another tweet.The former Congress chief said wherever these farmers are protesting, the people and Congress workers should stand in their support and provide them food. “The question is why is the farmer out on the roads, travelling thousands of kilometers and is stalling traffic. PM Modi says the three farm laws are in favour of the farmer, but if these laws are in the farmer’s favour, why is he not happy and why is he protesting,” asked the Congress leader. “These laws are for Narendra Modi’s two-three friends and are aimed at stealing from the farmers. That is why we all have to together stand with the strength of India - the farmer,” he said.He also shared an over one-minute-long video as part of the campaign in which the Congress party asked the government to listen to the grievances of the farmers and not use force against them. The video also alleged that while the farmers are producing food grains to feed the country, they are facing water cannons and lathis at the hands of the Modi government. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also joined the #SpeakUpForFarmers campaign and shared the same video highlighting the plight of the farmers. “In the name of farm laws, all billionaire friends are benefitting. How can farm laws be framed without even talking to farmers? How can the interests of farmers be ignored?” she said in a tweet in Hindi. “The government will have to listen to the farmers. Let us together raise our voice in support of farmers,” she commented while seeking public support in favour of the farmers. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should announce the suspension of the three agri laws and take back all 12,000 FIRs filed against farmers without any pre-conditions. He also demanded that Modi should himself talk to the representatives of all farmer unions and assures them of redressing their grievances. Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said, “Lakhs of farmers who are protesting the anti-farmer laws passed by the govt have now been stopped outside Delhi. If the BJP is convinced of the laws passed by them, they should have to courage to meet the farmers and convince them.”  Former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat lamented that the farmers who are helping the country’s falling economy have been rewarded with the new “black laws” and their grievances have not been heard. “There is a conspiracy to take away the MSP (minimum support price), demolish the existing mandi structure and end the procurement system through the FCI,” Rawat said.“The farmers have crossed all hurdles and reached Delhi to air their grievances. Hear out the farmers and their pain, but do not ignore their voice and talk to them... scrap the three black laws,” Rawat added. The Congress on its official Twitter handle demanded that the government must stop the alleged violence and atrocities against the farmers who are exercising their right to protest.“Use of brute force on the souls that feed a billion stomachs is nothing but grave, inhumane, gut-wrenching injustice. India will not stand for this. India will #SpeakUpForFarmers,” the party tweeted from its official handle.  It also alleged, “First they undemocratically passed the draconian anti-farmer laws, now they are hell-bent on stifling our farmers’ democratic voices.” A host of party leaders including P L Punia, Tariq Anwar, Shashi Tharoor, Salman Khurshid, Mohan Prakash and Sunil Jakhar also spoke in support of the farmers and urged the government to redress their grievances. The Congress has launched a day-long online campaign in support of the farmers who are agitating on the roads against the farm laws. The ongoing protests by thousands of farmers against the Centre’s new farm laws entered the fifth day on Monday, with the protesters threatening to block all five entry points to the national capital rejecting the Centre’s offer to hold talks once they move to the Burari ground, the farmers said they will not accept any conditional dialogue and have called a meeting to discuss their next course of action later in the day. Farmers, who had reached the Nirankarai Samagam Ground in Burari on Saturday, continued their protest there while traffic continued to be disrupted in the city due to the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-launches-social-media-campaign-to-garner-support-for-agitating-farmers/story-cmBDnT5hVZqAFTh4ZBYb0I.html
30-11-2020||India||SCO meet: India launches thinly veiled attack on Pakistan over terrorism||During a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) council of heads of government, India on Monday launched a thinly veiled attack on Pakistan for using terrorism as an instrument of state policy and called for collective efforts to combat the menace. Vice president M Venkaiah Naidu, who chaired the virtual meeting of the council, also indirectly criticised Pakistan for attempting to use SCO to raise bilateral matters and said this went against the grouping’s charter, which safeguards the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. In his opening remarks, Naidu pointed to the importance of efforts to boost economic recovery amid the Covid-19 pandemic and took a tacit swipe at China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), saying trust alone determines sustainability of global trade and countries must demonstrate their compliance with rules of multilateral trade. The council of heads of government is the second-highest body of SCO and is responsible for handling the grouping’s trade and economic agenda and approving its annual budget. This is the first time India is hosting a meeting of the body since it was admitted into the eight-member grouping in 2017. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan did not join the virtual meeting. Pakistan’s participation was at the lowest level – the country was represented by parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs Andleeb Abbas – and Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan were represented by their prime ministers. Naidu said trade can flourish only in an environment of peace and security, and the most important challenge faced by countries in the region is terrorism, “particularly cross-border terrorism”. He described terrorism as “the enemy of humanity” that needs to be combated collectively. “India condemns terrorism in all its manifestations. We remain concerned about threats emerging from ungoverned spaces and are particularly concerned about states that leverage terrorism as an instrument of state policy,” he said, without naming Pakistan. “Such an approach is entirely against the spirit and ideas and the charter of the SCO. Elimination of this threat will help all of us realise our shared potential and create conditions for stable and secure economic growth and sustainable development.” Naidu said SCO is key to cooperation based on universally recognised international norms, rule of law, openness and transparency and it is “unfortunate ...that there have been attempts to deliberately bring bilateral issues into SCO and blatantly violate the well-established principles and norms of the SCO charter safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of SCO member states”. Pakistan has repeatedly sought to raise bilateral matters such as the Kashmir issue at multilateral forums and India had walked out of a virtual meeting of national security advisers of SCO in September after the Pakistani representative projected a map that inaccurately depicted the borders of the two countries. Naidu said the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiative is aimed at building national economic strength, resilience and enhanced capacities so that the country can be a trusted partner. The initiative recognises the importance of reciprocity, transparency and fairness in trade and is central to collective efforts to overcome vulnerabilities exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, he said. “Partners must be trustworthy and transparent. It is trust that determines the sustainability of our global trade and nations must demonstrate their compliance with rules of multilateral trade to remain a part of this system,” he said. Naidu also highlighted India’s role in producing more than 60% of vaccines used for global immunisation programmes and said, “This global vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all the countries in fighting this crisis.” He noted that the socio-political impact of Covid-19 had exposed the weaknesses of global institutions, including the WHO, which need to be revamped as part of a reformed multilateralism that reflects today’s realities and gives voice to all stakeholders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sco-meet-india-launches-thinly-veiled-attack-on-pakistan-over-terrorism/story-a5hoaIRwpUn4EbhlBOsfUP.html

The state’s active cases had dipped to 78,272 earlier this month. There are now 90,997 active Covid-19 cases in the state.Pune district continues to have the highest active cases with 19,658 cases, followed by Thane district and Mumbai with 16338 and 15610 active Covid-19 cases. Maharashtra added 5,544 fresh cases on Sunday which took the tally to 1,820,059. The state also reported 85 deaths on Sunday, taking the toll past 47,000 to 47,071, at a case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.59%. Of the 85 fatalities, 39 were in the past 48 hours, 25 in the past week and 21 before that, the state health department stated. The state is expected to increase testing in the coming month to pick up any increase in spread of infection. The government is identifying ‘superspreaders’ in the population, or people who have maximum social contact in the community, and is testing such people on priority. These include bus conductors, street vendors, milkman etc who are likely to come in contact with 10-15 people daily due to the nature of their work.Two weeks after Diwali (November 15) the state is yet to see any significant increase in Covid-19 cases. There was a fear among state health department officials that the viral infection could see a surge after Diwali as large crowds were seen during the festive season. “There is no significant rise in cases yet, but we are ramping up testing. The district authorities have been directed to increase contact tracing as well,” health department officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/active-covid-19-cases-increase-in-maharashtra-inches-closer-to-1-lakh-mark-after-dip-last-month/story-oqTgQyL5Z8NUkIIiwlyHgK.html

He said it should be upto the farmers to decide whether they want to sell their produce or not in Varanasi.PM Modi was addressing his first public engagement in Khajuri where he dedicated to the nation the widened Handia (Prayagraj)-Rajatalab (Varanasi) section of National Highway 19. The Prime Minister’s remarks on farmers and country’s agricultural policies comes amid a stir by thousands of farmers against the three farm legislations recently cleared by Parliament. Also read: In Varanasi, PM Modi hails work done by Yogi govt, says UP now known as ‘Express Pradesh’Here is what all he said on farmers and agricultural policies in the country in his address:- We promised that Swaminathan would give MSP one and a half times the cost in line with the Commission’s recommendation. This promise was not only fulfilled on paper, but has reached the bank accounts of the farmers.- The new agricultural laws have been brought in for benefit of the farmers. We will see and experience benefits of these new laws in the coming days. There’s new trend now, earlier decisions of government were opposed, now rumours have become basis for Opposition (parties). Propaganda is spread that although decision is right, it can lead to other consequences, about things that haven’t happened or will never happen. Same is with farm laws.- We had said that we will stop black marketing of urea and give sufficient urea to the farmer.Urea deficiency was not allowed in the last 6 years. Earlier, urea had to be taken in black, and the farmers who came to take urea were also lathicharged on. - Earlier, transactions outside the market were illegal. In such a situation, small farmers were cheated and disputed. Now the small farmer can also take legal action on every deal that is out of the market. The farmer has now also found new options and legal protection from deception.- India’s agricultural products are famous all over the world. Should not the farmer have access to this big market and higher prices? If someone considers transactions from the old system only, then where has that been stopped?- Farmers are being empowered by giving them options for a bigger market. Reforms are being done in the interest of farmers, which will give them more options. Shouldn’t a farmer get freedom to sell his produce directly to those who give them better prices and facilities?- In the past years, crop insurance or irrigation, seeds or markets, work has been done at all levels. PM crop insurance scheme has helped about 4 crore farmer families of the country. Under the PM Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, 47 lakh hectares of land has come under micro irrigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doubts-being-spread-against-farm-reforms-this-has-become-a-new-trend-pm-modi-in-varanasi/story-TyzkaEKvjiMJGkqQcGwyAM.html

Speaking at an event organised at the Digawara railway station in Rajasthan’s Alwar district, the minister said the initiative will be the contribution of the Railways towards a plastic-free India.“Tea is given in ‘Kulhads’ at nearly 400 railway stations in the country today, and in future, it is our planning that tea will be sold only in ‘Kulhads’ at all the railway stations in the country. This will be the contribution of the Railways towards a plastic-free India,” he said. The minister said before addressing this gathering, he was having tea in a ‘Kulhad’ and the taste was really different.  ‘Kulhad’ saves the environment and lakhs of people get employment from it, he said. The minister was speaking at an event to mark the inauguration of the newly electrified Dhigawara-Bandikui section under north-western Railways.The minister said before the Narendra Modi government came to power in 2014, the railway sector was ignored in Rajasthan as electrification had not been taken up in the last 30 years after the electrification of Delhi-Mumbai route.Also Read | Northern Railways short terminates, diverts trains due to farmers’ stirHe said the investment by Railways and infrastructure development projects in Rajasthan have increased multiple times between 2014-2020 as compared to that between 2009-2014. Goyal said 65 underpasses were constructed from 2009-14 while 378 underpasses have been constructed from 2014- September 2020.He said only four overbridges were constructed in five years till 2014 whereas 30 such bridges have been constructed from 2014 to September 2020. The minister said electrification of railway lines across the country will save the environment as engines will run on electricity produced in the country, saving fuel, money and time. Also, the speed of trains will also be increased, he said.“This will also help farmers who will be able to take their crops to any part of the country (through rail freight transport) in less time,” he added. Goyal said the prime minister is very concerned about the environment and therefore emphasis is being given on electrification. The minister flagged off the first train on the newly electrified 34 km-long Dhigawara-Bandikui rail section. He said after the entire line from Rewari to Ajmer has now been electrified with the electrification of this stretch. Dausa MP Jaskaur Meena, GM-NWR Anand Prakash and other public representatives and railway officials were present in the function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eco-friendly-kulhad-to-replace-plastic-tea-cups-at-railway-stations/story-aFsqZf58yVOyG9k9W1x6tI.html
30-11-2020||India||Pilots’ bodies urge aviation minister Hardeep Puri to roll back pay cuts||Air India pilots have urged aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri to roll back their pay cuts, pointing out that unlike private airlines, their salaries were further cut from October. In a letter written on Monday, the pilots of Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association (ICPA) (representative body for the pilots of Indian Airlines) and Indian Pilots Guild IPG (that includes pilots of Air India Express and Alliance Air apart from Air India) complained of the unilateral wage cut and asked the minister to look into their grievances sooner. They also reminded Puri of their pending meeting. The pilots claimed that while private airlines are rolling back the austerity pay cuts for their pilots, the wage cut for Air India pilots has further increased from October which is divorced from market reality and unfair. The pilots also said their colleagues who test positive for Covid-19 need to undergo quarantine or hospitalisation as per the requirement which is followed by mandatory medical checks and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) approval. This entire process takes more than a month for the recovered pilot which is unfair as they are not paid when they do not operate. “Is it fair to deny these pilots their livelihood due to an occupational hazard? Is this how ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) wants to treat the workmen who are making the Vande Bharat Flights (VBM) possible?” questioned the pilots. “We pilots continue to be shackled with an indefinite and unilateral wage cut of up to 70% while the indifferent company top management contributes a namesake 10%. The airline top management has let us down tremendously. Our pilots have expressed their displeasure and are extremely troubled by this unwarranted ordeal,” said the association.

30-11-2020||India||BJP, Cong and JD(S) set for another electoral battle as EC notifies panchayat polls||The Election Commission on Monday notified polls for 5,762 gram panchayats across 30 districts of Karnataka that will pit the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress and JD(S) against each other. Though the polls are held without using party symbols, control of gram panchayats is seen by political parties as building blocks to consolidate their power.The polls were due in May but the state government had requested the EC to postpone it for six months saying that Covid-19 cases which were then surging would hamper the smooth conduct of the poll process. The Congress through its legislative council member K C Kondaiah had approached the Karnataka High Court seeking directions to hold the polls at the earliest. On November 13, the high court had asked the EC to notify the polls within three weeks.Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa welcomed the EC’s notification for the panchayat polls. “Gram Panchayat polls are as important as assembly and Lok Sabha polls to strengthen the party at grassroots level. Though candidates will contest without party symbols, voters know who will identify with which party,” he told media persons.He also brushed aside any chances of the panchayat polls further delaying the planned cabinet expansion “No. I don’t see any correlation (between the polls and cabinet expansion,” he said.State BJP President Nalin Kumar Kateel too said that for BJP the local body polls were very important as it would ‘nurture the next generation of BJP leaders.’ Last week, Kateel had said that the party was aiming to win at least 80% of the seats in the polls.The Congress too is going all out to win a majority of the seats in the gram panchayat polls. A total of 92,121 candidates will be elected in the 5,762 panchayats. The KPCC is holding a day-long meeting on Monday to analyze the reason for the recent defeat in the Sira and RR Nagar by-polls as well as to draw up a strategy to counter the BJP in the gram panchayat polls. In the 2016 local body polls Congress-backed candidates had won the majority of the seats.KPCC President D K Shivakumar on Friday had said that the party was fully geared to take on the BJP and win the bulk of the gram panchayat seats. The regional Janata Dal (Secular) which has its pockets of strength especially in Southern Karnataka has also been drawing up its battle plans with its state president and former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy meeting district unit chiefs to identify suitable candidates and draw up a strategy.Senior political analyst Neelakant said that the gram panchayat polls indicate the public mood, especially in rural areas. “It is important for all the three parties. For BJP to strengthen its hold specially in rural areas as it is still seen as an urban party. Its performance in the Old Mysuru region will be watched closely to see whether it has made an inroads there. For the Congress victory is important if it has to bounce back in the next assembly polls and for JD(S) it is an existential question.”The EC has said that the polls will be held in two phases with voting on December 22 and 27 while the results will be declared on December 30. With polls being notified the model code of conduct has come into force with immediate effect in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-cong-and-jd-s-set-for-another-electoral-battle-as-ec-notifies-panchayat-polls/story-YIt8BnEKnKOe3e0S0NN7ZN.html

Modern flood management principles adopted by the Dutch nation are of great value to India besides the culture of fitness and passion for cycling are worth emulating, he said on the last day of his tenure in this country. “The pandemic has opened everyone’s eyes to the need to stay healthy and build immunity. Bicycles are cheap, efficient and environment friendly. Electric bikes of the kind popular in the Netherlands can transport people over long distances with little effort. If manufactured in India in large numbers, prices will also be reasonable,” Rajamony told PTI in an interview over telephone. He said that India has strong economic interests in the Netherlands in terms of trade and investment. In the financial year 2020-2021 (April-June), the Netherlands is the second largest investor into India at USD 1.085 billion, the senior diplomat said. In the ongoing fiscal (April-September 2020), the Netherlands was the third largest destination for Overseas Direct Investment (ODI) from India with investments estimated at USD 679.12 million, Rajamony said. The top two destinations were Singapore and the US. Rajamony, who superannuates on Monday after putting in over three decades as an Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer, said that the relations between India and the Netherlands are at an all-time high and significant progress has been made during his tenure. “My tenure has been wonderful here. I have been touched by the affection I got from the Dutch people as well as those from India. We have achieved so much,” he said. Speaking about the role of the Indian diaspora in furthering the bilateral ties, Rajamony said that he would like the vibrant Indian diasporas in the Netherlands to be more actively involved in further strengthening Indo-Dutch relationship. “The strength of India is the strength of Indian diaspora too,” he said, citing the diverse and pluralistic nature of his home country.Also Read | Centuries-old Netherlands-India textile tradition revived with cotton printing studio De Katoendrukkerij’s opening “I came here (the Netherlands) without too much expectation. The job of Ambassador here is a very unique kind of position,” Rajamony said, highlighting the presence of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Dutch nation. A career diplomat, Rajamony has been working as India’s Ambassador to the Netherlands since June, 2017. He previously served at Hong Kong, Beijing, Geneva, Washington DC and Dubai among others. Rajamony also served as the chief of staff to External Affairs Minister and as Press Secretary to former President Pranab Mukherjee. He is also the Permanent Representative of India to the OPCW in The Hague as well as responsible for India’s relations with the ICJ and the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Rajamony was a member of the Indian legal team which successfully presented India’s views before the ICJ during the Kulbhushan Jhadav case. Jadhav, a retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. Weeks later, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence. The ICJ, then, restrained Pakistan from executing him. Ambassador Rajamony also appeared before the ICJ on behalf of India in the matter of advisory opinion on the Chagos Peninsula. India has supported Mauritius over its claim on disputed Chagos islands, which is home to Diego Garcia -- the key military base of the UK and the US in the Indian Ocean. Asked about things that he may wish to bring to India from the Netherlands, he said the culture of bicycling and fitness is something very positive to emulate. “The separate cycle tracks and associated infrastructure is well planned. Flood management systems are very advanced in the Netherlands. I also captured this in my book ‘What we can learn from the Dutch: Rebuilding Kerala Post 2018 floods’,” Rajamony said. “Dutch are quite efficient and direct in their communication. They also enjoy their holidays which are something admirable, particularly when you have a hectic work schedule,” he said. To a question on some of the unfinished tasks, he said India and the Netherlands have two centres of excellence (CoE) in agriculture - one on vegetables in Baramati, Maharashtra and a recently inaugurated Centre of Excellence for vegetables and flowers at Wayanad, Kerala. “Under the Indo-Dutch Joint Action Plan, more centres of excellence are planned. I hope we can operationalise the remaining soon so that India can benefit from Dutch techniques and know-how,” Rajamony, who hails from Kerala, said. Dutch can also contribute towards development of India’s inland water navigation system, port infrastructure and logistics network, he added. In a rare gesture, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte recently wrote a personal letter thanking Rajamony for his contributions in strengthening the Indo-Dutch relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/huge-potential-for-furthering-indo-dutch-economic-ties-says-india-s-envoy-venu-rajamony/story-KnHzsv3ocAn4zLokuFHWnI.html

The pilots’ bodies said that frontline workers continued to be shackled with an ‘indefinite and unilateral wage cut’ of up to 70 per cent while the top management faced only a 10 per cent deduction. The letter reiterated the civil aviation ministry’s statement where it expressed confidence that air travel would reach pre-coronavirus pandemic level by the end of 2020 and pointed out that while other airlines were rolling back the austerity pay cuts for their pilots, Air India increased the wage cut for its pilots from October. The bodies also added this was unfair to the pilots of Air India and its subsidiaries.“Pilots who test positive for Covid-19 need to undergo quarantine/hospitalisation. This has to be followed by a NOC, mandatory medical checks and DGCA approval. The entire process to get back to flying takes more than a month. Is it fair to deny these pilots their livelihood due to an occupational hazard? Is this how MoCA wants to treat the workmen who are making the Vande Bharat flights possible,” it said.The bodies further highlighted that the top management had let it down ‘tremendously’ and urged the ministry to intervene immediately and put a stop to this victimisation.Air India has been the Centre’s official carrier for the ‘Vande Bharat Mission’ - under which Indian citizens stuck in other countries were being evacuated and brought back home amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilots-bodies-request-urgent-meet-with-hardeep-singh-puri-over-wage-cut/story-WBNNUw1Eix5YO9R3IaHOiK.html

Criticising the use of water cannons on protesting farmers near Delhi in this cold wave sweeping parts of north India as “cruel”, the Sena also said that the BJP is raking up the Khalistan issue to start their “politics” in Punjab.“Our farmers are being treated as terrorists and attacked on the Delhi border while terrorists are killing our soldiers on the border in Kashmir. BJP wants to vitiate the atmosphere…. Khalistan is a closed chapter for which Indira Gandhi and General Arunkumar Vaidya laid down their lives. BJP is now unnecessarily raking up the Khalistan issue. It wants to spark the issue and start its politics in Punjab,” the editorial in Saamana said.Farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting for the past five days and have gathered at the Haryana-Delhi border as they are denied entry into the national capital. The farmers are protesting against new agricultural laws that the Centre says will bring reforms. They fear the new law will allow corporates to control prices and take away their minimum guaranteed earnings.Commenting on the use of Central agencies by the ruling government at the Centre to target opposition-ruled states, the Sena said, “The ED and CBI should be given an opportunity to prove their valour. Every time bullets don’t work. At Delhi’s border, our farmers are called terrorists while terrorists are entering the Kashmir border and Ladakh. At such times, ED and CBI should be sent to the borders. There is no other option.”The editorial published on Monday said that the giant statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat will be shedding tears at the treatment meted out to the farmers. It further added that the BJP is using all tools to destabilise the government of the opponents in all non-BJP ruled states, including Maharashtra, but the same “determination” is not seen while battling the enemies of the country.“Farmers are stopped at the Delhi border. Since they are from Punjab they are termed terrorists and Khalistani. Farmers are charged with rioting, attempt to murder, etc. Seeing all this the grand statue of Sardar Patel must have shed tears,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-enforcement-directorate-should-be-sent-to-borders-shiv-sena-takes-dig/story-2N4M1P5TONmPFyYD8M73WO.html

It is a make-or-break question||As India and China prepare for the 9th round of military dialogue to restore status quo ante in East Ladakh sector, New Delhi is waiting for “certain clarifications” on the disengagement and de-escalation roadmap from Beijing, people familiar with the matter said.According to military and diplomatic officials based in Delhi and Beijing, the window of opportunity for disengagement and de-escalation from the friction points along the 597 km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) would close in December when very heavy snows, polar temperatures and high-velocity winds sweeping the Tibetan plateau and Ladakh heights would make any significant movement of troops, artillery and armour will be near impossible. As of now both sides have deployed more than three divisions of troops on each side with missile, artillery and armor support.“There is a roadmap on the table but India has asked for specific clarifications from China on the stepwise disengagement by both the Indian Army and People’s Liberation Army. The clarifications could be a deal-breaker but the answers are awaited from Beijing. Step by step disengagement and de-escalation moves will be detailed in a written agreement if the clarifications are to satisfaction of both the countries,” said an official in the know of the matter.The Border Roads Organization (BRO) already is fighting an uphill battle to keep the Zoji La axis open till 31 December 2020, since the weather in east Ladakh has taken a turn for worse with multiple snowfalls and the temperature already way below the minus 20 degree-mark. The terrain on the Indian side of the LAC is mountainous and glaciated, while it is a flat plateau on the Tibet side of China.Also Read: Indian Army takes a leaf out of Chinese warfare, deploys tunnel defences in LadakhSince PLA aggression on the north bank of the Pangong Tso in May 2020, followed by transgressions in Galwan, Gogra-Hot Springs, the armies of two countries have been locked in a stand-off at multiple points in East Ladakh for more than six months. The Indian counter to PLA aggression was to occupy heights south of Pangong Tso, the saltwater glacial lake spread across 700 sq km - half the size of the national capital Delhi - and dominating the Chushul-Moldo area with Kailash Ranges ridgeline under its control.The PLA wants India to first disengage from south of Pangong Tso but New Delhi has made it clear that the Chinese military will first have to vacate the forward areas before the Indian Army retreats from the commanding heights south of the lake.Also Read: Chinese construction activities along Indian border ‘provocative’: US lawmakerGiven that the PLA has built roads right up to its outposts on LAC, New Delhi believes that the disengagement of the two armies should be such that time taken to return to the withdrawal point is the same for both sides.India has taken a cautious approach to disengagement and de-escalation, a senior official said, pointing that New Delhi will have to set aside its deep distrust of the PLA that has grown over the last six-seven months. India has, on several occasions, underlined that China had violated 30 years of written agreements for maintaining peace and tranquillity along the LAC by escalating the standoff and later reiterating its 1959 claim on Ladakh, which had been rejected by India the first time it was proposed by Mao Zedong’s regime, to justify its actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-seeks-some-answers-from-china-before-9th-round-of-talks-on-ladakh/story-GnLhJhOZy8tU3S9faGpYIL.html

30-11-2020||India||‘In 2024 Lok Sabha polls support will be for the party backing Gorkhaland demand’: Roshan Giri||Senior leader of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha’s(GJM) Bimal Gurung faction Roshan Giri on Sunday said they are not giving up their demand for Gorkhaland and will extend support to that party in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections which will back their demand for a separate state.However, in the 2021 West Bengal assembly elections the Bimal Gurung faction of the GJM will support the Trinamool Congress(TMC) and like to see Mamata Banerjee become the chief minister for the third time, Giri told reporters after a rally in Kurseong.The GJM led by fugitive Gorkha leader Bimal Gurung on October quit the National Democratic Alliance(NDA) and aligned with TMC, saying the saffron party has “failed to find a permanent solution” for the Hills -- which had witnessed major unrest over demand for a separate state in 2017.On Sunday, Giri, the general secretary of the outfit, said, “We will extend support to Mamata Banerjee in the coming assembly polls. She had fulfilled her promises about development in Darjeeling hills. But the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP), despite securing our support in Lok Sabha polls since 2009, had failed to honour its promises.” “We don’t trust BJP but we have faith in Trinamool Congress.” About the TMC not supporting the Gorkhaland demand in past, he said, “The Trinamool Congress government cannot do anything to fulfil our statehood demand, they don’t have the requisite power.” TMC government will ensure development of the hills. The BJP government at Centre had failed to honour their statehood promise to GJM in all these years, Giri alleged.“In 2024 Lok Sabha polls, our support will be for the party backing the Gorkhaland demand,” he said.Ruling out any reconciliation with the Binoy Tamang faction, he claimed that Gorkhaland Territorial Administration Chairman Anit Thapa and GJM leader Binoy Tamang have no base in the hills and accused them of being involved in financial wrongdoings.Tamang too had recently levelled similar charges against the Gurung faction and ruled out any understanding with them.Giri returned to Darjeeling district on Saturday, more than three years after slipping out of the hill station, following the police launching a manhunt for him and other party leaders in connection with violent incidents during the 2017 Gorkhaland statehood agitation.Gurung and Giri had resurfaced in Kolkata in October pledging support to Mamata Banerjee and announcing they severed links with the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-2024-lok-sabha-polls-support-will-be-for-the-party-backing-gorkhaland-demand-roshan-giri/story-6jwDL4u3260vQiGmHXqgRM.html

His statement came soon after a two-hour meeting with office bearers of Rajini Makkal Mandram, an extension of his fan club, in Chennai.“Districts secretaries told me they are with me on whatever I decide. I will announce my decision as soon as possible,” Rajinikanth told reporters outside his residence after the meeting. The announcement comes in the backdrop of doctors advising the Tamil superstar to not enter politics due to his health condition. Last month, after a letter stating Rajinikanth will not be entering politics did the rounds on social media, the actor denied releasing any such letter. “The leaked letter that has been circulated is not mine. However, the information in it about my health and doctors advice is true. Regarding my political stand, I will discuss with Rajini Makkal Mandram and announce at an appropriate time,” Rajinikanth had written on Twitter in Tamil.The actor had confirmed his plunge into politics in December 2017 and even confirmed setting up his own party. He also set up a website to register members from his fan clubs as well as those willing to join his party. The website is called rajinimandram.org and it’ll assemble all his fans under the click of a mouse button.However, soon after the launch of the website, speculations were rife that Rajinimandram could be the name of Rajinikanth’s party, but it is yet to be confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajinikanth-says-districts-secretaries-with-me-will-announce-my-decision-soon-on-his-next-political-move/story-8elBIurZDicNthQvIBW5NL.html

Most fishers told us they mend and repurpose nets if they can, but if they can’t do that the nets are often discarded in the river,” said Nelms. “Many held the view that the river ‘cleans it away’, so one useful step would be to raise awareness of the real environmental impacts,” she said. The findings offer hope for solutions based on “circular economy” where waste is dramatically reduced by reusing materials, according to Professor Heather Koldewey, from the Zoological Society of London(ZSL). “A high proportion of the fishing gear we found was made of nylon 6, which is valuable and can be used to make products including carpets and clothing,” Koldeway said. “Collection and recycling of nylon 6 has strong potential as a solution because it would cut plastic pollution and provide an income,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plastic-pollution-from-fishing-nets-threatening-wildlife-in-ganga-study-finds/story-Ma4r298OWOb3pO8NsW5x7L.html

Eshwarappa said that the party might give a ticket to a candidate of any community of the Hindus but not to Muslims. “We might give the party ticket to any community of Hindus. Whoever we might give it to - maybe Lingayats, Kurubas, Vokkaligas, or Brahmins but definitely, it will not be given to Muslims,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. A candidate who can win by gaining the trust of the people will be selected, the senior BJP leader told reporters. “Belagavi is one of the centres of Hindutva, there is no question of us giving tickets to Muslims here,” he added. The Belagavi Lok Sabha seat fell vacant recently following the death of Union minister of state for railways Suresh Angadi due to Covid-19. The bypoll for the seat is yet to be announced by the Election Commission.Earlier in April last year, Eshwarappa had in Koppal said that BJP will not give tickets to Muslims to contest the elections as they do not believe in the party. However, he had later clarified that he was not hater of any community including Muslims and his statement was in response to a question about a specific leader from the community getting a ticket from the BJP.

The 46-year-old actor will join the Shiv Sena on Tuesday, senior party leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said. She is likely to be inducted formally at Matoshree in the presence of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his son and state minister Aaditya. “She [Matondkar] is anyway a Shiv Sainik. She may join the Sena formally tomorrow… Our women leadership is getting stronger,” Raut told reporters in Mumbai, when asked if the actor is joining the party. Matondkar did not respond to HT’s calls or message, seeking her comment on the development. However, her husband Mohsin Akhtar said that she is scheduled to address a press conference in Juhu on Tuesday at 4pm. According to party insiders, the Sena has already proposed Matondkar’s name for one of the 12 Governor-nominated seats in the state legislative Council. Last year, Matondkar had contested the Lok Sabha polls from Mumbai North constituency on a Congress ticket. She was defeated by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Gopal Shetty. In September, she quit the Congress, stating that her efforts to work for the betterment of the party did not find support. She also cited “petty in-house politics” as one of the reasons behind her resignation. Senior party leaders said that the leadership was impressed with the manner in which Matondkar took on actor Kangana Ranaut when the latter and the Sena were locked in a war of words after Ranaut equated Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Matondkar will be an additional resource for the Sena to put out its messages on a national level. Party insiders said that Matondkar is a well-known face nationally, has a good social connect within Maharashtra and will become an additional voice for the party on issues. “Urmila is a Mumbai girl, who wants to work for Mumbai and its development. She is a well-known face across the country and voice and a well-read person. She is not just fluent in Marathi, but speaks Hindi and English also fluently. We are sure that she will fulfil any responsibility well that Uddhavji gives,” said Manisha Kayande, Member of legislation Council (MLC) from Sena and party spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/urmila-matondkar-to-join-shiv-sena-on-december-1-sanjay-raut/story-CzUWdm4aUt9bavydyWLMEJ.html

It took forest officials more than three hours to tranquilize the animal, which was trapped under a cane sofa placed in the verandah of the ground floor of the hostel where the owner stays. “The animal must have entered the premises in the wee hours as seen in CCTV camera footage. It entered the grilled verandah and got trapped under a sofa,” said Mousumi Bora, owner of Milestone paying guest hostel for girls located at Hengerabari area of the city. “I was the one to see it first. I mistook it for a piece of cloth and nearly grabbed its tail before realizing what it is. We locked ourselves in and informed forest officials. There are 15 girls in the hostel at present and they also locked themselves in their rooms immediately,” she added. It took forest and police officials a lot of effort to tranquilize the animal as they didn’t have a clear view of it. But when they finally managed to hit it with a tranquilizer shot, the leopard left the spot and entered a nearby house. Forest officials finally managed to put the tranquilized animal in a cage and shift it to the Assam state zoo at about 11 am. “Since the animal is sedated, it will be kept in the zoo till it wakes up. We will check if it has sustained any injuries. A microchip will be inserted into the animal and it will be released in a forest later,” said Tejas Mariswamy, divisional forest officer, Assam state zoo. As Guwahati is surrounded by forest and hills, leopards are frequently seen in the city and sometimes enter houses. In August this year, a 6-year-old boy was killed by a leopard in the city and in June local residents had killed and paraded a leopard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leopard-enters-girls-hostel-in-guwahati-tranquilized-and-sent-to-state-zoo/story-4SPIPplyvAIGVzmLdLv5pO.html
30-11-2020||India||South Korea considers more vaccine buys as coronavirus cases surge||South Korea’s ruling party has called for the country to buy millions of additional coronavirus vaccine doses after a spike in infection numbers raised concerns about the government’s existing plans.South Korea already plans to secure enough doses to vaccinate 30 million people, or about 60% of the population, but Democratic Party lawmakers said they would appropriate funds to buy doses for at least 44 million people.“The party plans to allocate an additional 1.3 trillion won ($1.2 billion) to next year’s budget,” an official with Democratic Party lawmaker Lee Nak-yon’s office told Reuters.South Korea is battling one of its largest waves of coronavirus infections yet, fuelled by small outbreaks in the densely populated capital city of Seoul and surrounding areas.The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 438 new coronavirus cases as of midnight Sunday, bringing the country’s total to 34,201 cases and 526 deaths. The government’s current vaccine purchase plan puts it well ahead of a World Health Organization (WHO) goal for the early purchase of supplies for 20% of most vulnerable people, and the minimum of 40% agreed by European Union nations, Britain and EU partners for their populations.Korean authorities have said they are not in a rush to procure large numbers of vaccines quickly because the country has succeeded in keeping infection rates at controllable levels, preferring to wait and see which vaccines worked best.Securing more vaccines of different types is also necessary because their safety has yet to be guaranteed, the KDCA said on Monday.The KDCA has said they do not expect to start vaccinating the public until the second quarter of 2021.The Korea National Enterprise for Clinical Trials said that as of Monday 3,500 people have pre-registered to participate in clinical trials for coronavirus experimental vaccines and treatment drugs, though a smaller number will be selected to participate.Under the current plan, the government has secured a third of the needed doses via the COVAX facility, an international Covid-19 vaccine allocation platform co-led by the WHO, with the remaining doses purchased from private companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/south-korea-considers-more-vaccine-buys-as-coronavirus-cases-surge/story-kcPnJRhSdrO4fC41htnTWL.html

Khalistan is a closed chapter for which Indira Gandhi and General Arunkumar Vaidya laid down their lives,” it said.“The government is using all its might to crush political opponents but why is this determination not seen while dealing with the country’s enemies,” it asked.In the last one month, 11 soldiers from Maharashtra attained martyrdom while fighting enemies on the borders, the Sena said.Also Read |  Leaders weigh in on issue in India, abroadReferring to the giant statue of Sardar Patel “erected by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah” in Gujarat, the editorial said Patel was also a leader of farmers and led many farmers’ agitation against the British. “His statue’s eyes must be moist now seeing how farmers are being treated,” it said.Central agencies like ED and CBI are being used as weapons against political opponents, the Sena said.“These agencies should also get a chance to display their valour,” it said and suggested that (personnel of) ED and CBI should be deployed in Ladakhand Kashmir to help the Army fight India’s enemies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-slams-bjp-calls-using-water-cannons-on-farmers-amid-cold-wave-cruel/story-swfrlF8AXq6S63uJ7HjAZP.html

It led to a brief period of silence on Rajya Sabha TV too. The Opposition had accused the Rajya Sabha authorities of deliberately switching off the microphones to silence the critics of the Bills. The CPWD, responsible for the maintenance of the Parliament building, wrote to the Rajya Sabha secretariat, “It is informed that abrupt interruption in the audio feed of the Rajya Sabha proceedings between 13.05hrs and 13.35hrs on September 20 during consideration of two farmer’s bills by Rajya Sabha was due to damage to the chairman’s microphones by the Hon’ble MPs.” Some Opposition MPs were accused of wrenching the microphone of the deputy chairman Harivansh, storming into the Well of the House, throwing papers and House rule book at the Chair and abusing him. They hurled some papers at the deputy chairman. As many as eight Opposition leaders were suspended till the end of the monsoon session for these “gross disorderly conduct” leading to another round of tussle between the Opposition and the government. Also read | Farmer groups say no political parties will be allowed to speak at protests, term Burari site as ‘open jail’While the Opposition denied uprooting microphones, the CPWD corroborated with what the government managers had said. “As per the directions of the chair, no other mic was on except those of the chairman. So, when these mics were broken, there was no audio output from the system to RSTV,” it wrote to the Rajya Sabha secretariat. Ruling out any technical issue causing interruption, it said, “the sound system was working perfectly and audio feed resumed when the broken mics were replaced with the permission of marshals and table office.” On September 20, Parliament marshals formed a double-layered barricade to protect Harivansh, who was presiding over the proceedings when the MPs charged at him, ostensibly for not paying heed to their demand for a division of votes on the two agricultural reform Bills. The bills were passed by voice vote, without being referred to a select committee of Parliament. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress accused each other of not upholding democratic norms after action was ordered by Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu against MPs from four Opposition parties for their protest in which they stormed the Well of the House and charged towards the Chair, which was at that time occupied by deputy chairman Harivansh. Trinamool Congress floor leader Derek O’Brien and his colleague Dola Sen; Aam Admi Party’s Sanjay Singh; Congress’s Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Borah; and KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) were suspended for seven days each. The last time a large group of MPs was suspended from the Upper House was in 2010, when seven MPs from three parties were barred for the rest of the session over their protests against the Women’s Reservation Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpwd-blames-opposition-leaders-for-muted-microphones-in-rs-during-farm-bills-passage/story-EQmOkCyFoHgpiYjvbMXXVM.html

The announcement, which PM Modi made on Sunday in his monthly radio address Mann Ki Baat, came on the eve of the Dev Deepawali celebrations, which the prime minister will attend in Varanasi on Monday. “Every Indian would feel proud to know that an ancient idol of Maa Annapurna is being brought back from Canada to India,” PM Modi said in the 71st episode of the programme. Explaining the connection of Goddess Annapurna with Varanasi, the prime minister said, “Mata Annapurna has a very special bond with Kashi. And the return of the idol is very pleasant for all of us. Like the statue of Mata Annapurna, much of our heritage has been a victim of international gangs.” Over 100 years ago in 1913, the idol was stolen from a temple in Varanasi and smuggled out of the country. On Monday, the PM will light the first diya (earthen lamp) at Rajghat to start the illumination at all 80 ghats that will be decorated with over a million diyas and colourful lights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ancient-idol-of-goddess-annapurna-to-be-brought-back-to-india-from-canada-pm-modi/story-PKUKiF4UQ5FqJfDNGcaLFM.html

Jogani then went to Shah’s office at BMC and gave him diamonds worth Rs62.85 lakh. At that time, Jogani added, Dolchiwala was also present at Shah’s office. The men took the diamonds and signed receipts against the same.Also read | Mumbai diamond trader duped of Rs1.29 lakh in commonplace KYC update fraudJogani said some other diamond traders had also handed over diamonds to the duo on that day. Many of them later went to Shah’s office and asked him to return the diamonds. He, however, expressed inability to do so, claiming that Dolchiwala had taken them all. Jogani added that attempts were made to contact Dolchiwala at his Surat residence, but he could not be traced.Meanwhile, Dolchiwala had moved the high court for a pre-arrest bail, contending that he was wrongly implicated in the case as an accused and he had nothing to do with the misappropriation of the diamonds. He added that he was merely sitting with Shah who accepted all the diamonds.Assistant public prosecutor SR Agarkar, however, pointed out that the investigation has revealed that Dolchiwala took all the diamonds. He pointed out that the CCTV footage collected by police showed that both Shah and Dolchiwala accepted the precious stones and both signed the receipts, and later Shah handed over the diamonds to the Surat resident who kept those in his pockets and left Shah’s office.Agarkar also pointed out that Dolchiwala had taken away diamonds worth Rs3.87 crore. “The investigation carried out so far has revealed that the diamonds given by the informant were taken away by the present applicant. His complicity in the offence is shown during the investigation,” said the judge, rejecting Dolchiwala’s plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-refuses-pre-arrest-bail-to-surat-resident-who-fled-with-diamonds-worth-rs3-87-crore/story-mvZk25M0roZXQfJMRT5xHM.html

Health and education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Monday that classes in elementary schools from kindergarten to Class 6 will resume from January 1 and hostels in residential schools and colleges will start in a limited manner from December 15. “The Covid-19 situation in Assam is satisfactory and under control. But keeping in mind, the situation in other parts of India and the world, we are on alert. A survey by a weekly magazine has ranked Assam as the best state in Covid-19 management,” Sarma told journalists in Guwahati. Till Sunday, Assam had recorded 2,12,617 Covid-19 cases with 981 deaths. At present there are 3,350 active cases in the state. The recovery rate is 98% while the death rate is 0.46%. Sarma informed that the number of positive cases have continuously gone down in November starting from 325 cases on an average daily in the first week of the month to 158 cases daily in the last week. “Keeping in view the present situation, we have decided to allow opening of elementary schools from kindergarten to Class 6 from January 1 and allow residential schools and colleges to allow final year students to stay in hostels from December 15,” he said. Though Assam had allowed resumption of offline classes from Class 7 and above earlier, the junior classes had not started in schools. Sarma informed that classes will start in a staggered manner and detailed SOPs will be announced within the next few days. Students will be allowed to attend classes based on written consent from parents and students staying in hostels will be allowed entry only after they undergo Covid-19 tests. “We have closed all temporary Covid Care Centres (CCCs) in the state due to the improved situation. In the meantime, the number of beds in hospitals has been increased. The temporary CCCs will open again if the Covid-19 situation deteriorates in the coming days,” said Sarma. There were over a dozen CCCs operating in Guwahati and another 20 more in the rest of the state earlier. Sarma informed that the Centre has asked states to prepare details on the four categories of people who would get vaccinated first—1) doctors, nurses, frontline workers, 2) police, army, para-military personnel, 3) senior citizens and 4) persons with co-morbidities. “Based on preliminary survey, there would be nearly 60 to 70 lakh people in Assam falling in those categories.

30-11-2020||India||Simultaneous production of sugar, power generation from bagasse is environment-friendly, says IIT-Bombay study||Simultaneous production of sugar and electricity generation from bagasse -- a by-product of sugarcane -- in mills is more environment-friendly and consumes less water than undertaking these processes separately, finds a study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay. Researchers found that the production of a tonne of sugar is likely to release greenhouse gases equivalent to 324 to 834kg of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are the key greenhouse gases (GHGs) that can hang in the air for almost 300 to 1,000 years and trap heat in the atmosphere, thereby increasing the temperature on earth. India is one of the leading producers of sugar in the world, and Maharashtra is the second-largest sugarcane producer in India with 82 million tonne (mt) production in 2018. “Scenarios with only sugar production lead to more GHG emissions, water consumption and other environmental impacts than scenarios with both sugar and surplus electricity production,” said the study published on November 13 in the Journal for Cleaner Production, a peer-reviewed journal published by Elsevier. Also read | Bharatiya Kisan Union to continue Dilli Chalo stir from UP Gate, decides to prolong staySugarcane cultivation alone accounts for more than 90% of greenhouse gas emissions in the entire life cycle of sugar production. Coal-based electricity consumption for irrigation and application of chemical fertiliser and cattle manure lead to this high level of emissions. Sugarcane milling accounts for 6-7% and cogeneration of electricity from bagasse accounts for 2-3% of emissions, finds the study. Researchers from IIT-B -- Moonmoon Hiloidhari, a PhD scholar from the interdisciplinary programme in climate studies, Rangan Banerjee, professor in the department of energy science and engineering and Anand Rao, professor and head of the Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas -- set out to understand the interaction of bioenergy, climate and environment in the production of sugar. They found that the energy return on investment (EROI) for producing sugar and using bagasse to produce electricity together was much higher than that for only sugar production or cogeneration of electricity. In simple terms, the energy generated from production of sugar and electricity surpassed the energy required for both the jobs, leaving producers with surplus electricity for sale. “We have detailed ways to reduce the carbon footprint, water crisis of sugar production and to improve environmental sustainability of sugarcane in Maharashtra. We have also discussed how sugar factories can become cleaner energy generators,” said Hiloidhari. The researchers suggest that sugar producers cultivate high-yielding sugarcane such as adsali or pre- seasonal to reduce environmental impact of sugarcane cultivation and increasingly use renewable energy-based irrigation systems. “Micro-irrigation techniques such as drip and sprinkler should be preferred over the existing flood irrigation system to reduce water consumption for sugarcane cultivation. Producers should choose truck-based transportation instead of a tractor to reduce energy demand and emissions from biomass transportation. Adopting modern cogeneration technology to increase surplus electricity production is environment-friendly and will also enhance revenue of sugar mills,” said Hiloidhari.Abinash Verma, director general, Indian Sugar Mills Association said that most sugar factories in the country were net generators of water and generated electricity from bagasse. “When the sugarcane is crushed, 70% of what we get is water. So we do not draw any water from the ground after the first day of crushing for any of our activities, including cleaning of factories. The surplus water is treated and released for irrigation,” said Verma.With the new sugarcane season set to take off on Tuesday, Verma said that the target for the sugar industry is to replace 7.5-8% of petrol consumption in the country with ethanol, another byproduct of the sugar industry. “Currently, sugar mills in India generate around 8,000MW power from bagasse, 6,500 MW of which is supplied to the grid as surplus. In addition, we have successfully replaced 5% of petrol consumption with ethanol, which is mixed with petrol to fuel engines. Ethanol is a greener substitute of petrol and the target is to replace 20% of petrol with it by 2030,” added Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/simultaneous-production-of-sugar-power-generation-from-bagasse-is-environment-friendly-says-iit-bombay-study/story-aHMiIB76pwrZ6ys8vOmrOL.html

TMC leaders have, however, rubbished the allegations, saying the BJP is taking random names to create confusion and spread propaganda with an intention to bring down the morale of the TMC workers ahead of the 2021 elections.“It is just a matter of time before TMC leaders Subrata Mukherjee, Goutam Deb, Rabindranath Ghosh and Sourav Chakraborty switch sides. These matters will be first discussed within the (BJP) party before a decision is taken,” said Saumitra Khan, BJP MP. While Mukherjee, Deb and Ghosh are state ministers, Chakraborty is a TMC MLA from Jalpaiguri district in north Bengal.

We were with Mamata Banerjee and would remain within the party,” said Chakraborty. “I have my standards. Never even in my dreams can I think of joining the BJP,” said Deb. Another BJP MP, Locket Chatterjee, claimed TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee is likely to join the BJP. But Banerjee has also rubbished the allegations. “At least five TMC MPs could resign any moment. Saugata Roy may be speaking on behalf of the TMC in front of the camera but he would also join the list once the camera is off,” BJP MP Arjun Singh had told the media on Saturday. “In the coming days, the BJP will form the government (in West Bengal).

It is just taking random names of TMC leaders. They are naming only those from whom they are facing stiff opposition. This is propaganda,” said Kalyan Banerjee.

Following that, his party events will begin from December 5-7,” said Gautam. Informing about Nadda’s events during his visit, he said, “On December 5, he will hold meetings with the chief minister, cabinet, party core committee and party state office-bearers to discuss public issues and government work done. On the same day, he will also meet Covid-19 warriors and leaders of social and religious organisations.” Gautam informed that the following day on December 6, he will hold meetings with “district unit presidents, leaders of party’s different wings and presidents of the booths who are important party members on the ground.” “On the last day of his visit on December 7, he will hold meetings with mandal leaders and social media volunteers. He will help to chalk out the party strategy for 2022 assembly elections which the party is going to win by bagging 60-65 seats of a total of 70 seats,” he said. The party national general secretary who is also the in-charge of the party’s Punjab and Chandigarh state units expressed confidence that the BJP will triumph in the next assembly elections as, “The government and the party is working in commendable coordination in the state”. “Also, the way the people welcomed us on the way from the airport to the city on Saturday, it showed that people are very enthusiastic about the BJP and happy with the development being done by its government here,” said Gautam. The Opposition Congress, however, attacked Gautam on his claims of winning the 2022 assembly elections saying the “public will teach BJP a lesson in the polls”. Congress state president Pritam Singh said, “He is claiming to win 60-65 seats of total 70 seats.

They didn’t fulfill any of our demands from 2009 to 2020. We’ll support Mamata Banerjee in North Bengal. We want to see her as the third time CM. She keeps her promises,” news agency ANI quoted Giri, general secretary of the faction headed by Bimal Gurung, as saying. During a rally in the Darjeeling region, Giri said the BJP governments had assured the Gorkhas before three successive Lok Sabha polls that political crisis in the hills would be solved but nothing was done. “Actually they don’t have the political will to find a permanent political solution. Why does the Centre make tripartite talks a prerequisite when it comes to the Gorkhas? The creation of Telangana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand did not require tripartite talks,” Giri said. The Gorkhas lost 15 years because of the BJP, he added.The GJM led by fugitive Gorkha leader Bimal Gurung in October quit the NDA and aligned with TMC, saying the BJP had “failed to find a permanent solution” for the Hills -- which had witnessed major unrest over demand for a separate state in 2017.Giri also clarified the GJM was not giving up its demand for Gorkhaland and will extend support to that party in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections which will back their demand for a separate state.He also ruled out any reconciliation with the Binoy Tamang faction claiming that Gorkhaland Territorial Administration Chairman Anit Thapa and GJM leader Binoy Tamang have no base in the hills. Giri accused them of being involved in financial wrongdoings(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decided-to-defeat-bjp-who-cheated-us-will-support-mamata-banerjee-gjm-s-roshan-giri/story-I64rh7pNPDTck6CgWebkGO.html

30-11-2020||India||GHMC polls: BJP only knows ‘jumla’ and ‘hamla’, says KTR on last day of campaign||Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) working president KT Rama Rao on Sunday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party on the last day of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) election campaign saying that the BJP only knew two things: ‘jumla’ (fake promises) and ‘hamla’ (attack). Speaking at campaign rallies at Goshamahal, Sanath Nagar, and Secunderabad constituencies, Rao also asked what the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance had done for the city in the last six years. “Tell me what NDA did to Hyderabad in the last six years? Who brought the prestigious Apple, Amazon, and other major IT companies to Hyderabad? It is the BJP government which cancelled the ITIR project sanctioned by the UPA government for Hyderabad and acted against the hopes of youth in Telangana. BJP knows only two things, first is jumla and second is hamla,” Rao said. “Union Minister Amit Shah is saying ours is Nizam culture. Mahatma Gandhi, who is from your own Gujarat in 1920 said Hyderabad culture is Ganga-Jamuna ‘tehzeeb’ and people coexist here peacefully and the city stands as an example to India,” he added. Commenting on Shah’s statement that no communal riots took place in the county, the TRS leader reminded the home minister that communal clashes took place in Delhi during US President Donald Trump’s visit right under the Centre’s police jurisdiction, and that news was published in the New York Times, Washington Post, damaging the image of Delhi.With the visit of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for campaigning in the elections, KTR mentioned the recent gang-rape in Hathras asking, “You know right what will happen in Telangana when crimes happen against women?”He further said, “Hyderabad has been peaceful for the past six years. There has not been a single incident of communal tension. Today, they only want to divide people in the name of religion. I urge you all not to support such parties.”Rao also reacted strongly to the state BJP president Bandi Sanjay’s “surgical strike” comment saying, “Do surgical strikes on poverty, corruption and on those who commit crimes against women, not on Hyderabad. Today, for a few votes and seats they are spoiling the peace and harmony of Hyderabad.” He further said that the BJP government was on a selling spree, and if given the chance, they would sell GHMC too.The party president further went on to highlight the achievement of the presidents, calling Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao a “futuristic leader” for expanding the Keshavpuram reservoir which would ensure drinking water in Hyderabad for the next several years. He further mentioned the Kalyana Lakshmi, KCR Kit, Annapurna Canteen, Basthi Dawakhana, Ambedkar Overseas scholarships, Jyothirao Phule scholarship, among many others, adding that the TRS government would resume Rs 10,000 financial assistance from December 7 onwards. The GHMC elections are set to take place on December 1, and the city is witnessing a triangular contest among the ruling party in the state, Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), AIMIM, and BJP, which recently bagged the Dubbak Assembly seat in the recently concluded by-polls.National president JP Nadda recently held a roadshow in Hyderabad on Friday and slammed the opposition parties for terming the upcoming election a “gully ka chunav” (street elections).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghmc-polls-bjp-only-knows-jumla-and-hamla-says-ktr-on-last-day-of-campaign/story-Wvp8n9GFLkkUXb4soMrW1K.html
30-11-2020||India||PM Modi seeks to quell concerns on farm laws||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday sought to dispel concerns about recently enacted farm laws that he said had opened up new opportunities for cultivators, in the backdrop of protests by farmers in Punjab and Haryana who have marched to the Capital.“New dimensions are being added to agriculture and its related activities in India. The agriculture reforms in the past few days have also now opened new doors of possibilities for our farmers,” Modi said in his monthly radio broadcast Mann Ki Baat. Decades-old demands by farmers that political parties at various times had promised would be fulfilled are now being met with Parliament having passed the three farm laws after rigorous brainstorming, Modi said.“These reforms have not only broken shackles of farmers but have also given new rights and opportunities for them. These rights started mitigating problems that were being faced by farmers in a short span of time,” he said.Farmers want the Modi government to revoke the three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government-controlled agricultural markets. Together, the laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled “mandi system”, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, which earlier only government-approved agents could, and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed prices. The Prime Minister cited the example of a Maharashtra-based farmer, Jitendra Bhoiji, who used the new law to recover money that was owed to him. After failing to get the amount that was due to him even four months after selling his produce, Bhoji invoked a provision that it was mandatory to pay a farmer within three days of the purchase. “If the payment is not made, the farmer can make a complaint. Under the law there is a provision that the SDM {sub-divisional magistrate} of the area must address the complaint of the farmer within a month,” the PM said. The Prime Minister also cited the example of Mohammad Aslam in Rajasthan’s Baran who is creating awareness among farmers by updating them about the day-to-day rates in the local agricultural markets. Aslam is the CEO of a farm producers federation. A third example that the Prime Minister cited was that of Virendra Yadav, who returned from Australia to Haryana‘s Kaithal and has found a solution to farm stubble burning. Instead of burning stubble, which hurts air quality, Yadav has been selling the stubble to paper mills and agro energy plants and has made a profit in two years.With thousands of farmers continuing their protest against the Centre’s new laws, Union home minister Amit Shah said in Hyderabad on Sunday said they were meant for the welfare of farmers and called their agitation apolitical. He told reporters: “The new farm laws are meant for the welfare of farmers. After a long time the farmer is going to come out of a locked system. Whoever wants to oppose it politically, let them do it. I have never said the farmers’ protest is political and would never say (that it is political).”The Congress party, meanwhile, continued to attack the government over the farm laws. Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala said on Sunday that the new laws were “anti-farmer” and their endorsement by the PM raises questions over the outcome of upcoming talks between the government and farmers’ leaders.“In this cold weather, the agriculture minister is making the farmers wait till December 3 to speak to them…PM Modi in his Mann ki Baat said that the three laws are right for the farmers, then what is the point of talks,” Surjewala said.The Congress leader also demanded an apology from the Bharatiya Janata Party for equating farmers with terrorists.“Chief Minister of Haryana, ML Khattar, called them atanki (terrorists), head of the IT Cell Amit Malviya has dubbed them Khalistani. The Modi government and the Haryana government have filed over 12,000 cases against farmers who had opted for a Gandhian protest,” Surjewala said.He alleged that the government wanted to benefit big business and not small farmers.Surjewala said the Congress wanted all three laws to be suspended and the cases filed against farmers to be taken back. The PM should hold talks with the representatives of farmers protesting in Delhi, he said.“The law says farmers can move around to other states to sell their produce. When they are not able to sell their produce properly in their own area, then how will this benefit them and with contract farming, the government has started another kind of zamindari law. The farmers, under contract farming, won’t be able to fight against the corporate houses, who will become their owners,” Surjewala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-seeks-to-quell-concerns-on-farm-laws/story-0Ex2Y77phXujCkt2wTlTmO.html
30-11-2020||India||Farmers decline Amit Shah’s offer, want panel named||Leaders spearheading the farmers’ agitation have set fresh terms for talks with the Union government, demanding the Centre name and authorise a Cabinet committee or a group of ministers for future discussions, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) said on Sunday. Nearly 30 leaders of various farmers’ organisations met on Sunday to discuss home minister Amit Shah’s offer to advance the date for the next round of talks scheduled for December 3. Home secretary Ajay Bhalla had on November 28 written addressed to Darshan Pal Singh, the Punjab chief of the Krantikari Kisan Union, along with 31 organisations, reiterating the home minister’s offer for early talks. The AIKSCC said the home ministry should not lead the discussions as agriculture was outside its jurisdiction. “We have rejected the offer for talks with the home ministry. The home ministry has nothing to do with farmers or agriculture,” said Singh. In a reply to the home secretary’s invitation, the farmers’ representatives set new conditions for the next round of talks, calling for involvement of the “highest political level”. “The Prime Minister takes all decisions in the country. Although Union ministers have participated in the last round of talks, we are not sure if they are empowered to take any decisions. We want a Cabinet committee or a ministers’ group duly authorised or notified by the highest political level for further discussions,” said Avik Saha, the AIKSCC’s national secretary. Sunday is the fourth day since farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh among other neighbouring states set off on their “Dilli chalo” (march to Delhi) campaign to protest a set of laws to liberalise farm trade and open up agricultural markets in the country. Saha said during the anti-corruption agitation led by Anna Hazare in 2013, a Cabinet panel had been named to carry out negotiations with those leading the protests. “We want a similar mechanism for talks because sometimes, talks are led by the food and agriculture ministers and sometimes, they seem to be led by the home ministry,” Saha said. The latest stand of the farmers could delay the next round of talks, with the government looking forward to resolving the politically challenging agitation. “The AIKSCC has demanded that the government should stop dealing with the issue from the prism of intelligence agencies and home ministry. The government got these statutes rammed through Parliament and farmers expect a response that is political, from the highest levels of the government. Its attempt to invoke Home Ministry only acts as a threat to farmers, rather than arouse confidence in its sincerity,” the AIKCC said in a statement. Thousands of farmers have clashed with police, travelling toward the national Capital, where they are holding protests against the three farm laws approved by Parliament in September. Cultivators on tractors and trucks flung police barricades into a river near Ambala district as they advanced to the national capital, as police stopped them with tear gas and water cannons. The Union home ministry on Friday allowed farmers to assemble at the Capital’s Burari grounds and made a fresh offer for talks. “The farmers clearly want to be sure that ministers who would be negotiating with them should be authorised to take decisions. That seems to be the message,” said political analyst Sanjay Kukreti of the Osmania University. On Sunday, home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar met at BJP president JP Nadda’s residence in Delhi to discuss the farmers’ protest, officials quoted by news agency PTI said. Farmers want the Narendra Modi government to revoke three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of decades-old, government-controlled agricultural markets. Together, the laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled “mandi system”, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, which earlier only government-approved agents could, and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed prices. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal had held day-long negotiations with farmers on November 13. The discussions were inconclusive, but both sides had agreed to continue negotiations in the future. Opposition Congress hit out at the BJP-led central government for the alleged delay in reaching out to farmers.“Why is it that agriculture minister has taken out a date of 3rd December before which no conversation can be held? ... What is the sanctity of 3rd December?... Why is it that no conversation is taking place, no dialogue is taking place with the farmers?” asked party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-decline-amit-shah-s-offer-want-panel-named/story-sAJ4v7OGjkb0thGfM1hIaM.html
30-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Delhi is like France and India, the US.Intriguing as it may be to explore the contours of this claim across dimensions, this writer’s import is exclusively about the trajectory of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in these regions.Delhi’s third wave, for instance, is already behind it if the numbers are any indication — and this time (unlike the first and second waves in the Capital), there has been and continues to be adequate testing of the right kind for the numbers to stand scrutiny. The Union territory’s administration would appear to be managing this wave reasonably well — not merely managing the numbers like some regions have been wont to do.The sharp third wave in Delhi merits comparison with the equally sharp second wave in France. The European nation has managed this wave well, although, unlike Delhi, it was forced to re-impose a lockdown to get the soaring numbers under control. Indeed, for some time it appeared as if daily cases in France would exceed those in India, which would have been something given the populations of the two nations. France’s is 67 million, around thrice Delhi’s and 5% of India’s. India’s population is around 1.3 billion.But what’s with India’s trajectory?On Saturday, the country registered 41,799 cases, according to the HT dashboard. It conducted almost 1.24 million tests. To date, India has conducted almost 150 million tests. That’s around 115,000 tests per million of population.According to the NYT database, India’s seven-day average of cases was 42,445 on Saturday. It was 45,622 on November 1. The average dipped a bit — through the Diwali weekend, especially — but has since stabilised. Given that testing has not dropped off significantly in this period (although there are still far more rapid antigen tests being used than should be), this means that the second wave in India is beginning with a long plateau. Sure, another way of looking at it would be that the country is enjoying (although that is the wrong word in the context of the pandemic which has killed almost 140,000 people here) a longish interregnum between the first wave and the second. Thus, while India is back to trending red (which means its 7-day average is off recent lows and inching up), in the database maintained by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the trajectory of the curve is still relatively flat.Dispatch 212 on November 26 wrote of how the week that starts today, Monday, November 30 will show whether or not the festivities of two weeks ago have had an impact on the number of Covid-19 infections in India, but if that doesn’t happen, the trajectory of the pandemic in the country will be following that in the US. This will hold true even if the number of cases rises (but not by much) on account of the celebrations. From around the third week of August to the first week of October, the US enjoyed a similar relative respite, recording cases in the low 40,000s between the end of the second wave and the beginning of the third in that country. The third wave in the US gathered momentum in the second half of October and then really accelerated through much of November. The seven-day average of cases peaked at around 176,000 on November 25, according to the NYT database, and was at around 163,000 on November 28, but this may well be explained by lower testing and delays in reporting around the Thanksgiving weekend.How long will India continue to see a lull (if it can be called that)? That’s a function of how assiduously people are adhering to mask discipline and social distancing and how diligent local administrations are about testing and tracing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-ON1XPDlnVhV6byYY2mVAgL.html

The council of heads of government is the second highest body of SCO and is responsible for handling the grouping’s trade and economic agenda and approving its annual budget. This is the first time India is hosting a meeting of the body since it was admitted eight-member grouping in 2017. Pakistan’s participation in the meeting will be at the lowest level – the country will be represented by parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs Andleeb Abbas. Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will be represented by their prime ministers. Modi, Khan and Chinese President Xi Jinping had joined the virtual SCO summit, chaired by Russia earlier this month. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India has usually been represented at meetings of the SCO council of heads of government at the level of the external affairs minister, while defence minister Rajnath Singh had attended last year’s meeting in Uzbekistan. “Since India is hosting the meeting this year, the vice president will chair it,” said one of the people. In January, the external affairs ministry had said the SCO council of heads of government meeting is “held annually at the prime minister level” and that India would invite all eight members of SCO and four observer states and other international dialogue partners to the meet in November. Modi is set to visit his constituency of Varanasi on November 30 to launch the Varanasi-Prayagraj highway project and participate in Deepotsav celebrations at the Ganges ghats. Though Khan has joined virtual multilateral meetings hosted by other countries, he skipped the online meeting of leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) hosted by India in March to discuss ways to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. Pakistan’s representative at that meeting had created a flutter by raising the Kashmir issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-imran-khan-to-skip-sco-summit-today/story-OT0X89by1KupilRGkCvLIO.html
30-11-2020||India||Siachen lessons give India an edge||The Indian Army’s decades-long experience in high-altitude warfare -- particularly the lessons learnt in Siachen -- bestow a tremendous advantage on Indian soldiers holding inhospitable and rugged heights in eastern Ladakh to prevent the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from altering status quo in the sensitive theatre that has been at the centre of border tensions between India and China for nearly eight months, officials familiar with mountain warfare said on Saturday. The Indian Army has an upper hand over PLA as the latter lacks combat experi ence in high-altitude warfare and has not permanently deployed troops to extreme heights the way India has to secure its farthest frontiers, said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named. With military and diplomatic talks to reduce tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) deadlocked, India and China are prepared for a long haul in the eastern Ladakh theatre where rival troops are holding towering heights including deployments at an altitude of nearly 20,000 feet in the mountains near Pangong Tso. The Indian Army has perfected its mountain warfare drills over decades and its soldiers possess the tenacity and resilience to overcome the toughest challenges that extreme altitudes pose, said a second official. Apart from the tough physical and mental makeup of soldiers, the Indian Army’s demonstrated ability to support frontline military operations with superior logistics, advances in high-altitude medicine, critical understanding of acclimatisation in mountains and air support are factors that put the army in an advantageous position in eastern Ladakh, experts said. “Conditions at Siachen are infinitely more challenging than eastern Ladakh. The lessons learned in terms of survival, health care, protection from cold injuries and avalanche rescue will be of tremendous help,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). The army and air force helicopter pilots are the lifeline of troops deployed at Siachen. “These pilots are very familiar with high-altitude operations and their role in supporting troops in eastern Ladakh will be a great plus for us,” Hooda added. In eastern Ladakh, Indian soldiers are holding positions at heights of almost 20,000 feet in the Finger Area on the northern bank of Pangong Tso. The IAF has decades of air maintenance experience in high-altitude areas --- heights in excess of 15,000 feet --- and standard operating procedures are in place to serve as templates for both helicopters and transport aircraft, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies, commenting on the IAF’s role in supporting forward deployed troops in the Ladakh sector. “Hill flying is tricky, and every helipad in the mountains has its own peculiarities. We have a bank of aircrew experienced in such operations. The aircrew is backed up by a dedicated band of technicians who slog continuously to keep helicopters and transport aircraft flying-fit,” Bahadur said. India is determined to hold forward positions in Ladakh till the PLA withdraws and restores status quo ante of early April. With no solution to the border row in sight, the Indian Army has completed the setting up of modern habitat for thousands of soldiers deployed in forward areas to deal with any misadventure by the PLA. Temperatures in some pockets where the Indian Army is holding posts can dip to minus-40 degrees Celsius.At the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit on November 26 in the backdrop of the persisting stalemate at LAC, defence minister Rajnath Singh said that India would not allow the PLA to take any unilateral action at the contested border and the government had given full freedom to its armed forces to challenge, with all their might, any attempt to change the situation along the LAC in any manner. The Chinese military is grappling with the difficulties of mobilising and deploying tens of thousands of troops during the harsh winter --- something that it hasn’t done in the past, officials previously told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siachen-lessons-give-india-an-edge/story-uttFIgao8Oi6CQYKOCbB1O.html

We know toxics regulation in India- and most parts of the world- is lax. So while the report was a reminder to act, its revelations were no surprise. About 77% of the surveyed farmers used glyphosate to control weeds in crops, but it was not approved for these crops. That apart, Glyphosate is not in the list of residues monitored in India in our food. A common and illegally used toxic chemical is poisoning us, but we don’t even try to monitor it.Meanwhile, the US Environmental Protection Agency, in a draft biological evaluation, says Glyphosate is likely to cause harm to or kill 93% of endangered species there. The press release mentioned the Monarch Butterfly which migrates annually over 3600 kilometers from Canada to Mexico. Glyphosate could end this natural wonder.Let’s come back to India, our own country with extraordinarily rich biodiversity. It is reasonable to assume that our own biodiversity is also imperiled by Glyphosate. Three steps are essential. First, a tight clampdown on its availability. Six states have restricted its use, but this is not enough. Second, weed management must change- MNREGA should include weeding as part of its allowed tasks, to offset labour costs that promote herbicides today. Natural weed-management should be promoted, even by eliminating GM crops causing this. Third, intense awareness about Glyphosate in local languages is key. We must fix the problem fast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clamping-down-on-glyphosate-availability-first-step-to-curb-use/story-wgyJv6In7p6tSdNwSW1vzO.html
30-11-2020||India||Mehbooba calls for dialogue with Pak||Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and said there was “no place for democracy” under its government. “There is no place for real democracy in BJP’s India. They want to create their own ecosystem. They have their own puppets and B-teams whom they want to install here and that is why they are making so many efforts for DDC elections,” she told reporters a day after the first phase of the first District Development Council elections in the Union territory. Mufti’s PDP and the National Conference have formed the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration to work for the restoration of Article 370, which was nullified last year, along with other regional parties. The constituents of PAGD are jointly contesting the DDC polls, the first elections being held in the erstwhile state since the effective revocation of its special status and bifurcation into two Union territories, J&K and Ladakh.The former CM said elections were not the solution to the problems of the region. Instead, she added, the government should hold a dialogue with the people of J&K, and Pakistan. “Election is no solution to Kashmir problem but I am happy that people are voting and saying that India and Pakistan should talk. And talks should happen,” she said.“Despite China taking so much of our land, we are talking to them. It is now 10 rounds of talks with them,” Mufti said, referring to military and diplomatic talks being held with China in the wake of a standoff at along the Line of Actual Control in the eastern Ladakh sector. “And on the other hand, people are dying on our borders, on both the sides, why not talk to Pakistan? Is it about (Pakistan) being a Muslim country that there is no dialogue? Because everything is communal now; Sardar is a Khalistani, Muslim is a Pakistani and Kashmiri is a terrorist,” the PDP chief said.“How many people participate in the elections has got nothing to do with Kashmir issue. The Kashmir issue is there, it is going to be there as long as there is no resolution through dialogue with the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and Pakistan,” she said.Reacting to Mufti’s allegations, J&K BJP chief Ravinder Raina said, “The people of J&K have rejected the Gupkar Gang... There is a wave in favour of BJP in the ongoing DDC elections. Mehbooba Mufti is distraught owing to the verve of BJP activists, particularly youth. She has been rejected by the people...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-calls-for-dialogue-with-pak/story-m5PwvEmOgLEIdb35nA33CI.html
30-11-2020||India||Leaders weigh in on issue in India, abroad||The ongoing stir by thousands of farmers on the borders of the national capital echoed in foreign countries even as the Union government attempted to initiate talks with the protesters and the Opposition criticised the Centre for not defusing the crisis that saw a pitched battle on highways last week.In Delhi, Union home minister Amit Shah defended the Centre’s recently enacted farm laws and said they were meant for the welfare of agriculture. “After a long time the farmer is going to come out of a locked system. Whoever wants to oppose it politically let them do it. I have never said the farmers protest is political and would never say,” he said.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the Centre was ready to hold talks. “The government has proposed to meet on December 3 for the fourth time...but farmers’ unions should create an atmosphere for it. They should leave the route of agitation and choose a way of talks,” Tomar told ANI.On Sunday, the protests were mentioned by Canadian politician Jagmeet Singh, who criticised the Indian government’s use of force against the farmers. His brother Gurratan Singh, an MLA in the Ontario assembly also joined in, tweeting he felt the “pain and struggle of farmers protesting laws that threaten their livelihoods.” In the United Kingdom, Labour MPs of Indian origin criticised the police measures against the farmers, while many Sikhs held a car rally in Southall. Preet Kaur Gill, Labour MP from Birmingham Edgbaston and chair of the All Party Parliamentary Party for British Sikhs, saidm “This is no way to treat citizens who are peacefully protesting over the controversial farmers bill in India”.Four days ago, farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and other neighbouring states set off on their “Dilli chalo” campaign to protest a set of laws to liberalise farm trade and open up agricultural markets in the country. The protesters want the Centre to revoke three laws approved by Parliament in September that did away with a network of government-controlled agricultural markets.The protests triggered a bitter war-of-words between Punjab and Haryana chief ministers.Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh flayed Khattar for his allegations that the former did not attend to the latter’s calls to discuss the farm issues. “If at all someone from his office called my residence...Why were official channels not used to get in touch with me?” a statement from the Punjab government quoted him.This came after Khattar alleged that he made efforts to get in touch with Singh but could not get hold of him.Khattar hit back, saying he will hold his Punjab counterpart responsible if farmers’ gathering led to a worsening of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state. “...when protestors tried to move forward, we decided not to use force. I don’t consider tear gas and water cannon as a way of force. It is a means of restricting people,” Khattar told ANI.Senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda also hit out at Khattar and warned that if farmers’ problems are not resolved, a “bigger movement” will be undertaken. “Until the farmers win this battle, we stand firmly with the demands of the farmers...,” he said. Other opposition parties also attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for not resolving the farmers’ issues.“The government does not have any sympathy for the farmers. It is only worried about the corporate houses and how to fill their coffers and hold hostage the resources of the state,” Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said.Delhi home minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Satyendar Jain said the Centre should not set any conditions to hold talks with the agitating farmers. “Central government should talk to farmers immediately and unconditionally,” Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal tweeted.The Shiv Sena expressed sympathy with the farmers. “It is sad they are not being allowed to come to Delhi and are being treated as if they are terrorists and have come from outside the country. The government should consider the demands of farmers sympathetically,” Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leaders-weigh-in-on-issue-in-india-abroad/story-7Iigp0IPRrSH0C2J7CR8bJ.html

On Saturday, the PM was in Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Pune to review the development and manufacturing process of coronavirus vaccines at facilities in these cities.He first visited the Zydus Cadila’s manufacturing facility near Ahmedabad, where he was briefed about the vaccine development process.He then visited the Bharat Biotech’s vaccine manufacturing facility at Genome valley, located around 20 km from the Hyderabad air station. “At the Bharat Biotech facility in Hyderabad, was briefed about their indigenous Covid-19 vaccine. Congratulated the scientists for their progress in the trials so far. Their team is closely working with ICMR to facilitate speedy progress,” Modi tweeted after his hour-long visit there on Saturday.The final visit was to the Serum Institute of India (SII) at Manjari, in Pune where he interacted with the scientists and other executives, who briefed him on the vaccine’s progress.SII is conducting the phase-three trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, while Bharat Biotech and ICMR have started the phase-three trial of the indigenously developed COVAXIN jab. SII CEO and owner Adar Poonawalla recently announced that India will have the vaccine for vulnerable population by January-February if it gets satisfactory trial results by November or early December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-interact-with-three-teams-working-on-vaccine-today/story-rSzCssJHLjA8kX49wHnByN.html
30-11-2020||India||CBI retains officer to handle Dabholkar case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has re-employed a superintendent of police who is handling the trial in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case as well as investigations into the murder of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar for six months beyond the completion of his tenure, people familiar with the development said. Nandkumar Nair, who currently heads the agency’s special crime branches in Mumbai and Thiruvananthapuram, has been re-hired on a contract basis until May 31, 2021, according to an order issued by the agency’s New Delhi headquarters. He was set to retire on Monday. The people cited above said o condition of anonymity that CBI director Rishi Kumar Shukla wants Nair to take the probe into the murder of Dabholkar in 2013 to its conclusion, due to which he is being retained in the agency beyond his tenture. Dabholkar’s murder has suspected links with the murders of journalist-activist Gauri Lankesh in September 2017, and social activist M M Kalburgi and Communist leader Govind Pansare in 2015. The murders of Kalburgi and Lankesh are being probed by a special investigation team in Karnataka while Maharashtra police is investigating Pansare’s murder. CBI is coordinating with both. Subsequently, the trial in Ishrat Jahan encounter case is at crucial stage and CBI wants Nair to continue, said an official. In October, a special CBI court in Ahmedabad had rejected the discharge pleas of four officers – JG Parmar, Tarun Barot, GL Singhal and Anaju Chaudhary -- who were named in the encounter case by the agency. Jahan, Pranesh Pillai and two others were killed on the outskirts of Ahmedabad on June 15, 2004 by officers of Detection of Crime Branch. In Kerala too, Nair is handling sensitive probes including the murder of two Youth Congress leaders – Kripesh, 19, and Sarath Lal, 24, in Periya (Kasargod) on February 17, 2019, in which leaders of the state’s ruling party, Communist Party of India- Marxist, are accused. The state government had in September this year moved the Supreme Court challenging the CBI probe. Nair could not contacted for his comment. CBI didn’t respond to a query by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-retains-officer-to-handle-dabholkar-case/story-xz0VJc6IkZM45WJ8Yl0DwK.html
30-11-2020||India||SII to sue man over claims of Covishield side effects||Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine maker, said on Sunday that it plans to file a lawsuit seeking Rs 100 crore from a 40-year-old man who has demanded that the company pay him Rs 5 crore, claiming that he had developed serious side-effects in the human trials that the company conducted on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine candidate Covishield.The man has served a legal notice on Pune-based SII, claiming to have suffered a virtual neurological breakdown and impairment of cognitive functions, seeking Rs 5 crore in compensation and a halt to the trial.“The allegations in the notice are malicious and misconceived. While the Serum Institute of India is sympathetic with the volunteer’s medical condition, there is absolutely no correlation with the vaccine trial and the medical condition of the volunteer. The volunteer is falsely laying the blame for his medial problems on the Covid vaccine trial,” a SII spokesperson said.“The volunteer was specifically informed by the medical team that the complications he suffered were independent of the vaccine trial he underwent. In spite of specifically being made aware of the same, he still chose to go public and malign the reputation of the company... the intention behind the spreading of such malicious information is an oblique pecuniary motive. The Serum Institute of India will seek damages in excess of Rs 100 crore for the same and will defend such malicious claims,” the spokesperson added.The legal notice has been sent to SII, which has collaborated with Oxford University and Astra Zeneca Plc in testing Covishield, the vaccine candidate they developed, the Indian Council of Medical Research, one of the sponsors, and Chennai-based Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, which administered the vaccine to the man.Alleging that the candidate vaccine was not safe, the man who participated in the trial has also sought cancellation of the approval for its testing, manufacture and distribution, failing which, he said, legal action would be taken. The man, according to the notice, suffered acute encephalopathy, a disease that affects the brain, following vaccination and all tests confirmed that the setback in his health was because of the vaccine candidate.When contacted, a spokesperson for Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research said the institute had received the notice, but declined to elaborate.According to the legal notice, the information provided in the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) was absolutely certain that Covishield was safe and the man was hence led to believe the claim and sign up for the trial. He was administered the vaccine candidate on October 1. Although there were no side effects for the first 10 days, he subsequently had episodes like a severe headache and vomiting. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and the institutional ethics committee at the implementation site are investigating the adverse event. The DCGI declined to respond to the matter.A senior health ministry official said: all trial subjects across the world have to sign an “informed consent form”, before they undergo any clinical trial. This form also mentions illustrative instances of adverse events that may occur. The trial participant had signed a consent form. A senior faculty member at the institute who did not wish to be named said that the patient was admitted following complaints of a headache. “At the time of discharge, he did not have any major effects or neurological deficits and there was no basis to link the vaccine as the cause,” the senior doctor said, requesting anonymity. “He refused to take the second dose.” The hospital discharge summary accessed by HT states that he was recovering from acute encephalopathy (that alters brain function) with a diagnosis of vitamin D and B12 deficiency. The institute said that all regulatory bodies for the independent clinical trial such as the ICMR, Serum Institute and Central Drug Standard Control Organisation and the ethics committee of the trial were informed. “We are currently preparing our legal response.” Repeated calls and messages to the principal investigator of the trial, Dr S R Ramakrishnan, and the vice chancellor, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Dr P V Vijayaraghavan went unanswered. The institute has been conducting two trials-- on Covishield, developed by Oxford University/ Astra Zeneca and is being produced in a Pune laboratory and Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited.ICMR has also picked SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre in Chennai as one of its clinical trial sites for Covid-19 vaccines. Besides that, the state government is in the second phase of tests on Covishield which is nearing completion. “So far there have been no adverse reactions or events in candidates in the first and second doses that were given,” said Dr T S Selvavinayagam, director, directorate of public health and preventive medicine. “We will start trials for Covaxin soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-to-sue-man-over-claims-of-covishield-side-effects/story-tvjnCYL1PsKlgqSn31Rp2I.html

30-11-2020||India||This lucky mom found her son after 15 years as she recovered lost memories||Time is a cruel thing. A decade and a half of alienation can make a mother and son unrecognisable to each other. But what doesn’t fade is the love in their hearts. When you meet Rama Devi Chowdhary and her son Mitrajit, not for a moment it appears that the two have just been united after a separation of 15 long years, such is their bonding. Their story makes you believe in the power of faith. Criminal lawyer Rama Devi Chowdhary left her home in Kolkata after she had some differences with her husband. She came to Delhi to pursue a career in law. Beginning from Patiala Court, she soon started practising in the Supreme Court. But her career suffered a blow in 2012 when it was discovered during one of her hearings that she was suffering from schizophrenia. The judge directed the police to have her admitted in IHBAS where she was treated for her mental illness for nine months. In 2013, she was shifted to a government shelter. After two years, she came to the home run by Rahab Center For Hope, an NGO that works for abused and trafficked women. Rama Devi began a new life here. In the five years of her stay, Rama Devi slowly opened up in the family like environment. “She would keep herself busy reading and writing. On Independence Day, she would write such wonderful speeches. There was tremendous improvement in her condition,” says Eunice Stephen, founder, Rahab. But the pangs of separation from her child often resurfaced when she was alone. Unable to recollect his name or any other detail that could lead her to the child, she kept her pain to herself. And one day, in the month of June, a miracle happened. In a flashback of memories, Rama Devi was reminded of her little boy’s name - Mitrajit. Longing to meet the son that she had left back home when he was only seven, Rama Devi requested Eunice to help her find Mitrajit. But no record of her husband or his family was available and Eunice didn’t know where to begin. Her efforts to get some information from Rama Devi’s brother in America yielded nothing. Rama Devi’s husband had relocated from Kolkata and no one seemed to have his address. When the shelters where Rama Devi had lived in the past could not help with any information, Eunice and her team decided to look up social media in the hope that they might get some clue about her son. As they typed Mitrajit Chowdhary , they came across several profiles on Facebook. They had absolutely no idea which one of them could be Rama Devi’s son. So messages were sent out to each person. And one of them indeed happened to be Rama Devi’s son Mitrajit! A message flashed on Mitrajit’s phone screen that said, “Hello, do you have a relative called Rama Devi Chowdhary? We have some information about her.” “I stared at the screen for the initial few seconds… it was finally happening…my mother had finally reached out, as I always believed she would one day. Without wasting time, I typed yes,” says Mitrajit When Mitrajit spoke to his mother for the very first time, he was very nervous. “I was shaking. I went blank for a while. She took my name… said Mitrajit, this is mom speaking. It was a lot to sink in,” he says. Mitrajit made a video call the next day. “I could not recognise her... She had all grey hair..she looked so different from the picture that I had of her taken at a family wedding. I kept looking at her, trying to absorb that she was finally right there in front of me. After that, we started talking regularly,” says Mitrajit. Soon after, Mitrajit started planning his trip to Delhi. On 25 November, the two finally met. It took a while for Rama to recognise her son who is now a 22-year-old confident young man working for as an HR executive for a firm in Visakhapatnam. “As I had a closer look, I saw the same childhood face…the only difference is that a beard covers it now,” she says. Mitrajit says he sort of knew that this is how it was going to end. “I was a kid when she left… it was a lot to deal with. All my dad had been able to tell me was that she had gone for her career and that she might return one day. I had no idea what happened to my mother. There was no source to trace her. I would sit by the beach and think about her..about not having a complete family...but something in me always told me that this will change…she will return one day.” Mitrajit is glad that he made a Facebook profile that finally led him to his mother. “Thank god I didn’t use any nickname unlike many friends. It would have been tricky to find me otherwise,” says the boy who used to google up his mother’s name every time he used a computer in the hope to find her whereabouts. Rama Devi and her son are now on their way to Visakhapatnam where she will meet her estranged husband after 15 years. The son can’t be happier that his parents are going to be united once again. “Mitrajit’s father never married, time has healed all differences and it’s such a touching reunion…I wish we are able to unite more such families that are torn apart due to circumstances. We have successfully traced several estranged individuals in the past as well ,” says Eunice who had made it a mission to trace Mitrajit for Rama. Before leaving for Visakhapatnam, the mother-son went to visit Birla temple and enjoyed eating out in the city. She is already acting like a typical mum, stuffing me with food all the time,” says a beaming Mitrajit. Love does find its way through the gloomiest of allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-lucky-mom-found-her-son-after-15-years-as-she-recovered-lost-memories/story-OcIY2h6sQgFFFaoiC5ufcK.html
30-11-2020||Editorials||Donald Trump’s last push in West Asia | HT Editorial||President Donald Trump has given up on foreign policy except in West Asia. His administration is presumed to have had a role in the assassination of Iran’s top nuclear scientist last week. His son-in-law has flown to the Persian Gulf for one last diplomatic roundabout. Mr Trump’s team is tying up the loose ends of what it sees as its great foreign policy moment — getting a slew of Gulf Arab nations to recognise Israel and concretise an anti-Iran coalition.West Asia’s deepest geopolitical fault-line no longer runs between Israelis and Arabs but between Shia Persians and Sunni Arabs. It was the Gulf monarchies which applauded Mr Trump ending the Iran nuclear agreement, initiated the Israel outreach and are now working to ensure all this will be fait accompli for President-elect Joe Biden. Mr Biden’s foreign policy supports the Arab-Israeli rapprochement. But it may be frosty towards Saudi Arabia and includes plans to resurrect the Iran nuclear agreement. The last won’t be easy. Iran has 12 times more low-enriched uranium than the original agreement allowed while Washington has zero diplomatic credibility.The stakes are high. The Arab Street has no love for Israel. Iran’s informal empire remains intact but broke. Outsiders must tread this minefield carefully. India has even more reason to avoid a regional role and continue to maintain a set of bilateral relationships. Pakistan is struggling. The United Arab Emirates banned visas for Pakistan and others who opposed normalisation of ties with Israel. As West Asian politics becomes ever more cut-throat, Islamabad may have to choose between ideological sanctity and economic stability. Either way will be to New Delhi’s advantage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/donald-trump-s-last-push-in-west-asia-ht-editorial/story-JjeyZwYA5TH837OHn7NEbL.html
30-11-2020||Editorials||Find a meeting point on farm laws | HT Editorial||The farmer protests, primarily led by land-owning agriculturists of Punjab, have raised a range of questions — about India’s larger political economy, relations between Centre and states and between states, the salience of identity politics in Punjab, especially given its troubled history of the 1980s, and the capacity of the Indian State to allow dissent and be politically accommodative. But at the root of it is the question of finding a meeting point between what is a reality and the apprehensions generated by that reality.The reality is that Parliament has passed laws which will change the manner in which agricultural produce is procured and traded. As this newspaper has argued, there is sound rationale for the move — agricultural markets needed to be liberalised, there is a greater need for interface between industry and farmers, and this will potentially enhance farm incomes. At the same time, the laws have generated apprehensions because of two reasons. The first was the rather abrupt manner in which the change was brought about — the Centre should have invested more in engaging with all stakeholders. And the second is the fear of the mandi and minimum support price (MSP) regime getting undermined.Farmers will have to recognise that the reality of the laws will not change. They also need to understand that extremist rhetoric and action — including flirting with extreme identity-issues when the demand is largely economic — is wrong, unacceptable, and undermines their own cause. At the same time, the government must recognise the depth of the sentiment of farmers, reach out sensitively, and find a mechanism to assure farmers that their incomes will be protected, including through an amendment if necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/find-a-meeting-point-on-farm-laws-ht-editorial/story-5PM9ahtduxKvWfg8TFJJyN.html
30-11-2020||Editorials||Is the economy turning? | HT Editorial||The Indian economy did better than most economists expected in the second quarter (July-September) of the current fiscal year. A GDP contraction of 7.5%, after a massive 23.9% in the June quarter, is, by all means, a significant sequential improvement. It shows that the June quarter number was a reflection of the 68-day lockdown rather than any massive damage to the productive capacity of the economy.To be sure, the latest GDP numbers are not surprising. Many high frequency indicators had signalled improvement. But the pandemic-induced challenge is far from over. Some economists have pointed out that the second quarter had the fortunate confluence of pent-up demand (due to the lockdown) and advance production for the festive season. These tailwinds might dissipate going forward. There is also the question of the slowly but steadily building demand squeeze due to a continuing weakness in labour markets and cost cutting by firms. An HT analysis of 2,400 companies shows that their profits went up in the September quarter despite sales going down. This has been achieved via a cut in costs including salaries. The most worrying part of the GDP numbers, however, is the pro-cyclical turn in government spending. There has been a deterioration on this front compared to the first quarter. While the Centre has announced many schemes to cushion the pandemic’s impact, a fall in government spending shows that the actual fiscal support has not been commensurate. This needs to change.There is also a big-picture message in the latest GDP numbers. India’s economic challenge in a post-Covid world is not going to be a restoration of positive growth rates. That is more a question of when (December or March quarter) rather than if. The real question is whether the economy can regain a high growth trajectory which gave way to a long deceleration phase even before the pandemic struck. This will require a vision and strategy for growth and ensuring that there is no permanent damage from the disruption. The government has unleashed critical second generation reforms, which could unleash hitherto unexploited growth possibilities. However, these possibilities will only materialise if there is a strong domestic demand. That should be the priority now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/is-the-economy-turning-ht-editorial/story-bqHOxxQ1ImJ1PlohM97yyM.html
