15-11-2020||News||Delhi can’t fight pollution with the current institutional apparatus||Delhi is one of the world’s most polluted cities. You would expect this to be regulated and reversed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). The problem is that DPCC can’t do so because its team of environmental engineers and scientists are hugely overworked and the organisation is collapsing due to decades of poor management. This is not unique to Delhi — many state pollution control boards (SPCBs) face a similar crisis.Look at DPCC’s recruitment. Several positions were created in 1998, but environmental engineers, crucial to its working, could not be hired and confirmed because it took 16 years to frame the recruitment rules. So, Delhi lost an opportunity to nip air pollution in the bud in the late 1990s, when it was already a problem. Today, there is provision for 48 junior environmental engineers, but none have been recruited. There’s just no sense of urgency. Nobody has the time either. Delhi’s environment secretary is also the chairperson of DPCC. That makes sense, except often, the environment secretary holds multiple charges. Two past secretaries simultaneously headed the Delhi Jal Board, a full-time job in itself. Some have had to deal with conflict of interest, with dual charge as health secretary. The board of DPCC has discussed fining government hospitals for violation of the biomedical waste rules, but the secretary found it hard to let one avatar of himself penalise another avatar. Most often, the DPCC chairperson lacks the time to focus on full-time duties. A robust organisation might perform with an able deputy — the member secretary (MS), in this case. Unfortunately, MSs at DPCC are frequently posted out. They need to have a three to five year tenure in order to hold the organisation accountable.Even with these changes, core institutional reforms remain non-negotiable. The legal cell is manned by a tiny team without technical expertise; so, environmental engineers and scientists also work on hundreds of Public Interest Litigations (PILs) filed against DPCC. This takes them away from their core work, the negligence of which causes the PIL to be filed in the first place. If the terms of work are brutal, so are working conditions. Many joined in 1993 or so. They have been promoted only twice in about 27 years of service. If they are lucky, they will get one more promotion. In the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), a 1993 batch officer would have got between four to five promotions by now. Surely, with so many positions now available, existing high-performing candidates can be promoted and new ones recruited. During these hyper-polluted days, not only do officials work during the day, but the same individuals also go for night inspections. By 2025, many of these officials will have retired.DPCC cadres have much to be demotivated about. Due to negligence, even those who could have been given a pension (those who joined before 2004), won’t be getting one. This isn’t hard to set right, as a few pollution control boards of some other states have shown. Delhi’s pollution engineers and scientists don’t even have medical facilities on par with the Central Government Health Scheme. The Delhi Government Health Scheme should be made available to them.Delhi — and India — cannot fight pollution without technical and scientific personnel. Like most SPCBs, DPCC has also been hit by multi-decade mismanagement. It’s location in a city most notorious for its pollution should be a reason to accelerate urgent change. The Delhi government should not look at the lost decades. Reform doesn’t need funds — DPCC is a self-financing body. Within this financial year, it can complete the recruitment of the pending 48 junior environmental engineers, formalise seniorities, institutionalise health care and enhance the legal cell. For clean air, we must reinvigorate the Capital’s and the country’s pollution control apparatus. There are no short-cuts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/delhi-can-t-fight-pollution-with-the-current-institutional-apparatus/story-FGFYHsPLPH4uVeWmVCW89L.html
15-11-2020||News||Under Biden, the future of US-India ties||The past fortnight was turbulent for both the United States (US) and the world. The long drawn out US elections finally resulted in Joe Biden being declared President-elect. The Biden-Kamala Harris administration will be sworn in on January 20. What impact will a President Biden have on the US-India relationship? To understand this, we also need to understand how the US views India.For the US, the Indo-US relationship is an extremely consequential one — India is essential to the US’s hopes of counterbalancing China. Thus, perhaps unsurprisingly, security cooperation has become the cornerstone of any Indo-US strategic partnership. The George W Bush administration first began the US commitment to co-opting India as a “natural ally”, a commitment that resulted in the landmark civil nuclear deal. Since then, while there had been progress, it had also not been as rapid or deep as the US would perhaps have liked. However, in the past four years under the Donald Trump administration, Indo-US security cooperation moved at breakneck speed. In 2016, the US designated India as a Major Defence Partner, which led to, among other things, India being able to receive access to a wide range of military and dual-use American technologies. Over the space of three years, three defence agreements were reached and signed. In 2018, the two countries began the 2+2 strategic dialogue, one of the highest level dialogues ever institutionalised. In 2019, the US and India conducted Tiger Triumph, the first ever tri-service (ground, naval, and air forces) exercises between them. And this year, Australia joined India, Japan, and the US in conducting the India-led Malabar naval exercises, giving a big impetus to the Quad. In the US view, while it had always been ready to engage in this level of cooperation, it was the border clashes with China that made India more willing to engage deeply with the US. Yet, despite both the US and India being on the same page in terms of the looming threat from China, there are obstacles that have remained. The US believes that India, which is still 60% to 70% dependent on Russia for military resupplies and hardware, will, in the future, have to choose — what kind of warfare will India align itself with? It can no longer choose from an à la carte military menu; rather it has to, as a former senior official in the state department said in a conversation, choose a system. But “the real Achilles’ heel” is, as this same official pointed out, economics and the continuing harping on strategic autonomy. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s use of power, especially in the second term, to promote a nationalistic agenda is viewed as a lost opportunity which has not brought the expected economic growth. At the same time, while very high-level Indian government officials favour a close relationship, more mid-level bureaucrats often raise resistance to the relationship citing the importance of autonomy. And since India has a very small bureaucracy to deal with a very wide range of bilateral issues, negotiations can be like “throwing spaghetti on a wall” — “brilliant” Indian officials don’t have the time and the bodies to staff the relationship. Finally, the Modi government’s domestic policies have hurt the US’s ability to talk about mutual values — less of a concern perhaps with President Trump than a President Biden. While some have suggested that President Biden would be more committed to human rights which could lead to a rift with India, on, for example Kashmir, in fact any US concerns, American officials believe, are more likely to be conveyed privately rather than publicly.Despite these obstacles, a Biden administration will not particularly change the relationship. And, in many ways, it may even come out stronger. President Biden will probably restore the US national security decision structure that was gutted by the Trump administration — for instance, traditionally there were regular inter-agency meetings, National Security Council meetings — and a process by which bureaucracy recommendations and decisions made its way up to the President’s office. This structure existed under both Republican and Democrat administrations. But under President Trump, decision-making was more ad hoc, not to mention, at times, chaotic. And the dismantling of this structure combined with his deep suspicion of bureaucracy led to the exodus of many experienced US officials. With respect to South Asia, there was no assistant secretary of state for south and central affairs ever appointed (his nomination of Robert Williams fell through, and Alice Wells remained the Acting Assistant Secretary), Kenneth Juster, the ambassador to India, was not appointed until nearly the end of 2017, and Pakistan, even today, does not have a US ambassador in the country (the chargé d’affairs Angela Aggeler is the acting ambassador). President Biden and whoever he chooses as Secretary of State would probably rebuild this structure. And while it is undeniable that Trump and Modi had a bond, both Biden and Modi are likely to be extremely pragmatic about a relationship which is “really about the geopolitical compulsions. And everything else,” said the US official with a smile, “is just gravy.”Manjari Chatterjee Miller is associate professor of international relations, Frederick S Pardee School of Global Studies, Boston University, and a research associate at the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies, University of Oxford The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-china-is-bringing-together-india-and-the-us/story-JgsUBsHa9xdo8TPcBLgTxO.html
15-11-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Can Panjab University function without a senate?||A crisis seems to be brewing at Panjab University, with the senate polls postponed twice after being scheduled for August 24 and October 15. This is a matter of concern as the university has now been without its supreme governing body since the four year term of the last senate ended on October 31 . Further delays can make things worse as the term of the university’s top executive body, the syndicate, ends on December 31. Many former senators have demanded early elections, alleging that postponing the polls is a covert ploy to install a board of governors under the National Education Policy (NEP) comprising only nominated numbers, which they say will “lead to complete alienation of stakeholders from the decision-making processes of the university.” In a year when the Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc around the world, hitting education systems especially hard, PU authorities will find it tough taking key decisions on restarting classes and hostels and planning for the next academic year without a senate. In the recent past, decisions on declaring results, announcing the first ever blended (online/offline) examinations, and the new calendar were taken without any House meeting. Also, as a stakeholder, the Punjab government has yet to adopt NEP and its consent is required if any board is to be set up, the former senators say. Worried about the developments, Punjab chief minister (CM) Captain Amarinder Singh has recently written to vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the PU chancellor, seeking early elections to the senate. The CM has said that the delay in polling is causing resentment among various constituents of the institution and urged Naidu to advise PU authorities and the Chandigarh administration to conduct it on time. “There is a substantial resentment among the teachers, professionals, technical members, graduates of the university and representatives of constituencies for the senate elections. Besides, there are legislators from the Punjab assembly and ex-officio members, such as the chief minister, education minister, and DPI (colleges) of the state, who represent the Government of Punjab,” Capt Amarinder Singh is learnt to have written. There is no reason now to put off the polls because of Covid-19 as the situation had improved and elections to Parliament, assemblies, and urban and rural local bodies had been held across the nation, the CM’s letter states. Various issues are pending before the university, and any delay in setting up a governing body can affect the working and hurt the interests of the students.

Garg said the fire department received 57 such calls. “Initially, three or four motorcyclists skid due to slippery roads in the immediate aftermath of the drizzle. They called the fire department, and at the same time rumour spread that there was an ‘oil rain’,” Garg said. Soon, the fire department was inundated with such calls. “But it turned out that the sudden rain mixed with the mud on the roads. It also brought down with it the dust in the air. All these together caused the road to turn a little slippery, giving rise to the belief that it was oil rain,” said Garg. The officer said the calls were received from across Delhi and not from any particular area. There were no immediate reports of any injuries due to the slippery roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/slippery-roads-after-drizzle-makes-motorists-call-fire-department-about-oil-rain/story-E27h0UltKEgvB3WYYNifxK.html

Environmentalists say this pointed to gaps in enforcement and that the authorities needed to focus on controlling the manufacture of crackers rather than going for only those selling and burning crackers.“So far we have recovered firecrackers and explosives worth more than Rs 8 lakh in the past one week and we will continue with the vigilance till the ban is in place,” said a police spokesperson.Knowledge Park police had the biggest haul. On Diwali two men, identified as Vijay Saini and Kashif, were nabbed with 39 sacks of firecrackers worth nearly ₹4 lakh. On Sunday, two men were nabbed with firecrackers worth ₹1 lakh by the Phase 3 police.Diwali night saw NGT rules being flouted across the district with the air quality index in the district going in to the “severe” category. However, only five people in the district were booked.“Our teams were constantly patrolling across the area and anyone we came across trying to burn crackers was given a strict warnings. Three persons from the Surajpur Kasba area were booked under section 151 of the CrPC for not adhering to the warnings and continuing to break laws,” said Pradeep Kumar Tripathi, station house officer, Surajpur police station.Two more people were challaned by the Bisrakh police for similar violations.Police personnel in Gautam Budh Nagar carried out awareness drives all through Diwali night to keep people from bursting crackers. “We identified spots where crackers were being burst and we spoke to people urging them to refrain from doing this. We gave warnings to them and we will continue with the vigilance for the upcoming festivals also. The ban is in effect till November 30 and the enforcement will also be in place for it,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1. He also said that people in the city stopped once warnings were issued to them. “But we have identified potential troublemakers and will keep an eye out on them in the next few days and take any necessary legal action,” said Singh.“The vigilance of authorities did not help as we know that crackers were burst openly all throughout the district. While creating awareness is crucial, we also need to focus on the industry itself. The manufacturing needs to be controlled while in turn will help control the distribution, sale and purchase. That is what police and Administration should focus on going forward,” said Vikrant Tongad, an environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/12-people-arrested-for-selling-crackers-in-noida-environmentalists-want-authorities-to-target-manufacturing/story-O2nepRnNP3qpTJ7ORNxr3H.html

Officials of the municipal corporation said that apart from initiating a cleaning drive, they are also expecting that Ganga water to the river will be released before the start of Chhath festivities.Annually, thousands of devotees come to offer prayers on the banks of river Hindon but this year, the administration is contemplating restricting the numbers of people who would be allowed to attend the festivities due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.“This year the festivities will be restricted due to the pandemic, and we are trying that only one person per family would be allowed. For this, we have held meetings with the Purabiya Jan Kalyan Parishad and asked them to restrict the size of the gathering,” said Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city). “We have also spoken to the irrigation department officials as well and have asked them to arrange for water to be released into the river before the festival. It is likely that Ganga water will be released into the river before November 20,” he added. The flow to the river gets affected before Diwali due to the annual maintenance of the Upper Ganga Canal system. Till the time the canal is shut for cleaning, water is stopped to the river.“The corporation has started the cleaning drive and we are also telling our members to restrict the number of people who come to the river banks. There are no directions as yet, specifically, for the Chhath puja. So, people who are coming over for the puja will arrive as they please. However, there should be no last minute issuance of directions. In such a case, we will not be able to restrict the number of visitors or tell them to curtail rituals,” said Rakesh Tiwari, Purabiya Jan Kalyan Parishad. He added that the association members have also asked officials to expedite the release of water to the river.The corporation officials said that they have initiated a cleanliness drive and deployed several teams to ensure that the banks are cleaned before the festival. “Our teams are deployed and they will ensure that people are restricted from throwing any puja material leftover from Diwali into the river. It is likely that the water will reach before the festival,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/cleaning-of-river-hindon-banks-starts-ahead-of-chhath-puja/story-jFzxCYR8WIZzsQqhcqojaI.html
15-11-2020||Noida||Despite ban on crackers, Diwali in Noida and Ghaziabad more polluted this year||Despite the complete ban firecrackers, there was no respite from pollution in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad this year as well. In fact, on Sunday, the day after Diwali, the three cities’ air quality fell to the “severe” category when even healthy people would suffer respiratory distress.This year, on the day from Diwali, the pollution monitoring stations reported much higher levels of coarse particles (PM10, those with size less than 10 microns) and ultrafine particles (PM2.5) than last. These particles are known to cause several diseases with PM2.5 being able to cross the blood-brain barrier and infiltrate organs.Residents of the three cities said that people openly flouted the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT’s) order banning all forms of firecrackers till November 30. While the Uttar Pradesh government directed all agencies to enforce the order, there seemed to have been limited impact on the ground.“On Saturday evening (Diwali), it seemed that there will be no firecrackers burning this year and maybe there would be some respite from the pollution. But after 7-8pm that hope soon fizzled out and cracker bursting went past midnight,” said Ruchin Mehra, a resident of Raj Nagar Extension. “There seemed to have been some measure of control,” said Akash Vashishtha, a Ghaziabad-based environmentalist. “Compared to last year, it was probably cut by three-fourth. However, it has raised concerns that there were gaps in enforcement due to which crackers eventually made their way into the hands of residents. It is unlikely that crackers were stored since last year and burst this year. In all likelihood it is possible that sales were done from behind the shutters.”The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that the average PM2.5 level ranged from 205 to 297 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) at the four monitoring stations in Ghaziabad during the 24 hours period of Diwali day in 2019. During the same period this year on November 14, the Diwali day, average PM2.5 was higher in range of 310.53 to 416.53µg/m³. Likewise, during the same period in 2019, the average PM10 stood in range of 331.82 to 487.84 µg/m³ but this Diwali it was much higher in range of 490.93 to 636.41 µg/m³. On Sunday, Ghaziabad was the second most polluted city in the country.The standard limit for PM2.5 is 60µg/m³ while that for PM10 is 100 µg/m³. In Noida too, the four monitoring stations recorded average PM2.5 in range of 182.22 to 206.82µg/m³ last year while this year the range was 267.3 to 391.12µg/m³. Likewise, the average PM10 levels were also high in range of 370.73 to 587.68µg/m³ this year while it stood in range of 301.89 to 376.16 last year. In Greater Noida, the scenario was no different. The average PM2.5 levels last year on Diwali ranged from 148.7 to 175.09 µg/m³, while these were 254.62 to 279.39µg/m³ this year. Likewise, the average PM10 levels were 264.18 to 348.72µg/m³ last year during the same period while it ranged from 405.75 to 525.59µg/m³ this year. “The pollution levels were primarily high due to unfavourable meteorological conditions and increased instances of stubble-burning which led to contribution of 32%. Crackers were burnt, but much lower after ban by NGT,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UP pollution control board. Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate, did not respond to calls and messages. “There was enforcement taken up and the violations were very less besides we also carried out awareness drives. It has also come to light that people brought crackers from outside the NCR,” said Shailendra Singh, additional district magistrate (city), Ghaziabad. SSP Kalanidhi Naithani did not respond to calls but police spokesperson responded with figures that stated that 40 calls were received on Dial-112 response system related to use and sale of crackers on Diwali and a day before Diwali. “In this connection, 27 cases were registered and action was taken against 30 persons. Another two-dozen people were arrested for creating ruckus and bursting crackers under section 151 of CrPC (prevention against commission of cognisable offence) and notices were served to another 100 persons,” the response by the police spokesperson stated. Police personnel in Gautam Budh Nagar said that they carried out awareness drives all through Diwali night to keep people away from bursting crackers. “We identified spots where crackers were being burst and we spoke to people urging them to refrain from doing so. We gave warnings to them and we will continue with the vigilance for the upcoming festivals also. The ban is in effect till November 30 and the enforcement will also be in place for it,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1. Five people in the district were booked for firecracker violations, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/despite-ban-on-crackers-diwali-in-noida-and-ghaziabad-more-polluted-this-year/story-r5ZUe9A0hsMfrl3oHQ1fdK.html
15-11-2020||Noida||Yamuna Expressway authority decides to launch new schemes only after acquiring land||GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) will not chalk out new plot schemes without having the requisite land ready for the same, unlike earlier when schemes were launched before the land was acquired. The move comes as the authority realised that schemes launched without ready land troubles property buyers in the long run.The authority, in 2008-09, had launched a residential plot scheme in sectors 18 and 20 along the 165km Yamuna Expressway, which connects Greater Noida and Agra. The authority had assured plot buyers to give possession of the plots in 2011-12. But the authority is still to give possession to at least 7,000 plot buyers. The Yeida took more than 10 years to ready this land to be given to plot buyers, who wanted to build houses, due to the land dispute. Farmers dragged the Yeida to the Allahabad High Court, delaying the residential scheme, which was the biggest plot scheme by the industrial body. The Yeida had launched another industrial plot scheme in 2013 and promised possession at theearliest. It had allotted 816 plots in Sector 32 located along the expressway, at a rate of Rs 5,500 per square metre. The authority had allowed, as per the scheme, to pay up half yearly installments for the plot cost, and charged 12% interest on the plot cost. But the authority is yet to ready the land and give possession. As a result, it has decided to first ready the land and then launch schemes, in the future.“We will launch schemes, be it for residential purposes or other usages, only once we have the land readily available with us. The reason is that the interest of our allottees is a priority for us. We want that investors or individual allottees can get possession of their allotted plot on time. Earlier, we launched schemes with planning to acquire the land. But now it is clear that we must launch a scheme only after readying the land for the same,” said Shailendra Bhati, officer on special duty of the Yeida.The authority is buying the land from landowners via direct purchase. In direct purchase, willing farmers can come forward and sell their land directly to the authority.“In this process, there is no scope for dispute because if a land owner is willing then he can sell his or her land,” said Bhatia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/yamuna-expressway-authority-decides-to-launch-new-schemes-only-after-acquiring-land/story-CQNLAikaXHWN91Aseqp98O.html

15-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Sewage network laid out in ten sectors to ensure only treated water is dumped into rivers||NOIDA: The Noida authority on Sunday said that it has connected the master sewer pipeline with a sewage treatment plant to trap waste water from sectors 74, 75, 76, 77, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, Hosiery complex and Phase 2, with an aim to make sure that only treated water flows in to Hindon River.The move will help in making sure that sewage is not dumped into the river without treatment, said officials. The National Green Tribunal, through various orders, had directed the Noida authority that only treated sewer water should be dumped into drains, which further empties into two rivers – Hindon and Yamuna, which flow along the city. Even the Noida Master Plan 2021 had mandated trapping of sewage from all areas and treatment of the same at the sewage treatment plants (STP), and before it was dumped in drains.“Our water department has connected the sewer network from many areas, that include sectors 74, 75, 76 and 80, among others, with an STP for sewage treatment, as per Master Plan 2021,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.These sectors 74, 75, 76 and others are home to several newly-built group housing societies. The sewage from these societies was being dumped into drains without any treatment, thereby causing pollution.Earlier, the authority was unable to tap the sewer as it could not connect a 1,200 metre-long stretch of the master sewer line in Sector 74 due to a land dispute. Due to non-availability of land, the authority could not build a sewer connection line and the master sewer line remained out of reach, said officials.“However, now the authority has connected the 1,200 metre-long stretch as it resolved the land dispute seven months ago. In the last seven months, the authority has completed the master sewer line work. We have started tapping 30 million litres daily (MLD) sewer water from these areas to the Sector 123 STP for treatment. Now we will no longer dump the waste water directly into drains,” said a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to the media. The authority has installed a sewer pumping station at Sector 117 (located between Sector 74 and the Sector 123 STP) to channelise sewage from these areas to the STP in Sector 123.Residents, meanwhile, said they have been demanding a master sewer line connection for a long time.“As the sewer line was not connected properly, sewage from our societies was being dumped into vacant plots and open drains. We hope it will change now. Still, the authority needs to clean the sewer line to make sure sewage is not dumped into open,” said Amit Gupta, president of Prateek Wisteria Society apartment owners’ association (AOA) in Sector 77.The 1200 metre sewer line has been laid six metres below ground to ensure all areas remain clean, officials said.“It is important that while building a sustainable township, we need to have a sustainable process of clearing household sewage waste. The 7x sectors cluster is one of the largest high-rise clusters of Noida. This will be a big relief to high-rise society dwellers. IT is indeed a welcome step and we look forward to the implementation of such infrastructure all across the district. This will also help Noida achieve a better Swatchh Bharat ranking in the future,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of AOA, an umbrella body of AOAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-sewage-network-laid-out-in-ten-sectors-to-ensure-only-treated-water-is-dumped-into-rivers/story-WAaAS5iTn5QNJ6oHYMrlfI.html
15-11-2020||Noida||Over 50% patients who died due to Covid-19 in Gautam Budh Nagar were diabetic, say officials||NOIDA: Among the comorbidity factors in Covid-19 deaths reported in Gautam Budh Nagar district, diabetes has emerged as the main comorbid condition behind such fatalities. Health officials said that more than 50% of the total infected persons who died due to the virus in the district were also suffering diabetes. According to the officials, out of 73 patients who died due to coronavirus in the district till November 14, 38 of them had diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder in which blood sugar levels are very high. District chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that it has been found that diabetes increases the risk of death among patients infected with Covid-19. “Out of 73 Covid-19 infected patients, who succumbed to the virus, 38 were diagnosed with diabetes. Diabetic patients, both during treatment and post recovery, are at high risk of developing complications and there is need for strict monitoring and follow-ups,” Ohri said.“Patients with diabetes, hypertension or any other comorbid condition must always take even minor Covid-19 symptoms seriously and immediately go to a Covid-dedicated facility instead of waiting for symptoms to be more serious,” the CMO said. On Saturday, GB Nagar reported 191 new cases, taking the tally to 20,154 in the district. The district also reported one death due to Covid-19 on Saturday, as per the state control room figures.Ohri further said that as early identification is very important in this situation, the district health department has asked all the Covid-dedicated facilities to keep a close tab on the blood sugar level of all the Covid-19 infected patients having diabetes. Dr AK Shukla, senior consultant physician of Kailash Hospital in Noida, said that there is enough evidence proving that the Sars-CoV-2 virus can attack the beta cells of pancreas, responsible for producing insulin. “In case of a diabetic patient, the blood glucose levels become highly erratic, especially when Covid-19 becomes acute. After the Covid-19 infection, they become more insulin-dependant and require higher doses. In some Covid-19 patients without diabetes previously, it has been found they can become diabetogenic. If the oxygen saturation level dips, the diabetic patients can also develop ketoacidosis, where the body produces excess blood acids (ketones),” he said. Echoing similar views, Dr Ajay Agarwal, director of internal medicine at Fortis Hospital in Noida’s Sector 62, said that it has been seen worldwide that complication and mortality for Covid-19 in diabetic patients is more as compared to non-diabetics. “So, it is very important for people with diabetes to control their blood sugar levels and take their medicines regularly. It is advisable for everyone above 40 years, who may or may not have been infected by Covid-19, to go in for a check-up for diabetes particularly if they have a family history of diabetes or are obese or have a sedentary lifestyle,” he said. However, Dr AK Gadpayle of Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida , doesn’t agree that diabetes alone can trigger the Covid-19 infection to death. “Diabetes can become a killer if it damages the other organs like kidney and heart. Abnormal blood sugar level invites many fatal diseases to attack the organs of our body. So, unless the other co-morbidities develop, diabetes alone can’t shoot up the Covid-19 viral infection to go to an incorrigible stage,” said Gadpayle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/over-50-patients-who-died-due-to-covid-19-in-gautam-budh-nagar-were-diabetic-say-officials/story-Y5uAy85oaQWBc8PgtUBWqI.html

Kashyap said many players went abroad to train at a high altitude while the same training could be provided in Himachal.The governor honoured Nehwal and Kashyap with a Himachali cap and shawl and presented them with a picture of the Raj Bhawan as a memento. He said, “The youth of the state are very talented but do not get a good platform due to lack of facilities.

15-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashra looks to bring down Covid-19 case fatality rate||Concerned over Maharashtra’s constant case fatality rate (CFR), which remains at 2.63% despite a dip in the number of cases daily, the directorate of health services has ordered formation of a death audit committee at every hospital in the state. Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 2,544 cases, lowest in five months since June 16, taking the case count to 1,742,242. It was the 29th consecutive day when daily cases recorded were below 10,000. The active cases reduced slightly, reaching 84,918. From November 9 to 15, the state has been seeing less than 5,000 cases. The average number of cases per day has declined to 4,433 from 12,088 cases in the corresponding period last month, according to the state health department. The state’s toll reached 45,974, with 60 casualties. Of the total deaths, 35 are from the past 48 hours and three are from last week. The rest are from the period before last week, health officials said. The death audit committee will carry out detailed factual analysis of every death due to Covid-19. It has to give its observation considering age, gender, co-morbidity and treatment period of the deceased. The committee will have to suggest changes, recommendations for field survey and training required for doctors and health workers, if needed, stated the order issued by the director, health services, Dr Archana Patil.

Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state and public health expert, said, “We want to ascertain where we are lacking and make changes accordingly. People have not followed the advice to avoid crowding while preparing for festivals and since social distancing wasn’t practised, we may have to face the consequences. For this, we will have to wait for at least 28 days to see if there is a surge.” Mumbai saw 577 new cases and 15 deaths, taking the tally to 269,710 and toll to 10,573. Pune registered the second highest number of cases, 299, and 7 deaths, followed by Ahmednagar which saw 163 cases and two deaths.

Medicos alleged that despite complaints, the hospital authority has not taken adequate steps to provide security. In November alone, three incidents of theft have been reported at the hostels of resident doctors. The first incident was on November 2 when a mobile got stolen from room number 26 at Annexe hostel, followed by two more incidents on November 11 and 12 at room numbers 30 and 321 of Annexe hostel and resident medical officer (RMO) hostel, respectively.In all three cases, first information reports (FIRs) were registered at Bhoiwada police station. Vinod Kamble, senior police inspector of Bhoiwada police station didn’t respond.All three cases of theft took place in the absence of the resident doctors who were on Covid-19 duty at the hospital. “After a tireless day at work at Covid-19 wards, we found our electronic items missing when we returned to our hostels. This is extremely frustrating,” said a medical student whose laptop is stolen. “Among the stolen goods two were Macbooks which cost over ₹1 lakh, one iPad and one Dell laptop. These are expensive electronics. We can’t afford to buy those again,” said a resident doctor. Due to the theft, students who had stored their thesis paper on their laptops have lost them which can get them disqualified for the final examination. “It took me two years to collect data to complete my thesis. If I don’t get my laptop back, I may not even qualify to sit for the final examination,” said another resident doctor. “Other than that, we also have important academic related documents,” the student added.Students alleged that despite repeated complaints to the hospital authority, they aren’t paying any heed. “The hospital hasn’t installed CCTV cameras on all floors. Security is extremely weak, so anyone from outside can walk into the hostels without being checked,” said another resident doctor.Dr Arun Ghule, president of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) at KEM Hospital, confirmed the incidents and said they are going to submit a letter to the dean on Tuesday. “This has started happening recently and we have also informed the hospital authority about it. If the doctors don’t get their laptops, then they have to redo their thesis again. We are going to demand for better and stringent security at the hostels,” he said.Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of the hospital said, “Police complaints have been filed. We are looking into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/medical-students-on-covid-19-duty-get-robbed-at-hostels-in-mumbai-s-kem-hospital-lose-thesis-papers/story-SikaDugkeAsmxrXHbfrLcL.html

15-11-2020||Chandigarh||Showers hit Punjab, more likely on Monday||Light rainfall was recorded across Punjab on Sunday under the influence of a fresh western disturbance, according to India Meteorological Department.Even hailstorm was witnessed in parts of Malwa region, including Bathinda, Muktsar, Faridkot, Ferozepur, Barnala, Sangrur and Ludhiana districts.According to data available till 5:30pm, 13mm rain was recorded in Amritsar, 1mm in Patiala and just 0.6mm in Ludhiana. More rain can be expected on Monday, following which dry weather is likely to return.“The rain was the result of a feeble western disturbance. There had been no western disturbance in the region after monsoon ended. Rain will continue on Monday, but the intensity will be lower than that on Sunday,” said IMD regional director Surender Paul.Farmers fear crop damage“Weather is still cloudy and even mild rainfall can cause damage to the freshly sown wheat crop,” said Ranjinder Singh, a farmer from Chaina village in Faridkot.Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar, plant protection officer, Moga, said rain may pose a challenge to farmers still resorting to stubble burning, but those who used crop residue management machines will benefit. “Crop residue ploughed back into the field will work as a cover and keep the field moist and benefit germination process. However, wheat sown in the last five days on fields where paddy straw was burnt is likely to get damaged as mild rainfall will harden the surface and affect germination,” he said.Be cautious of Covid, say expertsIn Amritsar, showers brought minimum temperature down to 13°C in the afternoon. With mercury taking a plunge, health experts have asked people to be more cautious to prevent a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases. “The survival rate of coronavirus on substances will increase in lower temperatures, increasing the chances of people getting infected,” said Dr Naveen Pandhi of the chest and TB department at Government Medical College and Hospital, Amritsar.“The drop in mercury can lead to more cases of cough, cold and chest infections, which can lead to further complications among Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Anita Chauhan, epidemiologist, Faridkot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/showers-hit-punjab-more-likely-on-monday/story-ZuU43YdpNWxHgdntI7aSZI.html

15-11-2020||Gurugram||Shiv Raj Puri held for duping people at golf course in Gurugram||Gurugram Police on Friday arrested Shiv Raj Puri, the 40-year-old alleged mastermind behind a major banking fraud in 2010, from Dehradun for allegedly duping people of nearly ₹2 crore at a golf course in Sector 80. He was declared a proclaimed offender in two cases and was carrying a reward of ₹50,000 on his arrest. According to the police, Puri had shifted to Dehradun in March before the lockdown was imposed and had rented an apartment in Engineers Colony on a forged identity. He was paying a rent of ₹15,000 and had told landlord that he used to invest in stock exchange and had plans to offer tuitions classes. He had introduced himself under a fake name, Shiv Sareen, said the police. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Puri was working as a golf trainer at Karma Lakeland on Delhi-Jaipur Expressway in Sector 80 and had duped several people of nearly ₹2 crore before fleeing the place. “During investigation, it was revealed that the suspect booked for fraud was a history-sheeter and was identified as Shiv Raj Puri. He had forged identity documents to take up the job and was training people in golf under the name of Dr. Shiv Ahluwalia,a professional golfer. He is a good golfer and had some tournament certificates to his name as well,” he said. The police said after registering a case under section 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (fraud) of the Indian Penal Code on June 26 at Kherki Daula police station, they started investigating. KK Rao, commissioner of police in October, formed a special investigation team under the leadership of Sangwan and assigned the task for Puri’s arrest to the Sikanderpur crime unit led by inspector Ajay Dhankhar. Rao said they roped in the cyber crime team to track his movement and his call detail records were scanned. He was traced based on human and technical intelligence and surveillance. “The teams had camped in Dehradun for four days before arresting Puri. He was living a luxurious life and was earning nearly ₹2 lakh a month from stock market. He had plans to dupe more people but was arrested,” he said. Ajay Dhankhar, inspector, said that Puri was living in South City-1 prior moving to Dehradun. He was changing locations to evade arrest. He had also changed more than 20 mobile numbers in the last one year, he said. Sangwan said Puri was produced before the court on Saturday and was sent to 14-day judicial custody. “We will take him on production remand in the two cases and will recover the amount duped,” he said. The police added that the enforcement directorate is in process to attaching his properties and court proceedings were underway in Gurugram’s sessions court.During investigation, it was further revealed that Puri used to work as a relationship manager at a private bank in DLF Phase 2 and was involved in ₹400-crore fraud case. He was suspended after the bank lodged a police complaint about suspicious transactions, forgery and criminal activities on December 5, 2010. Puri had duped nearly 30 investors and channelled the money to the stock market. Between December 5, when the police complaint was filed, and December 27, when Puri was arrested, the bank appointed one of the big four audit firms to conduct a forensic audit of all transactions related to wealth management, hired a top law firm for legal counsel, and even made Puri sign agreements with some of the clients, promising to return their money. Sangwan said Puri had worked in the bank for seven years, starting in 2002. In his early 30s, he had started siphoning off money, which increased after 2009. “He used to send fake circulars to the customers purported to have been sent by the capital markets regulator, promising 2-3% returns per month. People fell prey and started investing. Many had also given him blank cheques to invest money,” he said. A case of fraud was registered on December 27, 2010 after the bank complained against him. He was arrested on December 29 and was released on bail by the Punjab and Haryana high court on May 28, 2012, said the police. Later on February 25, 2014, the trial court pronounced Puri guilty under various sections of the IPC and sentenced him to two years and six months in prison and a fine of ₹10,000. In another case, Puri was convicted and sentenced to two years and six months in jail, thereby taking the overall imprisonment to five years. However, since he did not appear for any of the hearings, the police declared him as a proclaimed offender. He was out on bail, when he got a job at Karma Lakeland as a golf trainer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/shiv-raj-puri-held-for-duping-people-at-golf-course-in-gurugram/story-m4y6tgSrEXj8Db4ue504LL.html
15-11-2020||Chandigarh||Higher reaches receive snowfall in Kashmir valley||Light snowfall and widespread rain lashed parts of Kashmir on Sunday breaking the extended dry spell.Authorities have asked people to avoid travelling through the Srinagar-Jammu national highway as there were chances of a blockade due to inclement weather. Kashmir highway SSP traffic JS Johar said, “The highway is functioning as of now. There are overcast conditions in Ramban after light rainfall. We are advising people to avoid undertaking journey on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway (NH 44) till Tuesday when the weather opens up.” The traffic department will allow light vehicles to ply on the national highway if the weather conditions remain good. The department said Mughal Road and the Leh-Kargil roads were blocked due to accumulation of snow. The precipitation in northern and central Kashmir was due to a western disturbance hitting the region on Friday. Some places in the region had witnessed rain on Saturday. The meteorological centre in Srinagar said there was light snowfall in Gulmarg and rainfall in other parts of the Valley. “Gulmarg received 4.5 inches of snow on Sunday and 7 inches on Saturday.

Another wet spell is expected on November 18,” he said.Meteorologist Mohammad Hussain Mir said there was little snowfall this time owing to increase in night temperatures from November 13. “The region received less snowfall as the minimum temperature on the night of November 13 and 14 had increased to 6 °C,” he said.The MeT office said the maximum temperature in Srinagar was 7.7 °C while it had been 2.3 °C on Saturday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/higher-reaches-receive-snowfall-in-kashmir-valley/story-qrMDHzTiDzDs7291FbIKRM.html
15-11-2020||City||Diwali cracker curbs go up in smoke amid poor enforcement in Punjab||Restrictions imposed on bursting firecrackers were violated with impunity in various parts of Punjab, as police failed to ensure strict compliance on Diwali. Even as celebrations went on much beyond the two-hour window (8-10pm) announced by the state government, only a handful of FIRs were registered in various districts. These were registered under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code, but the violators remained unidentified in most cases. Following the National Green Tribunal’s directions to control pollution during festivities in India, chief minister Amarinder Singh had announced a two-hour window for the use of only green firecrackers on Diwali and Gurpurb, except in Mandi Gobindgarh where a blanket ban has been imposed. The CM had also asked director general of police Dinkar Gupta to crack down heavily on violators. Only 5 FIRs in Amritsar, none in Tarn Taran Even as crackers were being burst even on Sunday morning, only five cases were registered against unidentified violators in the Amritsar commissionerate area, while none was registered in Amritsar Rural and Tarn Taran police districts. In the two districts, 14 fire incidents were reported, of which three in Amritsar were major. However, no one was reported to be injured. A limited number of licences for selling green crackers were issued in the two districts, but many vends were reportedly set up illegally in densely populated markets of various towns and cities. “What is the point of issuing the order of a two-hour window, when there is nobody to implement it? People kept bursting firecrackers the whole night without any fear of law, and no cop was there to check it,” said Harikrishan Arora, a social activist in Tarn Taran. Tarn Taran superintendent of police Jagjit Singh Walia said no illegal sale of crackers was found by special teams constituted for the purpose. “We are trying to identify those who burst crackers beyond the two-hour window,” he said. 8 booked in Ludhiana, 14 in Jalandhar In Ludhiana, bursting of crackers went on till 2am, but only eight FIRs were registered against unidentified people. Meanwhile, 17 people suffered burn and eye injuries while busting crackers. The Jalandhar commissionerate registered only 14 FIRs, with one each at 14 police stations under its jurisdiction. On no one being named in the FIRs, police said violators had left the spot by the time teams reached there and efforts are on to identify them. In Mohali, 25 FIRs were registered for flouting cracker regulations, said senior superintendent of police Satinder Singh. Last year, not a single case was registered. Thirteen cases of minor burn injuries were reported at hospitals in the district. Firemen remain on their toes in Malwa regionIn Ludhiana, 33 fire incidents reported on Diwali night, including three major factory fires at Rahon Road, Tibba Road and Sahnewa. Goods and machinery worth lakhs perished, but no casualty was reported. Also, 26 fire distress calls were received in Mohali, but only two turned out to be major. A scrap dealer’s godown at Behlolpur village went up in flames along with 25 used cars and other equipment. Blaze also engulfed a house at Bhabat village in Zirakpur, and it took three hours to bring it under control. Around 2,000 cotton bales that were stacked in the open at an industrial unit were gutted at Abohar in Fazilka district on Diwali night. The fire is suspected to have been caused by a cracker.In Bathinda, a gifts shop godown was gutted at Amrik Singh Road, while in Faridkot, a garment shop at Hukki Chowk was destroyed in fires the same night. In Moga, firecrackers led to a blaze at a scrap godown on Nihal Singh Wala Road at Bagahapurana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/diwali-cracker-curbs-go-up-in-smoke-amid-poor-enforcement-in-punjab/story-bPilMnq7bbtPBeHBe8PQWP.html
15-11-2020||Chandigarh||Diwali pollution levels lowest in Chandigarh since 2017||Chandigarh Pollution levels on Diwali were at their lowest since 2017 with the firecracker ban in place and fears of contracting Covid-19 keeping many people indoors.Debendra Dalai, vice-president of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC), which maintains a record of the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) since 2017, said, “At the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station in Sector 25, the maximum AQI on the day of Diwali remained at 140, even as it had gone up to 341 in 2019 on Diwali.”The firecracker ban, Dalai said, had some success due to people’s cooperation. “We hope the AQI will continue to stay in the moderate bracket now (between 100-200),” he added.According to the data, of all five stations that measure AQI in the city, the highest AQI of 314 (very poor) was recorded at the Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH) in Sector 39. Last year, the AQI was 352 here. Such conditions can lead to respiratory illnesses on prolonged exposure.The prominent pollutant at all the monitoring stations was PM2.5, which can get directly absorbed into the bloodstream and cause asthma, lung cancer and heart diseases. Apart from Sector 39, other stations monitoring AQI recorded a dip, with Sector 17 registering 227 (poor). Although this was lower as compared to 247 in 2019, it was still higher than levels recorded in 2018 and 2017 .“No firecrackers were burst in Sector 17, but AQI remained high probably because of the footfall here even on Diwali. The roads were crowded with vehicles and the footfall was equivalent to Diwali in previous years despite the pandemic,” said Neeraj Bajaj, president of the Business Promotion Council in Sector 17.CPCC officials, meanwhile, said AQI in the busy market centre had been logged at 230 for the past week before the festival, so it actually fell to 217 on Diwali. Vehicular emissions, a source of PM2.5, could have been the cause, they said. The good news was that Sunday evening’s rain spell cleared the air considerably. “Rain brings down the suspended particles in the air reducing the AQI,” said Surender Paul, director, India Meteorological Department, Chandigarh.With rain likely to continue on Monday, AQI levels are likely to fall to the satisfactory bracket (between 50-100), he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/diwali-pollution-levels-lowest-since-2017/story-ytzVcYg5fz0bz42xqiUWEJ.html

According to the FIR, his father, a labourer, dropped him at the workshop on Saturday morning and went to shop for Diwali.On returning in half an hour, the complainant found his son’s trousers lying on the road outside a puncture repair shop situated next to the welding workshop.On entering the premises, he found the accused, who worked at the shop, forcibly pumping air through his son’s rectum. While the accused fled, the man rushed his son, who complained of severe stomachache, to hospital. The boy died in a few hours while undergoing treatment.“Preliminary investigation has revealed the accused, who is also a minor, was indulging in mischief with the victim. Raids are being conducted to nab him,” said Mantej Singh, station house officer, Ramdas.A case has been registered under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mischief-turns-fatal-juvenile-on-the-run-after-11-yr-old-dies-in-amritsar/story-5E9v1GjA4B9CEv6YFfjfdO.html
15-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai coastal road: More corals to be tagged, shifted than originally identified, permitted||During the exercise for shifting coral colonies for further reclamation for the coastal road project, marine biologists said the number of coral colonies visually identified was much more than what was originally identified for translocation. However, the exact area would be calculated post final translocation of the coral species.The exercise of shifting the marine species began on Thursday.The Union environment ministry and Maharashtra forest department granted permissions under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 for shifting two species of corals from the Rhizangiidae family (Oulangia and one unidentified species) with 18 colonies documented across 0.251 square metre (almost 3 square foot) in Worli region of the project site, and another species (Dendrophylliidae family) along with Rhizangiidae across 1.1 sqft area at Haji Ali. The marine species were falling in the project’s way and needed to be shifted for further reclamation, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Since March, BMC has reclaimed over 65 hectares of the sea along south Mumbai for the 9.9-km coastal road, an eight-lane highway connecting Princess Street flyover to the southern tip of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link.Between Thursday and Saturday, 16 colonies from Worli were removed from their original locations while loose boulders (with corals) were removed from Haji Ali. There are two more coral colonies at Worli that need to be translocated. The process is likely to continue over the next five days.“During the on-going survey during low tide, visually we found many more coral colonies, especially at Haji Ali. Overall, we need to calculate the total coral expanse versus what had been originally identified,” said Harshal Karve, a marine biologist appointed by the state mangrove cell to oversee the translocation process.Vivek Kulkarni, independent coastal ecologist appointed by BMC to overlook the safety of marine biodiversity for the project, said, “The original survey was carried out two years ago. During the lockdown there had been improvement of seawater quality and project construction was at a standstill. As a result, new colonies had also been established since they are living organisms. However, we are taking all care and will ensure no corals are harmed.” Karve explained that coral colonies may be found on boulders or rocks across isolated patches within tide pools at both areas but the total expanse is calculated based on only the length of each coral colony and not considering the extent of one boulder to another. He added that these colonies may have been missed during the original survey in monsoon as such corals were located towards the deeper end of tide pools which were submerged. “However, all such colonies at both Worli and Haji Ali have been identified, tagged, and will be shifted carefully as mandated by the forest department and Centre,” he said.While National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) officials refused to comment on the issue, BMC officials said the translocation work was being handled by NIO and monitored by the mangrove cell. “We have asked for a final report which will be submitted to the state government and the environment ministry post translocation,” a senior BMC official said.The corals from Haji Ali will be shifted to Navy Nagar in a protected zone while the corals at Worli will be shifted to a site less than 200 metre away, outside the coastal road project area. “These sites were cautiously selected considering their proper safety and feasibility of transporting the coral species using crates and other equipment which may not have been possible at other zones like Geeta Nagar, Colaba or Marine Drive,” said Karve.Environmentalists said the original biodiversity study was a rushed job. “We actually have no clue on the actual presence of corals, how many were shifted or already dead along the alignment. Large numbers of these marine organisms have already been destroyed due to reclamation and excess sedimentation prior to the first biodiversity assessment,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust, that is petitioning against the project.Mangrove cell said that each and every aspect of the translocation was being scrutinised in detail. “Firstly, we must realise that not all corals are Schedule I species under the Wildlife Act. Thus, the mandate is to protect mainly the reef building corals. Secondly, the window to apply for post-facto clearance for some of the additional coral colonies identified during the current exercise can be done by BMC,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).Goenka countered the claim highlighting a Supreme Court order that does not allow post facto-clearance for any projects either under the Environment Impact Assessment, Coastal Regulation Zone or Wildlife Protection Act.CORALS AND WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?Corals are protected marine species sporadically spread across rocky intertidal regions along the Mumbai coast. They garner the same protection as a tiger or elephant under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act (WLPA), 1972, and permissions are needed from the principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF-wildlife) before translocation of the species.Corals along Mumbai coastMarine biologists from Mangrove and Marine Biodiversity Conservation Foundation of Maharashtra, an autonomous body that assists the state in coastal marine conservation, found the presence of 11 coral species along Mumbai coast. HT had, on June 27, 2019, reported that some of these 11 coral species may be lost owing to the coastal road project.- Nine of the 11 species identified were stony or hard corals, which extract calcium from surrounding seawater to create a hardened structure, while two species were soft corals that grow woody cores similar to plants for protection.- Among the hard corals, five species were identified from Rhizangiidae family, one species each from Caryophylliidae family and Dendrophylliidae family, and two others identified as reef-building corals from Siderastreidae family called False Pillow coral and one species from Poritidae family, Goniopora. Both the species of soft corals are from Gorgoniidae family.- The corals were identified across eight locations — Haji Ali, Geeta Nagar in Colaba, Marine Drive, Nepean Sea Road, Worli Sea Face, Bandra Bandstand, Carter Road and Juhu — as part of a four-month study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-coastal-road-more-corals-to-be-tagged-shifted-than-originally-identified-permitted/story-iaWbR6ZFSoeDrjcuuENUdJ.html

Shimla deputy commissioner (DC) Aditya Negi on Sunday issued an order prohibiting mass leave, mass agitation or mass strike by the operating staff of EMRI, GVK-108 ambulances in Shimla district. “GVK EMRI ambulances are being used to transport patients from sub-divisions to district hospitals or to Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC). Ambulances also carry the dead to cremation grounds,” said Negi.Shimla chief medical officer Surekha Chopra had informed the district administration that ambulance service had been hit after the employees refused to attend emergency calls and the patients were forced to arrange transport to hospitals on their own.“In case of violation of these orders, legal action will be taken against the operating staff as per the provisions of HP Essential Services (Maintenance) Act, 1973,” said Negi. There has been a steady upsurge in the number of Covid cases in Shimla district, recently.GVK EMRI in public-private partnership (PPP) with the state government had launched the ‘108 emergency service’ on December 25, 2010. The 108 national ambulance service with a fleet of 200 ambulances is spread across different parts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/esma-enforced-in-shimla-as-emergency-services-control-room-staff-goes-on-strike/story-4gjVKWnwJdMjcUajL4IujI.html

15-11-2020||Mumbai||BMC starts restoration of British era heritage milestones in Mumbai||After a delay of about two years since it was first planned, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday started work on the restoration of 11 British era heritage milestone markers of the city. These milestones are approximately 200 years old, according to information from BMC, and were installed to mark the distance from St Thomas Cathedral near Horniman Circle in Fort, which is considered the zero milestone. There are supposed to be 15 or 16 such milestones in the city limits, of which 11 have been traced so far.The restoration process includes excavating buried milestones, cleaning and polishing the surface, reinstalling them in the original location on a raised platform, with an information plaque next to the stone. Each milestone will have a QR code tag that tourists can scan on their mobile phones to view the entire milestone heritage circuit. BMC plans to install replicas in place of those that have not been traced, to commemorate a heritage spot, while those 11 that have been traced will be restored as per this plan. Rahul Chemburkar from Vaastuvidhaan, which has been appointed as the conservation architect consultant for the project said, “The unique selling point of this project is the QR code that will enable us to create a heritage circuit of all milestones, tying up the circuit together digitally.” If a tourist comes across any one milestone, they can scan the QR code, and will be able to access map showing the entire heritage circuit, the distance and directions to the next milestone from the tourist’s present location, and more information about the history and relevance of each milestone. The Cooperage Bandstand and the Kothari Pyau also have similar QR codes. Both were restored by Vaastuvidhaan. These are also part of heritage circuits, for example, the Kothari Pyau will be part of a circuit of 22 such pyaus, that will be restored by the civic body over the next few months.Chemburkar said, “We need to give these distance markers their due importance.”In the past three years, various initiatives have been taken up by different stakeholders to reinstate a few milestones in the city, at the BMC ward level. This project will cost an estimated ₹26 lakh, and will take about three months to complete.The project was first pitched in 2018 before BMC’s Heritage Committee and has been in the pipeline due to the cost and design revisions.According to information available with HT (Received from BMC in 2018)Milestones found:I milestone at Kalbadevi Road3 milestone at Gowalia Tank, TardeoIII milestone at Bhatia Hospital, TardeoIV milestone at N.M Joshi Marg, ChinchpokliV milestone at AgripadaV milestone that was relocated to ColabaVI milestone at Chitra Cinema, DadarVI milestone at Rail Mantralay, DadarVII milestone at Antonia DaSilva High School, DadarVIII milestone in SionIX milestone preserved at Bhaudaji Lal Museum, BycullaMissing MilestonesMilestone marker II is missing, another milestone marker III probably located at Mascarenhas Road is missing, milestone with IV marking probably located at Voltas Nagar is missing, and a milestone marker VIII is missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-starts-restoration-of-british-era-heritage-milestones-in-mumbai/story-0yRx5VCahaKObcqFjOYbqN.html
15-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai witnessed lowest noise pollution in 15 years during Diwali: NGO||Mumbai recorded the lowest level of noise pollution in the last 15 years on the first day of Diwali festival on Saturday during the permissible hours when the use of firecrackers was allowed, according to an NGO.Sumaira Abdulali, founder of Awaaz Foundation, told PTI on Sunday that the credit for the lowest levels of decibels (dB- the unit in which sound is measured) goes to the strict guidelines of the state government on bursting of firecrackers and growing awareness among citizens.“The noise pollution level recorded during Diwali this year is the lowest in the last 15 years,” Abdulali said.In a statement, the NGO said the noise level was measured from 8 pm to 10 pm (on Saturday) and then until the next morning (Sunday).The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had banned the use of firecrackers and fireworks in the city in a bid to check the spread of coronavirus.“A noise level of 105.5 decibel (dB) was recorded just before the 10 pm deadline (for bursting firecrackers) at the Shivaji Park ground, a silence zone in the city,” the Awaaz Foundation said.“This is the first time since Shivaji Park was declared a silence zone by the Bombay High Court in 2010 that firecrackers were burst there during Diwali.“The maximum noise levels (for Mumbai) stood at 112.3 dB in 2019, 114.1 dB in 2018, and 117.8 dB in 2017,” the NGO said, adding that many people who had assembled at Shivaji Park didn’t wear masks.However, the NGO also added that the accurate measurement of decibels for the entire Mumbai is difficult.“While the sound of bombs and other aerial firecrackers was audible in parts of the city. Their sound in residential societies cannot be measured,” it stated.The NGO said the BMC’s ban on not bursting firecrackers after 10 pm was violated at some places in the city.“However, in spite of these violations and the use of green firecrackers, the overall use of firecrackers was significantly less this time compared to previous years,” it stated.Mainly, less-noisy firecrackers like sparklers, fountains etc. were used this time, it said.“I would like to thank citizens of Mumbai, the police and the state government for taking up the impossible challenge of reducing noise pollution in our city, one of the noisiest in the world.“It was heartening to see the massive change brought about through active participation of all, which has succeeded in significantly reducing noise pollution from some of its most acute sources including during Ganpati, Eid-e-Milad and Diwali,” Abdulali said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-witnessed-lowest-noise-pollution-in-15-years-during-diwali-ngo/story-eUcr7ITIy3MlgdPSQXNMuN.html

15-11-2020||City||Gurugram: 1,000 new cases over Diwali weekend; count drops as testing low due to festival||Gururgam: The district recorded over 1,000 new cases of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease over the Diwali weekend, with the daily tally standing at 504 new infections on Saturday, and 515 new cases on Sunday. While these numbers are lower than the 800-odd cases being reported daily last week, the health department’s data also shows a significant dip in testing over the past two days.Gurugram tested only about 2,500 samples per day (down from about 4,000 samples) over Saturday and Sunday, with the daily test-positivity rate (TPR) touching 20%, the highest in at least two weeks.While the chief medical officer, Gururgam, could not be contacted on Sunday, a medical officer in the health department, seeking anonymity, said, “The numbers have fallen largely because of the unavailability of staff during Diwali festivities, but the shortfall will be made up in the following week.”From the tally at 34,742 a week ago, the tally of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram is now a stone’s throw from the 40,000 mark, standing at 39,387 reported cases. The past week saw 4,645 new coronavirus cases, up from 4,215 new cases the week prior. This was the highest weekly aggregate in at least seven weeks.Alongside the continuing rise in new daily cases, the district’s total tally of active cases is also on the rise. From 5,183 active coronavirus patients a week ago, the number exceeded the 6,000 mark for the first time on Saturday, with the tally at 6,143 active patients. However, the number dipped on Sunday to 5,990 active cases. Of these, 405 are presently hospitalised (up from 309 a week ago), while 5,575 patients are under home isolation (up from 4,865 patients a week ago). Another 10 patients (up from nine a week ago) are under observation at district Covid-care centres.The daily growth rate of cases also dipped over the weekend, touching 1.3% on Sunday (down from 2.8% on November 8). However, experts cautioned that this is due to testing, and does not indicate that the spread of Covid has slowed down among the community.“Testing numbers must continue to increase over time as the virus spreads. If you reduce testing by such a large margin, as Gurugram has done over the weekend, then naturally your growth rate -- or the number of new daily cases -- will also reduce. This doesn’t mean that the spread of the virus has slowed,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine at PGIMER, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-1-000-new-cases-over-diwali-weekend-count-drops-as-testing-low-due-to-festival/story-26bg5IbBBmQdAfiiq4JjyK.html
15-11-2020||Gurugram||Colleges, varsities to resume physical classroom sessions from November 16||State universities and colleges across the state will resume physical classroom sessions in a staggered manner from November 16 for the first time since educational institutions across the country were asked to shut down in view of Covid-19 pandemic in March. As per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) shared with universities and colleges in the state last week, the higher education department had said that research scholars and postgraduate students in science and technology would be allowed to visit colleges for the purpose of research and laboratory work, with generic preventive measures in place. The same rules will apply to students of undergraduate courses of all streams. Pooja Khullar, principal of Dronacharya Government College, said that the college had informed teachers to send out appropriate directions to students for the resumption of classes from Monday. She said the college had already put in place sanitisation and physical distancing measures. “We are expecting students to visit the college from Monday. All teachers have been asked to ensure that attendance is not enforced so that only willing students can visit the premises. Enforcement of physical distancing is going to be our priority since admission formalities and exams are already taking place on the campus. With the resumption of classes, the footfall will increase,” said Khullar. As per the guidelines issued by the higher education department last week, online/distance learning will continue to be the preferred mode of teaching and shall be encouraged. Students who wish to continue with online classes will be permitted to do so and attendance will not be enforced. For now, colleges will be abiding by the protocol that was issued in September for academic guidance sessions. As per the protocol, students from different courses have been allotted different days of the week for the classroom sessions. “Students will be permitted to visit the college twice a week for a limited duration, to begin with. We are expecting students to visit the colleges from Tuesday since many students are still at home for Diwali,” said Dr Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/colleges-varsities-to-resume-physical-classroom-sessions-from-november-16/story-IvVw8YIxpmhmbP576vnD7O.html

The police said that the number of calls was the highest in the last 11 years.Other complaints made to the PCR include drinking in public spaces and people visiting one another without observing mask hygiene or social distancing. As many as 3,800 personnel had been deployed on Saturday night to make spot visits.Last Monday, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned the sale and use of all types of firecrackers in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), including Gurugram, following which the state government issued similar orders. However, instances of cracker burning were reported from across the city, said police.Police commissioner KK Rao said, “We had deployed 40 special teams across the city to keep a check and take action against violators found defying the state government’s order with regard to crackers. Despite regular coordination and awareness, people did not adhere to the guidelines and burst crackers until late night. People have bought crackers illegally from different cities and districts and even the people staying in high-rise and condominiums burst crackers on different floors,” he said, adding that 377 calls were made by neighbours of such violators.The police said that besides complaints, they received 77 mischievous calls as well. Rao said that in 13 instances, PCR vans rushed to the spot but found that the call was a hoax, whereas in other instances, officials were greeted by revellers, most of whom were inebriated. However, no action was taken against such callers. No action was taken by the police in a majority of the cases from societies on Golf Course Road, Palam Vihar, Sohna Road and in Nirvana either.According to the police, starting 11am on Saturday, the PCR continuously received calls till around 6am on Sunday. More than 35 calls were made by people complaining of drunken brawls, while 260 calls were miscellaneous in nature. The PCR in-charge, however, said that incidents of quarrels were fewer compared to last year. In 2019, the police received 67 calls of quarrels while around 17 calls of incidents of fire were also reported.Sixteen calls related to road accidents were received by three call operators, while around 107 calls related to noise pollution were reported after 10pm, compared to the 40 reported last year. These calls were mostly from Sushant Lok -1, South City-2, DLF Phase-2, Sector 23 and Golf Course Extension Road, along with some of the newly developing areas in Sector 107. Besides, nine calls related to fire incidents were also received, fewer than the 17 received last year. A team of 13 policemen were deployed at the PCR. “The PCR did not receive so many calls in a single day over the last 11 years. Every year, the control room receives around 700-800 calls on Diwali. The PCR staff members were prompt in taking action after receiving calls. All the senior police officials made regular visits in different areas and checked the police deployment,” said Rao. About 800 police officials from 40 police stations, 350 from traffic police and a few others from the crime team were deployed, along with riders and the PCR staff, to respond to calls. The police said that the highest number of calls from urban villages were from Badshahpur, Chakkarpur, Sikanderpur, Jharsa, Pataudi and Manesar, Sector 10A and Palam Vihar ranked highest among urban sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/over-1-300-calls-to-control-room-keep-cops-on-their-toes/story-kzYyTsQnVLr7IueTdG45BJ.html

15-11-2020||Gurugram||Light rain set to alleviate chokehold of toxic air||Several parts of the city received light rain on Sunday afternoon, a day after Diwali, due to a fresh western disturbance, said weather officials. Isolated to scattered rainfall is likely to bring some relief to residents from a spike in air pollution post-Diwali.Air quality in the city deteriorated to the ‘severe’ category on Sunday, with a reading of 425 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin, a day after Diwali. This is significantly up from Saturday’s AQI reading of 358, which indicated ‘very poor’ air.Earlier during the day, high-speed winds of 12-14kmph prevailed, due to which accumulation of pollutants was curtailed to some extent. As per the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research’s (Safar) official forecast, Sunday’s rainfall may help in the improvement of air quality.“An isolated scattered rainfall under the influence of fresh Western Disturbance by November 15 is also expected. The AQI is likely to start improving from the afternoon and make AQI in the lower end of ‘very poor’ on November 16,” stated Safar’s official forecast on Sunday.Gurugram’s minimum temperature settled at 15 degrees Celsius on Sunday, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Palam observatory in Delhi, which, according to the MeT department officials, gives a fairly accurate reading of the city’s weather. The IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) did not record the city’s minimum temperature on Thursday. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 27.4 degrees Celsius, as per the Palam observatory.Navdeep Dahiya, a Rohtak-based meteorologist, said that due to the build-up of meteorological activity on account of the western disturbance, the city could receive scattered rainfall till Monday morning. “Gurugram can expect light to moderate rain between Sunday night and Monday morning on account of the western disturbance. By Monday afternoon, the skies should clear up,” said Dahiya.He said that both the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to fall by several degrees in the coming days. “North-westerly winds from the snow-clad mountains will bring down the temperatures in the coming days. Gurugram can see a minimum temperature of around 8 degrees Celsius between 17-19 November while the maximum temperature might hover around 23 to 25 degrees Celsius,” said Dahiya.As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, both the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to drop by two degrees Celsius on Monday. While the maximum temperature will stay around 25 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, the minimum temperature will hover around 13 degrees Celsius, as per IMD. As per the weekly forecast, fog and mist will prevail in the morning hours, followed by partly cloudy skies during the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/light-rain-set-to-alleviate-chokehold-of-toxic-air/story-qgn7t0qkhFjQlZuUa7JetK.html
15-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Over 500 penalised for firecracker violations, not wearing masks||The Police on Saturday penalised at least 537 persons who were found without masks, bursting firecrackers or selling them. Police said a ban had been imposed on bursting firecrackers by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in view of rising air pollution, and they penalised violators in different areas of the city. According to the police, 104 people from different places in Gurugram were arrested for allegedly selling firecrackers despite a ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the city in the last three days, said the police.City police commissioner KK Rao said that they had alerted their informers and deployed at least 690 police personnel in plainclothes across the city in a massive crackdown on firecracker sale and usage. The NGT, earlier this month, had ordered zero tolerance on such activities in the National Capital Region (NCR) in view of the deteriorating air quality in November. “Since Saturday morning, we have been getting calls that people are not wearing masks and are roaming around in markets, shopping. Outskirt areas, from where most of the firecracker godowns were seized, were reported to be selling firecrackers,” he said.Across the city, police teams visited almost all residential areas and requested residents not to burst firecrackers, else they would face action.Rao said that until 6pm everything was peaceful but then suddenly, after 7pm, people started bursting firecrackers like there is no tomorrow. “Surprisingly, people living in high-rises too did not follow any guidelines issued by their resident welfare associations. They bought crackers illegally and burst them from their terraces. There was noise and air pollution at night following which people started calling and complaining about their neighbours,” he said. Police said they seized more than 700 kilograms of firecrackers during the crackdown and it was found that shopkeepers had bought them from neighbouring areas. Officers booked the suspects under Section 9B of the Explosives Act at respective police stations, said the police.Police said there was a lot of confusion amongst the people as many reached designated areas with firecrackers to burst them, not knowing of the latest NGT order. Their firecrackers were seized but no action was taken against them, said officers. More than 350 persons were given a warning and allowed to leave as they had come with their children at different spots and had assumed there was some firework display on Diwali.Rao said they wanted the people to have a safe Diwali and to ensure there were no drunken brawls, the police had taken precautionary measures and had deployed personnel in all slum areas as well. The NGT order bans firecrackers in the NCR from the midnight of November 9 to the midnight of November 30. Earlier this week, the NGT had sought responses from state governments in the NCR on banning firecrackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-over-500-penalised-for-firecracker-violations-not-wearing-masks/story-svICgfRl9NKC7VfPRLVnyM.html
15-11-2020||Gurugram||28 fire incidents reported on Diwali||At least 28 incidents of fire were reported on the day of Diwali from various parts of the city. However, no injuries were reported in any of them, said Gurugram fire department officials on Sunday.As per the officials, all the incidents took place between 6pm and midnight on Saturday, November 14.Of all the fire incidents, 26 were categorised as minor by officials, while two incidents — one in Sector 50 and the other in Sector 67 — were said to be major.In the first of these two incidents, three buses of a private school caught fire, with one of them getting completely gutted while the other two getting partially burnt.“The driver or the conductor of the bus had lit a candle or a diya (lamp) inside, the flames of which resulted in the bus catching fire. We had stationed a fire tender at Vatika Chowk. It reached the spot within three minutes after the incident was reported,” said Satyawan Samriwal, assistant divisional fire safety officer (ADFSO).Samriwal said that the flames from the bus also reached two other buses parked nearby.“With three buses catching fire, we sent another fire tender from the Sector 29 fire department for support. The two fire tenders were able to douse the flames in under 15 minutes. However, the bus where the fire had originally broken out was completely gutted,” said Samriwal.In the second incident, three cars parked at a vacant plot near IREO Victory Valley were gutted after a fire broke out possibly due to stray firecrackers.Minor fires also broke out in apartments located in Sector 9, South City-2, Sector 46 and Udyog Vihar while stray firecrackers resulted in a shop containing decoration items near Sikanderpur Rapid Metro station catching fire.Apart from these incidents, a rag collection point at a vacant plot opposite Signature Towers, and a 1.5acre farm in Farrukhnagar also caught fire.“All these remaining incidents were minor and, in most cases, required limited or no use of fire tenders. Overall, no injuries were reported in any of the incidents. We had strategically placed fire tenders at five different points across the city, besides having five fire stations, to ensure the minimum amount of response time,” said Samriwal.The fire department had placed fire tenders at Vatika Chowk, Sadar Bazar, Old Railway Road, Mahavir Chowk, and Palam Vihar.The fire department have also cancelled the leaves of all 200 firemen till November 16 to ensure that there are more available staff. The 200 firemen are working in two shifts of 12 hours each, instead of three shifts of eight hours each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/28-fire-incidents-reported-on-diwali/story-kPCEjBL6fqrfrL3BqTWEbK.html
15-11-2020||Gurugram||Cracker ban goes up in smoke as air worsens to ‘severe’ zone||Residents showed scant regard for the firecracker ban on Diwali, with extensive cracker bursting across the city since Saturday evening plunging the air quality to the ‘severe’ category, once again, on Sunday. Gurugram’s daily air quality index (AQI) reading for the day, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin, was at 425 — up from a ‘very poor’ AQI of 358 on Diwali day. Several citizens also took to social media to voice their criticism against the use of firecrackers, which could be seen and heard until well after midnight on Saturday.All four official air quality monitors in Gurugram recorded a sharp increase in the concentration of particulate matter pollutants between 8pm on November 14 and 12am on November 15.At Vikas Sadan in Sector 11, the level of finer particulate matter with diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5) rose from 340 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) at 6pm to over 500ug/m3 at midnight, and remained well above 400ug/m3 until 6am. In Sector 51, the level of PM2.5 rose from 300ug/m3 at 6pm to over 500ug/3 at midnight, while the level of PM10 rose from 140ug/m3 to 461ug/m3 at 10pm.Similar spurts in particulate matter were seen at two other air quality monitoring stations in the vicinity of Gwal Pahari, along the Gurgaon-Faridabad road. Hazardous levels of PM pollutants — exceeding concentrations of 400ug/m3 — persisted at all four monitoring locations until the wee hours of Sunday morning, and receded into the 330ug/m3 to 390ug/m3 range by afternoon, official data shows.Although the bursting of crackers remained muted throughout the day, it picked up pace between 6pm and 11pm, which majorly contributed to pollution on Diwali evening. A large number of residents also called authorities to register a complaint in this matter, but overall the enforcement of the ban on crackers was lax, alleged residents.Publicly available data from these monitoring stations also reveals spikes in the levels of chemical pollutants like sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) on Diwali night. For instance, in Sector 51, the concentration of CO rose from 60ug/m3 at 6pm to 133ug/m3 at 10pm. At Vikas Sadan, the concentration of SO2 rose from 16ug/m3 at 6pm to 106ug/m3 at 10pm.Officials in the Haryana State Pollution Control Board, as well as experts, attributed this spurt in pollution directly to firecracker emissions. With stricter adherence to the NGT’s ban, they added, air quality may have remained ‘very poor’ on Sunday, below the 400 AQI mark.However, officials also claimed that the city saw decreased firecracker emissions, in comparison to 2019, partly due to reduced use and partly due to favourable meteorological conditions.As per data provided by the HSPCB’s regional office in Gurugram, a dip in the level of PM2.5 was observed at its monitoring station in Vikas Sadan, as compared to 2019. “Last year on Diwali night, PM2.5 peaked to over 900ug/m3. This year, the maximum concentration was 633ug/m3. Similar variance from last year is also seen in the quantity of SO2 and NO2 at this same location. We can say it is because of less firecracker use this year. Non-availability in the market has worked to a degree,” said Kuldeep Singh, the HSPCB’s regional officer, Gurugram.Experts, meanwhile, said that while firecracker intensity has been lower this year, the overall pollution level is worse than last year. CPCB data from last year shows that Gurugram’s AQI a day after Diwali, on October 28, 2019, stood at ‘very poor’, with an AQI of 372 (as against 425 this year).“Last year, Diwali happened in late October, when the weather was warmer. There was also no stringent cracker ban as we have seen this year. So yes, we anticipate that the intensity of firecracker emissions has been less, but we are already at a point in the pollution cycle when the AQI is quite high, which is why it is not really a ‘cleaner’ Diwali,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist.Panwar, who has been tracking pollution levels in the city since early on Friday, also explained, “Gurugram saw extremely high wind speeds which touched 12kmph in some parts of the city on Diwali night, so pollutants from firecrackers were not allowed to accumulate. These winds were followed by light rain on Sunday afternoon, which will further alleviate the situation.”The early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR stated, “The strong easterly winds are highly favourable of removal of pollutants on 15.11.2020. The air quality is likely to remain in lower end of very poor to poor category on 16.11.2020. The air quality is likely to remain in poor category on 17.11.2020.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cracker-ban-goes-up-in-smoke-as-air-worsens-to-severe-zone/story-g73DjbozWbBRkfE8Si7pVM.html
15-11-2020||Chandigarh||Cracker ban goes up in smoke in Chandigarh with 11 arrests, 25 FIRs in Mohali||A cracker ban imposed by the Chandigarh administration was ignored in some sectors on Diwali on Saturday despite police patrolling with 11 persons arrested for violations. About 25 first information reports (FIRs) were filed in Mohali. Chandigarh police say 11 cases were registered under Section 188 (disobedience of an order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which involves imprisonment for up to two years with a fine of Rs 1,000, and the Disaster Management Act. Thirteen cases were registered in 2019 under Section 188.Awareness drives bore fruitPeople by and large didn’t burst crackers. “The awareness drives carried out bore fruit, which is why people were more willing to listen to us and lesser cases were registered,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, Chandigarh senior superintendent of police (SSP). Most of the arrests were made in the villages of the city, including a cracker seller in Manimajra. The police control room received 667 calls, of which 347 spot incidents were generated. Although 113 calls of nuisance created by bursting crackers were received as compared to 75 last year, there were fewer incidents of quarrels, accidents and fires.Though the offence is bailable, provisions under the Disaster Management Act are stricter as compared to Section 188 of the IPC, which carries maximum jail for only three months. Section 51 of the Act provides for a jail term of two years in case anyone gets hurt and one year for violations. Police officials also said bail was granted in all the cases on Saturday, but the parties will have to appear in court at a set date.Many residents violated the cracker ban. Kusum Ghai, a social activist in Sector 45, said fireworks went off at 4 pm near Killa Sahib Gurdwara and continued till the late hours. Criticising the locals for not paying heed to rules, Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Associations Welfare Federation, said, “Police patrolling was going on throughout the night, but people also need to abide by the rules. Crackers were being burst in most of the Sectors. However, the big aerial crackers which cause the most pollution remained missing this time.”Beyond time limitIn Mohali, 25 FIRs were registered under Section 188 for bursting crackers beyond the permitted time — 8pm to 10pm, versus zero cases last year.“We have registered 25 cases against the people from the district bursting crackers beyond permissible time limit,” said Satinder Singh, SSP Mohali.Challans were issued on traffic violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cracker-ban-goes-up-in-smoke-in-chandigarh-with-11-arrests-25-firs-in-mohali/story-ixpt23XSWzbzy8Vrz4gg5K.html

15-11-2020||Chandigarh||Sweeping, garbage lifting delayed in Ludhiana: Waste generated on Diwali remains strewn on streets||The waste generated as a result of Diwali celebrations remained strewn on the city’s roads till late on Sunday as the process to lift garbage from secondary dumps got delayed. The A2Z company’s labourers took part in Vishwakarma Day celebrations and the lifting process only started in the afternoon, that too at a slow pace. Also, sweeping got delayed in parts of the city including Shimlapuri, Haibowal, Dugri, Giaspura, Field Ganj and Dhandari.Officials said sweeping got delayed as it was holiday on Sunday; still the workers covered many parts of the city and the remaining areas will be covered on Monday morning. They added that the lifting of garbage got delayed as the A2Z company’s labourers were celebrating Vishwakarma Day and did not report on duty. There are over 50 secondary dumping points in the city where large quantities of garbage had accumulated. At certain points, including Jawahar Nagar Camp, Field Ganj, near Division number 3 police station and scooter market near Model Town, roads outside the garbage dumps got blocked due to dumping of waste. As per the information, around 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage is generated in the city everyday and on Diwali, the number reached 1,300 metric tonnes.Officials said the lifting of garbage restarted partially in the afternoon. Major points have already been cleared and garbage has been cleared from the road portions. Vishant Chaudhary, manager of A2Z company, said: “The labourers did not come to work on Vishwakarma Day. However, when the situation deteriorated in the city, we deployed a few workers and the lifting of garbage has been commenced partially. The garbage has been removed from roads and the process will commence at full capacity from Monday.” Meanwhile, residents said that the MC should make permanent arrangements to streamline the lifting of garbage as accumulation of waste in the open at secondary dumping points is not new in the city.Satinder Singh, a shopkeeper at the Model Town scooter market, said: “We understand that the lifting got delayed on Vishwakarma Day, but this is not new in the city. We have submitted several complaints to the MC, but they have failed to remove the open garbage dump from the area, which also takes a toll on the business. The foul smell spreads in the entire area.” Jagjit Singh, a shopkeeper in the Shimlapuri area, said: “The streets were filled with waste generated from bursting firecrackers and no sweeper reported on duty for duty on Sunday. The MC should make arrangements to clear the city roads after Diwali and residents should also become responsible. They should not bursted crackers in the street, and if they do, then should also make arrangements to clean up after themselves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sweeping-garbage-lifting-delayed-in-ludhiana-waste-generated-on-diwali-remains-strewn-on-streets/story-qrsf1FYFx0Xk1MjkuUThyJ.html

15-11-2020||Indore||200-year-old fireball-fight banned in MP, locals threaten to boycott civic poll||Breaking the 200-year-old tradition, Indore district administration on Sunday succeeded in stopping Hingot—the fight with fireballs-- that used to leave scores of people injured every year. Heavy police force was deployed in Gautampura area after Indore district administration cited Covid-19 pandemic to turn down the request for holding of annual Hingot—a 200-year-old tradition. Indore district collector Manish Singh issued an order banning organisation of Hingot since it encourages participation of hundreds of people and would make it impossible to check for violations of Covid 19 protocols. However, the decision of putting a ban on age-old tradition didn’t go down well with locals. Congress leaders also criticised the BJP-led state government for the decision of ban. A resident of Gautampura, Manoj Parmar said, “We wanted to do a symbolic fight to keep the tradition alive but administration and police didn’t allow us. We are planning to boycott local bodies’ elections which are slated to be held in January.” Congress MLA Vishal Patel said, “On one side, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan asked people to burst crackers on Diwali by defying National Green Tribunal’s order to keep the tradition alive but on the other side, BJP-led state government put a ban on an age-old tradition which is a matter of faith of people of Gautampura and Kalangi.” Also Read: MP govt’s Deendayal committees ploy to build BJP network for 2023 polls: CongDuring the by-elections, they didn’t think of gathering hundreds of people but now they are showing concern. This is a double standard of the government and people will make the BJP-led state government realise this in local bodies’ election. However, Indore, deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, HN Mishra said, “It is a wrong tradition and should be banned. This year, the administration put a ban on it but people themselves didn’t come out for the fight. The ban was completed successfully.” Last year, more than 70 people had sustained injuries in the fight. According to this tradition, the warriors — ‘Turra’ of Gautampura and ‘Kalangi’ of Runji village — attack each other with burning hingots, a hollow fruit stuffed with gun powder that resembles a shooting star.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/indore/200-year-old-fireball-fight-banned-in-mp-locals-threaten-to-boycott-civic-poll/story-AjdSeuQGCcA2kp3VtPinSP.html

Four fire tenders rushed to the spot and found the carcass, besides a burnt Mahindra Max loading vehicle and a three-wheeler. Staff from the Society for Prevention of Cruelty towards Animals (SPCA) was called in to remove the carcass. Two refrigerators, one television and the stationery at a shop were also damaged in the fire.Earlier around 11pm, three fire tenders had to be pressed into service after flames were noticed on the second floor of a shop near Samadhi Gate, on Old Ropar Road in Manimajra. After workers at the shop, Everwell Pharma Private Limited, informed the fire brigade, the fire was brought under control in 90 minutes. The total loss wasn’t ascertained, however, firemen said the premises stocked medicines. Later, at 11.30pm, the fire department received information of a fire at the godown of a clothing company in Faidan village.

15-11-2020||Delhi||JD(U) holds protest against Delhi’s Chhath Puja Ban||Members of the Janata Dal (United) (JDU) in Delhi and the Chhath Puja Sangharsh Samiti on Sunday held a protest at Jantar Mantar against the Delhi government’s ban on Chhath Puja this year, saying that the Aam Aadmi Party-led government is hiding its incapability as they failed to make proper arrangements for the celebrations.Satya Prakash Mishra, general secretary of the JD(U) in Delhi said that the government must allow devotees who were fasting to perform the puja on the banks of the Yamuna. “The government must at least allow the people who are fasting to go to the ghats and celebrate the festival while following all Covid-19 protocol. This is an important festival for the people of Bihar and Purvanchal and it is not possible to perform the puja at houses and mohallas. This government has imposed this ban to hide their incapability,” Mishra told ANI. He added, “If the government had made arrangements just one month ahead, the festival could have been celebrated very smoothly on the ghats of the Yamuna while following all protocol. We have reached out to the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister but have not received a response. We will continue this protest till our demand is met.” Parmila Devi, another protestor said, “We have been celebrating Chhath Puja for the last 30 years here. The river is just 5 kilometers away from our home. Where should we go and do puja? Does the government think we don’t know how to maintain social distance? Aren’t we also afraid of getting infected?” she asked.Others however felt that the ban was reasonable and said that they should follow the instructions of the government. “We will follow the government’s orders for Chhath Puja this year. We can collect some water from the river and perform puja at home. It is about your devotion anywhere and everywhere. I do not need to go to the river to show my devotion,” said a devotee on the ghats. Chhath, which is celebrated six days after Diwali, starts on November 20 this year. It is dedicated to the Sun God and is one of the most popular festivals for the people of Bihar and parts of Uttar Pradesh or Purvanchal. Devotees gather and take holy dip in rivers, ponds and other water bodies during the four-day festivities. Last week, the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government decided to ban community Chhath Puja celebrations at Ghats to curb the spread of Covid-19.

15-11-2020||Lucknow||Mayawati names new UP BSP chief, signals strategy for 2022 polls||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati, on Sunday, named Bhim Rajbhar as the party’s Uttar Pradesh unit president with an eye on other backward castes (OBC) votes in the 2022 assembly election.In a tweet, Mayawati congratulated Rajbhar on his appointment as BSP’s state unit president.Rajbhar will replace Munkad Ali who has been made the state coordinator of Uttarakhand. The decision to appoint a new president comes five days after BJP swept the results of the by-election on seven assembly seats by winning six and leaving one for the Samajwadi Party. The BSP failed to win even a single seat, though the party candidate was runner-up on the Bulandshahr seat.The BSP polled 19% votes, indicating that it enjoys the support of the Dalit community but may have to regain the support of its traditional OBC vote base to win the 2022 assembly election.The removal of Munkad Ali, considered the Muslim face of the BSP, has surprised political observers. In the by-election, Mayawati had fielded two Muslim candidates: Mohammad Muslim on the Bulandshahar seat and Furkan on Naugawan Sadat seat. Despite courting controversy with her statement that BSP will support the BJP candidate in the legislative council election to ensure the defeat of the Samajwadi Party candidate, the BSP candidates were runner-up on the Bulandshahar seat by polling 65,917 votes, and third on Naugawan Sadat seat, by polling 38,253 votes.Yes to uncle Shivpal, but no to major parties: Akhilesh Yadav reveals his probable plans for 2022 electionsMeanwhile, the BJP, SP and the Congress are trying to woo the OBC before the crucial 2022 assembly election. To counter their move, Rajbhar was appointed the new state president. The party wishes to send a message to the backward community that they will get a prominent place in the organisation, a BSP leader said.While Munkad Ali was removed from the state unit president’s post, the BSP is working to strengthen its base in the Muslim community. Muslim leaders have been made zonal coordinators in the organisation, while the party is also working on forming new alliances to expand the base in the Muslim community.The BSP contested the assembly election in Bihar in alliance with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi. The Grand United Secular Front (GUSF) secured victory on six seats. While the AIMIM bagged five seats, the BSP secured victory on one seat. The BSP might replicate the Bihar experiment in UP assembly election by tying up again with the AIMIM which has expanded its base in the Muslim-dominated Rohilkhand region, the BSP leader said.A loyal party leader, Bhim Rajbhar, is a resident of Mau district, located in Eastern UP. He held the post of the district unit president and was promoted to the rank of zonal coordinator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/mayawati-names-new-up-bsp-chief-signals-strategy-for-2022-polls/story-Qlktz57xfEqTtkA0MbWuEN.html

15-11-2020||Patna||LJP claims it proved its worth in Bihar through its ‘influence in changing results’||With questions being raised about the Lok Janshakti Party’s(LJP) prospects after it won only one seat in the Bihar assembly polls, party sources on Sunday cited its “influence” in “changing” results in over 40 seats to assert that it will continue to have a key presence in the state politics.The LJP was instrumental in the defeat of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United),JD(U)in at least 36 seats which is evident from its vote share, and the The Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP)would also have been hit hard if the regional party had gone all out against it in a similar manner, the sources claimed.The LJP might have won only one seat, but it has underscored its presence by fetching 5.7 percent votes, the party sources said.They noted that the party put up candidates in only six seats where the BJP was in the fray while contesting on almost each of the 115 seats where the JD(U) contested in the elections to the 243-seat Bihar assembly polls. With the JD(U), hit hard by the LJP in the elections, likely to oppose any friendly vibes to the party by its ally BJP, the sources in the Chirag Paswan-led party claimed that it was offered only 15 seats to contest in the polls, leaving it with no option other than to fight on its own. So far, there has been no official word from either the BJP or the LJP about the number of seats it was offered. LJP sources said their party could not have accepted only 15 seats after having six Lok Sabha MPs and one Rajya Sabha member in Ram Vilas Paswan, whose death has necessitated a by-election to the seat. “We had the option of either crossing over to the opposition or fighting on our own with a focus on seats being contested by the JD(U), as its reluctance was the main reason the LJP was offered only so few seats,” an LJP leader said, adding that its decision was driven by the desire to cause minimal harm to the BJP.The National Democratic Alliance(NDA) scraped through in a close contest with the The Rashtriya Janata Dal(RJD)-Left-Congress alliance by winning 125 seats against the opposition’s 110.The JD(U) suffered heavy losses as its tally fell to 43 from 71 in the 2015 polls. The LJP, which had two seats in the outgoing assembly, won only one seat while the BJP emerged victorious in 74.Chirag Paswan has insisted that his party might have left the NDA in Bihar, but it remains a member of the ruling alliance at the Centre.It remains to be seen what shape the LJP’s relations with the BJP at the Centre take as the party’s political presence is confined to Bihar where JD(U) leaders have expressed their opposition to any ties with Chirag Paswan’s party. In his campaign, Paswan was strongly critical of Nitish Kumar and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/ljp-claims-it-proved-its-worth-in-bihar-through-its-influence-in-changing-results/story-Y6YZYOUEBPdcdZDfHOrCvO.html
15-11-2020||City||20 per cent positive rate in Cantonment board areas despite lower testing||PUNE The three Cantonment boards in Pune district - Pune, Khadki and Dehu road - have an average Covid-19 positivity rate of 20.21% for the past 14 days.Pune district has a positivity rate of an average of 10 per cent in November. With fewer tests being conducted in Cantonment board areas located in the vicinity of the city, the city also runs the risk of a possible surge in Covid-19 cases. Even though the Indian Council for Medical Research’s (ICMR) testing guidelines, in anticipation of a second wave, states that there must be at least 140 tests per million population to prevent a re-surge of Covid-19 cases. As of November 14, the three Cantonment boards, combined, have reported 6,398 Covid-19 cases, of which 5,807 have recovered; 412 are active cases and 179 deaths have been reported. A total of 18,652 Covid19 tests have been done in all the three Cantonment boards as per a report by the district health office (DHO).As per the health office, the total number of tests done in all these three Cantonment boards since November 1 are 638, of which 129 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported, putting the positivity rate at 20 per cent. The data also shows that zero tests were conducted on November 8, a Sunday; and on November 14, Diwali, four Covid-19 samples were collected for testing. Dr V D Gaikwad, Pune Cantonment board’s resident medical officer, said, “On Sundays, labs are shut and we send our samples only to NIV and Sassoon. Our Covid19 centre at Mahadji Shinde is collecting samples while other hospitals have started non-Covid19 OPD services since this month.”Cantonment boards also lack tertiary healthcare and none of their dedicated Covid-19 hospitals have a ventilator or ICU beds, which makes the residents dependent on PMC, PCMC or private hospitals for critical cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/20-per-cent-positive-rate-in-cantonment-board-areas-despite-lower-testing/story-Qz3bHHkpyYCxiFcnAb4s7H.html

Dr Shreyansh Kapale, director of Medbros, the agency which runs the COEP jumbo facility said, “We have not had many discharged patients at the OPD and those who come to the facility come only for clerical work like getting their reports or other such things.” Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant medical officer in PMC, said, “It is true that we are not getting the response which we expected. However, the reason is not clear. It has been only a month since we started the OPD and the doctors by the private agency who run the facility also run the post-Covid-19 OPD as well, so we will wait for some more time.”Another PMC official, requesting anonymity, said, “It is not clear as to why discharged patients are not turning up even though we offer free services. It could be because of the fear of Covid-19 patients being treated at the centre, or even that only very few patients have any post Covid-19 symptoms, and those who have it, prefer going to private hospitals.” Many discharged patients have reported multiple symptoms including fatigue, breathlessness and cardiac ailments post their “recovery” from Covid19. These symptoms have been visible in patients discharged months ago from the hospital. Most private hospitals that treated Covid19 patients have now started their own post Covid-19 OPD’s to attend to symptoms of discharged patients. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital, who is also in-charge of the post Covid-19 OPD, said, “We have had 450 patients who were were infected and have come to the OPD for post Covid-19 care. We started the OPD almost two months ago and now we have all the data which we will also analyse to understand the common symptoms and the intensity of symptoms on people, and whether it depends on the comorbidity of the person, their age, the duration of treatment on ventilator or ICU, and the drugs and treatments procedures used on them during Covid19 treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/recovered-patients-a-no-show-at-jumbo-facility-opds-for-post-covid-care/story-iMTZv6FCYnoE0HIKJnbSGN.html
15-11-2020||Pune||BJP, NCP at war over credit for Bhama Askhed water project||A war has broken out over taking credit for the Bhama Askhed water project between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).The project is considered to be a landmark in the development of the eastern side of the city. The Bhama Askhed project which has been plagued in delays was completed recently and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has begun its trials.The PMC is bringing water in from a dam that is 50 kilometres away. Water will be provided to areas that fall under Ahmednagar road, Kharadi, Vadgaonsheri and Kalyani nagar.After the completion of the project, city unit president and former MLA Jagdish Mulik visited the project and announced that the ruling BJP will inaugurate the project at the hands of former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.Mulik claimed, “During his tenure as MLA from Vadgaonsheri, he followed up the project for a period of five years continuously.”Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol and standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne also supported city unit president and assured to inaugurate the project at the hands of Fadnavis.Meanwhile NCP’s incumbent MLA Sunil Tingre has objected to Mulik’s Fadnavis inauguration announcement.Tingre said, “The project was conceptualised and started in NCP’s tenure in 2014. Congress and NCP took approval from the Central government and got the funds under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. During the BJP’s tenure, the leaders were not able to sort out the whole issue and they delayed it for almost five years. Ajit Pawar took interest in it after the Maha Vikas Agadi was sworn in power and completed the rest of the work. It was decided by the PMC to inaugurate the project at the hands of Pawar.”Rasne said, “The Central government had given Rs 171 crore for this project and the state government contributed Rs 68 crore in it. Despite that, the Pune Municipal Corporation had spent Rs 112 crore on the project.”The BJP claims that during their tenure, they underwent a financial burden for the project despite it being funded by both the state and the Central government. However, the NCP blamed the BJP for increasing the financial burden of the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bjp-ncp-at-war-over-credit-for-bhama-askhed-water-project/story-aMvUuKB7ab8mtZ6UIOJm1I.html

According to civic officials, as compared to previous year people burst fewer firecrackers this year. An official of fire brigade department said, “Till 8.30pm, we did not receive any call of fire-related accident due to bursting of crackers.” Vishal Berate, a firecracker seller from Parvati area, said, “Due to Covid-19, this year the sale of crackers has come down. Every year, my friends and I, put up three stalls of firecrackers. Till Friday (November 13), there was no sale. On Saturday, the Laxmi pujan day, we saw buyers but not as expected.” Another stall owner Ravindra Pophale from Aryaneshwar area said, “Only half of the stock is sold out. Customers who used to spend Rs1,000 on crackers in previous years, this time purchased only of Rs200 to Rs300 of fireworks. Maximum purchasers are from trader community.” A Rupesh Sakla from Maharshinagar area said, “There was no bursting of firecrackers on the first two days, but on Laxmi pujan day people participate in fireworks, especially the trader’s community.” Trader Mitish Gujrati said, “It is an auspicious day. We burst a few crackers this year and followed the coronavirus precautions. Every year, we bought crackers worth Rs 5,000. but this year did a purchase of only Rs2,000.” Hrishikesh Joshi from Baner area said, “Most of the parents in our society did not allow kids to come down and burst crackers. Usually every year there is a huge rush in the evening.” Sachin Limaye from Padmavati area said, “In our 20-flat society, every year almost all residents used to burst crackers, but this time hardly one or two families did so. After Laxmi pujan, some more burst crackers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/less-firecrackers-this-year-on-laxmipujan/story-YEnEjeSiMJuldg1C6qRtjO.html

The proposal mentions that the hospital will have 100 isolation beds including 20 ICU beds and ventilators.”“We have a plot identified for the same near Golibar Maidan but we are awaiting a response from the ministry,” he said.As of Friday, out of the 3.30 lakh Covid-19 positive cases reported in the district, 6,388 are from the three cantonment boards including Pune, Khadki and Dehu road cantonment boards.Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, PCB, said, “We had sent a proposal for the release of funds under the PM funds for the project months ago. We have been following up on the issue including MP Girish Bapat but we are yet to receive any official approval for the same.”Currently, Naidu hospital is the only infection control hospital in the city which was also the first in the state to treat Covid-19 patients. However, the facility did not have any ventilators or ICU before the pandemic. With another infection control hospital in the city, it would reduce the load on PMC hospitals and make more beds accessible to patients living in cantonment areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/100-bed-infection-control-hospital-to-be-set-up-in-pcb/story-gEREcqvYkxkUPxOSLiNpaK.html

15-11-2020||Pune||Yourspace: ‘Do not let down guard against Covid-19’||It has been almost eight months that we all are battling the pandemic and every day there is a new challenge. Though the cases have reduced the authorities have warned of a possible second wave. As a doctor, the only thing which is most evident is that the fear is slowly turning into negligence. With diminishing awareness regarding the basic guidelines to curb Covid-19, people might overlook the reality that cases have just reduced and not eradicated. And thus, amid the festive season, it is important to act responsibly and follow all required precautions. One should adopt all precautions into day-to-day life which is a new normal. -Dr Sabiha SaudagarWay of life should change and not put on holdThe way of life must change, not put on hold completely, to fight the virus. It makes no sense to restrict people by starving them while trying to save them from the disease. Instead, the government and administration is expected to empower us with measures to carry day-to-day activities with necessary precautions. Closing down everything will make no sense. Protocols given by the civic bodies should be strictly followed.-Shreyas BagalEase restrictions, but follow precautionsIf people follow all safety precautions then reopening public and religious places and common areas won’t be an issue. Following safety protocols is the only way to fight the pandemic. The three basic rules to follow are wearing a face mask, follow social distancing norms and wash hands frequently. Sadly, many people are not following the norms which is a cause of worry.-Ravindra Kadam Public places should remain closeGovernment is easing restrictions in a phase-wise manner, but politicians and people are behaving impatiently and taking the virus for granted. People can be seen flouting safety norms and some are not even wearing a face mask and behaving irresponsibly. At shops and markets, people wear a face mask but remove it while talking to vendors or shopkeepers. I think the government should be strict with such people and not open all public places. -Jayashree Patil Take responsibility for yourselfGovernment and civic bodies are undertaking surveys and creating awareness among masses about the pandemic, but people are not serious and behave irresponsibly. It is high time people behave responsibly. The government should not only provide free treatment but also punish those who fail to follow norms.Ranjan Somani Authorities must ensure residents follow normsHumans are social beings and can’t remain isolated for a longer period. Many people face Emotional and psychological trauma as they are isolated inside their houses, some even stay alone here. Pubic places must be open in a phase-wise manner and people should follow safety norms and authorities should make sure the protocols are followed.-Vidya GadgilThis is not a simple flu Many people have preconceived notion about the virus and think is it just the normal flu and almost everyone recovers. The Sars-Cov-2 virus is a threat for those who are at risk and already suffer from comorbidity. So to keep our family and friends save we have to follow safety norms. At public places like tea stalls, eateries people behave in an irresponsible way which is not a good thing. -Vinod Sawant Behave responsiblyIf citizens follow all safety precautions the restrictions at public places can be eased. many people step out to buy groceries, milk and medicines but fail to follow norms. The civic bodies are taking enough steps to create awareness among masses but at the end of the day it the responsibility of each one of us to be safe and make sure the people around us are safe.-Yogita KelkarFight pandemic with precautionsWhat is the harm in keeping public places open when citizens are visiting in malls, theatres and markets I am of the view that instead of imposing strict lockdown, the civic authorities must focus on creating awareness about safety norms. The economy should keep running so we must step out, but with care.-Satyajit Dev||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/yourspace-do-not-let-down-guard-against-covid-19/story-0cij9oLpkgR34BXRp9pu8L.html
15-11-2020||City||Panth must stand with farmers against Centre’s laws: Akal Takht||Amritsar Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Saturday asked the Khalsa Panth (the core section of Sikh community) to stand with the farmers agitating against farm laws introduced by BJP-led union government.Delivering his customary ‘sandesh’ (message) on Saturday to the community from the Darshani Deori of the Golden Temple on Diwali, which is celebrated at the holiest Sikh shrine on a grand scale, he said, “We are celebrating the Bandi Chhod Diwas, when Indian farmers are in the battle field to secure their rights. The Khalsa Panth witnesses the development in which Baba Banda Singh Bahadur made people, the owners of the land they tilled, over 300 years ago.” He also claimed that incumbent rulers were making efforts to ensure control of the capitalists over farmers, their land and produce.“On Bandi Chhod Diwas, the Khalsa Panth should not only assure the victimised, including farmers and labourers that it stands with them, but also come to the fore to fight for the cause of their agitation,” the jathedar added.Giani Harpreet Singh added, “Every Sikh, especially our youth, should realise his duties. This realisation becomes necessary when drive of discrimination and oppression has been intensified in the country, once again, on the pretext of killing natural diversity in terms of religion, language, politics, economy, education and culture. When all citizens especially minorities, scheduled castes and tribal people are being deprived of exercising the right to freedom of speech and expression.”He continued, “When dissenting voices are being suppressed using the high-handedness of political power. When instances are increasing, in a worrisome manner, of putting ordinary citizens, including intellectuals, behind bars by introducing new draconian laws. When Sikh prisoners are being jailed for the past five years.”He also congratulated the community for helping the needy in times of covid-19 outbreak during which many people lost their livelihoods. Takht Patna Sahib jathedar Giani Ranjit Singh, Takht Kesgarh Sahib jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh, Golden Temple head granthi Giani Jagtar Singh, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal, Damdami Taksal chief Harnam Singh Khalsa and Budha Dal chief Baba Balbir Singh also addressed the devotees.Dhian Singh Mand, Sarbat Khalsa-appointed acting (parallel) jathedar of the Akal Takht, also came to the Golden Temple with his supporters including Jarnail Singh Sakhira and Harbir Singh Sandhu of the SAD (Amritsar) and other Sikh activists to deliver his sandesh, but police restricted his entry to the shrine, citing the possibility of clash between them and the SGPC staff inside. After being denied entry, they sat outside the shrine for half an hour and then Mand delivered his sandesh.As per tradition, Nihang organisations also gathered at the Akal Takht to observe the Bandi Chhod Diwas in large numbers, carrying long traditional weapons. The festival was celebrated with religious fervour with the entire shrine complex being illuminated. Candles and earthen lamps were lighted on the bank of the sarovar (holy tank).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panth-must-stand-with-farmers-against-centre-s-laws-akal-takht/story-WjBbQUrJ41GQMWONBwKFVJ.html
15-11-2020||Kolkata||‘Lost a family member’: Satyajit Ray’s son pays tribute to Soumitra Chatterjee||Legendary Bengali actor Soumitra Chatterjee died at 12.15 pm at a private hospital in south Kolkata on Sunday, losing a 40-day battle with Covid encephalopathy. He was 85 and is survived by his wife Deepa, who was also an actor, son Sougata and daughter Poulomi Basu. Known for an illustrious career that spanned over 61 years and around 300 films, Chatterjee is best known for playing the protagonist in as many as 14 films made by the legendary Satyajit Ray, a feat no other actor could match. Chatterjee received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1998 and 2011, the Padma Bhusan in 2004 and the National Film Award for acting in 2006. The highest honours, however, came rather late in his life. In 2012, Chatterjee received the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke award and, in 2018, the government of France honoured him with the Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur, (Legion of Honour) the highest civilian award of the country. Gloom descended on the movie industry and among Chatterjee’s countless fans in the country and beyond as the news flashed on television screens. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee rushed to the hospital within 15 minutes of his death. “We lost a gem today. Chatterjee was not just a memorable actor on screen and stage. He took part in many movements for the sake of humanity. Today we lost a part of history,” said the chief minister. “I am extremely grateful to the chief minister, the doctors and all those who took such great care of my father. I would like to ask everybody not to grieve. Let us celebrate his life,” said Chatterjee’s daughter. Chatterjee was admitted in the hospital on October 6 after he tested positive for Covid-19. He tested negative on October 14 but his neurological system was affected by Covid encephalopathy. As a result, Chatterjee’s condition drastically deteriorated. He was in a drowsy state over the past three weeks. His condition deteriorated further on Friday with neurological functions reaching its worst state. On Saturday night, Chatterjee’s organs stopped responding to life support therapy and Dr Arindam Kar, head of the team of doctors that treated Chatterjee, said his revival was nearly impossible. Ray’s son and director Sandip Ray said, “I lost a member of my family. He shared a wonderful chemistry with my father. He gave a lot of thought to the characters my father created. His most favourite role was that of Gangacharan in Ashani Sanket. He was so involved in the project that he even pushed the trolley when there was a shortage in manpower one day.” Also Read: Soumitra Chatterjee, the doyen of Bangla cinema, dies at the age of 85Aparna Sen, Chatterjee’s life-long friend and co-actor, said, “He was my first hero. I was only 14 when we first met. I used to call him uncle at that time. He and his wife were friends of our family. I became his friend too as I grew up. I can’t believe he is no more.” Chatterjee made his debut in 1959 with Apur Sansar (The World of Apu), the third in Ray’s internationally recognised Apu Trilogy, as the husband of another debutant, 15-year-old Sharmila Tagore. Also Read: End of an era: Soumitra Chatterjee, Ray’s all-time favourite protagonist in iconic films will live onReacting to Chatterjee’s death, Tagore told a television channel, “We were hoping that he would recover. I lost a very old friend, a very dear friend and a very loyal friend. He left a legacy. He is associated with Ray but he gave wonderful performances while working with other directors as well. He was a very erudite person. I remember listening to him and actor Subhendu Chatterjee as they discussed politics and literature for hours when we were shooting in the outdoor location for Ray’s Aranyer Din Ratri.” Chatterjee’s body will be taken to his home in Golf Green and the Technician Studio in Tollygunge before the last rites are performed at the Keoratala crematorium on Sunday evening. The state government will honour him with a gun salute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/soumitra-chatterjee-loses-40-day-battle-with-covid-encephalopathy/story-c8EfKTecUu8wZx0wnV04GK.html
15-11-2020||Lucknow||UP cities violate cracker ban resulting in poor AQI and low visibility||Despite a government ban on crackers in some Uttar Pradesh cities, especially those near Delhi, residents couldn’t resist bursting firecrackers during Diwali on Saturday, resulting in poor Air Quality Index (AQI) level and low visibility the next morning.Moreover, the debris of firecrackers and other festival paraphernalia were seen littered across the cities like Lucknow, Varanasi, Moradabad, and Kanpur on Sunday.In wake of the increasing pollution levels, the Uttar Pradesh government has banned the sale or use of firecrackers in Muzaffarnagar, Agra, Varanasi, Meerut, Hapur, Ghaziabad, Kanpur, Lucknow, Moradabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Baghpat, and Bulandshahr till November end.Despite this, unabated fireworks took place on Diwali night.The Air Quality Index in the Lalbagh area of Lucknow was recorded at 396 (very poor), as per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Kanpur’s Nehru Nagar recorded an AQI of 328 (very poor), as per CPCB.Meanwhile, the residents questioned the cracker ban.“What good did the government ban on firecrackers bring? It was of no use. Lots of firecrackers were burst, emitting a lot of pollutants. During the morning walk today, I faced some difficulties. Then what is the point of this ban,” asked a resident of Kanpur.Another local resident said despite the ban, people managed to buy firecrackers. “Had the government ensured proper implementation of the ban, the situation would have been different. My question is how come the crackers were burst despite the ban?”Akash from Moradabad echoed: “Lots of firecrackers were burst on the night of Diwali. I came out for a morning walk today, and I am having trouble breathing because of the pollution and smog.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-cities-violate-cracker-ban-resulting-in-poor-aqi-and-low-visibility/story-O9iCtNkC2MVfjRfQ3Bxs8O.html

Her throat and abdomen were cut wide and many of the organs were said to be missing, said police.It was being investigated whether the girl was sacrificed for exorcism or killed for some other reason.DIG Kanpur Dr Preetinder Singh said the angle of human sacrifice and old enmity were being investigated and some persons have been detained in the case.“Forensics team was on the site, collecting all the evidence; we can’t say anything at this point of time but are investigating it threadbare; sacrifice and old enmity is part of the investigation,” he said.The victim’s father Karan Kureel had informed the police about his daughter going missing on Saturday night. She was last seen with a local youth who had taken her to buy crackers around 6 pm.While the villagers claimed the police were indifferent to their complaint, the police said its men were part of the search mounted by the villagers in the night. There were announcements made from the local mosque and the temple to help find her. But the efforts did not yield results and Shreya could not be traced.Also Read: Crocodile with fish hook stuck in mouth rescued in Uttar PradeshThis morning around 7 am, her body was found in a field owned by a local farmer Gannu, close to Maa BhadraKali temple.

15-11-2020||City||Mumbai Police’s EOW registers 2 FIRs against Cox & Kings for “duping” Axis Bank, firm of ₹1,582 crore||The economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police has registered two fresh first information reports (FIRs) against global tours and travel company Cox & Kings (CNK) as well as its group company Ezeego One Travels for allegedly duping Axis Bank and a private investment company of Rs1,582 crore. CNK has been booked for payment default, cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust, falsification of documents and criminal conspiracy, among other charges, said EOW officers.An EOW officer privy to the probe said that the new cases were first registered at Cuffe Parade and MRA Marg police stations on Friday and was later transferred to EOW.On behalf of Axis Bank, its vice-president Prakash Prabhakara Rao filed a complaint against CNK at Cuffe Parade police station. Nine people – Ajay Peter Kerkar (CEO and group director of CNK); Urrshila Kerkar, Pessey Patel, ABM Good, Anil Khandelwal, Mahalinga Narayanan, Arup Sen, Manisha Amblapurkar and Nilu Singh – have been made accused in this case.“Axis Bank in their complaint has told the police that CNK had taken several loans from them under the company’s name and diverted the funds to suspicious bank accounts. Because of such misappropriation of funds, CNK and Ezeego jointly owe Axis Bank a total of Rs1,030 crore. They caused wrongful losses to the bank,” an officer who is part of the probe said.Meanwhile, Kerkar has refuted all the allegations against him and termed them baseless and frivolous. He said he has lodged a counter FIR against Axis Bank. “The allegations made in our FIR are being probed by the EOW. In the FIR, we have clearly revealed the modus operandi of Axis Bank. We have provided definite proof of collusion of Axis Bank officials to divert money from Cox and Kings and Ezeego to other companies,” said Kerkar, adding, “It is clear that this is simply a counterblast to divert the attention from their obvious crime and mislead the media.”In the second FIR at MRA Marg police station, Kerkar, Urrshila, Ezeego company and other individuals were booked after Dinesh Goel, director of Investment Opportunities IV Pte Ltd – an investment company incorporated under the laws of Singapore and its investment advisor SSG Capital Management (Singapore) Pte Ltd – approached the police alleging misappropriation of funds. Documents pertaining to the probe in possession with HT indicate that in October 2018 Goel was approached by Kerkar with a request for loans for CNK’s offshore subsidiaries, Prometheon Enterprises Limited (PEL) and its offshore subsidiary Prometheon Holdings UK Limited (PHUK). The loan was reportedly sought to repay the loans of CNK in India, as the travel company did not have any borrowing capacity.Axis Bank has refused to comment on the matter. On October 15, 2018, Kerkar, in a meeting with Goel at Fort, reportedly told the latter that only Rs1,850 crore was outstanding for CNK to avail the loan from the complainant company. This had been subsequently admitted by Kerkar in his documents filed in the United Kingdom under oath and is also evident from the multiple financial disclosures of CNK received by the complainant company as part of its financial monitoring.“Kerkar made several representations and false assurances to the complainant and its key persons that he has to repay the said loans in India with foreign-fund loans,” Goel’s complaint stated.Based on the representations and information provided by Kerkar, the complainant made available a short-term loan of 33 million pounds in December 2018 to PEL. This facility was used to transfer amounts to CNK in India for the repayment of its loans in India. Goel has alleged that Kerkar had again misled his company and used the loan amount to avail another loan, worth 50 million Euros for PHUK, under a facilities agreement on March 20, 2019, which was used by CNK to refinance the loan due from PEL.In April 2019, Kerkar again approached Goel seeking another loan. The complainant then provided a loan of $10 million in April 2019 to PHUK under a facilities agreement on April 25, 2019, against a corporate guarantee from CNK of $70 million and a personal guarantee from Kerkar, the police said.Before October 2018, Kerkar, Urrshila and some other unidentified accused, allegedly hatched a criminal conspiracy, and in furtherance of their common intention and mala fide and to deceive and defraud the complainant, co-ordinated and made numerous false representations to Goel to provide loans to CNK Group entities on the basis of a false debt position at CNK, said the police. The intention of the accused persons was dishonest, fraudulent and mala fide at the outset itself and they never had the intention to pay back the said loan amounts. Their acts caused wrongful losses, prima facie worth Rs552 crore to the investment company, the complainant alleged in the FIR.To the allegations made by the investment firm, Kerkar said, “This is an entity controlled by SSG. I have accused them of colluding with the key management personnel of Cox and Kings to transfer our assets to themselves illegally. A further point is that all the foreign companies mentioned in the FIR are companies which the Investment Opportunities Fund IV/SSG are a partner and had board representations. He also claimed that it is the investment company which caused losses and he is the victim in the case.This is the fourth FIR against CNK filed by the EOW. Earlier, the agency had booked Kerkar, along with the other directors and senior executives of CNK on complaints filed by Kotak Mahindra Bank and IndusInd Bank for allegedly duping them of Rs170 crore and Rs284 crore, respectively. The banking fraud unit-2 of EOW is investigating all the four FIRs against CNK.Earlier, Kerkar had refuted to the allegations made by Kotak Mahindra Bank and IndusInd Bank too, and had termed them baseless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-police-s-eow-registers-2-firs-against-cox-kings-for-duping-axis-bank-firm-of-1-582-crore/story-AJkSzpvFLtEp6MgO3XE2FO.html
15-11-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 forces life of shoe shiners in Mumbai off track||Shoe shiners have been a fixture at railway stations almost since the inception of the city’s suburban railways in 1853. More than 1,000 shoe shiners earned their living at Mumbai’s suburban railway stations until train services were shut down during the lockdown.Ramkishan Mehra, chairman of Maharashtra Railway Bootpolice Kamgar (MRBK), said of shoe shiners, “All of them have gone back to their villages as there they would at least not starve to death.” Mehra said MRBK has written to the Railways, asking shoe shiners be allowed to return to stations since some train services have now resumed. Surendra Ram, 55, used to sit at Wadala station. “For the first time in 20 years, I don’t have a job, I have no income and odd jobs are also difficult to come by. So I have started selling vegetables at a local market.” Ram and his family left Mumbai in May and walked to Ram’s village near Aurangabad. It took them 10 days. The move has thrown Ram’s children’s education into jeopardy. Ram’s son and three daughters were enrolled in schools in Mumbai. “I took them to Mumbai so that they could have a decent education. Now I don’t know how their future will shape up because I do not have any money left. My savings have been wiped out and I will have to discontinue their education,” Ram said.Jayprakash Ram, 42, used to sit at Kurla station. He and his family stayed in Mumbai till May. “We were running short on money, on groceries. There were days when my wife, two daughters and son slept hungry, and that is when I decided to head back to my village. Here at least I have the basics,” said Jayprakash, who is now back in his village in Bihar’s Bhojpur district. He now earns a living by doing odd jobs that fetch him between Rs 200 and Rs 250 daily.Dyanchand Bhimshankar, 56, used to be a shoe shiner at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. He left the city to return to his village in Bihar, in May, when special trains were organised for labourers. “I haven’t had a job since lockdown. All I know is that I want to get back to work,” he said. In addition to polishing shoes, shoe shiners are also an important part of the city police’s information network. A senior Mumbai Police officer requesting anonymity said, “A shoe shiner from Mumbai Central railway station alerted us to a gangster wanted for at least four murder cases. The gangster’s arrest would not have been possible but for the timely tip from shoe shiner.”Shyam Yadav, a shoe shiner at Andheri station, said “We do not forget faces and know how to identify suspicious characters. Once we spot something fishy, we immediately alert the Government Railway Police (GRP). Our job is to keep our ears and eyes open and to protect the commuters while also shining shoes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-forces-life-of-shoe-shiners-in-mumbai-off-track/story-ENB0Xo2yHS0DDTJcMWO3OP.html
15-11-2020||Mumbai||Coastal road: Mumbai civic body pays ₹150.33 crore for marine biodiversity conservation||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is building the coastal road in south Mumbai, has deposited ₹150.33 crore funds required for the conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity as per specific conditions under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance. BMC, however, has revised the total construction cost and reduced the applicable funds for marine biodiversity conservation by 31%. According to CRZ clearance granted in May 2017, the civic body had to pay 2% (₹254 crore) of the total cost of the project (₹12,721 crore) to the Mangrove Foundation — an autonomous society that assists the state government in marine conservation — on or before commencement of work in December 2018. “The total project cost computed by the mangrove cell was not correct. The actual project construction cost is ₹8,429 crore along with some additional costs taking the complete tally to around ₹8,750 crore. So, as per CRZ condition, all approvals have been received to pay 2% (₹175 crore) to the Mangrove Foundation. Of this, ₹25 crore was paid last year, and now the final fund transfer of ₹150 crore is underway,” said a senior BMC official in-charge of the project, requesting anonymity. Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell) and executive director, Mangrove Foundation, said, “We have received an official intimation from BMC that they have processed ₹150.33 crore. The funds will be kept in fixed deposits as per the Foundation’s mandate. The interest earned will be utilised for improving coastal and marine biodiversity of Mumbai and Thane regions, research projects, and to build awareness among citizens.” The 9.9-km-long road aims to connect Princess Street flyover in south Mumbai to the Worli-end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link and cut short travel time between south Mumbai and western suburbs by 70%. The submission of funds comes after a delay of two years. HT had, on November 3, reported that Tiwari had requested the environment department to ensure that conditions under CRZ clearance are complied with before considering fresh amendments proposed by BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coastal-road-mumbai-civic-body-pays-150-33-crore-for-marine-biodiversity-conservation/story-mWPPkAqbgjXLj3neG0xRqL.html
15-11-2020||Mumbai||Change in weather factors may keep air pollution lower than expected in Mumbai post-Diwali: SAFAR||With Mumbai recording the hottest day this season so far on Saturday, the city is expected to witness marginally lower air pollution after Diwali owing to change in weather factors such as hotter conditions and rise in wind speed, said an official at the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the city, recorded day temperature at 36 degrees Celsius, 2.4 degrees Celsius above normal. Colaba, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 35 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees Celsius above normal. Meanwhile, air pollution levels fell to ‘moderate’ category on Saturday, the day of Diwali, as opposed to a prediction of ‘poor’ air quality. Air quality index (AQI) for all pollutants on Saturday was 111 (moderate) with PM2.5 levels in the satisfactory category at 54 microgrammes per cubic metre (µg/m3) against the safe limit of 60 µg/m3, and AQI for PM10 at 98 (satisfactory).SAFAR published a revised air quality forecast for Sunday stating, “A positive development is that the prevailing temperature is not as cooler as expected. Also increase in wind speed may bring relief for Mumbai, and AQI is going to be towards the lower end of the ‘very poor’ category in a 50% firecrackers (half of the average emissions from firecrackers in 2016-2018) scenario. In case of no firecracker emissions, AQI is likely to remain steady and within ‘poor’ category.”The most polluted areas are expected to be Chembur, Mazagaon, and Malad on Sunday. On Saturday, not a single location in Mumbai recorded ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’ air. Bhandup and Navi Mumbai had the cleanest air.“The highest levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are expected between 1am to 4am between Saturday night and Sunday morning. Air quality will start to improve from Monday,” SAFAR said.In contrast to the previous AQI prediction at 338 (very poor), which would have been the worst post-Diwali air quality in six years, SAFAR’s revised forecast said AQI was expected to be 309 (very poor) on Sunday and 267 (poor) on Monday with 50% cracker emissions, and 227 (poor) on Sunday and 203 (poor) on Monday with no crackers. SAFAR categorises AQI levels from 0-50 as good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate, 201-300 is poor, 301-400 is very poor, and above 401 is severe.Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR said, “When temperature and wind speed is low, pollutant particles get suspended closer to the surface, but in this case, current weather factors can allow slight increase in pollutant particle dispersion.”According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the wind direction changed from cooler northeasterly winds to warmer easterly to southeasterly winds on Saturday, allowing the rise in temperatures. Wind speed ranged between 11 and 14 km/hour against the average wind speed of 5-6 km/hour over the past three days. The minimum temperature on Saturday increased to 22 degrees Celsius (a degree Celsius above normal) from 19.6 degrees Celsius on Friday in the suburbs while south Mumbai recorded a 1 degree Celsius rise from Friday to 24 degrees Celsius on Saturday.SAFAR also predicted that the concentration of PM2.5 on Sunday would be over twice the safe limit if firecrackers were used. Against the safe limit of 60µg/m3, Mumbai could record 132 µg/m3 on Sunday with 50% firecracker emissions and 98 µg/m3 with no emission from firecrackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/change-in-weather-factors-may-keep-air-pollution-lower-than-expected-in-mumbai-post-diwali-safar/story-mG9u6C4kdzleaYr0QWrSHI.html
15-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra education department warns schools against sharing student data to private agencies||The Maharashtra education department has warned schools against sharing the personal data of students to private agencies and coaching classes. In a circular issued recently, the department has stated that schools will face action if complaints of data breach are reported. “During the current situation, as learning has moved online, schools are using various tools for e-learning. For the purpose of online education, schools have collected contact details of students and parents. However, in many cases, this data is shared with private agencies which use it for marketing. Schools should refrain from such practices,” stated the circular. Several parents had complained about receiving calls from different companies trying to market their apps and e-learning solutions. “We trust schools with our personal details but they often breach this trust. Sharing sensitive data of students, including addresses, poses a risk for them. The department should keep a strict watch to stop such activities,” said Anita Tambe, a parent from Navi Mumbai. The education department has also asked schools to use the Diksha app as per the central government’s one nation, one app policy. “Similarly, educational content approved by the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) should only be used for teaching,” the education department’s circular further stated. Meanwhile, the department has also asked schools not to market e-learning applications of private players. “Schools should not indulge in these practices for profiteering,” stated the circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-warns-schools-against-sharing-student-data-to-private-agencies/story-Gos5Av15qiHwbKCj1MZdjK.html
15-11-2020||Mumbai||If Shiv Sena digs graves, we will find your skeletons of corruption: MP Sanjay Raut to BJP||With the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government nearing its first anniversary on November 28, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut taunted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to forget about their “Operation Lotus” to destabilise the three-party alliance government and instead work with them for the people of the state. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress are the other two parties along with Sena that form the MVA. Raut also hit back at BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, who has levelled a series of allegations against the Thackerays in the past few days, saying the latter is not taken seriously by his own party and if the “Sena starts digging old graves, it will unearth skeletons of corruption”. “I don’t think his [Somaiya] party also takes whatever he does seriously. But opposition must criticise. We want a strong opposition party in the state. Those who know Uddhav Thackeray and knew Balasaheb Thackeray will definitely tell you that we never stifle or suppress the opposition like it is done in other states and by the Centre. He must stop levelling false allegations. If they want to dig old graves, even we can do that. But our outlook is to forget the past and move on. If we keep digging graves, we will find the skeletons of your corruption,” said Raut.BJP was quick to respond to Raut’s jibe, with party leader Pravin Darekar saying the Sena leader should not dare them to open their mouths. “Such language of digging graves is not appropriate. Nobody should challenge in this manner. Even we can talk in the manner Sanjay Raut talks,” said Darekar.Speaking to the media on eve of Diwali, Raut said the Thackeray government faced several challenges, both natural and man-made, during its first year, but chief minister Uddhav Thackeray crossed the hurdles.“Several unholy attempts were made to destabilise the government, but none were successful... Nobody in the state has any doubt that the Uddhav Thackeray-led government will complete its full term and that he will remain the chief minister,” said the Sena MP.However, Darekar, the leader of opposition in the legislative council, slammed the Sena-led government over its performance in the first year. “Sanjay Raut said they have completed a year, but what have they done. They have not fulfilled the word given to the farmers... They have not been able to control Covid-19,” said Darekar. “Who talked about Operation Lotus? BJP never spoke. They fear that their government will collapse but they are challenging us to do so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/if-shiv-sena-digs-graves-we-will-find-your-skeletons-of-corruption-mp-sanjay-raut-to-bjp/story-bzmQVzOSUBFYeogLqyFI3H.html

The Delhi government conducted 49,645 cases on Friday, according to Delhi government’s Covid-19 bulletin, as compared to 56,553 tests on Thursday and 60,229 tests on Wednesday.Delhi also reported 96 deaths due to Covid-19, taking the total toll of the viral infection in the city to over 7,500. As of Saturday, 7,519 people had died of the infection in Delhi.Watch how India celebrated Diwali 2020 amid pandemic“The increase in the number of deaths is not unexpected. There is always a lag between the spike in the number of cases and deaths. It’s the time between people getting diagnosed, hospitalised, and dying,” said Dr Rajinder K Dhamija, professor of medicine and head of the department of neurology at Lady Hardinge Medical College.Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia perform ‘Diwali Pujan’ at Akshardham TempleHe further added, “Also, when the denominator -- the number of cases -- is huge, the number of deaths will also be more. But the case fatality ratio continues to be 1.57%.”The case fatality ratio (CFR) -- proportion of people who died among those who tested positive for the infection -- however remained at 1.56%.Experts suspect the number of cases to rise after Diwali.HT Spot Check: Delhi markets burst at the seams“There was a slight dip in numbers, but it is too soon to say whether the infections have peaked. In fact, I think that it isn’t even a true decline. With Diwali around the corner, fewer people are likely to go get tested, and tomorrow many labs would also not work. We will see an increase on Monday again,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director, department of pulmonology and sleep disorders at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh.Hospitals across Delhi are running out of intensive care unit (ICU) beds as the city experiences its third surge in the number of Covid-19 cases.Almost 88% of the total ICU beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 remained occupied as of Saturday night, according to the government’s Delhi Corona app.The number of beds are likely to increase from the current 3,484 ICU beds -- with and without ventilators -- after the high court allowed the Delhi government order to reserve 80% ICU beds in 33 major private hospitals. The Delhi government wrote to the Centre for 300 additional ICU beds for its hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-records-7-340-new-covid-19-cases-despite-conducting-fewer-tests-death-toll-crosses-7-500/story-WGBAHEooGoLi6LH3gr4rPL.html
15-11-2020||Mumbai||After classes, school admissions in Mumbai move online||With the Covid-19 outbreak, school admissions in the city this year are going digital with everything from application forms to school tours being done virtually. Most private schools in Mumbai begin the admissions process between December and February for the following academic year. While state board schools reopen in June, most schools following the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) and International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) begin their new academic year in April. “Last year, we had organised an orientation for all parents where their queries could be addressed and they could see the school at the same time. This time however, due to the current situation, we have decided to schedule this online. We’ll keep the entire admission process online,” said Rohan Bhat, chairperson, Children’s Academy Group of schools which runs schools in Kandivli and Malad. At Orchids - The International schools, parents have been given time slots to choose from and they can access the school’s online classes through the web app Zoom. To ensure the child also experiences the teaching methods, a sample material (like a text book or notes) is being sent by email ahead of the class. School tours for parents are also being conducted virtually.“It is understandable since most parents are working from home now, that they may not find the time to attend [classes] during the weekday. For such parents, we give access to weekend hobby classes or the evening extra classes. It helps them understand the kind of help students receive beyond regular teaching,” said Beena Nayaken, principal, Orchids - The International School, Masjid Bunder. Several schools are also offering student and staff testimonials and videos on demand. “We are offering parents videos to get an idea about the school infrastructure and the teaching at our schools. Similarly, we have organised online counselling sessions for students to get admission-related help easily,” said Prajodh Rajan, co-founder and CEO of EuroKids International. Despite these initiatives, schools said some parents still wish to see the school premises in person.“Many parents want to see the infrastructure and other things so we allow them to come on a designated day after adhering to all the safety protocols,” said Bhat.Some parents who had earlier planned to change their children’s schools are now considering postponing that move by a year. “I wanted to send my daughter to another school from Class 1 but we have decided to continue with the current school for now. With the scare around the virus, we are anyway not going to send her to school soon. So it makes sense to make the switch maybe a year later,” said Shraddha Atrey, a Nerul-based parent. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-classes-school-admissions-in-mumbai-move-online/story-MLGQb2PZIZtp9hNiyi9H9H.html

The remarks caused a political row in India, with the Congress party defending its leader. Speaking to reporters in Mumbai on Saturday, Raut said, “A foreign politician cannot give such opinions on Indian political leaders. We won’t say Trump is mad or Obama was a weak president. Nobody should make such remarks against any leader, whether it is Modi or Amit Shah or Rahul Gandhi. How much does Obama know about this nation?”Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are in a coalition government in Maharashtra.

Nerul had a large number of active cases since the start of pandemic due to which it still shows a high number of active cases. Nerul has a mix of urban and gaothan areas. The higher number of active cases is among the gaothan residents wherein the community stays very close to each other. The fishermen are also in large numbers in Nerul and since they are exposed to the markets, their community was also infected. Shivaji Nagar and Shiravane are congested areas with the latter also being a market area.”The number of deaths is maximum at Koparkhairane and Airoli with 143 each while the least is at Digha with 41 cases. Even as Digha comprises only 4.44 per cent deaths in the whole of Navi Mumbai, the fatality rate is the highest in the ward with 3.15 per cent. While Nerul accounts for 14.63 per cent of the total deaths, the fatality rate is the lowest at 1.67 per cent.Koparkhairane ward officer Ashok Madhavi said, “We make sure the law and guidelines including social-distancing and using of masks are followed by the residents. Fine is levied on those who don’t follow them. Every time the civic body allows opening of an institution, we make sure that they are following the SOPs provided to them. Tackling the virus medically, isolating the patients and treating the patients are looked after by a team of doctors assigned.”Koparkhairane comprises half the working class in residential societies. At least 30 per cent of the chawls is allotted to mathadi workers and 20 per cent of slums are occupied by labourers.“The maximum number of deceased in Koparkhairane ward comprises people directly and indirectly associated with the APMC market. The market is one of the major hotspots for the infection and most of the traders and mathadi workers reside in Koparkhairane,” a doctor associated with one of the urban health centres in Koparkhairane said.Turbhe is one of the wards with a huge number of slum areas. These include Turbhe store, Turbhe village, Pawane and yet there is currently no active case from the slums. The 143 active cases in Turbhe ward are from the urban areas of the ward including Sanpada, Sector 19 Vashi, Kopri and Juhu village.Dr Kailas Gaikwad, medical officer, Turbhe, said, “In the beginning of the pandemic, the challenge we faced was that no one was ready to listen to us. Not only the illiterate but also the literate believed that Covid was nothing but just a rumour. People would not even get tested. Once, it so happened that a 67-year-old man, who was always at home and never stepped out, succumbed to the virus the day he got admitted. His 23-year-old son, who used to visit the market regularly, was the carrier of the virus. I convinced his son to help us in spreading the awareness. Along with a few NGOs, he visited the slums in Turbhe, spoke to the people. He told them how he lost his father and the same should not happen to anyone and hence getting tested was very important.”Things changed after that in Turbhe.People were convinced that what the civic body was doing was for their own good. Of the three lanes that gave access to enter the slums, two were closed and only one was kept open with 24 hours police surveillance.“The police made sure that people who actually wanted to meet any essential needs were allowed to use the lane. Currently, Turbhe store, Indira Nagar, Pawane slums have no positive cases,” Dr Gaikwad said.He added that the slums in the Turbhe are densely populated due to which the residents have developed immunity now.“The toilets are shared, they are bound to get infected but they don’t turn positive because of the immunity. Whereas, people in urban areas get infected as soon as they come in contact with A Covid positive patient due to lack of immunity,” Dr Gaikwad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/recovery-rate-in-navi-mumbai-better-than-mumbai-civic-body-data/story-oUNxpI3dmFdyfoeq1YH0dK.html

15-11-2020||World||Covid vaccine would begin to be delivered at the “end of this year, beginning of next year”, says one of the vaccine creators||The new Covid vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech would begin to be delivered at the “end of this year, beginning of next year” if everything continued to go well, one of its creators said on Sunday. Last week, BioNTech and co-developers Pfizer said preliminary analysis showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90 per cent of people from getting Covid-19. About 43,000 people took part in tests.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Prof Ugur Sahin, co-founder and CEO of BioNTech, told the BBC that the goal was to deliver more than 300 million doses worldwide by next April, which “could allow us to only start to make an impact”. He said the bigger impact would happen later, adding: “Summer will help us because the infection rate will go down in the summer and what is absolutely essential is that we get a high vaccination rate until or before autumn/winter next year.” If everything continued to go well, he said, the vaccine would begin to be delivered at the “end of this year, beginning of next year”.Sahin said he was confident the vaccine would reduce transmission between people as well as stop symptoms developing in someone who has had the vaccine.It was possible, he said, the vaccine could halve transmission which would have a big impact.“I’m very confident that transmission between people will be reduced by such a highly effective vaccine - maybe not 90 per cent but maybe per cent - but we should not forget that even that could result in a dramatic reduction of the pandemic spread,” he added.He said this winter would still be hard as the vaccine would not have a big impact on infection numbers.Globally over 54,068,000 confirmed cases have been reported. The highly contagious disease, which emerged first in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has killed more than 1,313,000.The US is the worst-hit nation with more than 10,908,000 confirmed cases and 245,600 deaths, according to latest figures from Johns Hopkins University.The UK is expected to get 10 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered. The jab, which was trialled in six countries, is given in two doses, three weeks apart.Older residents and staff in care homes are likely to be prioritised, followed by health workers and the over-80s. People would then be ranked by age, the BBC report said.Asked if the vaccine was as effective in older people as it is in younger people, he said he expected to have a better idea in the next three weeks.He said it was not yet known how long immunity would last after the second dose of the vaccine is given.However, he said, a booster immunisation “should not be too complicated” if it was found immunity was reduced significantly after one year.Sahin also said the “key side effects” of the vaccine seen so far were a mild to moderate pain in the injection site for a few days, while some participants had a mild to moderate fever over a similar period.“We did not see any other serious side effects which would result in pausing or halting of the study,” he added.His vaccine is one of 11 that are currently in the final stages of testing. “Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19,” said Dr Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO said on November 9. “With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” Bourla said in a statement. “The first interim analysis of our global Phase 3 study provides evidence that a vaccine may effectively prevent Covid-19. This is a victory for innovation, science and a global collaborative effort,” said Sahin last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-would-begin-to-be-delivered-at-the-end-of-this-year-beginning-of-next-year-says-one-of-the-vaccine-creators/story-k9NiHS9sWMBCLHpSRSk7fI.html
15-11-2020||World||Donald Trump admits Joe Biden ‘won’, but insists US election was ‘rigged’||US President Donald Trump on Sunday acknowledged for the first time that Joe Biden, the president-elect, has “won” the 2020 election, starting a process that could possibly lead to a full-fledged concession.“He won because the Election was Rigged,” Trump wrote in a tweet, and went on to repeat his allegations of election fraud and irregularities that have found no traction outside his support base, have failed to stand up in courts and have been debunked by top election security officials of his own administration.“I concede NOTHING!” Trump added, however. “We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!”Trump has refused to concede the election, which Biden has won by securing 306 electoral college votes, matching Trump’s 2016 winning haul that he had called a “landslide”. Biden, the president-elect, has also beaten the Republican incumbent in popular votes by more than 5 million.Trump has not only refused to concede, he has also blocked Biden and his team from receiving intelligence briefings, cooperation and information from agencies as part of a transition process that has been honored and respected by outgoing Republican and Democratic administrations.Asked if Trump’s tweet was “step one” of a concession, Biden’s chief of staff Ronald Klain said on NBC’s Meet the Press show, “I accept it as a further confirmation of the reality that Joe Biden won the election.”On the same programme, Asa Hutchinson, the Republican governor of Arkansas, a state that Trump won, welcomed the president’s tweet. “It was good actually to see President Trump tweet out that (Biden) won. I think that’s the start of an acknowledgment,” he said.A growing number of Republicans, conservative pundits and media organisations have been calling for Trump to accept defeat, concede gracefully, facilitate a smooth transition of power, and leave office without further tarnishing his legacy with his unfounded allegations.Spurred by Trump’s allegations of election fraud and irregularities, thousands of his supporters - including white nationalists such as “Proud Boys” - rallied in Washington, DC on Saturday, chanting slogans such as “stop the steal”, inspired by his claims that he had won election and that it was stolen from him.The US president’s cavalcade drove past cheering supporters on his way to his golf course in the adjoining state of Virginia. He smiled and waved at them, but did not stop or make remarks as he had said he might.Tensions flared and violence broke out between Trump supporters and counter-protesters. The clashes intensified later in the evening as invectives were exchanged, punches were thrown and water bottles were hurled. At least 20 people were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-admits-joe-biden-won-but-insists-us-election-was-rigged/story-MsAnk0PPWdwCp6XdVClxaN.html
15-11-2020||World||US, Israel worked together to track and kill al-Qaida No. 2||The United States and Israel worked together to track and kill a senior al-Qaida operative in Iran earlier this year, a bold intelligence operation by the two allied nations that came as the Trump administration was ramping up pressure on Tehran.Four current and former US officials said Abu Mohammed al-Masri, al-Qaida’s No. 2, was killed by assassins in the Iranian capital in August. The U.S. provided intelligence to the Israelis on where they could find al-Masri and the alias he was using at the time, while Israeli agents carried out the killing, according to two of the officials. The two other officials confirmed al-Masri’s killing but could not provide specific details.Al-Masri was gunned down in a Tehran alley on Aug. 7, the anniversary of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Al-Masri was widely believed to have participated in the planning of those attacks and was wanted on terrorism charges by the FBI.Al-Masri’s death is a blow to al-Qaida, the terror network that orchestrated the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S, and comes amid rumors in the Middle East about the fate of the group’s leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The officials could not confirm those reports but said the U.S. intelligence community was trying to determine their credibility.Two of the officials — one within the intelligence community and with direct knowledge of the operation and another former CIA officer briefed on the matter — said al-Masri was killed by Kidon, a unit within the secretive Israeli spy organization Mossad allegedly responsible for the assassination of high-value targets. In Hebrew, Kidon means bayonet or “tip of the spear.”The official in the intelligence community said al-Masri’s daughter, Maryam, was also a target of the operation. The U.S. believed she was being groomed for a leadership role in al-Qaida and intelligence suggested she was involved in operational planning, according to the official, who like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.Al-Masri’s daughter was the widow of Hamza bin Laden, the son of al-Qaida mastermind Osama bin Laden. He was killed last year in a U.S. counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.The news of al-Masri’s death was first reported by The New York Times.Both the CIA and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, which oversees the Mossad intelligence agency, declined to comment.Israel and Iran are bitter enemies, with the Iranian nuclear program Israel’s top security concern. Israel has welcomed the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iranian nuclear accord and the U.S. pressure campaign on Tehran.At the time of the killings, the Trump administration was in the advanced stages of trying to push through the U.N. Security Council the reinstatement of all international sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the nuclear agreement. None of the other Security Council members went along with the U.S., which has vowed to punish countries that do not enforce the sanctions as part of its “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran.Israeli officials are concerned the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden could return to the nuclear accord. It is likely that if Biden does engage with the Iranians, Israel will press for the accord to be modified to address Iran’s long-range missile program and its military activity across the region, specifically in Syria and its support for groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad.The revelations that Iran was harboring an al-Qaida leader could help Israel bolster its case with the new U.S. administration.Al-Masri had been on a kill or capture list for years. but his presence in Iran, which has a long history of hostility toward al-Qaida, presented significant obstacles to either apprehending or killing him.Iran denied the reports, saying the government is not harboring any al-Qaida leaders and blaming the U.S. and Israel for trying to foment anti-Iranian sentiment. U.S. officials have long believed a number of al-Qaida leaders have been living quietly in Iran for years and publicly released intelligence assessments have made that case.Al-Masri’s death, albeit under an assumed name, was reported in Iranian media on Aug. 8. Reports identified him as a Lebanese history professor potentially affiliated with Lebanon’s Iranian-linked Hezbollah movement and said he had been killed by motorcycle gunmen along with his daughter.Lebanese media, citing Iranian reports, said that those killed were Lebanese citizen Habib Daoud and his daughter Maraym.The deaths of al-Masri and his daughter occurred three days after the catastrophic Aug. 4 explosion at the port of Beirut and did not get much attention. Hezbollah never commented on reports and Lebanese security officials did not report that any citizens were killed in Tehran.A Hezbollah official on Saturday would not comment on al-Masri’s death, saying Iran’s foreign ministry had already denied it.The alleged killings seem to fit a pattern of behavior attributed to Israel in the past.In 1995, the founder of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad was killed by a gunman on a motorcycle in Malta, in an assassination widely attributed to the Mossad. The Mossad also reportedly carried out a string of similar killings of Iranian nuclear scientists in Iran early last decade. Iran has accused Israel of being behind those killings.Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies and former analyst on Iranian affairs in the prime minister’s office, said it has been known for some time that Iran is hiding top al-Qaeda figures. While he had no direct knowledge of al-Masri’s death, he said a joint operation between the U.S. and Israel would reflect the two nations’ close intelligence cooperation, with the U.S. typically stronger in the technical aspects of intelligence gathering and Israel adept at operating agents behind enemy lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-israel-worked-together-to-track-and-kill-al-qaida-no-2/story-K7GA1aiBKWRgawxAFWZwcP.html
15-11-2020||World||Brexit: ‘Crucial’ week ahead as negotiations over trade agreement yet to be finalised||Officials from both sides of the Brexit divide may still be far apart on key issues, but they seem united on one thing -- the coming week is crucial.Negotiations over a trade agreement have already passed a number of informal deadlines, but the two sides remain locked in talks.On Sunday, Britain’s chief Brexit negotiator David Frost said on Twitter that he was back in Brussels for more discussions with his European Union counterpart Michel Barnier. There has been “some progress in a positive direction in recent days,” he said, while cautioning that “we may not succeed.”With Britain’s Dec 31 exit fast approaching, both the UK and the bloc “recognize that time is very short,” Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News’ Ridge on Sunday.“This needs to be a week when things move, when we break through some of these difficult issues, and get a resolution, and at least have some sort of headlines of an agreement,” he said. “Otherwise it gets quite difficult and we do start to run out of time to implement it.”Still, he noted “you can always squeeze out extra time if you need to if you are nearly there.”The issues of state aid and fishing remain as sticking point, Eustice said. While both sides can see what a final agreement would look like, Brussels officials insist that reaching one will require the UK prime minister to move first, a stance their British counterparts reject.Also Read |  UK Prime Minister’s top aide Dominic Cummings quits, will leave by year-endSpeaking on the same program, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said negotiators were running out on time, and “this is move week.”The two sides have “got to make big progress this week,” he said.Even so, a deal may not be ratified if the British government reintroduces parts of the internal market bill struck out by the House of Lords, he said.Peers voted last week to remove the most controversial parts of that bill, which gives ministers the power to unilaterally rewrite parts of the Withdrawal Agreement that Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed with the European Union.The departure of top Johnson aide Dominic Cummings will have no impact on negotiations, Eustice said. Frost also tweeted that he “will not be changing” his position in the coming negotiations.The government will overrule Lords to put back those powers, which in any case would be rendered void by a trade agreement, according to Eustice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-crucial-week-ahead-as-negotiations-over-trade-agreement-yet-to-be-finalised/story-S2IBweSJXDi5V8a5sduFgO.html

15-11-2020||World||Israel pushes for East Jerusalem building before Donald Trump exits White House||Israel is pushing forward with controversial plans to develop a Jewish enclave in a strategic area of East Jerusalem, in the waning days of a Trump administration sympathetic to Israeli settlement activity.On Sunday, the Israel Land Authority solicited bids to build 1,257 apartments in the Givat Hamatos area, a project that was originally approved in 2014 but was delayed over international opposition. The new construction would drive a wedge between the West Bank and East Jerusalem, further cutting off Palestinians’ access to the city and dimming their hopes to establish a state capital in its eastern sector.“It’s been a longstanding red line,” said Amy Cohen, a spokeswoman for the Jerusalem based non-profit group Ir Amim, which seeks a negotiated resolution of the city’s status. “We see this very much in correlation to the imminent change in the US administration.”The project could create strains with the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has gone head-to-head with Israel in the past over building in East Jerusalem, seized from Jordan along with the West Bank during the 1967 Middle East war.Under President Donald Trump, the US has pursued policies uniquely favourable to Israel, including moving its embassy to Jerusalem and deeming Jewish settlements not illegal under international law. This week, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo is expected to visit a West Bank settlement during a visit to the region, something predecessors didn’t do to avoid the perception of legitimizing Israeli construction on captured land.Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh denounced the planned visit, saying “this dangerous precedent legalizes settlements.” A spokesman for President Mahmoud Abbas, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, called the advancement of the Givat Hamatos project “a continuation of the occupation government’s attempts to kill the internationally supported two-state solution.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office had no immediate comment on the project. It could take years to build and because it’s in a preliminary phase can still be stopped.The Givat Hamatos push follows a decision last week to expand another Jewish East Jerusalem enclave called Ramat Shlomo by about 100 new apartments. Building plans for Ramat Shlomo advanced during then-Vice President Biden’s visit to Israel in 2010 caused a diplomatic rift and subsequently led Netanyahu to temporarily and unofficially freeze new construction in East Jerusalem.The Israeli leader says Israel has a right to build anywhere in the city. Its annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 war isn’t internationally recognized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-pushes-for-east-jerusalem-building-before-donald-trump-exits-white-house/story-cuNZxOojCHVRJEddQfc2rO.html
15-11-2020||World||Ethiopian rebels target Eritrea: Here’s what’s going on||Saturday’s missile strike by Ethiopia’s Tigray rebels is a sign that a conflict is brewing between the country’s ethnic minority, who once dominated the national government, and the current government of Nobel Peace Prize winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.“We will fight them (Eriteria) on all fronts with whatever means we have,” Debretsion Gebremichael, the leader of the Tigray region, told AP, and asserted that around 16 Eritrean divisions are fighting in what he termed a “full-scale war”.Who is Aiby Ahmed?Aiby Ahmed, the son of a Christian mother and a Muslim father, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his role as a mediator in the conflict with Eritrea, and in the regional conflict between the neighbouring nations of Sudan, South Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya and Somalia. The conflict comes at a time Ahmed is already battling on several fronts: Ethiopia is engaged in a stand-off with Egypt over a hydroelectric dam in the Nile, the country is fighting a debt-laden economy and a raging Covid-19 pandemic, and people of Ahmed’s Oromo tribe are growing dissatisfied with the lack of progress despite his many promises. Why did the federal government launch airstrikes on the Tigray region?Tigray is the northernmost region of Ethiopia, and home to the Tigrayan people, a politically affluent group, who account for only 6% of the country’s total population.The Tigrayans enjoyed unrestricted access to power in the federal government until the current Prime Minister took office. After fighting the military dictatorship that ruled Ethiopia in the 1970s and 1980s, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), emerged as the leader of the coalition, known as the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, that took power in Ethiopia in 1991. The coalition also consisted of four other parties and was divided along ethnic lines. Anti-government protests against the Democratic Font catapulted Aiby, who belongs to the Oromo ethnic group, to the Prime Minister’s office. Soon, Tigrayan officials were excommunicated from positions of power and Aiby pushed for a national integration under the federal government by reducing autonomy of regional players. This became a bone of contention between the two parties. A year ago, the TPLF withdrew from the ruling coalition after Abiy merged it with the nationwide Prosperity Party. The feud intensified after the TPLF decided to hold its own elections in September, defying the government’s orders of postponing polls due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Ethiopian lawmakers voted to cut funding to the region in October, a move that further enraged Tigray leaders.Following this, Tigray leaders announced the “closure” of their airspace, restricted road movement in the region, and declared that soldiers from the Northern Command of the Ethiopian military had defected and sided with the Tigray people, which the federal government has declared to be untrue. The Ethiopian government declared the regional Tigray government unlawful and TPLF retaliated by announcing it does not recognize Aiby’s administration anymore. In the final act which the International Crisis Group termed a “sudden and predictable” descent into conflict, Aiby announced on November 4 that TPLF had forced a military confrontation by attacking a federal military base in Tigray. The TPLF, in response, has called this a “deliberate concoction” by Aiby’s administration to justify their deployment of armed forces to the northern region. Experts fear a full-blown war between the federal forces and the TPLF, many of whom have fought in the Ethiopian-Eritrean war between 1998 and 2000, would cause serious unrest in the fragile Horn of Africa, impacting neighbours Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, and Sudan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ethiopian-rebels-target-eritrea-here-s-what-s-going-on/story-EMm3zuVkpoGaOhysua4ilL.html

The government in the past couple of years has made its visa policy more flexible, offering longer residencies for certain types of investors, students, and professionals.All holders of doctorate degrees, medical doctors, and also computer, electronics, programming, electrical, and biotechnology engineers are eligible, UAE Vice President and the ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al- Maktoum said in a statementAlso eligible are those with specialised degrees in artificial intelligence, big data, and epidemiology, as well as high school students living in the UAE who rank top in the country and university students with a Grade Point Average(GPA) of 3.8 or higher. After first announcing a long-term visa plan in 2018, the UAE in 2019 started granting 5- and 10-year renewable visas to certain foreign investors, entrepreneurs, chief executives, scientists, and outstanding students.The emirate of Dubai, a Middle East trade and tourism hub, in September said it would grant visas renewable every five years to wealthy foreign retirees.

While restaurants are closed, schools and shops so far remain open.Data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday that the number of confirmed cases in Germany increased by 16,947 to 790,503. Weekend figures tend to be lower as not all data is reported by local authorities.Altmaier said Germany should be wary of relaxing restrictions too quickly.“If we don’t want days with 50,000 new infections, as was the case in France a few weeks ago, we must see through this and not constantly speculate about which measures can be relaxed again,” he told Bild am Sonntag.“All countries that lifted their restrictions too early have so far paid a high price in terms of human lives lost.”His comments echoed those of other leading German policy makers. Among others, Health Minister Jens Spahn said at an online event of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative party on Saturday that hard weeks, possibly even months, lie ahead.The German chairman of the World Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, warned of a possible shortage of beds and staffing problems in German hospitals.“My forecast is that we will have to talk about further restrictions rather than any easing”, he told daily Augsburger Allgemeine.German police fired water cannon during an anti-lockdown rally in Frankfurt on Saturday and eventually broke up the gathering as rules like wearing masks and socially distancing were not observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-economy-minister-warns-of-another-4-5-months-of-severe-covid-19-measures/story-0f6WB6ve9XDuNmdzgVgIJM.html
15-11-2020||World||Palestinians torn as Israel seeks Gulf tourists in Jerusalem||When the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalise relations with Israel, the Palestinians decried the move as a “betrayal” of both Jerusalem, where they hope to establish the capital of their future state, and the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the city’s holiest Muslim site.But with Israel now courting wealthy Gulf tourists and establishing new air links to the major travel hubs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Palestinians in east Jerusalem could soon see a tourism boon after months in which the coronavirus transformed the Holy City into a ghost town.“There will be some benefits for the Palestinian sector of tourism, and this is what I’m hoping for,” said Sami Abu-Dayyeh, a Palestinian businessman in east Jerusalem who owns four hotels and a tourism agency.“Forget about politics, we have to survive.” Palestinian leaders have sharply rejected the recent decisions by the UAE, Bahrain and Sudan to establish ties with Israel because they severely weakened a longstanding Arab consensus that recognition only be extended in return for Palestinian statehood.The Palestinians hope to establish a state including east Jerusalem and the West Bank, territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. Arab support, seen as a key form of leverage in decades of on-again, off-again peace negotiations, now appears to be evaporating, leaving the Palestinians arguably weaker and more isolated than at any point in recent history.In a striking development last week, a delegation of Israeli settlers visited the Emirates to discuss business opportunities. The Palestinians view settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem as the main obstacle to peace, and most of the international community considers them to be illegal.But the prospect of expanded religious tourism could end up benefiting Israelis and Palestinians alike, as wealthy Gulf tourists and Muslim pilgrims from further afield take advantage of new air links and improved relations to visit Al-Aqsa and other holy sites.Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital, and its Jerusalem Municipality is organizing conferences and seminars to help tourism operators market the city to Gulf travellers.Also Read | Israeli military strikes Hamas targets in Gaza after rockets“I’m very excited because I think it opens us up to a new era of Muslim tourism that we never really had,” said Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, the deputy mayor of Jerusalem. “Even though we have peace with Jordan and Egypt, I’ve never really seen any Egyptian tourists or Jordanian tourists because the peace wasn’t a warm peace.” Hassan-Nahoum, who recently visited the Emirates and is a co-founder of the UAE-Israel Business Council, said the municipality is reaching out to local Arab tour operators to ensure the benefits extend to all.“You have mixed feelings,” she said. “Some of them are a little bit suspicious, (but) most of them understand that this is going to be incredibly prosperous for them, because ultimately they’re Arab speaking and so they have, I think, a unique advantage.” Abu-Dayyeh expects up to 28 flights a day arriving in Tel Aviv from Dubai and Abu Dhabi, global travel hubs for long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad, making it easier for travelers from the Far East and South America to reach the Holy Land.He’s confident Palestinian operators will be able to compete. “We’re on the ground here and we’ve been giving this service for many years, for hundreds of years,” he said.Other Palestinians appear to be more skeptical. More than a dozen Palestinian shop owners in Jerusalem’s Old City, which is largely shut down because of the coronavirus, declined to comment on the push for Gulf tourism, saying it was too politically sensitive.There are also concerns that an Israeli push to promote tourism to Al-Aqsa could heighten tensions.The hilltop esplanade in the Old City, home to the Al-Aqsa mosque and the iconic Dome of the Rock shrine, is the third holiest site in Islam. It is also the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the location of the two biblical temples in ancient times.The site is a raw nerve in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and tensions have soared in recent years as religious and nationalist Jews have visited in ever-larger numbers, escorted by the Israeli police.Last month a delegation of Emirati officials visited the site, entering through a gate normally used by Israelis and under an Israeli security escort. A small group of Palestinians heckled them. In August, Palestinian demonstrators burned a portrait of Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan near the Dome of the Rock.Officials from the Waqf, the Jordanian religious body that oversees the mosque compound, declined to comment on Israel’s efforts to promote Gulf tourism to the site, underscoring the political sensitivities.Also Read |  Israel’s settlement movements could test bond with Joe BidenIkrema Sabri, the imam who leads Friday prayers at Al-Aqsa, said any visits must be coordinated with the Waqf so that they do not advance any Israeli claim to sovereignty over the site. The Palestinians have long feared that Israel intends to take over the site or partition it. The Israeli government says it is committed to the status quo.“Any visitor from outside Palestine must coordinate with the Waqf,” Sabri said. “But any visitor from the side of the occupation, we do not welcome or accept them.” He acknowledged that the visiting Emiratis may have been unaware of the complex arrangement and said the heckling was a “reaction” by individuals to them entering with Israeli security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-torn-as-israel-seeks-gulf-tourists-in-jerusalem/story-2GL1TTEzQZ7dzJqu4SqMUN.html
15-11-2020||World||Philippines hit by worst floods in 45 years, typhoon deaths rise||The number of fatalities from the deadliest cyclone to hit the Philippines this year has climbed to 67, while many areas remained submerged in a northern region hit by the worst flooding in more than four decades, officials said on Sunday. President Rodrigo Duterte flew to Tuguegarao province to assess the situation in Cagayan Valley region, which was heavily flooded after Typhoon Vamco dumped rain over swathes of the main Luzon island, including the capital, metropolitan Manila. Twenty-two fatalities were recorded in Cagayan, 17 in southern Luzon, eight in Metro Manila, and 20 in two other regions, said Mark Timbal, the disaster management agency spokesman.Twelve people were still missing and nearly 26,000 houses were damaged by Vamco, he said.“This is the worst flooding that we had in the last 45 years,” Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba said during a briefing with Duterte. “We see that it is worsening every year.”The accumulated effects of weather disturbances and huge volumes of water from a dam affected thousands of families in Cagayan, some of whom had fled to rooftops to escape two-storey high floods.Six cyclones hit the Philippines in a span of just four weeks, including Vamco and Super Typhoon Goni, the world’s most powerful this year.But Mamba also lamented about denuded forests in Cagayan, prompting Duterte to order him to curb logging operations in the province.“We always talk about illegal logging and mining but nothing has been done about it,” Duterte said.Relief and rescue operations continued in Cagayan even as the nearby Magat Dam was still releasing water, two days after releasing a volume equivalent to two Olympic sized pools per second, based on government data.Vamco, the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, also caused the worst flooding in years in parts of the capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-hit-by-worst-floods-in-45-years-typhoon-deaths-rise/story-2Tv2cD9kZUKJCJ1G8CgXaI.html
15-11-2020||World||All you need to know about the RCEP trade pact||The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, was signed virtually on Sunday during the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).Fourteen countries under the initiative of China have formally agreed to form the world’s largest free trade bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity. After 8 long years of negotiations the deal was finally sealed as leaders world over are anxious to nudge their pandemic hit economies back on track. What is RCEP?The RCEP is a trade bloc conceptualised in 2012 that includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. India too was a part of the negotiations but withdrew last year.The bloc encompasses 2.1 billion people, with RCEP’s members accounting for around 30 per cent of the global GDP. Its aim is to lower tariffs, open up trade in services, and promote investment to help economies from Asia to Australia be at par with the rest of the world. It also briefly covers intellectual property, but makes no mention of environmental protections and labour rights.The RCEP was born after former US president Barack Obama announced a multinational trade deal - the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) - that would have excluded China. Why is India not a signatory?Indian pharmaceutical companies were all in favour of the RCEP because they wanted to import generic drugs to China, but fears that cheaper products from China would “flood” the market, and a $50 billion trade deficit with China kept the Indian government from joining.Textile, agriculture, and dairy were three industries that were expected to be hit particularly hard if cheaper goods were readily available in the market. Even though doors have been kept open for India, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) secretary (east) Riva Ganguly Das said at the 17th ASEAN-India virtual summit, “Our position is known. As far as India is concerned, we did not join RCEP as it does not address our outstanding issues and concerns.” Why is China pushing for RCEP?TPP, the largest regional trade accord in history, would have set new terms for trade and business investment among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations. It became a cause for discontent in the United States across party lines, and when Donald Trump took office all plans for TPP were shelved. Obama’s successor started an entrenched trade war with China, abandoning all plans of seeking cooperation with the budding economies of Asia, and hit China with high tariffs. Unable to find a market for its goods, China began to look for consumers within Asia and hence RCEP began to gain prominence.China has an annual surplus of almost $1 trillion, i.e. it sells much more than it buys from other countries. Almost half of that surplus is due to its trade with the US. An entrenched trade war with the US threatens China with dire consequences, no other country can buy as much as the US does. In the first half of 2019, after the trade war began, China’s overall exports to the US declined by 8.5% and rose by only 2.1% with the rest of the world. Faced by a production surplus, China was forced to lower its own high tariffs in May last year. Emphasis was put on labour intensive and low tech industries producing goods which its immediate neighbours would be more interested in buying. This current push to seal the deal on the RCEP comes from China’s anxieties about the policies of US President-elect Joe Biden, who has given no indication that Trump’s China policies would be recalled. The European Union too has been opening its eyes to the atrocities committed by the Chinese Communist Parties in the Xinjiang region. Both Trump and the EU’s push to stop doing business with Chinese military-backed tech companies like Hikvision and Huawei amongst others has added to the communist nation’s anxieties, as it continues to push forward with renewed vigour for a comprehensive trade pact to insulate itself from the storm Beijing knows is coming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-rcep-trade-pact/story-goXyovzVYmDb2ExKz7g6CM.html

Instead, large importing economies are generally powerful, partly as their currencies are directly used in settlements of transactions, he said.China’s exports have stayed largely resilient amid the Covid-19 global pandemic, as strong demand for medical supplies and reduced manufacturing capacity elsewhere worked in its favour.Its exports grew at the fastest pace in 19 months in October, while imports also rose but slower than analyst forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-will-import-over-22-trillion-worth-of-goods-over-the-next-decade-xi-jinping/story-OTf5sheM9JLzruwEXCalFJ.html

There is still very less we know about the disease and the researchers are working day and night to gather more and more information about the viral disease and its cure.In a major win against the Covid-19 researchers have identified that an Arthritis drug can help in reducing the mortality rate in elderly people by 71%. As per the findings, a daily pill of baricitinib along with standard care can reduce the deaths by 71% in Covid-19 patients with moderate or severe infection.The drug is marketed under the name Olumiant and is available for rheumatoid arthritis for only three years now.The latest findings can be encouraging for medics as they are hoping the arthritis drug could help save most vulnerable to coronavirus that are elderly people.The research is led by the researchers in Karolinska Institute in Sweden.As many as 53,945,763 people have been infected by the Covid-19 across the world. Most of the fresh cases were reported from the United States and Europe. While 1,311,427 others have succumbed to the disease.Meanwhile, on vaccine front, US-based pharmaceutical company recently announced that the vaccine, it is developing in joint cooperation with Germany’s BioNTech is 90% effective in preventing infections in the ongoing Phase 3 trials.The findings were based on an interim analysis conducted after 94 participants contracted the illness. The trial will continue until 164 cases have occurred. The preliminary results pave the way for the companies to seek an emergency-use authorization from regulators if further research shows the shot is also safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arthritis-drug-can-reduce-mortality-rate-in-covid-19-patients-by-71-study/story-EHoV7dBtUBU0ao1KwGPYKI.html

This trip will be SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft’s first voyage after NASA certified it for regular flights to the ISS as part of its Commercial Crew Program, following a successful initial test flight on May 31 with two astronauts.Besides being the US space agency’s first commercial launch, the Crew-1 mission is also the first NASA-staffed mission licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The regulator is undertaking responsibility for public safety because the flight is to be carried out by a commercial company, Elon Musk’s SpaceX.The crew has named the spacecraft ‘Resilience’. Hopkins will be the Crew Dragon Commander while Glover the pilot. Both Walker and Noguchi are mission specialists.NASA and SpaceX will use the learnings from the August 2 test flight to make this mission better. The company has bolstered parts of the Dragon’s heat shield, strengthened some areas of the capsule so it can hold out against rougher seas, and fine-tuned so that the landing parachutes deploy at a slightly higher altitude. When the crew returns in the spring of 2021 NASA will ensure a larger flotilla of Coast Guard ships is deployed to keep recreational boaters awayThe four astronauts will remain onboard the ISS and join their three teammates who are already docked there. The four will be replaced in the spring by yet another crew launched by SpaceX..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-s-first-commercial-crew-flight-to-take-off-on-sunday/story-MA4EpRrFl6YpzF2o6HC5IK.html

Hundreds of thousands of pro-Trump protesters marched in the capital city to back the baseless claims of electoral fraud, holding different events like Million MAGA March, the March for Trump and Stop the Steal DC.Small groups of counterprotesters also gathered in different parts of the city to support President-election Joe Biden’s win, leading to clashes with law enforcement and pro-Trump protesters. Taking to Twitter, the US President said that Antifa tried attacking his “innocent” supporters present at the MAGA rally but had to “ran for the hills” because they “aggressively fought back.” “Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!” Trump tweeted.Also Read | Pro-Trump march: Who are ‘Proud Boys’ and ‘Three Percenters’?What is Antifa?According to Merriam-Webster, the first known use of the term ‘Antifa’ was during Nazi Germany and is “borrowed from German Antifa, short for antifaschistisch.” It remains a vaguely defined militant political activist movement which identifies itself as anti-fascist. The members of the far-left group describe themselves as revolutionaries with anti-capitalist and anti-government views. Antifa members use a range of tactics to disrupt the events held by alt-right groups which they deem fascists. They dress in black and the most extreme factions of the far-left movement carry pepper spray, knives, bricks and chains. According to an AOL report, Antifa defends the use of violence to combat the “fascist” forces and call it appropriate tactics against Trump’s “unprecedented levels of surveillance, incarceration, deportations, and police brutality and murders against the US Public”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pro-trump-march-what-is-antifa-that-us-president-accused-of-attacking-his-supporters/story-i4hxfL7LIUfpyZqUiVxz3N.html

The research conducted from October 28 to November 4 while interviewing over 1,000 respondents, revealed that half of the Pakistanis blame the federal government for inflation.Geo News reported that only 15 per cent of the respondents said they blamed previous governments for it, a narrative the PTI and Prime Minister Imran Khan have been attempting to establish since day one in power. Forty-nine per cent held the Centre responsible for the crisis, 17 per cent considered provincial governments responsible while only 8 per cent blamed an unknown mafia. The ratio of those considering the federal government responsible for inflation was the highest (59 per cent) in Balochistan, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 58 per cent, 46 per cent in Punjab and 44 per cent in Sindh.The survey also revealed that price hikes have affected a whopping 97 per cent of the respondents. Ipsos asked respondents whether they are worried about increasing prices to which 88 per cent of respondents said they were.

15-11-2020||World||Pressure mounts on Peru’s president after 2 die in protests||Pressure mounted on Peru’s interim president to resign Sunday after a night of protests in which two people were killed and the country’s political turmoil deepened. At least nine of Manuel Merino’s Cabinet members quit and the president of Congress scheduled an emergency session to discuss the leader’s resignation.The chaotic events came as thousands marched through the streets of Lima wearing masks and carrying signs that read, “Merino is not my president.” Authorities said two men, ages 24 and 25, died from gunshot wounds during the demonstrations.Merino, a little-known politician and rice farmer, rose to Peru’s highest office Monday after the legislature voted to oust former President Martín Vizcarra. Lawmakers utilized a clause dating back to the 19th century to declare the president of “permanent moral incapacity” based on unproven allegations that he’d accepted bribes while serving as governor years ago.Read more | -70° celsius: Deep-freeze hurdle makes Pfizer’s vaccine one for the richAngry Peruvians have taken to the streets ever since in daily demonstrations accusing Congress of staging a parliamentary coup. Merino, who until recently served as the head of Congress, did not immediately respond to the growing calls for his resignation after Saturday’s protests.Earlier Saturday, the embattled leader denied the protests were against him, telling a local radio station that young people were demonstrating against unemployment and not being able to complete their studies amid the coronavirus pandemic. Peru has the world’s highest per-capita Covid-19 mortality rate and has seen one of the region’s worst economic contractions this year. Prime Minister Ántero Flores-Aráoz told RPP radio early Sunday he’d been trying to get ahold of the president without any luck.The protests are unlike any seen in recent years, fueled largely by young people typically apathetic to the country’s notoriously turbulent politics who view Vizcarra’s ouster as a power grab by lawmakers.Polls show most Peruvians wanted Vizcarra to stay in office. The ex-president is popular for his anti-corruption crusade, which led to frequent clashes with the legislature, where half of the members are themselves under investigation.“I am very sad over the deaths caused by the repression of this illegal and illegitimate government,” Vizcarra wrote on Twitter. “The country won’t let the deaths of these brave youths go unpunished.”International rights organizations have warned that police are using excessive force in trying to quell the protests. Dozens have been injured by rubber bullets and tear gas has been deployed near homes and hospitals.“We are documenting cases of police brutality in downtown Lima,” José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director of Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter. “Everything indicates repression against peaceful protesters is intensifying.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-mounts-on-peru-s-president-after-2-die-in-protests/story-G3b7J0wrMoBnuCuC0C0l3K.html

After this, he launched a failed attempt at the presidency, ending up with just one delegate to his name.Trump campaign and GiulianiTrump’s campaign for the presidency in 2016 offered Giuliani a chance at reinvention and this is where Trump and his friendship began. He also advised the president on the legality of his “Muslim ban” and he helped Trump dig up dirt on the Biden family’s connection to Ukraine during the 2020 campaign.Giuliani’s role nowAs the presidency has slipped away from Trump, Giuliani has taken the role of reinstating Trump in the White House with legal cases and tweets like, “682K mail-in ballots in Philidelphia and Allegheny County were counted WITHOUT observers present.

15-11-2020||World||Explained: What is presidential pardon and can Trump use it as his presidency nears end?||Donald Trump has faced a glut of legal challenges including lawsuits, fraud allegations and tax evasion allegations during his years as US President. But as his presidency enters its final weeks, Trump is deeply aware that once he formally exits the White House (on January 20 next year), he would not have the extensive legal protections that he hitherto enjoys.In 2018, he tweeted, “As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!” As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!What is a presidential pardon?All US presidents have the constitutional right to pardon or commute the sentence of people who have broken federal laws. The power to pardon cannot be restricted even by the Congress, therefore making it a limitless power that applies only to federal crimes and not state crimes. Thus, the pardons are not questioned and no reason has to be provided for the same.Can Trump pardon himself?Since there is no precedent of a president pardoning himself in US history, the legality of the issue has not been clear. Although Trump has insisted over the years that he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself. But a presidential pardon would not be able to protect Trump completely as pardons can only be given for federal crimes and therefore he may have to face trials in the state crimes. Trump can use this power- like previous presidents- to pardon his friends and family as this happened in 2019 as well when Trump commuted the prison sentence of his long-time ally Roger Stone.Read more | Explained: What new ruling says about DACA and the way ahead for TrumpCan vice president Mike Pence pardon Trump?Experts have been saying that Trump could use the 25th amendment of the US constitution which allows an incapacitated president to temporarily resign and hand over the reins to the vice president, who will act on his behalf until he returns to the office during which Pence could pardon Trump.

People are well aware of all these painful realities. They have learnt a lesson and will not let anyone gamble with their future,” Daily Pakistan quoted the PML-N supremo.Meanwhile, the Legislative Assembly elections began here on Sunday, amid legal concerns and massive protest surrounding the ‘‘provisional provincial status’‘ of Gilgit-Baltistan.The Imran Khan government had earlier announced granting provisional province status to the region, provoking a backlash from the residents of the illegally occupied region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pml-n-supremo-nawaz-sharif-urges-people-to-protect-votes-from-being-rigged/story-MWldXoIExLjcdYlPDJHjQK.html

The 56-year-old Harris, a senator, former prosecutor and the running mate of President-elect Joe Biden, will notch a slew of firsts when she is sworn in on January 20: as the first US female vice president and the first Black in that position, as well as the first person of South Asian descent. “Together, we showed little girls across the country what’s possible,” she said Friday on Twitter. Together, we showed little girls across the country what’s possible. pic.twitter.com/f6wxtPWOtdIt was the latest echo of a speech Hillary Clinton delivered in 2016 in recognizing her defeat by Donald Trump.“I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling” -- that of the White House -- “but someday someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think,” the defeated Democratic candidate said. Clinton then directed these words of encouragement to the country’s “little girls”: “Never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.” Since Clinton pronounced those words four years ago, women have transformed the face of American politics -- both in Congress and, soon, in the White House. “With Kamala Harris, a lot of glass ceilings were shattered in one day,” said Amy Dacey, a former chief executive of the Democratic National Committee now at American University. Ron Klain, whom Biden has named as his chief of staff, has said Harris will play a “significant” role, Dacey noted. “And I think (Biden will) bring in a lot of women at all levels of the administration.”Analysts expect Biden to appoint either progressive senator Elizabeth Warren or Federal Reserve official Lael Brainard, a former Treasury undersecretary, to head the Treasury -- a position never filled by a woman.Read more | US Election 2020: Thousands rally behind Donald Trump, believing he won race he lostThe United States might also see its first woman secretary of defense. Michele Flournoy, a former Pentagon number three, has been frequently mentioned. There are only two women in the Trump cabinet: transportation secretary Elaine Chao and education secretary Betsy DeVos. Several women have served Trump as senior advisors or as White House spokesperson. But the Republican billionaire has also frequently sparked controversy with insulting or sexist comments about women. In October, he referred to Harris as a “monster.” There are currently 127 women in Congress, or 23.7 percent of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives and the 100 in the Senate. While that percentage will rise to 26 percent in January, women still have far to go -- they represent half the US population. Democratic women will claim 105 seats in Congress (89 in the House and 16 in the Senate). Republican women, for their part, will occupy 35 seats (27 in the House and eight in the Senate) -- considerably fewer than their Democratic counterparts but still a big increase from the current 22. Women Republican candidates “performed better than expected,” Dittmar said.“They would still be significantly under-represented, but this should send a message about both their electability, and hopefully increase their influence within the party to ensure that more women get elected in the future.” Asked on Friday about the record number of Republican women elected, House speaker Nancy Pelosi -- the first woman to occupy that position -- said she would “congratulate and welcome each and every one of them.”But then the Democratic speaker, rounding the House total upward, quickly emphasized that her party was still doing better by women, casually adding:“Of course, we have 90.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-leads-record-wave-of-elected-women-changing-face-of-us-politics/story-w24toOOFLBN6xmcJhjmsNN.html

The number of confirmed cases spiked by 4,617 to reach 2,91,648, while 43 more deaths were reported, pushing up the total toll to 10,871.According to the outlet Global News, four provinces recorded their highest single-day spikes in cases including the two worst affected ones: Ontario and Quebec.In a statement, Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam warned things could get worse, saying, “Though the cumulative number is high and continues to increase, with many areas experiencing accelerated growth, it is important to remember that the vast majority of Canadians remain susceptible to Covid-19.”Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned that the Christmas season, with celebrations and family gatherings, could be jeopardised if these numbers kept escalating and pleaded with Canadians to be careful. He had also called for virtual celebrations of the Diwali festival in the country, which was echoed by Tam.Tam called for a “a collective effort to support and sustain the public health response”.The provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta reported their worst daily surge in cases since the pandemic began. Even the remote Arctic territory of Nunavut doubled its tally from four to eight. Leaders have signalled that some lockdown measures may have to be reimposed to curb the spread if this trend continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-sees-onset-of-winter-surge-as-key-provinces-report-record-spikes-in-covid-19-cases/story-yUh8z1hE9X9Z1dgjzZM65O.html
15-11-2020||World||Nobel UN food agency warns 2021 will be worse than 2020||The head of the World Food Program says the Nobel Peace Prize has given the UN agency a spotlight and megaphone to warn world leaders that next year is going to be worse than this year, and without billions of dollars “we are going to have famines of biblical proportions in 2021.”David Beasley said in an interview with The Associated Press that the Norwegian Nobel Committee was looking at the work the agency does every day in conflicts, disasters and refugee camps, often putting staffers’ lives at risk to feed millions of hungry people -- but also to send “a message to the world that it’s getting worse out there ... (and) that our hardest work is yet to come.”“It was so timely because we’ve been fighting to get above the choir,” Beasley said of last month’s award, pointing to the news being dominated by the U.S. elections and the Covid-19 pandemic, and the difficulty of getting global attention focused on “the travesty that we’re facing around the world.”“So this was really a gift from above,” Beasley said, recalling the surprise and delight of WFP’s 20,000 staffers worldwide, and his own shock at being interrupted during a meeting in Niger in Africa’s Sahel region with the news.Beasley recalled his warning to the UN Security Council in April that as the world was dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, it was also “on the brink of a hunger pandemic” that could lead to “multiple famines of biblical proportions” within a few months if immediate action wasn’t taken.“We were able to avert it in 2020 ... because the world leaders responded with money, stimulus packages, deferral of debt,” he said.Now, Beasley said, Covid-19 is surging again, economies are continuing to deteriorate particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and there is another wave of lockdowns and shutdowns.But he said the money that was available in 2020 isn’t going to be available in 2021, so he has been using the Nobel to meet leaders virtually and in person, talk to parliaments, and give speeches to sensitize those with power to “this tragedy that we are facing -- crises that really are going to be extraordinary over the next, who knows, 12 to 18 months.”“Everybody now wants to meet with the Nobel Peace Prize winner,” Beasley said, explaining he now gets 45 minutes instead of 15 minutes with leaders and is able to go into depth and explain how bad things are going to be next year and how leaders are going to have to prioritize programs. “And the response has really been good,” he said.“I’m telling them you’re not going to have enough money to fund all the projects you historically fund,” he said.“Those are important things,” Beasley said, but he likened the upcoming crisis to the Titanic saying “right now, we really need to focus on icebergs, and icebergs are famine, starvation, destabilization and migration.”Beasley said WFP needs $15 billion next year -- $5 billion just to avert famine and $10 billion to carry out the agency’s global programs including for malnourished children and school lunches which are often the only meal youngsters get.“If I could get that coupled with our normal money, then we avert famine around the world” and minimize destabilization as well as migration. he said.In addition to raising extra money from governments, Beasley said, his other “great hope” is that billionaires that have made billions during the Covid-19 pandemic will step up on a one-time basis. He plans to start pushing this message probably in December or January.In April, Beasley said 135 million people faced “crisis levels of hunger or worse.” A WFP analysis then showed that Covid-19 could push an additional 130 million people “to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020.”He said in Wednesday’s virtual interview from Rome, where WFP is based, that while famine was averted this year, the number of people facing crisis levels of hunger is increasing toward 270 million.“There’s about three dozen countries that could possibly enter the famine conditions if we don’t have the money we need,” Beasley said.According to a joint analysis by WFP and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in October, 20 countries “are likely to face potential spikes in high acute food insecurity” in the next three to six months, “and require urgent attention.”Of those, Yemen, South Sudan, northeastern Nigeria and Burkina Faso have some areas that “have reached a critical hunger situation following years of conflict or other shocks,” the UN agencies said, and any further deterioration in coming months “could lead to a risk of famine.”Other countries requiring “urgent attention” are Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Lebanon, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Sierra Leone, Somali, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, they said.Beasley said a Covid-19 vaccine “will create some optimism that hopefully will help jump the economies around the world, particularly the Western economies. But the WFP executive director said there’s already been $17 billion of economic stimulus this year “and we’re not going to have that globally.”“We’re very, very, very concerned” that with deferred debt payments for low- and middle-income countries resuming in January, new lockdowns and the rippling economic impact, “2021’s going to be a very bad year,” Beasley said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-un-food-agency-warns-2021-will-be-worse-than-2020/story-QJCR8cyEZfMNktXtHA8geK.html
15-11-2020||World||Explained: What new ruling says about DACA and the way ahead for Trump||A judge on Saturday rejected the White House’s limitations on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program which protects 700,000 so-called “Dreamers”, or undocumented migrants, brought to the United States as children. The federal judge in New York ruled that Donald Trump’s acting homeland security secretary Chad Wolf was not lawfully serving in his role when he issued the new rules for the DACA program in July. The ruling is another victory for proponents of the Barack Obama-era program after the US supreme court in June rejected Trump’s cancellation of it.Here’s everything you need to know about DACA:What is DACA?The recipients of DACA are young people who have grown up as Americans. As most of these young people had no way to gain legal residency even though they have lived in the US most of their lives, the DREAM Act provided a pathway to US citizenship to certain undocumented youth who go to college and/or serve in the military while maintaining a good record. Therefore, DACA enables certain people who came to the US as children and meet several key guidelines to request consideration for deferred action; allowing non-US citizens who qualify to remain in the country for two years, subject to renewal.What happened in June 2020?On June 18, 2020, the supreme court blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to end DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) in a 5-4 ruling and maintained the program, allowing DACA recipients to renew membership. In 2017, President Trump ordered an end to the DACA program which was issued in an executive order in 2012 by then President Obama. After the Trump administration ordered an end to DACA, several lawsuits were filed against the order. Two federal appellate courts have now ruled against the administration, allowing previous DACA recipients to renew their deferred action, and the supreme court agreed to review the legal challenges. The Supreme Court asked us to resubmit on DACA, nothing was lost or won. They "punted", much like in a football game (where hopefully they would stand for our great American Flag). We will be submitting enhanced papers shortly in order to properly fulfil the Supreme Court’s.....What is the fresh controversy on DACA?Saturday’s ruling said that Chad Wolf, who has not been confirmed in his role by the US senate, issued new restrictions on the program in response to the supreme court ruling. Thus, his restrictions “effectively suspended” DACA and said that new applications would not be accepted as renewals would be limited to one year instead of two. All these restrictions were declared invalid by the supreme court because “the court holds that Mr. Wolf was not lawfully serving as acting secretary of homeland security” when he issued the restrictions.What is the way ahead for the Trump administration?The ruling is the second defeat for the Trump administration after June 2020 as Trump entered office promising to halt almost all immigration and end the DACA program. It is still unclear what steps the Trump administration would take. On the other hand, President-elect Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in the November 3 polls, has pledged to reinstate the DACA program when he takes office on January 20.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-new-ruling-says-about-daca-and-the-way-ahead-for-trump/story-AyIOXIvpNKdjaQCm9rWe0J.html
15-11-2020||World||US Elections 2020: Why poll watcher complaints don’t amount to fraud||President Donald Trump’s legal allies have launched a flurry of lawsuits arguing that widespread fraud could have been committed because its poll watchers didn’t get proper access to the voting process. Most of those lawsuits have been dismissed over lack of evidence of election fraud. There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!Trump has tried to argue that there is a link between some of the complaints of partisan poll watchers and the results of the election. But till now, he has been unable to validate his assertions. Who is a poll watcher?A poll watcher is a partisan appointee who monitors voting or ballot counting to help ensure their party gets a fair shot. They are not supposed to interfere in the electoral process, except to report issues to party officials or polling place authorities, and are typically required to register in advance with the local election office. Poll watchers are designated by a political party or campaign to report any concerns that they may have. Monitoring polling places and election offices is allowed in most states, but rules vary and there are certain limits to avoid any harassment or intimidation.Were Trump’s poll watchers denied access? The Trump campaign said from the beginning that republican poll watchers were being improperly denied access to observe the counting of ballots. But election officials in key battleground states said that rules were being followed and they were committed to transparency. In Pennsylvania, for example, state election officials said poll watchers were certified in every county. Even republican lawyers acknowledged in court that they had observers watching polls and mail-in ballots being processed. In Michigan, a Trump campaign lawsuit included assertions from their observers that poll workers rolled their eyes when viewing votes for Trump, wore masks or clothing supporting the Black Lives Matter movement or appeared to double-count ballots. Other lawsuits claimed poll watchers were temporarily denied access in some locations, but there has been no evidence to back it up. Was there any voter fraud in the elections then?The federal cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency has called the voting and count “the most secure in American history.” But Trump’s legal allies continue to argue without any evidence that their poll workers weren’t on hand and anything could have happened out of their view.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-why-poll-watcher-complaints-don-t-amount-to-fraud/story-Qgbe7iHw3sTdAuTMaHaRPI.html

Pashinyan had come under pressure with thousands of demonstrators protesting since Tuesday and demanding he resign over a ceasefire that secured territorial advances for Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh after six weeks of fighting.The NSS said its former head Artur Vanetsyan, the former head of the Republican Party parliamentary faction Vahram Baghdasaryan and war volunteer Ashot Minasyan were under arrest.“The suspects were planning to illegally usurp power by murdering the prime minister and there were already potential candidates being discussed to replace him,” the NSS said in a statement.Read more | Thousands in Armenia protest Nagorno-Karabakh truce termsPashinyan said earlier this week he had no choice but to sign the agreement to prevent further territorial losses. He said he was taking personal responsibility for the setbacks, but rejected calls to step down.The ceasefire halted military action in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated by ethnic Armenians. Under the agreement, 2,000 Russian peacekeeping troops are being deployed to the region. Since the early 1990s, ethnic Armenians had held military control over all of Nagorno-Karabakh and substantial swathes of Azeri territory surrounding it.

Biden’s election has caused some unease in Taiwan.Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan’s representative in Washington and close to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, spoke to Blinken by telephone to convey Taiwan’s congratulations to Biden, Hsiao said on Twitter on Saturday.“Appreciated bipartisan support for US relations with Taiwan and hope to continue close cooperation with the US in coming years,” she added.Read more | Republicans face court setbacks, Donald Trump law firm steps downTsai met Blinken in 2015 at the State Department when he was deputy secretary of state and she was the presidential candidate for Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). On that trip, Tsai also became the first Taiwanese presidential candidate to visit the White House, meeting Evan Medeiros, President Barack Obama’s senior director for Asian Affairs.“It is thus clear that the government of the Democratic Party had a friendly attitude towards Taiwan,” Tsai said in a DPP-issued statement on Wednesday. With his decades of experience on Capitol Hill, at the White House and as the former No. 2 at the State Department, Blinken is widely seen in Washington as a natural fit to be Biden’s national security adviser or a possible pick for secretary of state.Biden, a Democrat, has not discussed what role Blinken will fill in the new administration. Tensions over Taiwan have escalated dramatically since Republican Trump took office four years ago, with China mounting regular military drills near the island, including during visits earlier this year to Taipei by senior US officials.Taiwanese officials are due in Washington this week for trade talks, and the island has expressed confidence these will continue under the new administration, pointing to bipartisan US support for Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-hopes-for-close-us-cooperation-in-call-with-biden-adviser/story-E4mGCNCtI8nUlgDQo1DJmO.html
15-11-2020||World||Mexico reaches 1 million coronavirus cases, nears 100,000 deaths||Mexico on Saturday topped 1 million registered coronavirus cases and nearly 100,000 test-confirmed deaths, though officials agree the number is probably much higher.What is more, officials in Mexico claim science is on their side. Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell says any wider testing would be “a waste of time, effort and money.” Face masks, López-Gatell says, “are an auxiliary measure to prevent spreading the virus. They do not protect us, but they are useful for protecting other people.”President Andres Manuel López Obrador almost never wears a mask, and López-Gatell only occasionally does. Except science does not appear to be on their side. International experts have recommended mass testing, and say face masks protect both the wearer and other people.“They say there is no evidence. No, excuse me, there is evidence,” said former health secretary Dr. José Narro. “In May, we already began to have empirical evidence and well-documented scientific studies began to appear stressing the importance of face masks and the need for testing.”“What I can say is the (government) strategy did not have the necessary flexibility to adjust to the increasing amount of knowledge” about the disease, Narro said. In part that has been a hallmark of López Obrador’s administration: never back down, never change course, and if challenged, double down. His main promise to Mexicans is that there would be enough hospital beds for everyone who needs one, and his government has largely fulfilled that basic promise — even if Mexicans are so afraid of those hospitals they often wait until the last moment to go for treatment, at which point, doctors say, it’s often too late. That fear was not unfounded; early in the pandemic, three-quarters of patients intubated and put on ventilators in Mexico’s largest hospital network died.Read more | Clashes erupt between protest groups as thousands rally for Trump, police step inThat resistance was what Mexico City human resources manager Lorena Salas felt when her 76-year-old father, Jaime Salas Osuna, began to show signs of what could be Covid-19.“The idea was mainly to stay at home, no? Thinking of going to the hospital was not an option, we were terrified that there he would surely be infected,” said Salas. Instead, she sped down to the resort city of Acapulco, where her father lived, and when she arrived, she found him thin, sweating and confused.“At that moment the delivery service arrived with the oxygen meter, and his oxygen saturation was 77,” she recalled. (A normal reading is 93 to 98). “At that moment I felt like a bucket of cold water had fallen on me. We just looked at each other. I said ‘Dad, do you have Covid?”Salas drove him to Mexico City; he didn’t want to be intubated, but doctors explained they had to. He underwent two operations, two intubations and struggled for 13 days before he died on October 20. To its credit, that is one of the few areas where the government’s public message has changed: where officials once urged people with the disease to stay home as long as possible, they now advise those over 60 or with risk factors like diabetes or obesity to seek treatment immediately.But on most other points, the insistence that the rest of the world is wrong and Mexico’s approach is right appears to have taken a toll in lives. Late Saturday, Mexican Director General of Health Promotion Ricardo Cortés Alcalá announced that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had reached 1,003,253, with at least 98,259 deaths from Covid-19. Since the pandemic began, Mexico has managed to administer only about 2.5 million tests to its citizens; only seriously ill people get tested in Mexico. Testing only 1.9% of the population since the pandemic began has made it hard, if not impossible, to effectively trace contacts, catch outbreaks early or identify asymptomatic cases.Even in Mexico City, one of the few places that has paid lip-service to trying to identify cases before they get to a hospital, the efforts have been incredibly weak. To be fair, few countries have managed to do contact tracing well; Mexico, with fewer financial resources and where half the population is poor, self-employed or working off the books, there was little chance of strict control or surveillance.Mexico City has tried an alternative approach, which is to identify neighborhoods where clusters of cases have occurred, and give them special attention. Lurid yellow warning posters reading “Caution! You are entering an area of high infection” now dot the city. Special kiosks are set up in such neighborhoods to provide some tests, and a few health workers have gone door-to-door looking for cases. But that is rare. For doctors on the front lines, the official response has been at times frustrating.Dr. Arturo Galindo, head of the infectious disease program at the National Medical Sciences and Nutrition Institute, one of Mexico’s leading public hospitals, has seen his intensive care unit fill up to 100% capacity in recent weeks as Mexicans relaxed and began holding more get-togethers. The hospital is now sending critical Covid-19 cases to other treatment centers.“I have had arguments on the street when I say “hey, put your face mask on,” and people argue with me, citing the argument ‘well, the president doesn’t,’ and that is their only argument,” Galindo said. “It wouldn’t be bad if he (López Obrador) set an example.”Speaking for himself, not his hospital, Galindo also voices support for more testing, and senses there are signs of a new-found willingness to consider the idea — not the least because of the advent of rapid, cheap new antigen tests. But while he says some things are improving — people are now getting to hospitals sooner, thus improving their chances — some recent developments make him worry.Read more | ‘No more bullying’: Fresh start to US-Mexico relations eyed under BidenExcept for a few states, nobody in Mexico has even attempted to enforce a lockdown, or mask-wearing. The closest thing most local authorities have done has been to force some workplaces to shut down, and fine or close businesses that allow too many customers inside at once. Beyond that — travel, mask wearing, parties, weddings — there is very little enforcement. And as the pandemic stretched into its tenth month, people began to let their guard down.That has led to super-spreader events like an October 3 wedding of a soap opera actor and the daughter of a local businessman in the northern border city of Mexicali. Authorities in Mexico say more than 100 people are believed to have been infected by the coronavirus at the wedding, which about 300 people attended.There have been instances of outright rebellion. On October 25, a couple of hundred young people gathered for an illegal concert in an empty lot on the outskirts of the city of Toluca, just west of Mexico City. On videos of the event, the lead singer of one band can be heard telling asking the crowd, “Honestly, who doesn’t give a damn about the pandemic? Whoever doesn’t give a damn about coronavirus, raise your beer!” Dozens raised their cups.Salas, whose father died and who herself was infected, said people have to abandon conspiracy theories and the strange belief it won’t happen to them.“I see a lot of apathy, a lot of people being irresponsible, not giving a damn or not believing the disease is real. People still think it is something invented by the government.” Salas said. “It is something that people have to realize does exist, it is real.”Galindo said those on the front lines are shocked when they look at social media. “They have this sense of frustration seeing photos of parties, meetings,” Galindo said. “They have been locked up for six months, fighting, going without sleep or without eating, and then they see that, and it’s shocking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-reaches-1-million-coronavirus-cases-nears-100-000-deaths/story-0eXdpUae0Qi0nPolpZa8FN.html
15-11-2020||World||ASEAN, China, other partners set world’s biggest trade pact||China and 14 other countries have agreed to set up the world’s largest trading bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity, in a deal many in Asia are hoping will help hasten a recovery from the shocks of the pandemic. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, is to be signed virtually on Sunday on the sidelines of the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “After eight years of negotiating with blood, sweat and tears, we have finally come to the moment where we will seal the RCEP Agreement,” Malaysia’s trade minister, Mohamed Azmin Ali, said in a statement.Also Read | We couldn’t take our family photo like every year, says PM Modi at 17th ASEAN-India Summit The deal sends a signal that RCEP countries have chosen “to open our markets instead of resorting to protectionist measures during this difficult time,” he said. The accord will take already low tariffs on trade between member countries still lower, over time, and is less comprehensive than an 11-nation trans-Pacific trade deal that President Donald Trump pulled out of shortly after taking office. It includes the 10 nations belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, but not the United States. Officials said the accord leaves the door open for India, which dropped out due to fierce domestic opposition to its market-opening requirements, to rejoin the bloc. It is not expected to go as far as the European Union in integrating member economies but does build on existing free trade arrangements.Also Read | PM Modi underlines centrality of Asean in India’s Act East policy The deal has powerful symbolic ramifications, showing that nearly four years after Trump launched his “America First” policy of forging trade deals with individual countries, Asia remains committed to multi-nation efforts toward freer trade that are seen as a formula for future prosperity. Ahead of Sunday’s RCEP “special summit” meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would firmly convey his government’s support for “broadening a free and fair economic zone, including a possibility of India’s future return to the deal, and hope to gain support from the other countries.” The accord is also a coup for China, by far the biggest market in the region with more than 1.3 billion people, allowing Beijing to cast itself as a “champion of globalisation and multilateral cooperation” and giving it greater influence over rules governing regional trade, Gareth Leather, senior Asian economist for Capital Economics, said in a report. Now that Trump’s opponent Joe Biden has been declared president-elect, the region is watching to see how U.S. policy on trade and other issues will evolve. Analysts are skeptical Biden will push hard to rejoin the trans-Pacific trade pact or to roll back many of the U.S. trade sanctions imposed on China by the Trump administration given widespread frustration with Beijing’s trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft. Critics of free trade agreements say they tend to encourage companies to move manufacturing jobs overseas. So, having won over disaffected rust-belt voters in Michigan and western Pennsylvania in the Nov. 3 election, Biden is “not going to squander that by going back into TPP,” Michael Jonathan Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a web seminar. But given concerns over China’s growing influence, Biden is likely to seek much more engagement with Southeast Asia to protect U.S. interests, he said. The fast-growing and increasingly affluent Southeast Asian market of 650 million people has been hit hard by the pandemic and is urgently seeking fresh drivers for growth. RCEP originally would have included about 3.6 billion people and encompassed about a third of world trade and global GDP. Minus India, it still covers more than 2 billion people and close to a third of all trade and business activity. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the retooled version of the North American Free Trade Agreement under Trump, covers slightly less economic activity but less than a tenth of the world’s population. The EU and Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revised version of the deal Trump rejected, also are smaller. RCEP includes six of the 11 remaining CPTPP members. India balked at exposing its farmers and factories to more foreign competition. Among other concerns, Indian dairy farmers are worried about competition from New Zealand and Australian milk and cheese producers. Automakers fear imports from across the region. But overall the biggest fear is over a flood of manufactured goods from China. Trade and investment flows within Asia have vastly expanded over the past decade, a trend that has accelerated amid feuding between the U.S. and China, which have imposed billions of dollars’ worth of punitive tariffs on each other’s exports. The RCEP agreement is loose enough to stretch to fit the disparate needs of member countries as diverse as Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. Unlike the CPTPP and EU, it does not establish unified standards on labor and the environment or commit countries to open services and other vulnerable areas of their economies. But it does set rules for trade that will facilitate investment and other business within the region, Jeffrey Wilson, research director at the Perth USAsia Center, said in a report for the Asia Society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asean-china-other-partners-set-world-s-biggest-trade-pact/story-YdmFJPfhUzsNr5Z8kkZRdO.html
15-11-2020||World||Afghan forces capture ‘mastermind’ of 2 Kabul attacks||Afghan forces have captured the mastermind of two brutal attacks on education institutes in the country’s capital which killed nearly 50 people, officials said Saturday.Mohammad Adel planned an attack on his alma mater Kabul University on November 2 and a bombing at another education centre in October, officials said.At least 22 people were killed and another 27 wounded when three gunmen rampaged through Kabul University, spraying classrooms with bullets for several hours.The brazen daylight assault came just days after 24 people were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up near the Kawsar-e Danish education centre in the capital, which offered training and higher-education courses.The attacks came amid surging violence across the country that has only worsened in recent months despite the government holding peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar.Afghanistan’s intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security (NDS), said: “NDS special forces have detained Mohammad Adel, the main mastermind of Kabul University and Kawsar education centre, in a targeted operation in Kabul.”It did not say when Adel was captured.Security sources said he was a former student of Kabul University.During his interrogation, Adel told NDS officers that it was he who proposed the university attack as it “would get wide coverage and put pressure on the government”, the NDS said.It did not reveal details on how Adel planned the other attack.Earlier on Saturday, Vice President Amrullah Saleh had also said Adel masterminded the university attack.He said Adel was recruited by the Haqqani network, an affiliate of the Taliban.“The attack was carried out to pressure, defame and make the government look weak in front of the people,” Saleh said.Saleh said that Adel -- who had studied the Islamic sharia law and hailed from the province of Panjshir -- had revealed that he received weapons from the Haqqani network to carry out the attack.The shadowy group has long been accused of carrying out brutal assaults on Western forces and civilians, and has been branded a terrorist group by Washington.Soon after the university attack, Saleh and other top officials had blamed the Taliban.However, both attacks were claimed by the Islamic State group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-forces-capture-mastermind-of-two-kabul-attacks/story-GZMFqgfAdD3WfV9wVgRsWP.html
15-11-2020||World||Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine’s trial success may boost acceptance, says Anthony Fauci||The success of Pfizer Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine trial may help persuade more people to get inoculated amid a surge in new coronavirus cases, according to Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious-disease doctor.Pfizer’s vaccine, developed in collaboration with Germany’s BioNTech SE, has “an extraordinarily high degree of efficacy -- more than 90%, close to 95%,” Fauci said in an interview. That could be a key factor in overcoming reluctance to take pandemic vaccines that have been developed at top speed.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“What I would hope is that even though there’s a degree of skepticism about vaccines in general, that when the general public sees how effective this vaccine is,” said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, “we might see a turnaround of the attitude toward vaccination.”The US may begin offering the vaccine to priority groups at the end of December, Fauci said. It’s hoped to blunt spiking infections that reached a record 190,000 new daily cases this week. The Trump administration has both purchased and funded development of doses from Pfizer and other drugmakers with a goal of making enough supplies for most Americans by year-end.Read more: Trump’s ‘Operation Warp Speed’ Aims to Rush Coronavirus VaccineThe name of the administration’s effort, Operation Warp Speed, may have created an impression that corners are being cut to create a vaccine, undermining public confidence, researchers including Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, have said.Just over half of US adults said in September they would definitely or probably take a vaccine to prevent Covid-19 if it were available, down from 72% in May, a national survey by the Washington-based Pew Research Center showed. A survey in June of people in 19 countries published last month in the journal Science found 71.5% of participants would probably take a Covid-19 vaccine, with acceptance ranging from almost 90% in China to less than 55% in Russia.Results of a late-stage trial of a vaccine candidate from Moderna Inc. that uses the same messenger RNA technology as the Pfizer shot are likely to be available within a week, Fauci said. “And if that is really comparable to what we saw with the Pfizer trial, we’ll now have two highly effective vaccines,” he said.“We’ve got to convince people to take the vaccine, because if you have a highly effective vaccine and only 50% of the people take it, you’re not going to have the impact that you’d need to essentially bring a pandemic down to such a low level that it’s no longer threatening society,” Fauci said. “And that’s the goal of a vaccine.”The vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech SE and Moderna are given in a two-shot regimen. The duration of their protection, or that of any Covid-19 vaccine, isn’t yet known, Fauci said. Coronaviruses generally don’t generate an immune response with decades-long durability, and people are infected with one or more of the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold year after year, he said.If the vaccine’s effect has “one to two years of durability, to me that’s fine, because we just go back and boost people and get the immunity up,” Fauci said.More than 20 Covid vaccines have entered the final stage of patient studies that new pharmaceutical products are usually required to undergo for regulatory approval. Even though the late-stage trials may take only a few months, participants and others who receive experimental vaccines will be followed for as long as two years as part of safety monitoring and surveillance, Fauci said.“You always want to be very careful when it comes to safety when you’re dealing with vaccines that you’re going to be giving to hundreds of millions, if not billions of people,” he said. “And that is something that is on everybody’s front burner. Safety is paramount.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-s-trial-success-may-boost-acceptance-says-anthony-fauci/story-ocXK8GOSTmQFlzahkWG4lO.html

15-11-2020||World||Egypt finds treasure trove of over 100 sarcophagi||Egypt announced Saturday the discovery of an ancient treasure trove of more than a 100 intact sarcophagi, dating back more than 2,500 years ago, the largest such find this year.The sealed wooden coffins, unveiled on site amid much fanfare, belonged to top officials of the Late Period and the Ptolemaic period of ancient Egypt. They were found in three burial shafts at depths of 12 metres (40 feet) in the sweeping Saqqara necropolis south of Cairo.Archaeologists opened one coffin to reveal a mummy wrapped in a burial shroud adorned with brightly coloured hieroglyphic pictorials.Saqqara, home to more than a dozen pyramids, ancient monasteries, and animals burial sites, is a vast necropolis of the ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.“Saqqara has yet to reveal all of its contents. It is a treasure,” Antiquities and Tourism Minister Khaled al-Anani said at the unveiling ceremony.“Excavations are still underway. Whenever we empty a burial shaft of sarcophagi, we find an entrance to another.” The latest find came just over a month after archaeologists in the area found 59 other well-preserved and sealed wooden coffins, also dating back more than 2,500 years ago.- ‘Beautiful, wonderful statues’ -More than 40 statues of ancient deities and funerary masks were also discovered, the minister said.Another two wooden statues were found in the tomb belonging to an ancient judge of the 6th dynasty, according to Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities.It was not immediately clear if the statues depicted any of the judge’s family members but one statue is believed to depict an individual, by the name Heteb Ka, who was “venerated by the king”, Waziri said. “The beauty of the statue ... is seen in the intricacy of its eyebrows, moustache, and eyelashes. It is absolutely beautiful and wonderful,” he added.The sarcophagi will be distributed among several museums in Egypt including the yet-to-opened Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) at the Giza plateau.Situated near the famed Giza pyramids, GEM is planned to be inaugurated in 2021 after multiple delays.Anani attributed the flurry of discoveries in Saqqara to extensive excavation works in recent years.Another discovery in the vast Saqqara necropolis is expected to be announced in December or early 2021.Archaeologists also hope to find an ancient workshop for manufacturing wooden coffins for mummies.Waziri explained that ancient Egyptians used to buy their coffins at this workshop.“We expect it to be somewhere close to the coffin’s burial shafts,” Waziri said. Egypt hopes archaeological discoveries will spur tourism, a sector which has suffered multiple shocks ever since a 2011 uprising up until today’s coronavirus pandemic.str-mz/hc||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-finds-treasure-trove-of-over-100-sarcophagi/story-sDeiTQ8yXWSvrlmcicWwVL.html

It was unclear what triggered it, officials said. Seven other people were injured and in a critical condition, including the doctor on call, they said.Prosecutors said they would investigate the cause of the fire.Health Minister Nelu Tataru told reporters six surviving patients would be transferred to a Covid-19 hospital in the eastern Romanian city of Iasi.The injured doctor, who had severe burns on 40% of his body, would be transferred to a hospital in the capital Bucharest, Tataru said.“In future legislation, all public hospitals will be coordinated by the health ministry,” Tataru said without elaborating. Local hospitals are currently run by county councils, making overall supervision of the health system difficult. Tataru said the Piatra Neamt hospital would continue to run an intensive care unit on a separate floor. The fire was the country’s deadliest since 2015, when a night club in the capital Bucharest burned down and 65 people died.That blaze triggered mass protests across Romania at the country’s culture of graft and lack of accountability.Romania, which has one of the European Union’s least developed healthcare infrastructures, has reported 353,185 coronavirus cases and 8,813 deaths. Just under 13,000 people with Covid-19 were in hospital across Romania on Saturday, including 1,172 in intensive care units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-kills-10-at-romanian-covid-19-hospital/story-qxhygwiKJllUOuDhSHvmMJ.html

It was not clear if Putin had a call with Aliyev and then another call with Aliyev and Pashinyan, or if he spoke separately with the Armenian leader.Under the agreement, 2,000 Russian peacekeeping troops are being deployed to the region. Since the early 1990s, ethnic Armenians had held military control over all of Nagorno-Karabakh and substantial swaths of Azeri territory surrounding it. They have now lost much of the enclave itself as well as the surrounding territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-tells-azerbaijan-to-take-care-of-christian-shrines-in-nagorno-karabakh/story-CjQ272wB9GujEpxbEVSnEM.html

We did nothing.” “Days and nights we stayed on our backsides at home and fought against the spread of the coronavirus,” the narrator continues. “Our couch was the front line and our patience was our weapon.” The ad ends with a government message that “you too can become a hero by staying at home.” Germany imposed fresh restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19 at the start of November, shutting restaurants, bars and gyms, and setting limits on the number of people who can meet in public and private settings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-government-ad-hails-couch-potatoes-as-covid-19-heroes/story-weQnKhcpIoDmWGWp869NEI.html

But China has not yet formally responded to the request. They said that informally Chinese authorities conveyed that the interest rate could be higher than the one mentioned in the term sheet,” the sources told the Pakistan daily.In May Pakistan’s former ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani wrote in an article in The Diplomat that Pakistan’s desire to maintain strategic relations with China has resulted in the construction of USD 62 billion worth of CPEC, which includes a set of infrastructure projects, being mired in insufficient transparency.“China’s consistent strategic support, including help with Pakistan’s nuclear program, is often held out by Pakistan’s military establishment favorably in contrast with the more conditional Pakistani alliance with the United States. But it seems now that China is not in Pakistan to help its people but rather as a predatory economic actor”, he said.The 278-page report by the “Committee for Power Sector Audit, Circular Debt Reservation, and Future RoadMap” listed malpractices to the tune of 100 billion Pakistani rupees (USD625 million) in the independent power generating sector, with at least a third of it relating to Chinese projects.According to the committee’s report, “excess set-up costs of (Pakistani Rupee) Rs 32.46 billion (approximately USD204 million) was allowed to the two coal-based [Chinese] plants due to misrepresentation by sponsors regarding [deductions for] the ‘Interest During Construction’ (IDC) as well as non-consideration of earlier completion of plants.”The interest deduction was apparently allowed for 48 months whereas the plants were actually completed within 27-29 months leading to the entitlement of an excess Return on Equity (RoE) of USD27.4 million annually over the entire project life of 30 years in the case of the Sahiwal plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-seek-usd-2-7-bn-loan-from-china-for-cpec-project/story-4LRPBY3a0yT0Kd8y9gDKYK.html
15-11-2020||India||Pregnant leopard killed in road accident on Mumbai’s Western Express Highway||A three-to-four-year old female leopard identified as L98 was found grievously injured in a road accident on the Western Express Highway (WEH) near Kashi Mira, Bhayander at around 12.30 am on Sunday, and subsequently succumbed to injuries.The leopard was one-month pregnant with three foetuses, said forest officials.According to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) director and conservator of forest G Mallikarjuna, the injured leopard was rescued by an SGNP team and brought to the facility’s leopard rescue centre.“However the leopard succumbed to its injuries during treatment at 2.15am. A post mortem was conducted by a team of veterinarians at SGNP on Sunday afternoon where the leopard was found to be pregnant with three foetuses,” said Mallikarjuna.The post-mortem revealed that the cause of death was mostly probably due to the collision with a vehicle. “It was due to strong mechanical impact (probably vehicular origin) causing multiple hemorrhages, multiple fractures, and muscular damage resulting in hypovolemia (life threatening condition due to high blood loss) and respiratory arrest,” added Mallikarjuna.Wildlife biologist from Wildlife Conservation Society Nikit Surve, who has been annually assessing leopard numbers in and around SGNP, said L98 was first photographed in October 2018 at Ghodbunder village after local residents had spotted the animal. “Early last year, the leopard was spotted on the opposite side of the road near Kashi Mira, Bhayander, which showed that she had successfully crossed. Also, just about seven days ago, the leopard was spotted in one of our camera traps near Kashi Mira. However, it is extremely unfortunate that she met with the accident probably while crossing the road on Sunday because it is not easy for animals to understand oncoming traffic. It is even more disheartening that she was pregnant,” said Surve, adding that leopards do not stop hunting or movement till the moment they stop to give birth.Dr. Shaliesh Pethe, senior veterinarian, SGNP said the gestation period for a leopard is three months. “This leopard was one-month pregnant. Externally (photographs) one can identify that a leopard is pregnant only within the last 15 days before she delivers,” he said.SGNP and peripheral areas are home to at least 47 big cats that include the transient population moving between SGNP into surrounding landscapes, according to a 2019 estimation by Surve and SGNP. Data from SGNP, NGO Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) and Mumbaiikars for SGNP revealed that 19 leopards had been killed around SGNP, most of them on the Western Express Highway and Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS) from 2008 to 2018.“Unless we provide adequate mitigation structures (under or overpasses) on roads, railways and canals, we will lose most of our large mammals to linear infrastructure, very rapidly,” said Anish Andheria, president, Wildlife Conservation Trust.An earlier assessment under the ‘Mumbaikars for SGNP’ initiative in 2013 revealed that 40 leopards died in road accidents along the periphery of SGNP from 1994 to 2012.“Over the last two years, accident cases with animals have reduced as road widening work is underway on the WEH. Owing to less traffic during Diwali, vehicles were moving at a faster speed that led to this unfortunate incident. However, we have suggested several mitigation measures along this route, and we are trying to expedite their construction with project proponents as early as possible,” said Mallikarjuna.Apart from the incident in Mumbai, another leopard was killed in a road accident on Saturday near Satara on the National Highway 4 that connects Pune and Bengaluru. The country recorded 83 leopard deaths in train and road accidents in 2019, the highest in a decade, according to the Wildlife Protection Society of India. Of these, 73 were killed in road accidents and 10 were run over by trains. Also, there had been a 278% rise in such deaths due to road and rail accidents from 2010 to 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pregnant-leopard-killed-in-road-accident-on-mumbai-s-western-express-highway/story-y3m8KpdVGlgMvUDzS7Kp0J.html
15-11-2020||India||Dissension in Congress unit in Bihar spills into the open||The cracks in the Congress party in Bihar have widened further after its debacle in the recently concluded assembly election.Dissension against the top guns in the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) and the All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge is growing. They are now being blamed for the party’s poor show after it won only 19 of the 70 seats it contested — eight less than its tally in 2015 — in the 243-member Bihar assembly. Raj Kumar Sharma, the national coordinator of the All India Kisan Congress, staged a sit-in Sunday at the Sadaqat Ashram, the state headquarters of the Congress, demanding a complete revamp of the BPCC. His supporters are also baying for the blood of Bihar Congress in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil, secretaries in-charge Ajay Kapoor and Birender Singh Rathore, appointed by the AICC for the assembly polls. Also in the firing line are BPCC chief Madan Mohan Jha, its campaign committee chairman Akhilesh Singh and Congress legislature party leader Sadanand Singh, all of whom were instrumental in the ticket distribution to candidates. “I have just two demands. First, remove the nearly one dozen ticket brokers, who sold our party tickets to candidates. Secondly, revamp the Congress and have in its core group grassroots workers and party loyalists for over two decades,” said Sharma, who is leading the revolt. Sharma minces no words when he says “ticket dalaals” (ticket brokers) in his party “sold” the party symbol to candidates. “Our leaders who had a say in distribution of tickets surreptitiously worked for the BJP and RSS. They sold tickets at a heavy price and favoured the BJP,” he said. “There were at least 26 candidates who didn’t get tickets from the constituencies of their choice. For instance, Praveen Kushwaha, who wanted a ticket from Bhagalpur, was made to contest from Patna Sahib assembly constituency in Patna. Gunjan Patel, who wanted to contest from Digha, was given a ticket from Nalanda. Kundan Gupta from Lakhisarai was asked to contest from Harnaut in Nalanda. Sanjeev Kumar Singh was given a ticket from Vaishali when he wanted one from Muzaffarpur. Pappu Singh was given a ticket to contest from Lalganj when he was interested in Aurangabad,” he added. BPCC president Madan Mohan Jha was not available for comments. He had diverted his calls to a number which was switched off on Sunday evening. Cong spokesperson Harkhu Jha demanded a complete revamp and said Gohil was responsible for the Congress’ poor show. “The unrest within the Congress is because of the flawed distribution of tickets and decisions taken by AICC’s Bihar in-charge. The party should change the whole set up of leaders, who are responsible for the debacle of the Congress in Bihar,” he added. Dissension within the Congress began in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections itself when many candidates who had switched alliance, were given party tickets at the eleventh hour. Some leaders including Jha had then written to the Congress high command, seeking a revamp to revive the Congress in Bihar. However, it did not pay heed and continued with the same set of persons when the assembly elections were announced. Peeved at the distribution of tickets, more than a dozen leaders went solo as independents in the assembly election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissension-in-congress-unit-in-bihar-spills-into-the-open/story-u77NaVWwRXvlQ4NcNG831K.html

A deputy SP has been put in-charge of the investigation,” said a senior police official. Agrawal did not comment on the developments.Early this month, Banaja Panda, the wife of Debanarayan Panda, former personal assistant of Malkangiri district collector Manish Agarwal, had moved the court of SDJM in Malkangiri, seeking lodging of case of murder against the IAS officer and three others alleging that her husband may have been murdered since he allegedly came to know about the involvement of the collector and others in corruption. Alleging lack of transparency and efficiency in the investigation process, she claimed that the CCTV footage of the district collector’s office has been tampered with.Also Read: ‘Bande Utkala Janani ‘will be part of class 9, 10 school curriculum in OdishaOn December 27 last year, the collector’s personal assistant had gone missing from his office.

Superintendent of Police, Mungeli, Arvind Kujur that the Mungeli District and Sessions Judge, Kanta Martin, who was living alone in her official residence was found hanging from the ceiling fan at her official residence in the district. “The staff of the judge told police that on Sunday she told them to leave at around 6 pm and there was no one present at her residence when the incident took place,” the SP said adding that the incident took place between 11 pm to 11 am as per preliminary investigation. Kujur said that on Sunday, when the cook returned, he found the door of her residence locked from inside and there was no response to his knocking. He then informed the judge’s guards.“I reached the spot after we got the information. We managed to open a window and found that the judge was already dead,” said the SP. Police preliminary investigation seems to suggest that she died by suicide since all the doors were locked from inside while the guards were present at the gate of the residence. The staff and some other acquaintances claimed that she was under depression after her husband died last year following which she had been alone, the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/district-judge-in-chhattisgarh-allegedly-dies-by-suicide/story-eHfSCdRSUdpSXzI9VdcNEM.html
15-11-2020||India||Pollution level in Delhi higher this Diwali than last year, says CPCB||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Sunday said pollution levels were higher in Delhi this Diwali as compared to the last year and this could be attributed to high share of stubble burning and unfavorable meteorology during the festival season. In a special report, the CPCB said almost all pollutants reported higher values on Diwali day this year as compared to 2019. “Diwali was in mid-November this year which has unfavourable meteorological conditions for dispersal of pollutants as compared to 2019 when it was in last week of October,” it said, according to news agency PTI. The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was 32 per cent on Diwali day this year as compared to 19 per cent last year. Therefore, it may be inferred that elevated PM2.5 concentrations in 2020 in comparison to previous year had enhanced contribution of stubble burning and the same is also reflected in elevated levels of CO and NO2,” it added.The air quality dipped to severe at several places across the national capital on Saturday night owing to a combination of stubble burning and firecrackers burst during the Diwali celebrations in violation of a ban on the same.The Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM 2.5 pollutant stood at 481 in Anand Vihar, 444 in IGI Airport area, 457 in ITO, and 414 in Lodhi Road area, all four in the ‘severe’ category, at 11 pm on Saturday, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) data.A thick blanket of smog was seen at several places across the national capital as the Diwali celebrations came to an end late Saturday night. Meanwhile, the air quality was at 460 at Anand Vihar, 382 at IGI Airport area, 415 at ITO, and 322 at Lodhi Road for PM 10 pollutant.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pollution-level-in-delhi-higher-this-diwali-than-last-year-says-cpcb/story-ik14XVJTkxGfwcg9PsumWJ.html
15-11-2020||India||Bihar has set template for Bengal, Assam elections, claims CPI-ML chief||National general secretary of the CPI-ML (liberation) Dipankar Bhattarcharya on Sunday said the huge support won by the grand alliance comprising the RJD, Congress and the three left parties has set the template for coming elections in West Bengal, Assam and other states where the polls would be fought on people’s agenda like unemployment, migration, agrarian crisis and opposition to labour law reforms. Bhattacharya, while addressing a press conference on Sunday, said the GA would continue to raise the people’s issues inside the state assembly and outside to register its opposition to the BJP–JD(U) led NDA government and emphasised it was a wrong propaganda being spread by the BJP that there was resentment against the chief minister Nitish Kumar, who was facing anti-incumbency. “The BJP has been an equal stakeholder in power in the NDA government for over a decade and people have put the BJP on the dock as well. If the issue of employment was a poll agenda, the privatisation of railways was also an election issue,” he said. To buttress his point, Bhattarcharya said the poll results of 2020 should not be compared with 2015 and instead compared with 2010 results when the NDA had got a big majority in Bihar even though the UPA was in power at the centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah were not around in national politics. Also Read: Nitish Kumar’s most challenging term“This time, the NDA has managed to form the government with a thin majority. It is clear, there is widespread resentment against both the JD(U) and the BJP among people,” he said. Bhattacharya, whose party won 12 seats in the recently concluded elections, said people of Bihar had shown their resistance against the conspiracy of BJP to have an opposition-free democracy by strongly supporting the GA. Also Read: The Bihar mandate has lessons for all parties“On November 26, the CPI-ML would extend its support to the joint call by trade unions across the country for a strike against the reform in labour laws,” he said. Besides, CPI-ML state secretary Kunal and senior leader Kavita Krishnan too said the party would discharge its responsibility as a strong opposition in the state assembly and outside in coming days and raise issues of employment, migration and poverty in the state. Krishnan also said that the theory being spread by the NDA that women voters gave their support to the NDA overwhelmingly in this state polls was a false propaganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-has-set-template-for-bengal-assam-elections-claims-cpi-ml-chief/story-GOfr9p1yB8xYKlykB0lE3O.html

15-11-2020||India||‘No credibility’, India trashes Pak’s claims of Delhi sponsoring terrorism||India on Sunday rubbished Pakistan’s dossier with so-called evidence of Indian sponsorship of terrorism, saying it was a propaganda exercise that will find few takers as the world community is aware of Islamabad’s role in supporting terror. Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and chief military spokesman Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar had on Saturday released the dossier along with they said were intelligence intercepts that purportedly showed the involvement of Indian intelligence operatives in acts of terrorism. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava responded to the allegations levelled during the “press conference by the Pakistani establishment” by saying: “This is yet another futile anti-India propaganda exercise.” He added, “The so-called claims of ‘proof’ against India enjoy no credibility, are fabricated and represent figments of imagination. This desperate attempt will find few takers as the international community is aware of Pakistan’s tactics and proof of its terror sponsorship has been admitted by none other than its own leadership.” Srivastava noted that al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden, the “face of global terror”, was found in Pakistan, and Prime Minister Imran Khan had “glorified him as a ‘martyr’” on the floor of Parliament. Khan also “admitted the presence of 40,000 terrorists in Pakistan”, and Pakistan’s science and technology minister Fawad Chaudhry “proudly claimed involvement and success of Pakistan, led by its Prime Minister, in the Pulwama terror attack” in 2019 in which 40 Indian troopers were killed, he said. “Despite repeated calls for restraint and adherence to the ceasefire understanding of 2003 for maintaining peace and tranquillity, Pakistani forces continue to engage in providing supporting cover fire to infiltrators. The incessant infiltration of terrorists and induction of weapons to fuel terror activities continues unabated,” Srivastava said. These activities are not possible without the support of Pakistani forces deployed along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, he said. The news conference on Saturday by Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership was a “deliberate attempt on the part of the Pakistani establishment to shift focus from its internal political and economic failures”, Srivastava said. It also sought to “justify cross-border terrorism, including ceasefire violations and infiltration across the LoC and international boundary”, he said. “We call upon Pakistan to end its support to cross-border terrorism. Pakistani leaders have never hidden the fact that it has become a factory for producing terrorists,” Srivastava said. “India is not the only neighbour to be targeted as underlined by the statements of countries similarly targeted. Distant parts of the world have seen the terror trail lead back to Pakistan. Concocting documents and peddling false narratives will not absolve Pakistan of such actions. We are confident the world will hold it to account,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-credibility-india-trashes-pak-s-claims-of-delhi-sponsoring-terrorism/story-UQqc4QnXfHBkY9DeTihH2L.html

Adityanath flew into Dehradun and then accompanied Rawat to Kedarnath where they also took stock of the reconstruction work underway in the town of Kedarpuri near the shrine. On Monday, the portals of Kedarnath shrine will close for the winter season at 8:30 am on the occasion of Bhai Dooj. After offering prayers at Kedarnath, the two chief ministers will head for Badrinath shrine, where Adityanath will offer prayers and lay the foundation stone of a tourist guest house of the Uttar Pradesh government that will be built there. In October 2017, PM Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stones of five major reconstruction projects at the Kedarnath shrine. The projects include improved facilities for devotees, construction of retaining walls and ghats at the Mandakini and Saraswati rivers, an approach road to the shrine and reconstructing the Samadhi Sthal of Adi Shankaracharya, an early eighth-century seer and the founder of the Vedanta school of philosophy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adityanath-visits-kedarnath-ahead-of-closure-ceremony-for-winter/story-u1OafdjOmMPa2YdwPBAQ7K.html
15-11-2020||India||Fire at Assam’s Baghjan gas well finally doused after more than five months||The fire at the Baghjan natural gas well of Oil India Limited (OIL) that had raged from June 9 was finally doused on Sunday after a five-and-half-month effort. The fire was extinguished by a team of experts from Canada, who had reached the site in Tinsukia district on November 4, using a technique called snubbing. “The well has been killed with brine solution and is under control now. The fire has been doused completely,” OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika said in a statement on Sunday. “There is no pressure in the well now and the same will be observed for 24 hours to check if there is any amount of gas migration and pressure build up. Further operation to abandon the well is in progress,” he added. The gas well in Tinsukia district had a blowout (uncontrolled release of oil or gas) during a workover operation on May 27. It caught fire on June 9 killing two firefighters. Another engineer died at the site in September due to electrocution. Though the fire at the wellhead was doused in August and a portion of the released gas diverted for production, the unused gas directed to a flare pit near the well was still blazing. Finally it was decided to ‘kill’ the well by snubbing-a process to install or remove tubular from a well while it remains pressurized (alive). This technique is used when it is not possible or desired to kill a well using a mud-sludge called ‘kill fluid’, a technique which was tried unsuccessfully earlier. Earlier this month, a National Green Tribunal (NGT) panel has stated that OIL was operating well at Baghjan without the required official permissions at the time of the incident. In its progress report filed on November 3, the committee headed by retired Gauhati High Court judge Brojendra Prasad Katakey also recommended directions to be issued to Pollution Control Board, Assam (PCBA) to take legal action against OIL and its officials for violation of mandatory requirements. The committee’s report also mentioned that despite Supreme Court orders, OIL did not carry out biodiversity impact assessment study for the Baghjan well, which is close to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park (DSNP). It stated that OIL had also not taken environmental clearance from the Union environment, forest and climate change ministry before starting drilling operations at Baghjan from November, 2006. Besides the loss of three lives, over a dozen houses located close to the well had been gutted in the fire and nearly 40 others damaged partially. Thousands of people were forced to leave their homes and stay in temporary camps for months while efforts were on to control the blaze. As the well is located close to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park and the Maguri Motapung Wetland there were also apprehensions of damage to ecology due to the blowout and fire. According to OIL, several studies were conducted to access the damage caused and none of them had detected any major harm. Impact on the areas close to the well will be studied after the well is completely brought under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fire-at-assam-s-baghjan-gas-well-finally-doused-after-more-than-five-months/story-ib8oG0BUsgtAYTR5jGgWKN.html

There is a prediction of another wet spell on November 18,” he said.Meteorologist Mohammad Hussain Mir said that snowfall was less this time owing to an increase in night temperatures from November 13. “The snowfall was less as the minimum temperature on the night of November 13 and 14 had increased to 6 degree Celsius which changed the nature of the precipitation. Subsequently tomorrow there would be improvement in weather,” he said.The MeT office said that the maximum temperature in Srinagar was 7.7 degree Celsius while it was 2.3 degree during the Saturday night.The traffic department has asked people to avoid travelling on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway as there are chances of blockades due to landslides.“However subject to fair weather and road conditions, light motor vehicles will be allowed from Jammu to Srinagar,” said the department in a statement.It said that the Mughal Road and Leh-Kargil roads are blocked owing to accumulation of snowAs against the monsoon in the rest of the country, Kashmir mostly owes its precipitation to winds blowing from the Mediterranean Sea which is y called ‘Western Disturbance’.The union territory has been witnessing unusually dry weather this year causing immense problems in the availability of water for irrigation as well as drinking.On November 4, there was very light snowfall in the higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh but there was no precipitation for the plains.The summer this year was abnormally dry.“The year saw abnormally dry weather in J&K. The precipitation due to Western Disturbance was almost zero while the rainfall due to monsoon from July 1 to October 1 was 35 per cent less than normal,” said Mohammad HussainLight to moderate rains also lashed the Jammu region on Sunday afternoon.Traffic police in Jammu advised people against driving to Srinagar on the national highway till Tuesday when the weather is expected to be clear. “The highway is functioning as of now.

15-11-2020||India||Katihar MLA Tarkishore Prasad set to replace Sushil Modi as Bihar’s Dy CM||The selection of Tarkishore Prasad, four-time MLA from Katihar, as the leader of BJP legislature party has put a question mark on the role of Sushil Kumar Modi in Nitish Kumar-led NDA government, which is to be sworn in on Monday. Prasad is being tipped to replace Sushil Kumar Modi as deputy chief minister even as suspense over the BJP candidate for the post continues. “The candidate will be decided soon,” said defence minister Rajnath Singh, who came as party observer on Sunday. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, too, said that the name will be decided soon. A senior BJP functionary, however, confirmed that Prasad will be the deputy CM. What has set the rumour mills agog about the possible new role for Modi, who was deputy CM-cum-finance minister of the state for close to 11 years was that he was called by the BJP’s central leadership to New Delhi on Friday. On Sunday, he was all along moving with the defence minister and was not seen with Nitish Kumar when he went to meet the governor to stake claim to form the government. Modi, later congratulated both Prasad and Renu Devi, who was elected as deputy leader of the party and posted an emotional tweet. “The BJP and the Sangh Parivar gave me so much in the political life of 40 years that no other person would have got it. I will also discharge the responsibility that will be given. No one can take away the post of worker,” Modi tweeted. Prasad, 64, is an intermediate pass from the local D S College Katihar. He won Katihar seat on a BJP ticket in October 2005 and since then he has never lost the seat. Prasad comes from RSS background and he had held several posts in the organization before joining the BJP. He retained the seat even in 2015 when JD-U had allied with the RJD and the Congress.“I’ve been given this responsibility and I’ll carry out the duty to the best of my ability,” said Prasad after being elected as leader of the BJP legislature party in Bihar. He, however, refused to comment on the post of deputy CM. “I can’t comment on it as of now. Whatever responsibility comes, I will take the challenge,” he said. Ranjit Kumar, a resident of Manihari said, “Prasad held several posts in RSS and his elevation in the BJP and in Bihar politics was because of his dedication to the party and the RSS.” Katihar shares a border with West Bengal and experts believe it could be one of the reasons for his elevation in the party ahead of the assembly election in Bengal. “BJP wants to enter West Bengal politics in an emphatic way and hence Tarkishore Prasad was elevated to the post of the leader of BJP in Bihar,” political expert Naresh Kumar Srivasatava said. Prasad’s elevation has been widely hailed by the rank and file of the BJP in Seemanchal. “This is a matter of happiness that a leader of Seemanchal has been offered this coveted post in Bihar,” Rakesh Kumar, BJP president of Purnia district said.In Seemanchal BJP and its ally JD-U won 12 seats out of 24 in with the BJP alone winning eight seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/katihar-mla-tarkishore-prasad-set-to-replace-sushil-modi-as-bihar-s-dy-cm/story-ocFPp7JB7exGYl0vMfb2TI.html

Tweeting about the meeting, O’Farrell said the RSS has been “actively supporting the community during Covid-19”. “... I met with sarsanghchalak Dr Mohan Bhagwat who shared relief measures the organisation has adopted across during these challenging times,” he tweeted.The tweet was a throwback to the 2019 meeting between Bhagwat and German ambassador Walter J Lindner. The German ambassador had also tweeted about the meeting, which set off a storm on social media with many people criticising the meeting.Commenting on his meeting, the Australian High Commissioner said, “Since arriving in India I’ve reached out to all sections of society, civil, business, government and politics, as I seek to gain a greater understanding of the country. During my political career I had an ‘open door policy, which served me well; I intend to continue it as Australia’s representative to India.” The RSS for its part said the meetings are in keeping with the organisation’s outreach. Sangh functionaries have been meeting diplomats formally since 2009 when an ambassador of a European nation hosted a meeting between Bhagwat and 27 other ambassadors.More recently, the Sangh chief has begun holding meetings between diplomats and the foreign press representatives to answer their questions about the Sangh, the ideological fount of the Bharatiya Janata Party.Also Read: It is wrong to think on the basis of ideology which eclipses national interest: PM in JNUIn the past, the then deputy high commissioner and minister-counsellor of Singapore, Jonathan Tow, was present for the Vijayadashami speech in Nagpur in 2012; in August 2016, the president of the Central Tibetan Administration Dr Lobsang Sangay met Bhagwat and in 2018, Kieran Drake, minister-counsellor at the British high commission also called on Bhagwat, which was later described as a courtesy call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australian-high-commissioner-meets-rss-chief-bhagwat-discusses-covid-19-relief/story-0FJgrmW77E0KkTDaw9mA2J.html

The number of farm fires was 43,149 in the state during the same period in 2017.An official from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) said the incidents of stubble burning hit the peak between November 4 and November 7. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi-NCR’s pollution peaked to 42 per cent on November 5, when 4,135 farm fires were recorded in the region.“It was a bumper harvest this year, so the amount of crop residue was also large. Also, it was a cloud-free season as compared to last year. The biomass was drier and prone to burning.“It also appears that the farmers are not willing to cooperate. There could be anger over farm bills,” he said.According to a Punjab government official, “farmers are not happy” as the ruling dispensation has not disbursed the financial incentive to them as directed by the Supreme Court to prevent stubble burning.Following the apex court’s guidelines to incentivise farmers to stop stubble burning, the governments of Punjab and Haryana announced a bonus of Rs 2,500 per acre for small and marginal farmers last year. Farmers say the incentive can help them cover the cost of fuel used in operating machinery for in-situ management of stubble.Harinder Singh Lakhowal, the general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, Punjab, also said the number of farm fires is “very high this year and anger over farm bills is one of the major reasons”.“Unavailability of labourers -- many returned to their native states due to the Covid-19 pandemic -- is also a reason why farmers are burning stubble to clear the fields quickly,” he added.Also Read | Delhi’s air quality turns severe on Diwali: IMDThe IARI official said the increase in the number of incidents of stubble burning does not mean that the policy of providing farm equipment for in-situ management of crop residue has failed.“The numbers of stubble burning incidents in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh tell a different story altogether. The figures have come down significantly,” he said.According to IARI’s data, Haryana recorded 4,699 farm fires between October 1 and November 12 while Uttar Pradesh reported 2,288 such incidents during the period, which is the lowest in both the states in the last five years.Haryana recorded 5,807 incidents of stubble burning and Uttar Pradesh 2,653 cases during the corresponding period last year.“In Punjab also, the number of cases was reducing every year till 2019. Only 2020 has been the ‘odd’ year out,” the IARI official said.According to a study conducted by IARI scientists in Tarn Taran and Amritsar districts of Punjab, stubble burning incidents between October 1 and October 10 in Amritsar increased from 180 in 2019 to 515 in 2020 -- a rise of about 2.9 times.In Tarn Taran, the number of stubble burning incidents increased from 92 in 2019 to 341 in 2020 -- a rise of about 3.7 times.“It is estimated that the harvested area increased by 35,500 hectares in Amritsar and by 39,300 hectares in Tarn Taran by October 10 this year as compared to last year.“It indicates a significant early harvesting of paddy in these two districts this year, which may be on account of early planting of paddy by about 7-10 days, an increase in the proportion of area under short-duration varieties, and a clear weather during 2020 as compared to a cloudy weather in 2019 during the same period,” the study said.“By October 10, the proportion of burnt area to harvested area in Amritsar increased from 38 per cent in 2019 to 74.6 per cent in 2020. In Tarn Taran, it increased from 30.9 per cent in 2019 to 60.9 per cent in 2020,” it added.Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh attract attention during the paddy harvesting season between October 15 and November 15.Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left behind after harvesting paddy and before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR.Last year, Punjab produced around two crore tonnes of paddy residue, of which 98 lakh tonnes were burnt by farmers.Farmers in Haryana burnt 12.3 lakh tonnes of the 70 lakh tonnes of paddy residue produced.Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to defy it as there is a short window between the harvesting of paddy and the sowing of wheat.Also Read | MeT office sounds hail, rain warning for parts of Delhi, NCRThe high cost of manual or mechanical management of straw is a major reason why farmers choose to burn it.State governments are providing a 50 to 80-per cent subsidy to farmers and cooperative societies to buy modern farm equipment for in-situ management of paddy straw, installing paddy straw-based power plants and running a massive awareness campaign against stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/angry-over-farm-bills-punjab-records-highest-stubble-burning-cases-in-4-years/story-YH7PAIxgB028Btm4eEGetK.html

The tests would help the defence services to further improve the performance of the missile system, government sources told ANI.In the last two months, DRDO has been successful in testing both new and existing missile systems including the Shaurya missile system which can hit targets at over 800 km and technology demonstration vehicles for hypersonic missile technology.Recently, the Indian Air Force had flown its Sukhoi-30 aircraft from the Halwara air base in Punjab and launched the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile at an old warship acting as its target in the Bay of Bengal area. The air-launched version of the missile has been used to equip a squadron of the Air Force in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu.The BrahMos-equipped aircraft from the squadron were also deployed close to the Northern borders soon after the conflict with China had started and 20 Indian soldiers lost their lives in the Galwan valley in a clash with the Chinese Army.Also Read | Russia to consider India’s request for speedy delivery of S-400 air defence systemsLast month, the Indian Navy had also carried out the test firing of the Brahmos missile from its warship INS Chennai to showcase its capability to strike targets at ranges more than 400 km in high seas.India is also working on finding export markets for the supersonic cruise missile which has been indigenised to a large extent by the DRDO under its project PJ 10.After the launch of the joint venture between India and Russia in the late 90s, the Brahmos supersonic cruise missile has become a potent weapon for the all three armed forces which are using them for different roles in different trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-carry-out-multiple-launches-of-brahmos-supersonic-cruise-missiles-by-month-end/story-KucmNkZrxFh6WzAWuoOLXI.html

The zone recorded 70.28 dB on November 9.The silence zone registered 68.55 dB during window hour, from 8pm to 10pm against the permissible limit of 50dB, while the same zone recorded 66.5 dB during post window hours, from 10pm to 12midnight, against the limit of 40 dB.The permissible limits for silence zone are 50 dB during day (6am to 10pm) and 40 dB at night (10pm to 6am).Similarly, Ashok Nagar, city’s posh locality, recorded average decibel at 71.28 during six hours against the limit of 55 dB in day and 45 dB at night. The area registered 74.45 decibel during allotted hours against the limit of 55 dB and 71.6 dB after that from 10pm to 12 midnight, against the permissible limit of 45 dB.The residential area had registered an average 57.85 dB in six hours during pre-Diwali measurement. The commercial zones Albert Ekka Chowk recorded average sound pollution at 78.41 dB and Kutchery Chowk at 74.31dB during the six-hour period. Permissible limits for commercial areas are 65 dB in day and 55 dB at night.The commercial zones registered 70.9 dB and 72.36 dB respectively during pre-Diwali assessment on November 9.Albert Ekka Chowk registered 80.9 dB during the allotted hours and 73.75 during post window hours. Similarly, Kutchery Chowk recorded 74.31dB during window hours and 71.3 during post window hours on Diwali night.JSPCB analyst RN Kashyap said, “The increase in sound pollution during post window hours seems due to unawareness of Diwali revelers. It seems that the order of two-hour window had not reached many residents.”“In some places like Albert Ekka Chowk, rise in noise level is appearing due to some other factors such as loud speakers and vehicular sound,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sound-pollution-spikes-66-in-ranchi-s-silence-zone-on-diwali-in-prohibited-hours/story-CNPVkqFtC12OV0Jfvb9AkI.html

PDP leaders confirmed that Beigh has resigned and conveyed his decision to Mehbooba Mufti, who is the president of the party. “The news about his resignation hasn’t been denied by Beigh or the PDP. So, it’s true,” said a senior PDP leader.Beigh had previously served as deputy chief minister of the erstwhile state and also as a member of parliament (MP) from Baramulla Lok Sabha seat. Among the senior most leaders of the party, Beigh had mostly stayed away from party activities since last year when Centre abrogated Article 370 that had conferred special status to Jammu and Kashmir. However, Beigh’s wife Safeena Beigh, who is the president of PDP’s Women’s wing, has been actively attending party meetings after the release of PDP leaders, especially the PDP president, from detention. Beigh is now planning a press conference in the coming few days to chalk out his future strategy. Some leaders are still trying to convince Beigh to stay within the party. Neither Muzaffar Beigh nor his wife Safeena Beigh responded to calls or messages. PDP too, has not made any official announcement about Beigh’s resignation.PDP leaders claimed that Beigh was upset since his wife was not given a ticket from Sangrama block on a seat reserved for women, resulting in the seat going to a National Conference candidate. Beigh feels that PDP didn’t do much to secure a seat for the party candidate in Sangrama.“Beigh wanted a seat from Sangrama and despite request from the PDP, NC local leadership didn’t relent, which became the reason for his resignation,” said a senior PDP leader, close to party president.Also Read: Army holds pre-recruitment training camp in J-K’s Poonch districtThere have been strong indications that Beigh will leave the party, especially after the formation of the Apni Party in March this year, when almost two dozen PDP leaders, including many former legislators and ministers, left the party to join the new party.Earlier, PAGD leadership decided to contest the DDC polls jointly; however, after NC candidates cornered most seats released in the first list, leaders from other parties in the alliance raised questions over the distribution of seats. NC president Farooq Abdullah who is the chairman of the PAGD was authorised to select the candidates for the DDC polls. On Saturday, another meeting was held at the residence of PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, in which further deliberations were held on the names of the candidates for the remaining phases of the polls.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, however, said that the PAGD has bigger cause to fight for than petty electoral gains. “PAGD was formed solely to safeguard the identity of people of J&K that has been under constant attack since August 2019. To assume it was created for petty electoral gains or to further party interests is erroneous. We have a bigger cause to fight for than bicker over DDC elections,” tweeted Mehbooba Mufti. Also Read: ‘Initiate dialogue’: Mehbooba Mufti asks Centre after shelling at LoCPeoples’ Conference chairman, Sajjad Lone, while endorsing the tweet of Mufti hinted that there are differences on the distribution of seats.“I agree with every word and would further add that the reality, as it exists, is that statesmanship and magnanimity is still a missing trait in our polity. And the absence is being felt more than any other time,” Sajad Lone tweeted.Besides the National Conference and the PDP, the Peoples’ Conference, the CPI (M), and the Awami National Conference are part of the PAGD. The National Conference and the PDP had stayed away from the panchayat polls in 2018. Peoples’ Conference however participated in the elections. Congress has also said that they are part of the alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdp-founder-quits-over-ddc-poll-ticket-mehbooba-urges-focus-on-bigger-cause/story-M3w0Kfvd8VqzyeZkhhz8uM.html

15-11-2020||India||Goa CM Pramod Sawant pledges to cut coal handling at Mormugao port by 50%||The Goa government plans to reduce coal handling at the Mormugao port by 50%, chief minister Pramod Sawant said Sunday while speaking during an interaction with children who had called on him to urge him to stop coal import because of pollution in localities around the port and railway line. The children met Sawant while he was exiting a function.The children who were accompanied by a few adults, carried placards demanding the stoppage of coal import to reduce pollution. The group was part of a larger anti-coal import agitation in Goa. Sawant, who last week met Union Minister for Shipping Mansukh Mandaviya said efforts were on to reduce the quantity of coal imported through the port by exploring other commodities or services that could be promoted at the port. “I assure you coal import and handling will drop by 50 per cent. We will reduce coal and are in the process of stopping it as soon as possible. We cannot stop it altogether. Industries are on (have been running) for 40 years,” Sawant said. “There are 2,000 people working there. They also have small children. We have to give them other employment first and then stop coal. Once the other work starts, we will reduce coal and completely shut it down. Give us some time,” Sawant said. Around 12-14 million metric tons of coal and coke is imported via Goa’s Mormugao Port primarily by steel units in north Karnataka. Goa has seen intermittent protests against the state government’s plans to enhance the coal handling at the port as envisaged under the Sagarmala programme. The protests intensified over the last few months after the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests cleared a plan for double tracking of a railway line passing through the Western Ghats coupled with other infrastructure projects, which environmentalists have said is being done solely to enhance the coal ferrying capacity via rail from the port to the industries in the hinterland. A Change.org petition asking for the scrapping of the projects started by a group of students has garnered around 150,000 signatures over a few days. “It will spell permanent damage to the tiger’s habitat, as the path of the project was already marked as tiger reserve by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. In this region other than trees, there are 5,000 flowering plant species, 139 mammal species, 508 bird species, 179 amphibian species and 325 globally threatened species of wildlife reside here. The doubling of railway lines project is set up for coal transport across states and in order to connect with the Mormugao port which will bring out a lot of pollution,” says the petition.However, Sawant has said that the projects will bring other benefits as well. “People think double tracking is being done for coal. We are creating infrastructure for passengers and other commodities too,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-pramod-sawant-pledges-to-cut-coal-handling-at-mormugao-port-by-50/story-Qu4NhcF8oZQBuZTJclfaHI.html

Four civilians including a woman and a seven-year-old boy were also killed in the exchange of firing in Uri, Naugam, Keran and Gurez sectors.“Without any reason, Pakistan indulged in ceasefire violation using heavy artillery which prompted us to respond. We have also suffered some damage including the martyrdom of sub-inspector Rakesh Dobhal,” said Inspector General of BSF, Rajesh Mishra, after paying tributes to his slain colleague.The BSF said Pakistan started unprovoked ceasefire violations on the LoC on November 13, using artillery, mortars and other weapons targeting even the civilian areas. Dobhal, a 2004 batch sub inspector from BSF’s artillery regiment, was hit in the firing in Naugam sector of Kupwara. He is survived by his parents, wife and a daughter, who all live in district Dehradun (Uttrakhand).“Pakistan used heavy weapons in this firing which was without any provocation. BSF and army responded fearlessly but in the firing, army jawans were also killed as well as a lot of damage was inflicted on civilians including civilian casualties,” Mishra said.Also Read: India summons Pakistani chargé d’affaires to protest civilian deaths in LoC shellingArmy also paid tributes to its slain men; Havildar Hardhan Chandra Roy (38) from Assam, Naik Satai Bhushan Rameshrao (28) from Nagpur, Gunner Subodh Ghosh (22) from West Bengal and Sepoy Jondhale Rushikesh Ramchandra (20) from Maharashtra, who gave their lives on November 13.In a solemn ceremony at BB Cantt, Lt Gen BS Raju, Chinar Corps Commander, and all ranks paid homage to the soldiers who had received splinter injuries in Uri and Gurez sectors.The IG BSF said that the forces responded fiercely during the violation.“In our befitting response, Pakistan defenses were also hit and I understand they have suffered a lot of damages,” he said.Also Read: PM Modi rides on Arjun’s ‘aatmanirbhar’ fire power to send message to Pakistan, ChinaPakistan media quoting Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) has blamed India for the ceasefire violation on November 13. It has said that a Pakistani army soldier and four civilians were killed in Indian firing on Friday.The BSF officer said that militants were waiting on launching pads on the other side of LoC to infiltrate into the country.“As per our inputs, the infiltrators are ready there on launching pads. Around 250-300 are present on each launching pad and make every effort to infiltrate into the country and target the internal security here but army and BSF have remained successful to a large extent in thwarting those efforts,” Mishra said.India and Pakistan, who have fought at-least three wars since 1947, had agreed in 2003 to maintain peace along the border, but violations intensified after bilateral relations plummeted in 2016. India often accuses Pak of violating the ceasefire to give cover to infiltrating militants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-says-pak-s-bid-to-push-250-300-terrorists-from-each-launchpad-foiled/story-CMhGIaEGLt0lJ1a7MawTKL.html

15-11-2020||India||Expected surge in Covid-19 cases post Diwali will not lead to shortage of beds in Mumbai||With the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) expecting a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases post Diwali; it has at the same time maintained that the possible spike post the festival should not pose a challenge to the availability of Covid-19 beds in the city.From over 14,000 beds available in Covid-19 hospitals, 66% are vacant, BMC officials said.In categories like ICU, oxygen and ventilators the vacancy rate is between 30-60%. The BMC has said there will not be any impact on the bed availability, and if need arises it can increase the bed capacity depending on the requirement.According to the data on BMC’s dashboard, of the 14,456 beds in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and centres, 9,580 beds were vacant, as of November 14.In case of ICU beds, out of the total 2,003 ICU beds, 803 are available followed by 5,987 oxygen beds of the total 8,689 oxygen beds and 373 ventilators of 1,183 ventilators, are vacant.After the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, BMC had come under criticism owing to non-availability of beds. To deal with the issue, the BMC starting June 2020, created 24 mini controlled ward war rooms to regulate the allocation of beds rather than having a single centralized bed allocation control room.Suresh Kakani, Additional Municipal Commissioner of BMC said, “The 14 days cycle post Diwali is crucial, and there may be a surge upto some extent. But bed availability will not be an issue and citizens don’t need to worry about it. However, they need to be cautious and take all precautions to control the spread of Covid-19.”The BMC had reserved 80% of the total beds for Covid-19 in a few chosen private hospitals and nursing homes. However, with the daily case load going down several hospitals and nursing homes had requested to bring down the cap and reduce Covid-19 beds, but the BMC has not allowed that yet.The BMC had also decided to put several temporary Covid-19 centres on standby or shut them owing to the caseload going down. But the state Covid-19 taskforce has warned against permanently closing down such centres fearing a second wave.Meanwhile, Dr Kedar Toraskar, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force said, “We understand that daily operation of these centres can be a costly affair but we don’t have to shut them but should rather put them on standby wherein they can be activated anytime, in case of any spike in the coming days.”The state government had last week warned of a possible second wave in the month of January and February owing to unlocking of economic activities. There is also a school of thought that cases will increase during the winter season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expected-surge-in-covid-19-cases-post-diwali-will-not-lead-to-shortage-of-beds-in-mumbai/story-SA5BLtsZkkBihU5CV8vuoL.html

A network has been formed in several places of the state. Even Bangladesh leader Khaleda Zia has said the terrorists are being trained in India and sent to Bangladesh to create disturbance.

Several political parties cane come here and contest. That doesn’t matter to the BJP. Our party has created a good atmosphere to conduct polls. Around 45 per cent people of Bengal cast their votes for the BJP. They have full faith in us. The TMC, CPI(M), Congress, AIMIM, all the parties can merge together.

15-11-2020||India||PM Modi spells out the offensive-defensive doctrine for India||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s friends and detractors know that there is nothing casual about the man from Gujarat. He practises his speeches, measures his words and then articulates the message for maximum impact. Addressing the tri-services at historic Longewala, where a Punjab regiment company and Air Force Hunters destroyed 40 Pakistani tanks in 1971 conflict, Modi spelt out the Indian war strategy and it was certainly not pacifist. He said that India is willing to understand or make the adversary understand but there will be fiery retaliation if the enemy tries to test its military might. Simply put, India is not seeking confrontation but will stand its ground in case it is confronted. In Modi’s speech there was a message for both domestic and international audience. He skipped the East Asia Summit to be with Indian troops on Diwali Day and deputed External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on his behalf. US President Donald Trump did not attend the summit even last time and Cambodian leader was under quarantine.That Modi was not war mongering and meant business is will known to Pakistan during the Balakot Strike on February 26, 2019. After Pakistani propaganda started posting pictures of a captured and bleeding Wing Commander Abhinandan, Modi let it be known to Islamabad through then ISI chief that India will launch a missile strike if any harm came to the Indian Air Force pilots. He conveyed through interlocutors that “humne Diwali ke patake nahin rakh rakhe (we have not kept Diwali crackers in our arsenal)” and asked the Indian Prithvi Missiles to be deployed in the same Rajasthan sector. Such was the impact of the message that the MiG-21 Indian pilot was set free by the Pakistan government the very next day.Also Read | PM Modi rides on Arjun’s ‘aatmanirbhar’ fire power to send message to Pakistan, ChinaWithout naming China, PM Modi took on the expansionist policies of the present Chinese regime by saying that it was a product of 18th century twisted mindset and that India would firmly oppose it. By saying this the PM countered the Chinese description of rapidly emerging QUAD, with US, Japan and Australia as other members, as a product of Cold War mindset.At Longewala, he again reiterated the Indian resolve to take the battle to the enemy or extinguish the threat to India at the source. Clearly, this is the new offensive-defensive doctrine of India, which coupled with building of airborne and expeditionary force projection capability, will ensure that future battles are not fought on Indian soil.Prime Minister Modi’s statement should not be seen in isolation but in context of what his Cabinet minister ranked National Security Advisor Ajit Doval said on banks of River Ganga at Rishikesh on October 22 and what External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said at the East Asia Summit on Diwali. The message from both was not sugar coated but expression of what India expects from the neighbours in terms of cross-border terrorism and freedom to navigate the South China sea and resist any attempts to make it into Chinese pond. Without seeking any acrimony or confrontation with Beijing, what Jaishankar conveyed on Saturday was a reiteration of PM Modi’s conversation with the then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the first summit meeting in 2014. At that time, it alarmed the Indian mandarins but Modi did not flinch from what he had to convey. It is another matter, that Jaishankar was among the more moderate voices on South China Sea at the East Asia Summit.While India and China are on track to disengage and de-escalate from East Ladakh to mutual satisfaction, India is neither over-negotiating with PLA to bring the Depsang bulge issue into the current resolution nor is it willing to cede an inch of territory from the friction points at Galwan, Gogra-Hot Springs and finger 4 spur on the north banks of the Pangong Tso. Under Modi, India has decided to call a spade a spade by building a pro-India lobby in the world and is prepared to defend its own interests by choosing its friends and degrading its enemies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-spells-out-the-offensive-defensive-doctrine-for-india/story-Ik7AHB2S5Heyr2Km7rWzNO.html
15-11-2020||India||End of an era: Soumitra Chatterjee, Ray’s all-time favourite protagonist in iconic films will live on||The curtains came down on an era in Bengali cinema as Soumitra Chatterjee, 85, the most illustrious protégé of legendary director Satyajit Ray, died at a private hospital in south Kolkata at 12.15 pm on Sunday. He was suffering from Covid encephalopathy. With the Dadasaheb Phalke Award winner’s death, a 61-year-long journey in movies and theatre that were influenced by Bengal’s history, creation of Bangladesh, the Emergency and rise of Marxism and shaped by the works of immortal writers, came to an end. Most of the great actors with whom Chatterjee shared screen space - Chhabi Biswas, Uttam Kumar, Utpal Dutta and Subhendu Chatterjee to name just a few -- passed away over the decades. Chatterjee was the last male face of what the veterans often referred to as the golden age. The chronicle of his life, which gave the audience around 300 movies in monochrome and colour, stands as testimony. When Mohit Kumar Chatterjee and his wife, Asha, had their second son on January 19, 1935, nobody in the family possibly thought that the name Soumitra would touch a chord with millions someday. Fondly called Pulu, a nickname the Chatterjees found apt for the naughty boy who would run around the family’s home at Krishnanagar in Nadia district, Soumitra showed the first signs of a performer among the four siblings at a rather young age. “Our family moved to Howrah when I was around ten. I was the high jump champion at the Howrah Zilla School. My parents had great influence on me. My father inspired me to be an actor while my mother guided me into the world of poetry,” Chatterjee said during a television show in 2010, six years after he had been awarded the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award given by the Government of India. The veteran was already 75 in 2010, but real recognition for the performer inside him had not yet come. Unlike no other actor in Indian cinema, Chatterjee played key roles in as many as 14 movies Ray made between 1959 and 1990. Most of these received national and international acclaim but Chatterjee, despite his outstanding performance in some, never got the national award for acting. These movies included Apur Sansar (The World of Apu), the third in Ray’s internationally acclaimed Apu Trilogy, in which Chatterjee made his debut in 1959 as the husband of another debutant, 15-year-old Sharmila Tagore. Ray became Chatterjee’s mentor. Their partnership lasted till Ray’s second last movie, Shakha Proshakha (Branches of the Tree), released in 1990. Their 31-year-long journey became unique as Ray made Chatterjee walk in and out of diverse characters such as private detective Pradosh Mitra or, a village teacher (Hirak Rajar Deshe or The Kingdom of Diamonds, 1980) who led people into a rebellion against an autocratic king played by another doyen of Bengali cinema and theatre Utpal Dutta. The other movies of Ray in which Chatterjee stood out are Abhijan (The Expedition, 1962), Charulata (The Lonely Wife, 1964), Aranyer Din Ratri (Days and Nights in the Forest, 1969), Ashani Sanket (Distant Thunder, 1973), Ghare Baire (The Home and The World, 1984) and Ganashatru (Enemy of the People, 1989). Director Shyam Benegal, while commenting on Chatterjee during an interview, said, “He has worked particularly for Satyajit Ray. All the films he has made for Ray are so extraordinary. He fits into the role in a way that he becomes the person you would know immediately. That’s a brilliant quality in an actor and he has that.” Chatterjee, who graduated from City College and got his master’s degree in Bengali literature from the Calcutta University, was immensely inspired by thespian Sisir Kumar Bhaduri, an icon in his time. Chatterjee joined theatre after college and got a job as an announcer at the All India Radio (AIR) where he worked for about two years. “I was closely associated with the great Sisir Kumar Bhaduri. It was almost predestined that I should be an actor. I made up my mind when I was doing my graduation. But I never thought that I would be a famous film star. Before witnessing a revolutionary change in India with Pather Panchali (the first part of the Apu Trilogy and released in 1955) I had a snobbish kind of an idea about cinema. I didn’t like Bengali cinema in those days,” Chatterjee candidly said during an interview decades after his debut. Although he shared screen space with acclaimed performers such as Uttam Kumar, Utpal Dutt, Suchitra Sen, Tanuja and Sharmila Tagore, Chatterjee, unlike these co-actors, was always reluctant to try his luck in the Mumbai film industry. He appeared in only two full-length Hindi movies; Nirupama (1986), which was a telefilm, and Hindustani Sipahi (2002). Both were made by Bengali directors who had cast local actors. Some of the movies Chatterjee worked in were, however, later remade in Mumbai. Often described by critics and fans as the hero of intellectual moviegoers and not the masses, Chatterjee also worked for nationally acclaimed Mrinal Sen and Tapan Sinha. He played the lead in Sen’s Akash Kusum (Up In the Clouds, 1965) opposite Aparna Sen, his life-long friend and co-actor in many projects. The movie was remade in Hindi 10 years later by another legendary director, Basu Chatterjee. Starring Amitabh Bachchan and Moushumi Chatterjee, Manzil (destination) did moderate business but its music composed by R D Burman remains a chartbuster. With Sinha, Chatterjee worked in Khudita Pashan (Hungry Stones, 1960), Jhinder Bandi (the Prisoner of Jhind, 1961) and Atonko (Fear, 1984). Based on a novel by Sharadindu Bandopadhyay who was inspired by Anthony Hope’s 1894 novel, The Prisoner of Zenda, Jhinder Bandi saw Chatterjee playing a ruthless villain for the first time, and that too against Uttam Kumar who was then the star of Bengali cinema. Chatterjee received the highest awards from the Government of India rather late in life. He even refused the Padma Shree twice as he felt that his prowess had not been recognized. “I have long since lost all interest in these awards because they have so often been awarded to someone who didn’t deserve them. It is not an ego problem. It is just reasonable thinking. I have acted in 14 of Ray’s films and I have not been considered to be the best actor in any of them,” Chatterjee once said during an interview. Chatterjee received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1998 and 2011, the Padma Bhusan in 2004 and the National Film Award for acting in Podokkhep (footsteps) in 2006 although two of his more well-known movies got the National Film Award in 1991 and 2000. Finally, in 2012, Chatterjee received the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke award and, in 2018, the government of France honoured him with the Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur, (Legion of Honour) the highest civilian award in France. But here too, Chatterjee followed his mentor. Ray received the award from the French government in 1987. Chatterjee gave an emotional speech after accepting the Dadasaheb Phalke Award from Hamid Ansari, the Vice-President of India. “I am really not in a frame of mind to say anything about this. All my life I am have been plagued with a doubt about my work and always thought that maybe this business of entertainment is not really worthwhile. And I have always thought that if I could instead do something like Albert Schweitzer and go away to a distant leper colony and serve people, my life would have been worthwhile. But time and again for the last more than 50 years, I have been accepted, loved and made to feel as one of their own by my countrymen. I love them. I respect them. They are the reason I have come this far…. I salute them that they have supplied me with the energy and the determination to continue with what I believe in and what I think to be good art..,” said Chatterjee. The recognition moved some of the stalwarts in the Indian film industry. “Mr Chatterjee getting the Phalke award is eminently deserved. I think he is one of those actors who would be counted as one the best in the world,” director Govind Nihalni said in an interview. An ardent follower of literature, a writer and a poet, Chatterjee loved drawing sketches as well. But he never left theatre, his first passion. He presented his first play during his college days and directed or acted in a dozen more over the next few decades. In November 2010, Chatterjee put on makeup and Celtic costumes to appear on stage at the age of 75 as Raja Lear (Kind Lear), a play based on the tragedy by William Shakespeare and directed by Suman Mukhopadhyay. As he won accolades for the role, Chatterjee said at a literary festival that he would like to do Macbeth but was not sure if his health would permit it. A statement Chatterjee made during his last interview to a Bengali news channel a few months ago showed the world his indomitable spirit and perhaps his vulnerability as well. “I feel alive because I am still acting,” he said. Nothing could be more true for a man who surprised the YouTube generation in 2015 by playing the husband of Radhika Apte, an actor a third his age, in Sujoy Ghosh’s 14-minute film, Ahalya. Some of the films iconic actor Soumitra Chatterjee will be remembered for: Apur Sansar, 1959 Khudita Pashan, 1960 Devi, 1960 Jhinder Bandi, 1961 Teen Kanya, 1961 Abhijan, 1962 Akash Kusum, 1965 Aranyer Din Ratri, 1969 Teen Bhubaner Paare, 1969 Prathom Kadam Phool, 1969 Baksho Badal, 1970 Stree, 1972 Ashani Sanket, 1973 Basanta Bilap, 1973 Sonar Kella, 1974 Ganadevta, 1978 Hirak Rajar Deshe, 1980 Ghare Baire, 1984 Atonko, 1984 Kony, 1986 Ganashatru, 1989 Shakha Proshakha, 1990 Asukh, 1999 Bela Seshe, 2015 Ahalya, 2015 Sanjhbati, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/end-of-an-era-soumitra-chatterjee-ray-all-time-favourite-protagonist-in-iconic-films/story-07c64jZuD2AClBrO8JFM2J.html
15-11-2020||India||In Mumbai, BMC begins restoration of British era heritage milestones||After a delay of about two years since it was first planned, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday started work on restoration of 11 British era heritage milestone markers of the city. These milestones are approximately 200 years old, according to information from BMC, and were installed to mark the distance from St Thomas Cathedral near Horniman Circle in Fort, which is considered the zero milestone. There are supposed to be 15 or 16 such milestones in the city limits, of which 11 have been traced so far.The restoration process includes excavating buried milestones, cleaning and polishing the surface, reinstalling them in the original location on a raised platform, with an information plaque next to the stone. Each milestone will have a QR Code tag as well, that tourists can scan on their mobile phones to view the entire milestone heritage circuit. While those 11 that have been traced will be restored as per this plan, BMC plans to install replicas in place of those that have not been traced to commemorate a heritage spot.Rahul Chemburkar from Vaastuvidhaan, which has been appointed as the conservation architect consultant for the project said, “The unique selling point of this project is the QR code, that will enable us to create a heritage circuit of all milestones, tying up the circuit together digitally.” If a tourist comes across any one milestone, they can scan the QR code, and will be able to access map showing the entire heritage circuit, the distance and directions to the next milestone from the tourist’s present location, and more information about the history and relevance of each milestone. The Cooperage Bandstand, and the Kothari Pyau also have similar QR codes, and both were restored by Vaastuvidhaan. These are also part of heritage circuits, for example the Kothari Pyau will be part of a circuit of 22 such pyaus, that will be restored by the civic body over the next few months.Chemburkar said, “We need to give these distance markers their due importance. Its relevance today is a history marker, even though in those times it was used to measure the distance in the city limits which were quite limited.”In the past three years various initiatives have been taken up by different stakeholders to reinstate a few milestones in the city, at the BMC ward level. This project will cost an estimated Rs 26 lakh, and will take about three months to complete.The project was first pitched in 2018 before BMC’s Heritage Committee and has been in the pipeline due to cost and design revisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-mumbai-bmc-begins-restoration-of-british-era-heritage-milestones/story-24yCmZ13LJSRwVYJTgVE0O.html

Barring a handful of incidents in some pockets, the festival was marked for the first time as one without air and noise pollution. The vigilant Kolkata Police seized a few thousand kilos of fireworks before and during the festival and arrested 294 people. The Kolkata Police tweeted photos of the city skyline in the middle of the night to show the effect of the ban.  #SayNoToCrackersHappy Diwali..Our city as on tonight ...@CPKolkata @KolkataPolice pic.twitter.com/jKhdqaTKis“This became possible only because of the level of consciousness among citizens. People followed the rules in the interest of society,” said urban development minister Firhad Hakim. The court had banned the use of all types of fireworks in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I cannot believe this. For elderly people who suffer from asthma like me, the festival of lights turns into a nightmare. I felt so relieved,” said Saradindu Roy, 75, a resident of Gariahat in south Kolkata. The districts, however, stayed behind Kolkata with fireworks used at random in some parts. A minor girl even died of burn injuries in the Kaliachak area of Mala district in a fireworks related accident. There were, however, a few incidents of accidental fire in Kolkata. Part of a slum at Baguiati in east Kolkata was gutted when one of the rooms caught fire from candles and the flames spread to adjacent homes. In another incident, an elderly woman died inside her home in central Kolkata when her saree caught fire from an oil lamp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-residents-create-history-on-diwali-by-shunning-fireworks/story-QjHlq3BGMyHhJauz761wHL.html

15-11-2020||Editorials||Nitish Kumar’s most challenging term||With the legislators of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) parties electing Nitish Kumar as their leader, and Mr Kumar staking claim to form the government on the basis of the majority in the new Bihar assembly, the state is set to see a government marked by continuity and change. In his first full term, Mr Kumar’s core challenge was to restore the governance functions of the State — and there is no doubt that he performed admirably well. In his second and third term, Mr Kumar took his eyes off the governance ball and spent an inordinate amount of time and energy in shifting political alliances — he left the NDA in 2013, resigned as chief minister in 2014, came back to take his position at the helm of government in 2015, allied with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) to win state elections that year, and then shifted back to the NDA in 2017 to cement an uneasy partnership with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In this election, Mr Kumar paid a price for his governance and political deficits — becoming a distant third in Bihar’s political landscape, his brand depleted, and dependent almost entirely on the BJP. This constrained mandate now makes his challenge in this term more acute. Mr Kumar has to first deal with political management. He will have to concede a greater share of power and decision-making to the BJP. This will keep both allies always suspicious of each other’s intent and ultimate game plan. Mr Kumar will also have to contend with a strong and possibly effective RJD in opposition, and this will be a greater challenge since the RJD has raised questions about the legitimacy of the elections. He will also have to sustain his own social base of extreme backward classes without antagonising the upper castes. But his real challenge is on the governance front. The pandemic has exposed Bihar’s weak health infrastructure — and greater public investment is now essential to improve the state of Bihar’s hospitals and improve the ratio of medical personnel to citizens. The election has also shown that Bihar is desperate now for the next stage of economic reforms which can generate employment at home and reduce distress caused by migration. Mr Kumar must find ways to generate jobs locally. Unless he can get both his politics and governance matrix right, there is a possibility that Mr Kumar may begin this term — but not end it as chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/nitish-kumar-s-most-challenging-term/story-wsn7YpaA2LAvQGDUms5LdI.html
