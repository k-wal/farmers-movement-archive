20-11-2020||News||Pakistan: Where fact and fiction come together||Lt General (retd) Asad Durrani, who headed Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in the early 1990s, is no stranger to controversy. Two years ago, along with AS Dulat, chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in late 1990s, he co-authored The Spy Chronicles: RAW, ISI and The Illusion of Peace. The slim volume, based on their conversations on the Track II circuit (he describes this as a circus), covered India-Pakistan relations, Kashmir and cross-border terrorism, and got him into trouble in Pakistan. The ISI hauled him over the coals, a court of enquiry suspended his pension and other retirement benefits and he was barred from leaving the country. He has since been pursuing lawsuits to get his entitlements restored.He has authored a novel, Honour Among Spies that describes the travails of a Pakistani Lt General Osama Barakzai (Zirak branch of the Durrani tribe) who gets into trouble with his parent organisation (Guards) ostensibly for co-authoring a book with Indian ex-spy chief Randhir Singh. However, as he plays cat and mouse with his interrogators and engages in verbal duelling with colleagues from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and MI6, Osama finds other plausible reasons for his troubles, pointing the spotlight at the establishment (a popular euphemism for the Army and ISI). Despite the disclaimer that “though inspired by some real events, this is a work of fiction”, such a book would be explosive at any time in Pakistan. But appearing as the domestic political scene heats up for Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan, Durrani may find that he has more than a bestseller on his hands. Fiction: Osama Barakzai was appointed to head the Intelligence outfit in the Guards by the Chief Akram Moghul in 1990. Both came under a cloud in a case filed by Admiral Khan for using Yousaf Haseeb, a banker, for channelling slush funds to Naveen Shaikh to dislodge the incumbent woman PM. Part of the money is unaccounted for and Barakzai points the finger at Moghul who feels vengeful. The case lingers on through Pakistan’s courts and the current tribal chief, Jabbar Jatt, shares a sub-tribal loyalty with Moghul. He had been appointed by Naveen Shaikh (in power from 2013-17) but since switched loyalties to Khurshid Kadri.Another thread in Barakzai’s ruminations leads to the female terrorist mastermind, Uzma bint Laden, who was living incognito in Jacobabad and killed in 2011 in a daring raid by United States (US) Navy Seals. Barakzai, who had long retired, and, after a couple of diplomatic assignments, is now active on the conference circuit and a sought-after commentator on TV channels, suggests on BBC about the possibility of complicity between the Guards and the US agency. The story passes as it absolves the Guards (under then Chief Raja Rasalu) of incompetence that they were unable to detect the incoming raid. The problem resurfaces as US investigative journalist Simon Hirsh uncovers a Pakistani mole, Baqar Bhatti, who had walked into the US embassy to inform them about the fugitive, indicating collusion. Adding to this mix is the tricky relationship with India with the Narendra Modi government’s assertive policy of surgical strikes after Uri, the air strike at Balakot after the Pulwama attack and conversations between Barakzai and Randhir Singh to keep alive the hopes of the composite dialogue initiated by former Indian PM KL Gujjar and pursued by the opening up of Sardarpur shrine. Fact: Lt Gen Durrani was DG (MI) and Gen Mirza Aslam Beg appointed him DG(ISI) in 1990. Both were interrogated in the case filed in 1996 by late Air Marshal Asghar Khan, accusing the Army of funding Nawaz Sharif in the 1990 elections against Benazir Bhutto through Younis Habib, CEO of Mehran Bank. General Beg and current chief General Qamar Bajwa both belong to 16 Baloch regiment. Durrani has been critical of General Pervez Musharraf’s role in the Kargil war (described as the Pir Panjal pass fiasco where Gen Gulrez Shahrukh keeps PM Naveen Shaikh in the dark). In 2011, Durrani told BBC that the Pakistani authorities probably knew about Osama bin Laden hiding in Abbottabad but would have preferred to be blamed for incompetence rather than complicity. Seymour Hersh’s disclosures in 2015 confirmed this, pointing at Gen Ashfaq Kayani and identifying the Pakistani informant as Brig Usman Khalid, subsequently resettled in the US.Enough parallels to whet any conspiracy theorist’s appetite.A strange reality: Nawaz Sharif may have begun his political career with the blessings of the establishment but differences grew after Kargil and Musharraf’s coup in 1999. After returning to power in 2013, Sharif pressed treason charges against Musharraf. The Army was unhappy, Panamagate took its toll and Sharif was ousted in 2017, jailed, and has been in exile for a year. He has mounted a no-holds-barred attack on the selected PM Imran Khan and the selectors, General Bajwa and the ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, holding them responsible for his ouster. An Opposition front of 11 parties, combining Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) under Bilawal Bhutto and Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) under Maryam Sharif, led by veteran Maulana Fazlur Rehman who was close to the Army but currently unhappy, has begun a series of protest rallies last month culminating in Islamabad next month. It is a re-run of the process that ousted Sharif in 2017 with Imran Khan and the Maulana in the lead, with the tacit backing of the establishment. Last year, Bajwa managed a three-year extension from Imran Khan, causing rumblings within the army. Into this mix comes a thinly-disguised novel calling out those manipulating democratic politics and hinting at internal differences within the establishment. Only time will tell if Barakzai will reappear in a sequel — Honour Restored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/pakistan-where-fact-and-fiction-come-together/story-aTjnDopqymiFZjbcEleVVK.html
20-11-2020||News||Regional parties fail to cross the final poll hurdle||The current moment in Indian politics masks an interesting paradox. Nationally, the Opposition seems to be in the shadows and has failed to politically mobilise citizens on key issues. Yet, in state elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is increasingly facing challenges. For example, a few months ago, it was considered safe to bet on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) sweeping the Bihar assembly elections, but eventually, the alliance had to fight hard to retain power.What explains this paradox? The problem lies essentially in our perspective, in which the Congress, despite its diminished stature, seems like the natural opposition to the BJP. And the current disarray in the Congress forces many to think that the Opposition is not in a position to challenge the BJP’s growing dominance. Additionally, as the BJP under Narendra Modi, in its agenda-setting mode, makes swift moves to create one wedge after the other, the ideological confusion in the Congress only becomes further magnified. This image then gets reinforced by the BJP’s superior control over information channels and its narrative-setting prowess.State-level parties, on the other hand, seem to have developed a clear template to challenge the BJP juggernaut in their respective strongholds — highlight local issues; challenge NDA’s state-level leadership; avoid walking into the trap on national issues, particularly religion and national security; and stay clear of direct attacks on Modi. And the results are there for everyone to see in assembly elections held since 2019. While, in many instances, these state-level players such as Jannayank Janata Party (JJP) in Haryana, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in Jharkhand, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Bihar have managed to put the brakes on the BJP’s expansionist impulses, the party continues to occupy the pre-eminent position, even in these states.Why are these state-level parties finding it hard to cross the finish line? And how long can they survive the BJP’s hegemonic ambitions?First, most state-level parties in the past decade have undergone a generational transition — Akhilesh Yadav took full control of the Samajwadi Party in 2017, Tejashwi Yadav ran the 2020 Bihar campaign, Dushyant Chautala formed an independent party, Uddhav Thackeray heads the Shiv Sena, Sukhbir Badal is the president of the Akali Dal and MK Stalin controls the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham. The patriarchs of many of these formations are now either deceased or in retirement due to ill-health. Ironically, Modi’s rise has coincided with the fading away of regional stalwarts such as Mulayam Singh, Lalu Prasad , Karunanidhi, and HD Deve Gowda. In their heydays, these leaders would have made every possible effort to check the rise of the BJP as an unparalleled election machine in their respective states.The new leadership of these parties is drawn exclusively from political families and thus carries the baggage of past records. This offers the BJP a potent mobilisational plank on a platter by emphasising the ills of dynastic politics. Modi also has an uncanny ability to leverage political contradictions, which means these leaders must show immense political skill, acumen, and patience. And this is not easy for politicians who have not risen through ranks learning the art of survival.Second, many of the regional parties began their journey by mobilising large voting blocks of backward classes and Dalits. Their own failure to share power and patronage outside their specific jatis led to disenchantment among other castes supporting them, resulted in a fragmentation of political space. For example, in the 2020 Bihar elections, three separate parties were exclusively banking on Dalit voters — Bahujan Samaj Party, Lok Janshakti Party, and Hindustani Awam Morcha, and there were at least four separate claimants to the backward caste voters: The RJD was wooing Yadavs, Vikassheel Insaan Party was wooing Nishads, Janata Dal(United) was targeting Kurmis, and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs), and Upendra Kushwaha was focusing on Koeris. This underrepresentation of smaller castes in these parties also gives the BJP an opportunity to create a social coalition of extremes on the ground and with its own upper-caste base solidly behind the party, it enters the competition with an advantage. The possibility of the rise of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen in states with a significant Muslim population post-Bihar is going to further dent the base of these regional outfits who have relied heavily on Muslim votes thus far.Third, the rhetoric of Congress-mukt Bharat created an impression that the primary target of the BJP’s expansionist impulse is only the Congress. This got further reinforced by the fact that state-level parties outside UP and Bihar managed to largely keep their bastions safe. But the BJP did not lose sight of rural elites who largely support these state-level formations. It slowly worked towards undercutting the political economy base of these parties. The various reform bills related to the farm sector, education, labour, and land are likely to severely affect the power base of these parties. This was a strategy deployed in other states too, with the Devendra Fadnavis government using various means to weaken the NCP’s control over cooperatives banks and sugar mills in Maharashtra when it was in power and the Yogi Adityanath government going after the likes of Mukhtar Ansari, Sunder Bhati, Raja Bhaiya, and Atique Ahmed — all of whom mobilise resources and votes for state-level parties in UP.In conclusion, state-level parties often had controlling stakes in ruling coalitions and influenced policymaking. And it is likely that in the BJP-dominant system, the bargaining power of these parties will be on the wane. However, given the civilisational diversity of India, political entrepreneurs will continue to populate the competitive landscape. The assembly elections in five states where regional outfits are an important force — Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal — next year will determine the nature of Indian federalism in the years to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/regional-parties-fail-to-cross-the-final-poll-hurdle/story-3QaeB4BQe7PfaTDnzGR3hO.html
20-11-2020||News||Devise an India-specific Covid vaccination plan||With the possibility that several vaccines will be available soon, it is now essential to develop and disseminate a Covid-19 vaccine allocation plan. Those in India infected with Sars-CoV-2 are likely to have developed some form of immunity. Judging by studies around the country that have found under 50% seroprevalence, however, more than half the population remains susceptible to Covid-19. Even at optimistic estimates of production capacity (60 million doses/month), it will take a minimum of a year to produce enough doses for every individual at risk. Some vaccines may require multiple doses, which compounds the problem. Then, there are the challenges of storage and distribution which could cause further delays. It is tempting to look abroad for guidance on how to prioritise groups for vaccination. After all, many of the vaccines India may use are being developed abroad. While we have some things in common with other countries, there are several ways in which India differs which make it critical that we develop our own strategy.Let us examine the common features. First, all countries will prioritise health care workers employed in the Covid-19 response. Likewise, we are likely to prioritise other frontline workers and leadership, so that policy decisions are made and implemented that will keep the pandemic at bay until every susceptible person is vaccinated.However, the differences here are more stark. First, multiple serological studies suggest that India has a lower infection fatality rate than many countries. Second, some parts of the country have a much higher percentage of the population that has already been infected. Third, the poor have been disproportionately affected by suppression policies, even when compared to the poor in other countries. Fourth, India has unique difficulties with the distribution of medical treatment. These require us to develop a customised plan for India.So the question now is, after we immunise critical frontline workers and leadership, who should be vaccinated next. When trying to decide on this, we have to keep a few things in mind. First, any priority list the government develops should focus on factors that policymakers can implement easily. For instance, vaccinating those with co-morbidities, who are most at risk of death if infected, makes sense in theory. But it is hard to implement this plan in practice because the government cannot easily identify people’s co-morbidities. Instead, we should focus on location, demographic features, and possession of a ration card.Second, there are two major benefits of vaccination. One is the direct health benefit to the person being vaccinated, who is less likely to get infected and thus to die from Covid-19. This benefit suggests prioritising the people most vulnerable to infection and death going forward. The other is the indirect benefit to others who will not be infected by the person who is vaccinated. This benefit suggests prioritising those most vulnerable to infection and infecting others going forward. These two goals are not always aligned: The infected who are most likely to die are old, while those most likely to infect others may not be old. Third, calculating the direct benefits of vaccination involves a delicate balance. We want to identify groups that are most likely to get infected, but have not already been infected in the past. However, the groups that are most likely to get infected going forward are also likely to be immune, precisely because they were more likely to be infected in the past. It is possible to address this conundrum, but it requires careful statistical analysis.It might be tempting to think that a detailed analysis is not required, that vaccination should proceed from the oldest to the youngest. But that supposition would be wrong. Our analysis of mortality rates in Bihar and Mumbai suggests that individuals in their 80’s have lower mortality rates than those in their 70s (among males) or even 60s (among females). What we need is a vaccine allocation plan that will maximise the short-term health benefits for the country. Our top priority should be frontline workers and leadership that are critical to suppressing Covid-19 and vaccinating the population. After that, we should prioritise those who are not already immune and remain at high risk of death from the virus. This allocation should focus first on areas where the disease is spreading quickly, as those are the areas at greatest risk. Finally, we must continue surveillance efforts to ensure we have the most up-to-date information on areas of need when a vaccine finally becomes available.Over 0.1 million Indians have died from Covid-19 and this is far from over. A well-designed vaccination plan can reduce deaths by up to 70%. Given how much the country has sacrificed to slow the infection down, it is owed a carefully-planned – and customised – vaccine distribution plan.

20-11-2020||News||Creating a robust and effective digital media regulatory mechanism||On November 9, the Centre amended the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, and brought streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hotstar, and news websites under the ambit of the ministry of information and broadcasting (I&B). There is one point of ambiguity, though, in the notification: The online content can be curated content (as provided by news portals or entities such as Netflix, Hotstar or Amazon), and also user-generated content. The words “providers” and “platforms” must be explained clearly to clarify whether both curated and user-generated content are covered under this notification. This will materially change the scope of the notification. The reactions to this notification from content providers have been adverse and display their apprehensions of an impending regulatory mechanism for online content. These fears do not appear to be well-founded, at least, for now. If, with the present arrangement of co-regulation, better and more innovative TV programmes are being curated, then why this fear? The notification only formalises the government’s decision that matters related to news, current affairs, films and audio-visual content online will be dealt with by I&B ministry. The fear that it will lead to censorship or a regulatory regime is perhaps fuelled by the fact that this notification has been issued after the Supreme Court (SC) sought the government’s response on how it plans to deal with objectionable online content. The industry is most probably under the impression that after creating this enabling provision, regulation will follow. Is this perception misconceived? Or does it contain some truth that the government intends to control online media content? An important indicator of the government’s thinking on this matter could be how it has dealt with content control on television channels, both news and non-news.The only content that is censored in India today is that of films. Television programmes are not pre-censored. What prevails today as far as TV content is concerned is something akin to co-regulation. While the I&B ministry retains the power to control content through the provisions of a programme code incorporated in the Cable Network Regulation Act, 1995, industry bodies — the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) and the News Broadcasters Association — have also set up their self-regulatory mechanisms. Both have programme codes and regulatory authorities. IBF set up Broadcast Content Complaints Council (BCCC) in 2011, while NBA set up News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) in 2008. While there is no formal acceptance of their codes, the I&B ministry has been forwarding complaints it has received to these bodies. It has increasingly ceded regulatory space to these bodies. The trust quotient between these bodies and the ministry has improved over these years.The world of online content is far more complex. Not only is it without boundaries, but the volume generated is enormous. Its nature is driven by the choices and decisions of viewers. Several layers of technology-aided safeguards can be provided to make sure that the content reaches only the intended viewers.Given the huge size and diversity of India’s entertainment sector, and the quantum of content created every day, setting up an apparatus that will monitor content online 24x7, analyse it, detect violations and initiate action against the violators will be a complex, time-consuming, controversial and expensive task. Its administrative cost may outweigh the gains. A better way would be to implement a rule-bound and transparent self-regulatory mechanism with government oversight. The government and industry must work out the modalities of a credible self-regulatory mechanism with a robust and practical code for content, a representative, inclusive and fair governance structure, and an effective enforcement mechanism. A huge regulatory structure just to monitor content and process the violations seem neither optimal nor prudent.

20-11-2020||City||Plot for Thane Metro casting yard to be given to MMRDA at ready reckoner rate||Following controversy over allotting a plot to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) in Kolshet to set up a casting yard for Metro-4 (Wadala to Kasarvadavli), the general body of the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) on Friday decided to allot the plot as per the ready reckoner rate. The administration had proposed to allot the 75,390-sqm plot free of cost, however, mayor Naresh Mhaske ruled that the corporation has lost crores in revenue in the last two years, while the MMRDA contractor was already using the plot, and henceforth the land would be provided at RR rate. The rent for the last two years would also be recovered from the contractor. In his ruling, Mhaske said, “TMC will allot the plot to the MMRDA for the Metro project as per the RR rate. Moreover, the rent for the last two years, which comes to ₹96 crore, will be recovered from the contractor.” Municipal secretary Ashok Burpulle confirmed that the ruling was passed in the general body. MMRDA officials have claimed that they do not have any written communication from the TMC regarding the plot so far. RA Rajeev, MMRDA commissioner, said, “We have not received any such communication from the TMC. Let them write to us, and we will make a decision accordingly.”The proposal was first tabled two years ago, but the general body rejected it. The administration then gave the land under its power without the approval of the body. It again tabled the proposal on Friday. The corporation claimed that as per the government resolution (GR), it was supposed to allot land on a temporary basis, free of cost for Metro projects. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) had earlier opposed the proposal, claiming that the corporation had lost ₹96 crore in revenue in last two years, when the contractor appointed by MMRDA was using the plot. Other parties too rejected the proposal to allot land free of cost on Friday. Najib Mullah, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporator took up the issue in the general body. “We had already stayed the proposal when it was tabled the first time. We had demanded that the plot be given as per the ready reckoner rate and the demand is still the same,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/plot-for-thane-metro-casting-yard-to-be-given-to-mmrda-at-ready-reckoner-rate/story-cVA4gS2dBTU5KkfvOTWHeL.html
20-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai slums are 6 degrees Celsius warmer than neighbouring housing societies in October: Study||The city’s slum settlements are five-six degrees warmer than their neighbouring housing societies, while 37% of Mumbai’s households with metal roof structures are exposed to a risk of high rise in temperatures or heat risk post monsoon, a study by the geo-analytics team of environment group World Resource Institute (WRI) India across the city during October over the past three years has revealed. The study found the city has an alarming shortage of green cover. WRI India published three satellite maps –October Heat series – highlighting location-specific risk exposure to citizens. The maps established microclimatic changes and temperature variation within Mumbai, and called for city-specific policies that need to build on by adopting more nature-based solutions to adapt to climate risks. “Coastal cities do not record very high air temperatures, but the combination of temperature and humidity (heat index) is significantly high, especially for humid months like October, making it high risk for those most exposed. Prolonged exposure can lead to exhaustion and serious health ailments,” said Lubaina Rangwala, senior manager (urban development and resilience), WRI India, adding that October was one of the most severe weather months for Mumbai. “As the rains retreat, there is high moisture availability combined with a rise in temperature. While the absolute temperatures may not be very high, 90% humidity combined with low wind speed allows the heat index and stress to shoot up in Mumbai. This is why we chose October.” The first map showed slums in Dharavi recorded 35.9 degrees Celsius (during October over three years), while housing societies in Matunga recorded 30.3 degrees Celsius. A similar phenomenon was recorded across Powai-Vikhroli, Goregaon, and Girgaum-Marine Lines.“We found that this was a function of the type of building material used, compromised ventilation and green cover, and limited access to open spaces,” said Rangwala. The analysis revealed that industrial and commercial land use with large built-up footprints such as the airport, industrial estates and malls had a significantly higher surface temperature (33-35 degrees Celsius) than natural areas – forests, lakes, mangroves (27-32 degrees Celsius). The second map showed the difference in surface temperatures of settlements using concrete versus metal roofs. “Roofs are the most exposed surfaces of a building to solar radiation, and play a key role in determining indoor thermal comfort. Metal roofs are poor insulators and good conductors, resulting in increased indoor temperatures, while concrete transfers heat at a slower rate, resulting in increased night-time temperatures,” said Rangwala. The ward-wise breakup of roofing material showed S ward (Bhandup, Powai, Kanjurmarg, Vikhroli and Nahur) had the highest share of metal or asbestos roofing material (57%), followed by P-North ward (Malad, Manori, Marve, Aksa, and Madh – 55%) and N ward (Ghatkopar, Vidyavihar and Pant Nagar). While areas such as Pydhonie, Bhuleshwar, Grant Road, Walkeshwar, Malabar Hill, Breach Candy to Haji Ali all had concrete rooftops. WRI India’s third map was a correlation of the city’s green spaces and heat exposure and its implication on surface temperature. It showed over 31% of Mumbai’s land area had green cover (open maidans, tree-cover, mangroves and forests, city-parks etc.) but it was concentrated only in some wards. “There is a variation of 29 to 34 degrees Celsius across Mumbai wards, which means areas with highest green cover are five degrees cooler than those with less than 10% vegetation. Urban greening helps improve air quality, increased oxygen levels, lower ambient temperatures, and improve livability standards,” said Rangwala. R-Central ward (Borivli) had the highest percentage of green cover (75%) and the lowest mean temperature (29-30 degrees Celsius) followed by T-ward (Mulund) with 70% green cover and the lowest mean temperature at 29 degrees Celsius. Conversely, B ward (Masjid Bunder, Mohd. Ali Road, Dongri and Bhendi Bazar) and C ward (Pydhonie and Bhuleshwar) had less than 10% green cover and highest mean temperatures at 34 degrees Celsius. They sayWhat WRI India said“Combining all options under a heat action plan for Mumbai is a necessity, implemented by all stakeholders. Heat risk in cities is a problem of social equity. City governments need to support greater innovation in low-income settlements to increase vegetation, deploy sustainable and heat resilient materials for housing construction,” said Madhav Pai, director, WRI India.MinisterspeakVariations in temperature are bound to be there in slum areas where there is no space for trees vis-à-vis residential zones where more green cover is present, said state environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray. “However, we are working on specific plans for Mumbai and will be factoring in solutions for site-specific heat exposure as part of the Maharashtra state climate action policy. We are meeting with various state departments, and looking at what they are offering towards this policy to ensure city-specific climate resilience in Maharashtra,” he said.ExpertspeakThe state’s current climate action plan falls short of addressing the heat stress concerns, say experts. “Without such a plan, the situation is likely to worsen annually now under the current effects of climate change, and unfortunately low-income groups would be at the forefront of the health impacts,” said Ashok Jaswal, former scientist of the India Meteorological Department and lead author of 2017 study on decadal rise in average heat index over 60 years in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-slums-are-6-degrees-celsius-warmer-than-neighbouring-housing-societies-in-october-study/story-wo22fMA4bIUjzvV5OIdamN.html
20-11-2020||Mumbai||Kanjurmarg plot for Mumbai Metro car shed can curb costs, save land: MMRDA commissioner RA Rajeev||A month after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced moving the Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) car shed from Aarey Milk Colony to Kanjurmarg, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) commissioner RA Rajeev in an exclusive interview with Tanushree Venkatraman said the plan is to transform the 102-acre plot where the depot will come up, into the city’s largest transit hub. MMRDA is the nodal agency for developing all Metro corridors in Mumbai.Rajeev said the depot at Kanjurmarg will be an operating centre for Metro-3, 6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) and 4 (Wadala-Kasarwadavali) with an interchange for the proposed line 14 between Kanjurmarg and Badlapur. Rajeev stressed on the fact that the decision is the “most cost-efficient, which also saves land and will boost operation efficiency”.Rajeev also said despite the pandemic, MMRDA will complete the Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri-E) within the estimated cost and the lines will be made operational by May 2021.Excerpts from the interview:The Centre has made a claim on the Kanjurmarg plot where the state has proposed to shift the Metro-3 car-shed. Will this affect the project?All the claims have to be reviewed by the revenue department of the Maharashtra government. The revenue department and the district collector have handed over the plot to MMRDA post due diligence and examining all records. We are not affected so far and we are going ahead with the work. I visited the site on Wednesday; road construction is on at the periphery and we also discussed plans to integrating the car sheds for Metro lines 3, 4 and 6. Ultimately, we have to look at public interest. Around 80-90 lakh population of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) will be affected by these decisions. The state has not taken the decision only about Metro-3, but also for Metro-6, for which we had no depot land even though there was a cabinet decision zeroing in on Kanjurmarg plot as the depot for the line.Will the integration mean major changes in the plans for the three Metro lines? Technically, anything is possible. System integration can be done. In 2015, MMRDA had written a letter to the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (which is executing line 3) stating that Metro-3 and Metro-6 can be integrated. Kanjurmarg will be the largest transit hub in Mumbai. It will cater to almost 90 lakh commuters if you take lines 3, 4, 6 and 14 into account. We have 102 acre of land here while the biggest issue in Mumbai is scarcity of land. If constructed separately, we will need 30 hectares in Aarey, 43 hectares in Mogharpada and 20 hectares for line 6, which will total 93 hectares of land (close to 229 acres). Wouldn’t it be more efficient to construct one depot for all three lines? It is cost-efficient, operation-efficient, and we save on land. We can manage more trains at this depot with lesser staff and inventory. This is an opportunity to create an operation and control centre here. The ground and first floor can be the depot, with the control centre on the second floor.Is MMRDA reconsidering its decision to construct the Metro Bhavan at Aarey?Not yet, but if we can build an efficient control centre catering to three lines in Kanjurmarg, nobody will say no to the idea.What is the status of MMRDA’s plan to build a Metro-4 depot at Mogharpada? Though the land at Mogharpada is government land, there are a lot of allottees and class-2 landholders there. We faced the issue of encroachment too. There was resistance to a joint inspection conducted by the collector. We would have had to spend ₹1,500-₹2,000 crore to acquire that land parcel. We will save this cost also if we integrate and build the line-4 depot at Kanjurmarg.Metro-1 has been facing losses since its inception. There are talks of MMRDA taking over the line. What is the status?Reliance Infra, which manages line 1 wants to hand it over as they are facing financial issues owing to the pandemic. We cannot let such a huge public project drag. Since MMRDA has a stake of 26%, we can take over the operations. The contention is to arrive at the right estimate. There will be a valuation committee and we have also hired a consultant for it.How has the pandemic financially affected the Metro projects? How will MMRDA bear the civil construction cost of the lines?So far, as line 7 and 2A are concerned, we are not going for any cost revision. As far as funding for the civil construction of other lines is concerned, the key lies in starting revenue operations for these two lines as soon as possible. Once we start it, we can earn some revenue. The other model we are also working on is to use these two lines for equity-financing. We can pose the projected income to agencies for upfront funding. We have also submitted a transit-oriented development (TOD) policy to the state government through which we can develop areas around the stations. Additionally, we are planning to develop Wadala as the next Bandra-Kurla Complex, which will provide us with revenue.How will MMRDA address last-mile connectivity?We have taken last-mile connectivity into account since the beginning. We will be providing multi-modal integration at each of the upcoming Metro stations. Before the lockdown, we also started bike services at Jagruti Nagar Metro station, which a lot of people have been using. We also had a competition for new mobility services to come up with ideas for last-mile connectivity.

He also asked the market representatives to apprise shopkeepers about the role marketplaces can play in stopping the outbreak. Kejriwal also requested all Aam Aadmi Party officials to distribute free masks to people seen without masks. Earlier, shopkeepers from various markets in Delhi were concerned about a proposal that the Delhi government had sent to the Centre requesting to shut down markets for a short period of time if they are seen flouting Covid-19 prevention rules. Delhi government had expressed concern citing that norms not being followed by people visiting these marketplaces may have also contributed to the recent rise in the number of cases.Delhi recorded close to a lakh cases within the first two weeks of November.

The woman had been found dead at her home on Monday.Nikita Gehlot, deputy commissioner of police (Manesar), said that they made the arrest based on circumstantial evidence and preliminary investigation on Friday. “The woman lived with her son alone in the house. Her husband used to sell vegetables in the outskirts of the village and lived in a temporary accommodation along with one of his relatives there,” she said.The man was the woman’s son from a previous marriage. On November 16, the woman’s husband lodged a complaint with the police in which he stated that his stepson had informed him of finding her dead. In his complaint, the man said he found her lying on the bed with a scar on her neck that suggested strangulation. During a preliminary investigation, the police suspected that she had been sexually assaulted and killed herself. They filed a case under section 376 (rape) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Pataudi police station. Gehlot said the autopsy was conducted on Thursday and the report confirmed rape and suspected strangulation. “The husband said that the woman was earlier married to his elder brother who died three years into their marriage. Later, he married her as her son was young and they were financially weak,” she said. The husband alleged that the woman’s son often fought with her and she had thrown him out of the house a few days ago, said police. He allegedly would threaten to kill her when she refused to support him financially. The husband alleged that despite insisting murder, police initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (usually invoked when police do not suspect foul play), and only after the autopsy confirmed rape did they register the FIR “We will add relevant sections once we have completed the investigation. A team has been formed and have recorded statements of the family members, neighbours and relatives. The rape has been confirmed and the prime suspect, son of the deceased woman has been arrested,” said Gehlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/autopsy-confirms-rape-victim-s-son-arrested-police/story-SdK3R1gJsDvxsm2BccqpWK.html
20-11-2020||Gurugram||Daily RT-PCR tests reach 5000-mark; new cases above 790||The number of Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests conducted in a day in the district reached the 5,000-mark for the first time on Friday since the outbreak of the pandemic, which has till now infected 42,618 people in Gurugram. With an additional 1,503 rapid antigen tests, the overall testing also reached 6,503 — the highest ever in a single day so far. For the second consecutive day, more than 6,000 tests were administered in the district.With the increased testing, the district recorded a maximum jump in new infections after almost a week. On Friday, 793 new cases were recorded — highest spike after November 13, when at least 797 new cases were reported. The decline in testing from November 14 due to Diwali led daily new cases to fluctuate between 500 and 660 in the last one week, due to which the weekly positivity rate (November 13 to 20) slightly declined to almost 16% from previous week’s 18%. Epidemiologically, increased testing should continue till the positivity comes down to five percent. Lower positivity means the transmission of the virus is controlled. RT-PCR, the gold frontline test for Covid-19, has increased by almost 50% in the last two months to control the transmission. The district health bulletin shows that until September 20, the health department and private labs together were administering almost 2,200 RT-PCR tests. Almost same number of RT-PCR were conducted till October 21. It increased to 2,500 and further to 3,000 on November 2.In the last two days, a sudden increase in rapid antigen tests to over 1,500 also led to the overall hike in testing numbers. The district health department had received 10,000 antigen kits on November 19. Following which mass testing camps were held in Khandsa, Kherki Dhaula and other market areas to test people. Due to shortage of kits, department did less than 14% antigen tests. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Samples are being given to different private labs, who have signed MoU to conduct RT-PCR in ₹900. Considering the capacity of RT-PCR in private labs, nearly 16,000 tests can be conducted.”The hospitalisation also increased to 443 on Friday from 426 on November 19. According to the district health bulletin, out of the 5,485 active cases, at least 5,110 are in home isolation and seven in district Covid care centres.

20-11-2020||Chandigarh||Talks of senate abolition just baseless rumours, says Panjab University V-C||Clearing the air on elections to the senate, Panjab University vice-chancellor on Friday said talks about its abolition or changes in the varsity’s governing structure are baseless rumours.“We have already made all arrangements for the senate polls, and whenever the administration gives us the green signal, we will go ahead,” he said.Kumar was speaking to former student leaders outside his office after a protest march, which also saw participation of senators and teachers. The march was part of a series of similar protests held on the campus in the recent days to demand immediate conduct of polls to the senate, PU’s apex governing body. The polls were first scheduled on August 24, and were postponed by the V-C for second time on October 15. This led to apprehensions that the governing structure of the university might be changed under the National Education Policy 2020, with a board of governors replacing the senate. “As far as I know, these are baseless rumours... A lot of confusion is being created, and the university is a part of Punjab state,” the V-C told the protesters.Recently, even Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Badal had written to Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu, who is the PU chancellor, urging him to ensure immediate conduct of senate polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/talks-of-senate-abolition-just-baseless-rumours-says-panjab-university-v-c/story-fW34xi0VsVGL5NWuABJXeL.html
20-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram air quality remains poor due to farm fires; may improve over the weekend||Air quality in the city remained poor on Friday, recording 275 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin, up from 253 the previous day. The uptick has been attributed to a slight increase in farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, pollutants from which are being blown eastward by winds originating from the northwest of Delhi-NCR.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing, Friday’s deterioration in the air quality was mainly on account of about 600 farm fires in Punjab and Haryana that contributed to the rise in PM2.5 levels across NCR, thereby pushing up the AQI across major cities. The level of ultrafine particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) which has a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 175 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Monday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11 was 292ug/m3, up from about 175µg/m³ on Monday. “In the interim, the level of PM2.5 has been steadily going up, day by day. About a quarter of the city’s air pollution load at the moment would be from farm fire pollutants,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist. However, with the India Meteorological Department predicting high wind speeds of up to 15kmph over the next two days, the situation may improve. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality over Delhi NCR is likely to improve and reach in... Poor to Moderate category on 21.11.2020. The Air Quality is likely to remain in Poor to Moderate category on 22.11.2020.” Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said on Friday, “The wind speed has remained good and is likely to be the same over the next two days, which should lead to some dispersal of pollutants. But if farm fires continue, and if temperatures keep dropping, we may see pollutants accumulating instead.” Gurugram on Friday recorded a minimum temperature of 10 degrees Celsius, the same as on Thursday. The maximum daytime temperature also remained constant, at 24.1 degrees Celsius, as per IMD data. “However, we are expecting cold wave conditions in some pockets of Delhi-NCR soon and temperatures will probably fall sharply soon, maybe by two to three degrees,” said Srivastava. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast for Gurugram, the minimum temperature may drop to as little as six degrees Celius over the next seven days, while the maximum daytime temperature could drop to 23 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-air-quality-remains-poor-due-to-farm-fires-may-improve-over-the-weekend/story-gwiINDE0dXQPlPK4mqxL3I.html
20-11-2020||Gurugram||Five members of a gang held for looting jewellery shop in Sadar Bazar||Five members of a gang allegedly involved in an armed robbery at a jewellery shop in Sadar Bazar’s Roshanpura area on September 19 were arrested by the police on Friday afternoon. According to the police, four armed and masked men had barged into a jewellery shop and decamped with valuables worth ₹13 lakh after injuring the shopkeeper. The incident took place at around 3.25pm, when the jeweller was alone in the shop. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that two gang members had entered the shop and asked to them show them rings. The jeweller had taken out one tray and presented six rings. “One of the suspects told the owner that he was getting engaged and wanted to choose a heavy gold ring. Before they could finalise the ring, another suspect entered the shop and took the jeweller at gunpoint, after which the fourth suspect entered and jumped above the glass counter and grabbed the shopkeeper,” he said. The police said they had recovered CCTV footage from the shop where it was seen that he was purportedly seen struggling and raising an alarm, but due to the closed glass door, the noise could not pass through. Sangwan said the shop is located on a busy road and the suspect took advantage of the crowd. The three suspects picked three to four jewellery trays from the display counter and rushed towards the car, which was parked outside, and fled. “During questioning, it was revealed that they were hardened criminals and had murdered a man in Bilaspur in 2013 in a robbery case. There are six members in the gang and they have committed dozens of snatching, robberies and theft cases in Delhi-NCR,” he said. The suspects were identified as Varun alias Sonu (32) of Kaithal, Mintu (24) of Nathupur in Gurugram, Harsh (19) of Badshahpur, Tony (24) of Sector 65, and Sunil Kumar (27) of Madhya Pradesh. The police said Varun is the kingpin of the gang and was lodged in Bhondsi jail for four years for a murder in Bilaspur and is currently out on bail. He had formed the gang in 2017 and was convicted for 20 years of imprisonment by the district courts. Sangwan said they targeted this jewellery shop as it was hardly 100 metres away from the main road and was situated on the outskirts of the Sadar market. As such, he could easily flee from the spot after committing the crime. “The car used in crime had a fake registration plate and belonged to one of the gang members who is still absconding. They were arrested based on technical surveillance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/five-members-of-a-gang-held-for-looting-jewellery-shop-in-sadar-bazar/story-uDaJ9rW1Hv9NWu21N3umlL.html
20-11-2020||Gurugram||All schools to remain shut till November 30||All schools in Haryana will be shut till November 30 in view of the rising cases of Covid-19 among students and teachers in various districts of the state.More than 180 government school students and 110 staff members in different districts have tested positive since schools reopened for regular classes earlier this month. The numbers were high in districts such as Rewari, Jhajjar, Jind, Hisar and Rohtak. Schools across the country first were shut in mid-March when the countrywide lockdown in response to the outbreak of Covid-19 and shifted to online teaching. Voluntary visits to schools for clearing doubts for a limited time period were initiated by the state government in September followed by regular classes from November 2 for students in classes 9 to 12.District education officer (DEO) Indu Boken said that extensive sanitization will be undertaken in schools over the next ten days when schools remain closed. During this period, schools will continue with online classes as before. Gurugram block education officer Sheel Kumari said schools heads could visit schools along with non-teaching staff for administrative work, if required. “The order for closure came late during the day. We have asked schools to inform students about it. School staff will inform other students if they visit the school tomorrow. Classes will continue online and administrators will be able to visit the school for work, as they had been doing during the lockdown,” said Kumari. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that students had been informed about the closure of schools and online classes would continue as before. “A number of students had been coming to school for classes for clearing doubts and catching with lessons since schools reopened. The experience of a physical classroom session is difficult to replicate online but the safety of students necessitated the closure. We have informed students who are in touch with us,” said Sharma. While most private schools had been continuing with online classes over physical classroom sessions, teachers who had started visiting the schools have been asked to work from home from Monday. Anita Malhotra, principal of Lotus Valley International School, said that the school had informed teachers about the closure. “We have been conducting online classes since most parents are not in favour of schools visits. Teachers who had been coming to school will be working from home till November 30 in line with the government directions,” said Malhotra. The school will remain open for administrative work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/all-schools-to-remain-shut-till-november-30/story-reu3hXL5cTJ17URe0qje4I.html
20-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn to review relaxations amid rise in Covid-19 cases||Concerned over a second Covid-19 wave in Chandigarh, the UT administration has decided to review major relaxations announced in the past month, including opening of schools.“Covid cases are rising alarmingly. On Monday (November 23), the administration will decided on the issue of relaxations. The administrator will take a final call,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida. The administration in the past one month introduced several relaxations to Covid-19 restrictions, latest being opening of Rock Garden, museums and Tagore Theatre.Earlier, the administration had also allowed opening of schools while colleges and libraries are supposed to open on Monday. On Friday, the Haryana government shut its schools, which were recently opened, as more than 180 students tested positive for Covid-19. The Himachal Pradesh government had also closed its schools after reopening them.“Closing of schools, tourist attractions like Rock Garden, public places like Sukhna Lake, and community centres is being considered if the cases continue to rise,” said Parida. However, there are no plans to shut markets or offices, he said.The adviser also expressed concern over travellers from Delhi testing positive on their arrival to Chandigarh. As many as 10 of 210 incoming passengers sampled at the Inter State Bus Terminal, Sector 17, had tested positive on Thursday.For better enforcement of Covid norms, the administration might also impose higher penalty for not wearing masks and maintaining social distance, said Parida.In a worrisome trend, the city has been witnessing a steady rise in cases since the mid of October. From 316 cases in the week from October 16 to 22, the cases within a month have more than doubled with 779 recorded between November 13 and 19.However, Dr Amandeep Kang, director, UT health department, said even though the cases are rising, it cannot be called a second wave. “The uptick in infection is expected next week too, due to the population mobility in festivals. Cases being reported are only a third of the numbers seen during the peak in September,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-to-review-relaxations-amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases/story-pFy5OrUQnSYlzjWGUvK5tO.html
20-11-2020||Gurugram||Work underway to clean drains which caused GCR flooding||Work to clean and restore four natural creeks, which carry monsoon runoff from the Aravallis onto Golf Course Road and the neighbouring sectors, is expected to be completed within this year, officials in the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said on Friday. The cleanup is being undertaken after investigation by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s (GMDA) flood protection committee, which identified these creeks as a key factor in the waterlogging of Golf Course Road on August 19. Officials involved in the matter said that work on two of these drains in sectors 26 and 42, or creeks 1 and 2 respectively, is already underway as part of the cleanup’s first phase, while the remaining two creeks, in sectors 54 and 56, are set to be taken up early next month. A work order for the same was first issued on November 12, with work on site commencing soon after Diwali. Hari Kishan, a junior engineer with the MCG, who is tasked with overseeing the restoration of these drains, said, “Construction work in the vicinity has picked up steam in recent years and the drains were completely choked with construction debris. This past week, we have been working on the site daily, using earthmoving machines to clear the rubble. In one instance, we cleared a patch of the drain in Sector 26 but found that it was filled with construction debris again the next morning.” To circumvent such violations, Kishan said, the drains may also be fenced off after cleaning. An interim report by the TERI School Advanced Studies also noted the presence of C&D waste dumping in the area, which had rendered these four creeks “not fully functional”, especially the one in Sector 42. The report, which suggests preliminary measures to prevent flooding along GCR, states, “Many tributaries of the creeks as reported are non-existent now which means that the storm water is not carried through them, instead they are carried onto the road (the road substitutes as a channel).”“Our job for the moment is to clean all waste from the nullah and open up a clear channel for the water. This will avoid any spillover onto Golf Course Road as runoff will be directed to a natural water body in Sikanderpur, which collects at the end of the Wazirabad bundh. We will observe the site during winter rains to see if the creeks are able to carry runoff,” said Kishan.A senior official in the GMDA’s infrastructure department, who is privy to the matter, said while seeking anonymity, “Though it was the GMDA’s purview to understand why GCR got flooded, the drains are with the MCG. Therefore they have been instructed to do the cleanup. Meanwhile, our detailed project report for augmenting drainage in the area has been reviewed by a team of researchers from TERI. We will meet with them to discuss their findings, and take steps accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/work-underway-to-clean-drains-which-caused-gcr-flooding/story-oAMO5K52bBEpqQIsIxNTtL.html
20-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh feels the chill as mercury drops below 10°C||Following snowfall in Himachal Pradesh earlier this week, minimum temperature in Chandigarh dropped below 10°C, for first time this season, in early hours of Friday. It was recorded at 9.7°C as compared to 11.2°C the previous day. However, maximum temperature went a notch up from 22.5°C to 23.5°C.“Winds coming down from the hills are cooling the region, which is normal during this time of the year. However, due to cloudy weather expected in the city over the weekend, it is possible that minimum temperature will go above 10°C again,” said the weatherman.Meanwhile, after staying at good (0-50) and satisfactory (50-100) level due to rains earlier this week, the Air Quality Index (AQI) went into the moderate level (100-200) once again on Friday. It was recorded between 100 and 110 throughout the day at the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station in Sector 25. The weatherman attributed it to the inversion of temperature, adding that the air quality is likely to worsen, with AQI entering the poor bracket (200-300), as the temperature falls.In the next three days, maximum temperature is expected to remain between 21 and 22 degrees while minimum temperature will remain between 9 and 11 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-feels-the-chill-as-mercury-drops-below-10-c/story-RZibFAF7gwUF5z4UKlABxM.html

Officials said that they had made several appeals to residents to offer prayers at home due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.According to officials’ estimates, the gathering was about 15,000-20,000, as against an estimated gathering of over one lakh seen every year. Though a majority of devotees wore face masks, social-distancing was hardly observed.Community associations, however, felt the number to be higher. “We estimate that there were about three lakh people there on Friday, as against the seven-eight lakh who come out every year. The gathering was reduced considerably as those who could not make arrangements at home came out. Majority people were wearing masks and our association also distributed free masks. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to maintain social-distancing when the gathering is large,” said Rakesh Tiwari from Purabiya Jan Kalyan Parishad.Those who arrived at the river banks expressed satisfaction about the measures put up. “Since many of the festivals were curtailed this year due to the pandemic, we were worried whether we would be able to celebrate or not. But the government did not ban prayers and allowed us to celebrate this major festival. It is a matter of relief for us. Many families, however, did not come to the river banks due to fear of Covid-19,” said Durga Prasad Mishra, a devotee from Arthala. The Ghaziabad administration had made arrangements at 53 different places across the city for the festival and had made regular appeals to people to offer prayers at home.“There was an estimated gathering of about 15,000-20,000 people who arrived at the banks of river Hindon and about 95% of them were wearing masks. We distributed about 10,000 masks and more have been arranged for the prayers on Saturday morning. Appeals were issued regularly for social distancing and wearing of masks,” said Shailendra Singh, additional district magistrate (city).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/crowds-many-without-masks-at-ghats-of-hindon-as-devotees-offers-prayers-for-chhath/story-I0QRg9PqIYwQIFxxsp98tI.html

The police on November 18 had arrested one Jitendra Tyagi on charges of criminal conspiracy in the case, and said that the MLA’s absconding elder brother was allegedly also part of the conspiracy.The police identified the two shooters as Vipin Sharma, resident of Modinagar living in Ashok Nagar in Delhi, and his alleged accomplice Arpan Chaudhary, who is from Bulandshahr. The “arms supplier” was identified as Manoj Kumar, a resident of Saddik Nagar in Ghaziabad. On the morning of October 9, the MLA’s maternal 60-year-old uncle Naresh Tyagi was gunned down by two men on a two-wheeler. The MLA and the victim’s son, Abhishek Tyagi, on November 18 had said that they were not convinced with the disclosure made by the police. The two “shooters” were arrested from the roundabout area near Raj Nagar Extension while Manoj was picked up from his residence. “During his arrest, Jitendra told us about Vipin and said that he hired him for ₹2 lakh while an advance of ₹50,000 was given for the killing. Jitendra had informed them who to shoot but did not reveal the victim’s identity to the shooters. He also supplied the weapons to the shooters through Manoj. We scanned a number of CCTVs and came across these two men who were on a two-wheeler,” Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police (SSP), said during a press-conference on Friday.The police said that Jitendra had allegedly told them that he had some personal and other rivalry with the victim and allegedly planned the murder along with the MLA’s elder brother Girish Tyagi. They added that a notice under sections of the CrPC has been served to Girish’s family so that he can come and record his statements. “The statements given by Jitendra are being verified and investigation is still on in the case. Teams have been asked to verify statements made by Jitendra,” the SSP added.Following Jitendra’s arrest, officers had said that he and Girish had allegedly flown to Lucknow two days before the incident, on October 7. Officers added said that they have also recovered weapons used during the crime and the two-wheeler. The MLA did not take calls for a comment on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/murder-of-bjp-mla-s-uncle-ghaziabad-police-arrest-two-shooters-arms-supplier/story-Ksog4xyqUjXKY8bKulKoXO.html

Bajpayee said that on March 24, his wife and he were in Bengaluru when the lockdown came into force. “On November 16, we returned to our Noida ground floor home and found the door locked from inside. I called some neighbours and we found that the kitchen window grille was damaged,” he said. Inside, they found their rooms ransacked. Thieves had made away with ₹21,000 cash and some jewellery. “I am not concerned about the valuables, but it is shocking that it took place in the society. I informed the police and filed a complaint,” he said. R K Singh, SHO Sector 20 police station, said that a case of burglary under Section 380 of IPC was registered against unknown persons. “The police teams are scanning the CCTV footage to identify the suspects. The society keeps one month footage of CCTV camera. It is not clear if the incident took place in last one month or earlier since the family was away since March,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/during-lockdown-thieves-target-former-iaf-officer-s-home/story-BHpPG1lIy3tp6LZL1namrI.html
20-11-2020||Chandigarh||Covid norms thrown to the wind at Chhath Puja in Chandigarh||Around 2,000 people turned up at the lake in Sector 42 to pay obeisance to the setting sun on the third day of Chhath Puja in Chandigarh on Friday. Most of them were seen without face masks and maintaining no social distance, even as the number of Covid-19 cases are on a steady rise in the city.The authorities issued not a single challan to the violators, though announcements urging people to exercise caution were being made from loudspeakers.According to orders issued by the UT administration under the Unlock 5 guidelines on October 1, which have been extended till November 30, religious functions and congregations can be held in open spaces with strict observance of social distancing, mandatory wearing of face masks and provisions for thermal scanning and handwash or sanitiser. The permission for holding Chhath Puja at the lake had been granted by the administration subject to strict observance of these Covid protocols. The organisers were made responsible to ensure compliance.“We weren’t expecting a lot of people, but at least 2,000 turned up in the evening,” admitted Arvind Singh, treasurer, Purvanchal Sabha, adding that the number was estimated on the basis of masks distributed by the organisation.Singh said similar rush is unlikely on Saturday morning, when devotees pray to the rising sun and break their fast, as children and the elderly are not expected to come.Detailing the arrangements made at the venue, assistant superintendent of police (ASP, south) Shruti Arora said: “Around 200 cops were deployed in and around the lake to ensure order. Roads in front of the lake had been closed to manage the crowds better. “ Also, unlike previous years, vendors were not allowed at the venue, and Covid testing booths that have been set up in the parking lot were closed on Friday.In the afternoon, the administration had even chalked lines for devotees to maintain distance between each other, and they were allowed to enter the lake only from the front. However, in the evening, these rules went for a toss.“Once the crowd started swelling, we did what we could. We distributed masks and ensured compliance,” said subdivisional magistrate (SDM, south) Satish Jain, while confirming that no action was taken against violators.The fine for not wearing a face mask in public places is ₹500 in Chandigarh. Meanwhile, Purvanchal Sabha chairman Anil Kumar Dubey, who is also an elected councillor, said: “ We were doing our best to manage the crowds and asking people to wear masks. To discourage people from coming to the lake on Saturday morning, we will be serving only tea after the puja concludes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-norms-thrown-to-the-wind-at-chhath-puja-in-chandigarh/story-lTYCXvjnTBShEs66BUfLDK.html
20-11-2020||Noida||Noida mountaineer Arjun Vajpai aims for solo summit to Mount Everest||Noted mountaineer Arjun Vajpai (27) from Noida has planned a solo climb of Mount Everest (8,848m), the world’s highest peak, by May next year. He plans to do it without the help of sherpas and supplementary oxygen, and climb the mountain within a week. Ten years ago, Vajpai was the youngest Indian to have successfully climbed Mount Everest. He was 16 at the time and part of a group expedition. For the next climb, he has been training on the mountains of Uttarakhand. Vajpai said he will attempt the summit from Tibet side as Nepal does not allow solo summit. Vajpai and his parents had moved to Uttarakhand from Noida before the lockdown. “I live in Almora with my family in a small village. There are mountains in my neighbourhood which are lovely and serene,” he said.Vajpai said that the pandemic affected his schedule. “I had to postpone all my expeditions to next year. I will be the first Indian to solo climb the peak if I succeed,” he said. Reinhold Andreas Messner, an Italian explorer, is credited to have solo climbed Mount Everest first in 1978. Since then, a few more people followed, but an Indian is yet to do so, said Vajpai. “I will practice for on Mount Annapurna in March 2021 before going for the final push on Everest from the northern side in Tibetan Plateau,” he said. In a decade-long journey Vajpai took the national flag atop six of the world’s highest mountains. In 2010, he had first conquered Everest; in 2011 he climbed Mount Lhotse (8,516m) and Mount Manasalu (8,163m); in 2016 Mount Makalu (8,485m) and Mount Cho Oyu (8,201m), and in 2018 Mount Kangchenjunga (8,586m). Vajpai had also explored a “virgin mountain” in Lahaul Valley, Himachal Pradesh, and named it Mount Kalam (6,180m) after former president of India Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in 2015. In the next five years, Vajpai aims to become the youngest person in the world and only Indian to summit all 14 8,000-m high peaks in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-mountaineer-arjun-vajpai-aims-for-solo-summit-to-mount-everest/story-cKGj53xEvJAXe0C8qCSgwK.html
20-11-2020||Noida||Greater Noida police seize three buses for violating Covid-19 protocols||Greater Noida: The Badalpur police on Friday seized three buses for violating coronavirus (Covid-19) disease protocols and not ensuring social distancing norms.

20-11-2020||Noida||Hospitals near Noida to check if beds are free before referring Covid-19 patients to district||NOIDA: The Gautam Buddh Nagar administration has asked hospitals in neighbouring districts to refer coronavirus (Covid-19) disease patients to hospitals in the Noida district only after co-ordinating with Covid-dedicated facilities here about availability of beds.In its recent meeting with private Covid-dedicated hospitals in the district, the administration had asked them to increase their capacity of beds and to treat Covid-19 patients from Noida district on priority.District magistrate Suhas LY said that it has been proved now that due to its floating nature of population and frequent cross-border movement between Delhi and Noida, The Gautam Buddh Nagar is prone to have fluctuating number of Covid-19 cases, with respect to neighbouring areas. “We have categorically asked all private Covid-19 facilities in Noida district to admit referred patients from other districts only if they have adequate beds,” he said.“In addition, our health department officials have intimated hospitals in neighbouring districts that before referring any Covid-19 patient to hospitals in GB Nagar district, they must first co-ordinate with the respective hospital whether beds are available. The health department officials have also been asked to take stock of patients from other districts being treated in GB Nagar hospitals,” he said.He further said that at present, the district’s hospitals do not have any dearth of beds for Covid-19 patients. “At present, our Covid-19 facilities have as many as 2,411 beds, including 383 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, 181 ventilator beds and 884 oxygen beds. However, the number of patients admitted in these are 712, while and 433 others are under home isolation. The chief medical officer (CMO) has been asked to keep records of all Covid-19 patients being treated at different facilities in the district updated. He has also been asked to keep records of doctors and paramedics visiting Covid-19 wards in shifts there,” Suhas said. Expressing concern over the sudden surge in positive cases in the national Capital, the DM said that the situation had adversely impacted GB Nagar in April, when the district health department had found that 42% of the cases had come from contacts in Delhi. “And now when restrictions have eased and economic activities have started, the sources of several new positive cases in Noida can be traced to there. To check the spread of the virus, we were left with limited options – to increase surveillance in areas with floating populations, and random sampling at borders. We started these exercises Wednesday,” he said.District CMO Dr Deepak Ohri said that due to random sampling on Noida-Delhi borders, as many as 21 new positive cases have been detected out of tests through 521 rapid antigen kits. “While three persons tested positive on Wednesday out of 165 random samples at DND Flyway and Chilla borders, nine tested positive on Thursday out of 178 sampled at Botanical Garden and New Ashok Nagar metro stations. On Friday, our health workers conducted random testing of 178 persons at Botanical Garden bus stand and Dallupura areas, of which nine have been tested positive” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/hospitals-near-noida-to-check-if-beds-are-free-before-referring-covid-19-patients-to-district/story-Cl8s3wIH6V0KnLLNf54LJK.html
20-11-2020||Noida||Noida slips back to ‘very-poor’ zone as mercury falls, Saturday, Sunday to be coldest of season so far||The air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad continued its downward trend on Friday with Noida entering the “very poor” zone and the other two cities going deeper in the same zone after having slipped into it a day earlier. Added to this, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted that with Delhi expected to suffer a “cold wave” over the weekend, the three national capital region (NCR) cities will also experience some part of it. A cold wave is declared when the minimum temperature falls significantly from the normal minimum.“The region is receiving north-westerly winds which is bringing some smoke from stubble burning from those parts of the country. On Friday morning till the afternoon, the region had wind with speed ranging between 18 to 20 kmph. But since the temperatures were low during the morning hours, so the ventilation would have been minimal, leading to spike in the air pollution,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Centre (IMD). Low temperatures result in denser air making it difficult for wind to disperse pollutants.On Friday, Delhi recorded its lowest minimum temperature for November since 2006 at 7.3 degrees Celsius, which was five notches below the season’s average and is also representable for the NCR. “There could be some variation of two to three degrees in the average minimum temperature of Delhi-NCR and the actual temperature of Noida. But the next two days will see rise in chilly winds and a further temperature drop. This could also make the pollution dispersion a bit difficult,” said Srivastava. According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Friday 306 or ‘very poor’ against 284 or ‘poor’ a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 314, same as a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 325 against 305 a day earlier. The AQI between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’. The pollution mass also worsened with PM2.5 for past 24-hours in Noida increasing to 173.92 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³) against 144.85µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida also worsened to 177.92µg/m³ on Friday against 161.22µg/m³ a day earlier. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI may improve marginally due to wind over next two days. “Energetic surface winds are forecasted for the next two days and likely to influence AQI positively. The AQI is likely to marginally improve and in the Very Poor to Poor category for the next two days. AQI is forecasted to marginally deteriorate and in the Very poor category on 23rd November,” said a statement by SAFAR on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-slips-back-to-very-poor-zone-as-mercury-falls-saturday-sunday-to-be-coldest-of-season-so-far/story-SHZcB3ybiHYB2GcHWIcuXP.html
20-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s SGNP to get cub after reunion bid with tigress fails||Following a failed reunion attempt of an 11-month-old tigress at the Chichpalli range of Chandrapur forest division earlier this year, the Maharashtra forest department has decided to send the cub to live in captivity at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Borivli.The cub left from Chandrapur on Friday and is expected to reach Mumbai by Sunday said, forest officers. The tigress is expected to help improve SGNP’s tiger breeding program. According to NR Praveen, chief conservator of forest (Chandrapur), the cub was found abandoned near Chichpalli range on April 24 and was brought to the Chandrapur Transit Treatment Centre (TTC). “The cub was quite weak and dehydrated when we found her. She had to be artificially-fed initially, and then after a few weeks, she began eating normally, he said. Praveen further said, “We planned to reunite her with her mother but there were two adult tigresses in the same region where we had rescued the cub and were not sure which was her mother.”The forest department carried out a DNA matching study to accurately identify which tigress the cub belonged to. The department claimed that it was the first such study in the country. Samples from the cub and the two adult tigresses (based on scat and hair samples) were sent to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, and the department got a match.“It took about two months for the results to come in, and the reunion was planned from June 18 to 20. The cub was placed in a small cage close to the location where she was rescued and the mother tigresses’ movement had been observed. Though there were calls from the cub and another tigress, unfortunately, the mother did not come for the cub, and the reunion failed,” said Praveen, adding, “It may be possible that since the cub was at the TTC for a long time, there may have been high human imprint (changes in behaviour in captivity) which may have deterred the mother from coming close to the cub or the mother was unable to locate the cub.”The reunion attempt was called off in July.Meanwhile, on July 27, a state-appointed committee, deciding on the possible rehabilitation of tigers and cubs post rescue or capture, recommended the cub be relocated to a rescue centre.“Owing to the human imprint, the cub could not be released in the wild. SGNP showed interest and had already requested the department for two tigers for improving their breeding program. Thus, it was unanimously decided to shift the cub to SGNP by the department and committee,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife). At present, SGNP is home to five Royal Bengal tigers, including four females and a male.Sultan, who is four-and-a-half-years-old and the lone male tiger, was brought to SGNP from Gorewada Rescue Centre in Nagpur, last December. In August 2019, twin tigresses – Bijlee and Mastani, both nine-years-old, were brought to SGNP from Pench Tiger Reserve. Basanti, 20, and Laxmi,10, are the other two female tigers, who make up the population at SGNP.“All four tigresses are dominant and keep clear of Sultan or don’t allow him to come close to them. Thus, translocation of the female cub was essential for the park and the future of the breeding program, and the tiger safari. We await the cub’s arrival,” said G Mallikarjuna, director and conservator of forest, SGNP.Another male tiger RT1, aged about five to six years and said to have killed eight people, was captured near Sindhi village in Rajura forest at central Chanda, Chandrapur on October 27. While the tiger was relocated to Gorewada, there has been a request to transfer the tiger to SGNP as well. “We are yet to decide on this. Nothing is final yet,” said Kakodkar.Gorewada International Zoo to be inaugurated in DecemberOn Friday, officers from the Gorewada project, Nagpur, said a five-year-old male tiger Rajkumar was shifted from their rescue centre to a holding area at the Gorewada International Zoo. Over the next two days, another tigress, seven leopards (two male and five female), and six sloth bears (three male and three female) will be shifted to the zoo. “The zoo would be inaugurated closer to the end of December and opened to the public. We have built a total of 75 hectares (25 hectares each) for tiger, leopard and sloth bear safaris at the zoo,” said Pramod Panchbai, divisional manager, Gorewada Project, Nagpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-sgnp-to-get-cub-after-reunion-bid-with-tigress-fails/story-ej2h1MfJKOtGz48vq5j3yN.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||FIR against hotel for violating Covid rules||New DelhiDelhi Police on Friday registered a first information report (FIR) against a hotel in north-west Delhi’s Pitampura for allegedly not enforcing Covid-19 guidelines during a wedding function organised at the venue on Thursday. “There was no social distancing at the function and many people were not wearing masks,” Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west) said. Arya said a case under Indian Penal Code section 188 (disobedience to an order promulgated by a public servant) was filed at Maurya Enclave police station against City Park Hotel in Pitampura. Though there were reports on social media that there was a gathering of more than 200 persons at the hotel and police took action because of this violation, the police did not confirm this. Arya said police had filed case because the guests had flouted social distancing norms and did not wear masks. When HT spoke to the hotel officials about the allegations, they called it a “fake”. “There was no wedding at our hotel on Thursday. These are fake allegations and any video being circulated could be an old one. We are complying with all government guidelines,” said an official of the hotel over the phone. She did not identify herself. A short video clip in circulation, purportedly of a wedding at the hotel, showed a few guests dancing at the stage and hotel attendants -- many of them wearing face shields-- standing at a distance. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video, or the number of guests. The DCP said the FIR was registered after a local resident brought the video to the police’s notice.The wedding guests were not booked, the officer said. The Delhi Government had on Tuesday banned a gathering of more than 50 people at wedding venues in light of the rising number of Covid-19 infections. The government had earlier allowed a gathering of up to 200 persons. Eish Singhal, Delhi Police spokesperson, said the order was implemented by police from Wednesday. “We are taking action whenever we receive a call about violations of this rule. But most hotels are complying with guidelines and taking undertakings from clients to ensure no more than 50 people attend the weddings. Caterers are not taking orders for more than 50 guests. Hotel owners are being careful to not invite police action and there is a general compliance. If there are violations by a few, we are taking immediate action,” said Singhal. A district deputy commissioner of police (DCP) said police in civil dresses are taking rounds of wedding venues to see if there are any violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fir-against-hotel-for-violating-covid-rules/story-fq7FvVKIr8VXmuK82slhNP.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi high court dismisses plea seeking stay on demolition of temple in Chandni Chowk||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed an application moved by a registered religious society, seeking a stay on demolition of a Hanuman Temple in Chandni Chowk. The HC said the same issues have already been re-agitated, considered and rejected earlier last year and that the plea for interference had to come from the state government.The organisation represented by advocate Rushab Aggarwal had said the single judge could not have rejected the decision of the Lieutenant-Governor (LG) of Delhi, who as chairperson of the religious committee had recommended for the temple to be amalgamated and saved as part of the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Plan. He said devotees had a fundamental right to practice their faith and that the temple was an integral facet of the faith. The trust said they were aggrieved by an order dated October 31 of the North MCD, proposing to demolish the temple, which according to them would be done on Sunday.On Friday, a bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad said it was for the Delhi Government to make an application for modification because the Supreme Court had asked them to approached the high Court. On November 14, 2019, the Delhi High Court had rejected recommendations of the religious committee to allow the temple to exist at the site. The order was challenged by the Delhi government in Supreme Court, which disposed it of after the government said it would move “a suitable application before the high court for further directions, as may be warranted”.The court said once such a liberty was granted to the Delhi government, and that because the government had not approached the high court, there was no reason to entertain that application for intervention “which is nothing but an attempt to re-agitate the same issue that has been considered and rejected by an earlier order dated 14.11.2019”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-dismisses-plea-seeking-stay-on-demolition-of-temple-in-chandni-chowk/story-PUWePnchwvmcahgykL2O3N.html

The authorities have been raising unnecessary objections in processing our case. In the past, they also claimed that kin of Manpreet and Sukhdev were not entitled to jobs as they were contractual employees. Later, they agreed to provide a job to my daughter, but the file is just stuck in red tape,” said Manpreet’s father Malkit Singh, who also lost his wife to heart disease in March this year.“I just want to question the authorities, whether my son was standing shoulder to shoulder with the rest or not?” he rued.Having lost their breadwinners, the three firemen’s families are struggling to make their ends meet.Vishal’s mother Asha Rani said, “Though I am a government employee, I will retire in two years and Vishal’s wife and two sons are dependent on me. We have been demanding a job for Vishal’s brother Vikas, who is also married and does menial jobs. Despite making rounds of government offices, no one is paying heed to our situation.”Similarly, Sukhdev’s wife, who now lives with her parents, said she and her three daughters were dependent on her family. “If the government provides me a job, I could take care of my children myself,” she added.Also bereft of benefits of gallantry awardAll nine firefighters were awarded the President’s Fire Service Medal for gallantry in January 2019, but the benefits still elude their families.These include a special allowance of over Rs 6,000 per month, discount on air travel, concession in school admission fee for children, widow quota in jobs, etc.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “We have already forwarded MC’s recommendations regarding the jobs to the state government that has yet to accord its final approval. As far as the special allowance is concerned, its file has been forwarded to the finance and contracts committee for its nod.”Besides firemen Manpreet, Sukhdev and Vishal, the factory collapse had also claimed the lives of sub-fire officers Rajinder Sharma, Sumohan Gill and Raj Kumar, leading firemen Pooran Singh and Manohar Lal, and fireman Rajan. In all, 16 people were killed in the tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kin-s-angst-still-simmers-three-years-after-death-of-9-firemen-in-ludhiana-factory-collapse/story-UPJ1SXfErxpqpus5QPS6BK.html
20-11-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Agri-varsity employees protest for 2nd consecutive day; threaten to go on hunger strike||Employees’ unions of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) continued to protest over non-fulfilment of long–pending demands for the second consecutive day on Friday.They gathered outside Thapar Hall and threatened to go on hunger strike if their demands are not met. The employees’ unions also took out a march in the varsity to garner support. As many as four employees’ unions, including the PAU Employees Union, PAU Teachers Association and PAU Class Four Workers Union, have been protesting on campus since October 13.Among their demands is the implementation of the old pension scheme, on the lines of Punjabi University, Patiala, for employees recruited till July 9, 2012. Besides, they also want the grade pay for library attendant and meteorological attendant to be at par with the lab attendant, promotions for JEs and SDOs, filling up of vacant posts of store-keepers, recruitment and promotion of car and jeep drivers and the problems cropping up in internal audit to be resolved.On Thursday, they sat outside vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon’s office and stopped him from entering. A day on, the V-C tried to appease the protesting employee and urged them to not vitiate the atmosphere of the university campus, but instead, discuss their issues with the authorities. “The PAU fraternity is like a family. When a problem arises, the head of the family comes forward to solve the issue,” the V-C said.Dhillon further assured the employees that all their genuine demands will be addressed and urged them to stop the agitation.RS Sidhu, registrar, said the university is aware of the demands of the employees and authorities are doing their best to address them.On the other hand, Baldev Singh Walia, president of the PAU employees’ Union, reiterated that employees working on contract should be made permanent as per seniority. He said the V-C was deliberately stalling the promotions and appointments.Meanwhile, the university has issued details of their position with respect to demands of employees’ unions. On the implementation of the old pension scheme, the varsity said the state government has to consider the case of PAU and other institutions together, and they will implement any orders issued in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-agri-varsity-employees-protest-for-2nd-consecutive-day-threaten-to-go-on-hunger-strike/story-GOuSKEoJ0oKnlDfUrEuoWM.html

They said Gurcharan Singh Grewal, the officer during whose term an illegal liquor factory had flourished, has been reposted as Khanna’s senior superintendent of police by the Punjab government.The SAD leaders also threatened to raise a stir if the he was not posted out the district.Former minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal said it was during Gurcharan’s tenure as SSP that an illegal factory, which produced 1,000 crates of liquor everyday, had flourished under the nose of the local police.“It is condemnable that the same officer, who was transferred out of the district for failing to stop liquor smuggling, has now been posted back. We condemn the move and demand that he is posted out of the district immediately,” said Grewal.The senior SAD leader also demanded a CBI probe into the liquor scam. He said those who supplied machinery for the illegal factory and spirit used to make alcohol were yet to be identified.“The role of the Khanna Congress legislator who openly patronised the factory has also not been probed adequately. Till such time that the CBI probes the matter, it should be given for inquiry to an IG level officer,” he said. The former minister said it is clear that Gurcharan has been reposted as Khanna SSP to ensure the probe into the illegal factory and its godfathers can be scuttled.“In case the SSP is not posted out of the district, and a free and fair probe is not conducted into the matter, SAD will launch an agitation to secure justice”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/khanna-liquor-scam-sad-accuses-cong-of-trying-to-scuttle-probe/story-wtpXLOnFgIk3c28GO90zpM.html

Those in Delhi-NCR who love to hoard and repurpose/reuse old things, have found a new liking towards old objects in their homes, during the pandemic. Be it a hand-me-down sari or a an earthen pot, most things have got a dash of colour on them since their owners had some real spare time on their hands! So, from simple household furniture such as trunks and cupboards to cutlery and bottles, denizens have given a twist to most, while on #WFH mode. “Pandemic was a kind of signal from the universe to take a break, ponder, cleanse and redesign your thoughts and lifestyle. And to upcycle is a wonderful way to align yourself with the flow of events as it helps you to rejuvenate your home as well as your spirit,” says Sameera Satija, a Gurugram-based auditor, who revamped a trunk lying in her daughter’s room, and also worked with broken ceramic crockery to turn them in pieces of art. “The idea is to reuse, instead of discard old products, in order to not give into fast-paced consumerism,” adds Satija. Anuradha Ramachandran, a freelance writer, recently upcycled an old trunk taking help of her college-going niece Kriti Sahni, to decide on the various book titles that now adorn the new look on this metal storage piece. “The theme for the trunk ties in my love for books and reading with my current state of mind; especially during these extraordinary times where I feel we have more than enough. We need to take stock rather than spend on more. And Kriti helped me bring the idea to life,” says Ramachandran.And this comes naturally to Gurugram-based art teacher Piu Ghosh, for whom the canvas of late has been her daughter’s cupboard! “From ordinary paper I moved to painting furniture during the lockdown. I also painted crockery and made small additions to our dining table and walls. My husband is also artistically inclined, and we are trying to impart the same to our daughter,” she adds.Some denizens say that upcycling became a fun way for them to bond with their kids, while remaining indoors. “I made a batman dress out of old materials at home,” says Prachi Puri, a Gurugram-based businesswoman, who used the last few months to train her 5-year-old how to utilise thermocol plates, newspapers etc for school projects. Puri adds, “I paint old bottles, and make craft items from cartons, old plates and spoons. Reusing and recycling helps me think in a positive and constructive manner,” she says.An eco-friendly lifestyle is what motivated Gurugram-based homemaker Shilpa Anand as well. Her hobby has turned into a passion during the last few months of lockdown, and Anand has been posting pictures of her paintwork on old biryani pots and discarded water bottles. “Amid the pandemic, upcycling and painting acted as a therapy, and helped me stay calm and occupied. I turned old chocolate boxes into serving trays, and made DIY gift bags out of corn flakes boxes,” says Anand describing how the children in her society started coming to her to learn to recycle things at home. “It’s inspiring for me to realise that my work is influencing our younger generation,” she adds.

As temperature dips in the city, winter has come knocking in Sarojini, where sellers have put their varied winter wares on display.Lightweight sweaters and cardigans are a hitThe by lanes of Sarojini Nagar market are packed with people looking for lightweight sweaters, and the wide variety isn’t disappointing them either. “Corona apne ghar gaya,” quips Surinder, who has his stall stocked to the brim with sweaters that are available for ₹100 each. “Sabse jaldi yehi bik raha hai,” he says pointing towards thin cardigans on hangers. “The crowd has been better in the festival season, as people are learning to live with the virus while taking precautions,” he adds.The long and short of coatsRam Sevak Yadav, who has been selling clothes in this market for over a decade, shares that he has stocked up on jackets and coats, ranging from ₹350 to ₹800 since he saw that there’s always been a demand for these. “Long coats are the best sellers! And we try to keep all varieties... right now people want to wear light weight material, but do intend to protect themselves from Delhi’s chilly evenings,” he says. Dipti Gupta, a Noida resident, out for her winter shopping with friends in this shoppers’ paradise, says “Revenge shopping is a thing! I hadn’t shopped in seven months until festival approached. And since winter is fast approaching, I decided to splurge on a few coats that will go well with both saris and jeans. When the thought of shopping took over me, I knew there’s nothing like Sarojini when it comes to coats,” she says as she goes back to search for a corduroy. Sleepwear shenanigans: Flannel pyjamas to the rescue’Tis the season for coffee and warm pyjamas. Soft flannel night suit sets are on display in a noticeable quantity. Available at a starting price of ₹400, these night sets can be ditched for loose flannel pants, which cost around ₹200. Manorama, a south Delhi resident eyeing these pieces, tells us that she is looking for a pair to fulfil her daughter’s demand. She adds, “She had seen them online, but those were expensive. So I thought I’d try looking for them here, and thankfully found a few shops that are selling them. Ab bas bargain karna padega (chuckles).” Jackets, watta bomb!Young shoppers can be seen thronging shops selling jackets — denim fabrics, bomber jackets and even faux leather ones. “I used to come in December-January for winter wear, but this time evenings have become quite chilly especially when we are at home all day. So my yearly pilgrimage to Sarojini has come a little early this year,” says Niyati, a shopper who bought two denim jackets priced at ₹200 each. Buy now or repent later! Shopkeepers in the bargaining hub say they bought the winter stock, albeit in a limited quantity since they were skeptical that they might not be able to make as much sale as they did during the pre-Covid winter months. “The footfall is less than expected because cases wapis se badh rahe hain. Isliye hum kam saaman la toh rahe hain but only in limited quantities. More variety is expected to come in the coming weeks. Dresses, leather shoes, animal print jackets, ye sab aaega. Abhi se zyada stock layenge toh humara loss hoga, but agar aap ye sweaters leke nahi jaoge, toh bohot pachtaoge,” says Sonu Yadav, a young shopkeeper.

Also, SAD spoke up on denial of official language status to Punjabi in Jammu and Kashmir.He said that SAD had voted against the central agri bills in the Parliament, besides quitting the Union cabinet and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).“It is clear that the former minister has become a victim of political vendetta. SAD, however, will not be cowed down by such tactics of Centre and will continue to stand with farmers and Punjabis against the central laws and other issues that weakens the federal structure or is intrinsically anti-Punjab,” said the SAD spokesperson.The SAD leader said that Z-category security had been given to Majithia in 2010 during the UPA rule on the basis of threat perception.“The case was cleared by the then Union home minister P Chidambaram, who was known to be a hard taskmaster on the basis of credible reports. We would like to know what has changed suddenly that the 10-year-old cover was withdrawn on the basis of a single-line order,” said the SAD leader.SAD leaders claimed that Majithia continues to be a target of Pakistan-based anti-national elements and gangsters who have openly threatened to eliminate him.“Even Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had recently talked about increased attempts of Pakistan’s ISI to revive terrorist activities in Punjab, particularly in the Majha belt, which shares a border with Pakistan,” said a SAD spokesperson.“Majithia is from Majha area. There have been instances of seizures of drones and arms and ammunition from here. The law and order situation in Punjab, particularly the open licence to gangsters to operate from jails, is also known to everyone,” the spokesperson added.Stating that the Union home ministry will be held responsible for any untoward incident following the withdrawal Majithia’s security cover, the SAD leaders said this kind of action was “clearly designed to brow beat opponents, and is a new low in the Indian politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-condemns-withdrawal-of-z-security-cover-of-majithia/story-8sB4pqsocWy7zIzkP0xZKI.html

Prices of essential commodities, electricity, water and bus fares have been hiked, government treasury has been destroyed by continuous loans, bogus foundation laying ceremonies are being done and the state is suffering huge losses daily due to the pandemic. The state government cannot hide these facts by making false claims,” he said.Agnihotri further said that the CM is worried about losing his power and position and when the state government should rigorously work to contain the spread of the virus, but he is busy holding rallies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agnihotri-asks-cm-to-issue-white-paper-on-loss-suffered-by-himachal-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-Iyt8qvJVkLtEHuY24W4eOL.html

He also sought public cooperation to keep the situation under control.The health secretary in a statement said that it has often been observed that people were not following the specified guidelines in crowded places and were lowering their guard in the fight against the deadly virus which can prove fatal.People were flouting social distancing norms and were seen without masks during festival celebrations, weddings and private ceremonies.“In recent times there has been an increase in Covid-19 cases, in which most of them were recorded during these ceremonies or events,” he said.He further said that as many as 4,75,263 people have been screened for Covid-19 in the state to date, of which 32,197, were found positive.There are 6,980 active cases in the state while 480 people have died.Statistics of deaths due to the Covid-19 indicate that the majority of deaths occurred of elderly or people suffering from other diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or co-morbidities.He said that of the total people tested it has been found that about 70% of people were suffering from co-morbidities.Awasthi urged all such people, who are above 60 years of age or also suffering from any other disease, to be more vigilant.“At this time, the only requirement is to be vigilant, strengthen your immunity, get medical advice quickly and follow the guidelines suggested by the government,” he said.Awasthi also urged people to avoid attending social gatherings. “Do not take fever, cough, cold, or breathing problem lightly and immediately contact helpline number 104 or e-Sanjeevani OPD,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/adequate-health-infra-facilities-for-covid-management-in-hp-health-secretary/story-2DOmAcOzq2t1dNWqqzz9UI.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Chhath Puja for Delhiites: Low-key celebrations, thekua #FOMO and makeshift ponds||The four-day Chhath Puja celebrations, which involve worshipping the Sun God, began in the Capital on Wednesday. But, this year most denizens say they will be celebrating the festival at home, after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) instructed officials to ensure the festival is not performed at public places, river banks and temples, in lieu of the Covid-19 pandemic.Celebrate, but be safe In the absence of large-scale celebrations at public places, residents of Delhi-NCR are celebrating Chhath at home, with makeshift arrangements of water. Nishant and Nivedita Mishra, Gurugram-based working professionals residing in Gurugram, say they miss being home in Patna, where their family has gathered for the festivities. “It would be a gathering of all near and dear ones, where prayers and party would go hand in hand. We can’t go this year because of Covid-19 situation, but we’ll make arrangements for the morning and evening puja at our terrace, and ask our mothers on video call about the rituals that we need to follow,” adds Nishant. Swimming pool becomes makeshift pondYoungsters who love the festival because it gives them a chance to meet relatives and enjoy get-togethers, will give it a miss this year. Noida-based Aaditya Chandra says, “In normal times we used to go and meet relatives, and have the puja together. However, this year we’ve decided that it’s best to celebrate at home and follow the norms of social distancing. While the decision may feel disappointing in the short-run, in the long term it’s for the overall benefit. The rituals which were to be done at the ghat, are going to be done in the society’s swimming pool.”Some youngsters are happy to be home with their families since colleges are closed due to the pandemic, allowing them to have low-key celebrations while being at home with their dear ones. Ananya Jha, a Delhi University student, says, “My family gets together for Chhath, no matter what. Majority of my relatives are still gathering in a village in Madhubani district in Bihar this year. Right now due to the pandemic, I am back in Patna. Our apartment is collecting water in a makeshift perishable pond. Only one-two women will be fasting, on behalf of their families. We’ll be dressed up but we wouldn’t actively be participating in the rituals; we’ll just be spectators.”Missing Thekua, Food and FunMany who have not been able to go back home for Chhath, due to the pandemic, say the biggest thing they miss about the festival is the food! “Everyone in my office was hoping I’ll go home and bring back thekua but I have postponed my trip until next year; I don’t want to travel and put my parents at risk. However, I’ve plans to try my hand at making thekua for my colleagues,” says Nemaly Lochan, who works for an MNC in Gurugram. Mohit Bhatia, a second year student at a university in Greater Noida, says he’s also missing Chhath Puja savouries, especially the ones his friends used to bring from home. “Our classes are continuing online, and my friends who celebrate Chhath haven’t come back to Delhi yet. So I’m missing relishing the amazing thekua and poori that my friends would bring back from home. And knowing my friends, I know I’m going to be more jealous when they share pictures of their celebrations at home.”Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chhath-puja-for-delhiites-low-key-celebrations-thekua-fomo-and-makeshift-ponds/story-7PDHhEZDuoGdCTEYxt58aK.html

A messy office will just not do. Strict directions have been issued to the staff to keep the premises clean or face action,” Sabharwal said.Meets supervisors for waste segregationLater, Sabharwal conducted a meeting with MC supervisors deputed in areas falling under Zones A and B regarding waste segregation at source. Health branch nodal officer Ashwani Sahota said, “The supervisors have been told to spread awareness among waste collectors to pick only segregated waste from households. Also, wet and dry waste should be dumped separately at the secondary dumping points.”A monitoring committee of the National Green Tribunal had earlier set a November-30 deadline for implementation of waste segregation in the city. Failure to do so, will lead in encashment of MC’s Rs 5 lakh bank guarantee. Under the solid waste management bylaws, not segregating waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable entails fines ranging between Rs 250 for households and Rs 5,000 for bulk generators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/spearheading-cleanliness-in-ludhiana-mc-chief-gets-rude-shock-at-filthy-zone-a-office/story-DyoIqs1yfULLsFCtEdHE2L.html

Mumbai has recorded 2.72 lakh Covid-19 cases and more than 10,600 deaths.School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “The state government has taken a decision on reopening physical classes of Class 9 to 12 students, but for schools, local administration will have to take a decision. Districts having coronavirus cases should take a decision after discussing with all the concerned authorities such as district collectors, education officials etc. They are directed to take a call considering both the health and studies of the students.”Also read: Mandatory Covid test for Maharashtra school teachers triggers rush, inconvenience“Online classes will continue even if physical classes cannot be started due to the pandemic crisis in schools,” Gaikwad added.The state government on November 7 decided to resume physical classroom sessions for Class 9 to 12 students from November 23. However, there will be no daily classes as schools have been directed to open every alternate day and that too, only for four hours. BMC’s public relations department confirmed that all schools will remain shut in the city till December 31. A detailed circular in this regard, however, mentioned that the ongoing supplementary examination for Class 10 and 12 will be undertaken as per schedule but the regular Classes for 9 to 12 will remain shut till December 31. A BMC official said, “Considering BMC is the local body for Mumbai, we have taken the decision to keep the schools shut. We have also studied the pattern of Covid-19 spread in other parts of the country post schools were reopened, and hence have decided to keep them shut till December 31.” Also read: Covid-19: Ensure necessary arrangements are made before schools reopen, Maharashtra education department tells local bodiesSandhya Doshi, Shiv Sena corporator and education committee chairman of BMC, said, “There are discussions that we might hit the second wave soon.

Mohi said, “Senior Congress leaders of the district and state are mum on the issue, which proves that Bains enjoys the Congress party’s support. The complainant should be provided security, as Bains will make every possible effort to pressure her.” Gill said, “We have demanded that the inquiry be marked to a senior police official. Further, Bains should be summoned to inquire about the messages and calls to the complainant.”Despite repeated attempts, Bains was not immediately available for comments. However, LIP chief spokesperson Gagandeep Singh (Sunny) Kainth said Congress and SAD were trying to frame Bains in a false case to reap political benefits. “This is being done to divert the attention of Punjabis from ‘Lok Adhikar Yatra’ of LIP.

The group is accused of scamming over Rs 29 crore of around 250 investors.The group is accused of misappropriating funds in the name of government housing policy by luring victims of fruitful returns. According to DDA, no individual entity is authorized to advertise, market, book or sell or invite purchase any plot or flat for any project in the name of land pooling without registration of the project under Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. On the website, DDA also claims that it has not issued any license or approval to any housing project under the land pooling policy as of date.DDA’s land pooling policy came as a measure to build and provide sufficient houses through proper urban planning for Delhi-NCR. This scheme is used by various builders, promoters and individuals to con the innocent buyers. DDA has numerous times come with cautionary warnings to alert the citizens about societies, developers, companies and promoters that float misleading advertisements about the housing scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-arrests-member-of-fantastic-four-group-for-cheating-rs-29-crore-under-dda-s-land-pooling-scheme/story-i3ZMU4zCiC24jV7zm4AX5M.html

However, most deaths happen after 10 days. If you see the proportion of deaths, it has remained the same at about 1.57%. This is almost comparable to the national average of 1.48%. There was a time when Delhi’s case fatality ratio was about a percent higher than the national average,” said Jain.Although the cumulative case fatality ratio (CFR) – the proportion of deaths among those who tested positive for the infection – remained at about 1.57%, the seven-day average has shot up to 2.78%.Also Read: Health experts clash over use of certain drugs for Covid-19Union home minister Amit Shah has said that half the deaths in Delhi were happening within the first two to three days of hospitalisations in June when Delhi had seen the first surge in the number of cases.

Half of these deaths happened within the first 24-hours of admission. In Delhi, there has been a dramatic change since.

Chances of mist and fog will continue in open areas across the region in the morning and evening due to relatively higher humidity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cold-to-intensify-as-maximum-temperatures-three-degrees-below-normal-in-punjab-haryana/story-m201BsFyhJFmcjiLCdwi5M.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi health minister ropes in Superman, Batman to fight Covid-19||The Delhi government has brought in Batman, Superman, and Flash in their fight against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with the health minister posting pictures of the superheroes in masks on Facebook. The caption on the photographs read, “Heroes wear masks. Put on your mask and save lives. #BeAHero.” Another post reads, “Not all heroes wear capes, some wear masks.” Health minister Satyendar Jain also shared a post on how not to wear a mask, with the people in the picture having the mask dangle from one ear, sliding down on their chin, or just covering their mouth.This comes as the Delhi government increased the fine on not wearing mask in public places from Rs500 to Rs2,000, in view of high number of Covid-19 cases and deaths being reported each day. Delhi on Thursday reported 7,546 new cases and 98 deaths due to the infection. So far, the pandemic has killed 8,041 people in the city and affected over 510,000 people since the first case was reported on March 2 this year. Also read | Covid-19: Containment zones rise to over 4,550 in DelhiJain has maintained that masks are better than lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19, which is largely transmitted through droplets released by an infected person when they talk, cough, or sneeze. Earlier this week, Jain had said, “The lockdown had been an experiment and what we have learnt from it is that wearing masks can give us the same benefits. Scientifically, masks are the best way to stop the virus. If you see, the lowest positivity rates are recorded in Covid-19 hospitals because the doctors there follow precautions. If everyone follows precautions the spread of the infection can be prevented. And, when it comes to lockdown, some people still go out and they can bring the infection back to their family members.” Experts agree. “The likelihood of a person getting the infection from another depends on whether the person is contagious, the number of contacts with an infected person, and the risk of infection with each exposure. Now, a lockdown can only cut down the number of contacts you have with an infected person, but a mask also reduces the risk of infection with each exposure,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, head of the department of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-health-minister-co-opts-superman-batman-to-fight-covid-19/story-etNAqDI8CHoAXXUDLhZqnL.html
20-11-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka cabinet reshuffle: Deputy CM says BJP high command to convey decision by next week||As the wait continues for expansion or reshuffle of cabinet in Karnataka, Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi said on Friday the BJP high command is likely to communicate their decision in about a week’s time. “CM (B S Yediyurappa) has made national president J P Nadda aware about all related matters here. Nadda ji has informed the CM he will discuss with the Prime Minister and Amit Shah (Union Home minister) and will convey the decision..It will come in four to six days,” Laxman Savadi told reporters at Kalaburagi. Responding to a question on some ministerial aspirants meeting BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel, he said, “they (MLAs) have freedom to express their feelings with the president and the Chief Minister. They have expressed their opinion and the CM and the president will look into it.” Yediyurappa after his meeting with Nadda in Delhi on November 18 on the cabinet exercise, had said the party national president has sought a couple of days time to consult other leaders on the matter. Developments in Delhi on Wednesday was a repetition of sorts for Yediyurappa, as he was sent back with a similar reply by Nadda, when the Chief Minister had gone with a proposal to take up cabinet expansion exercise in September, ahead of the monsoon session of the state legislature. Political activities have intensified within the ruling BJP camp in the state after Yediyurappa on November 10 indicated that cabinet reshuffle was on the cards after the party’s victory in the bypolls to two assembly constituencies. The Chief Minister had then hinted about reshuffle by dropping or inducting some Ministers. The cabinet expansion or reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope walk for Yediyurappa, considering that there are too many aspirants. Several legislators have openly declared their aspirations and political hobnobbing is also taking place within the BJP circles. A few aspirants had met BJP state president Kateel on Thursday, apparently aimed at securing their place during the cabinet exercise this time. On the other hand, 8-time MLA Umesh Katti, who has been sulking on being denied a chance earlier, met Yediyurappa on Friday. Meanwhile in what is being dubbed as related development, Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has met BJP national general secretary B L Santosh in New Delhi. According to party sources, Jarkiholi is said to have lobbied for Congress-JD(S) rebels who joined the BJP along with him last year and helped the party come to power. Recently some BJP legislators had met at Jarkiholi’s residence and reportedly discussed cabinet exercise. While several of the old guard like Katti are awaiting a chance to be inducted into the Ministry, Congress-JD(S) rebels like A H Vishwanath, R Shankar and M T B Nagaraj, who helped the BJP come to power and are now party MLCs, are also aspiring for slots. As per the agreement, Yediyurappa will also have to keep space for Munirathna, following his win from Rajarajeshwari Nagar seat in the bypoll, and also for Pratap Gowda Patil who needs to win the Maski bypoll that is yet to be announced. The cabinet currently has 27 members, and seven berths are still vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-cabinet-reshuffle-deputy-cm-says-bjp-high-command-to-convey-decision-by-next-week/story-yzniAtMCHZr3IpXz1SsokI.html

According to ANI, he said, “In our culture, marriage isn’t just an individual choice, it also encompasses approval of religion & society. Agenda of ‘Love -Jihad’, sufferings of our daughters are clear to everyone and to ignore it only shows his (Ashok Gehlot) small thinking.”Rajasthan CM Gehlot on Friday attacked the BJP in a series of tweets where he said that the term ‘Love Jihad’ is a term manufactured by the BJP and accused them of creating divisions in the society. He tweeted, ““Love Jihad is a word manufactured by BJP to divide the Nation & disturb communal harmony. Marriage is a matter of personal liberty, bringing a law to curb it is completely unconstitutional & it will not stand in any court of law. Jihad has no place in Love.”He also expressed concern and said that the government is forcing consenting adults ‘to be at the mercy of state power’ and placing curbs on their personal freedom.Several BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka are planning to roll out an anti-conversion bill in a bid to stop ‘Love Jihad.’ ‘Love jihad’ is a term used by several right-wing organisations to describe marriages between Hindu women and Muslim men and allege that it is a ploy to increase conversions to Islam by using marriage as a tool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/ignoring-the-suffering-of-our-daughters-bjp-s-poonia-slams-gehlot-over-love-jihad-tweets/story-MqqLdJfDuV55z1wrvr1byL.html

If the TMC members think they can intimidate voters and engage in political violence, then there are provisions in the Constitution to take care of such things,” he told a local news channel.Supriyo claimed that the people of the state have made up their mind to vote for the BJP in the assembly elections, which are likely to be held in April-May next year.“We want the people who voted TMC to power to topple the present government through a democratic process,” said Supriyo.The TMC said that Supriyo was hinting at imposing President’s rule in the state.“If he was hinting at the imposition of Article 356 in Bengal, then he should first talk about the imposition of President’s rule in Uttar Pradesh where rule of law has ceased to exist,” TMC MP Sougata Roy said.

20-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: As cap on attendees back, Delhi banquet and hotels owners struggle to retain clients||Deepak Sharma (48), a bakery shop owner in Najafgarh, made frantic calls to relatives to look for a new venue for his son’s wedding, scheduled on November 25, after Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal approved the government’s proposal to restrict the number of guests at marriage-related events to 50 amid a spike in Covid-19 cases.Sharma had booked a resort in Mundka for the wedding. “With the help of our relatives, we found another resort in Ballabhgarh, Faridabad. Now, we are busy informing all our relatives about the change of venue and making arrangements for transportation. There is complete panic and chaos in the household instead of fun and enjoyment,” said Sharma.Also read | Amid spike in Covid-19 cases, Delhi starts door-to-door survey from todayLike Sharma, many people are now looking for alternate venues in the National Capital Region—Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat etc—so that they can accommodate all the invitees. Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) decision has proved to be disastrous for the wedding industry in the Capital. Tent houses, banquets and hotels claim that they are bombarded with cancellation calls or asking for refund.Nitin Gulati, owner of Gulati tent house, said that he has got nine cancellations in just two days. “We had erected the tents for a capacity of 200 people. Now, our clients are looking for venues in neighbouring areas. We have started removing tents after nine clients cancelled the event,” said Gulati.He added, “This year has been disastrous for us. After no work for 7-8 months due to Covid-19, we were looking forward to the wedding season to stay afloat. We had called labour from Bengali and UP. Now, I don’t know how to pay them, as clients are asking for a refund,” said Gulati.Vikaas Gutgutia, managing director and founder, Ferns N Petals — which is into luxury venues since 2003 —, said, “For the Indian wedding industry, recovery was on the cards, but businesses will again come to a standstill, as we are facing the brunt of Diwali crowds at markets. We have been getting calls from clients who had opted for a venue in Delhi, to enquire, if the functions can be organised at our venues in the NCR. In the coming days, all our 11 wedding venues are booked to host 10-12 weddings each but we are now anticipating changes or delays.”Associations of banquets, tent houses and hotels are still trying to approach the Delhi government and the L-G to reconsider the decision. Ramesh Dang, president of Community Welfare Banquet Association Delhi, said, “We have written to the CM to reconsider the decision, as it will result in the collapse of the sector. People are now opting for neighbouring areas in UP and Haryana. We have 1 million families associated with us. It will lead to large scale unemployment,” said Dang.Struggling to retain their clients, hotels and banquets are trying to offer them different options. Greesh Bindra, vice president, operations, at Suryaa hotel, said, “We are getting a lot of calls from concerned clients who are asking for refund. We have 4-5 venues, including big outdoor spaces at our hotels. We are suggesting them different options such as holding events at two different venues in the hotel or holding multiple events so that the guests can be divided. We have also suggested that some guests come for lunch while others for dinner.”The government’s sudden decision will hurt the industry in the next wedding season starting from January, as people don’t want any uncertainty in their plans. “This atmosphere of uncertainty will impact the next wedding season in Delhi,” said Bindra.Calling the restriction over the number of guests unjustified, Pankaj Shokeen, general secretary, Delhi tent owners’ federation, said, “The cinema halls are allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Buses are running full capacity. The markets are crowded. But the restriction is just for weddings. Why? In wedding events, people know each other. But in cinema halls or buses, people sitting next to each other are complete strangers. There is no logic in the decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-as-cap-on-attendees-back-delhi-banquet-and-hotels-owners-struggle-to-retain-clients/story-o6X3qexZ5h9ne0nnFUvYwK.html

I have asked Animal Husbandry Minister Sri @PrabhuChavanBJP to get “The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter & Preservation of Cattle Bill” passed in the Cabinet and present the same in the upcoming Assembly Session,” the Chikkamagaluru MLA tweeted.Ravi had also said earlier this month that on the lines of Allahabad High Court’s order, Karnataka would enact a law banning religious conversions for the sake of marriage.“We will not remain silent when Jihadis strip the dignity of our sisters,” he had said, adding, any one involved in any act of conversion shall face severe and swift punishment.The Allahabad High Court in its order on October 31 said that religious conversion just for the sake of marriage was not valid.The court made the remark while dismissing a plea by a newly married couple in Uttar Pradesh that had approached it to direct police and the woman’s father not to disturb their marital life.In the petition, it was stated that the couple got married in July this year, but family members of the woman were interfering in their marital life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-bjp-leader-ct-ravi-says-cow-slaughter-ban-coming-soon/story-AeZMBtNbuokFVaEarlqlJJ.html

20-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi records coldest November morning since 2006||The minimum temperature in the national capital dropped to 7.5 degrees Celsius on Friday morning, five notches below normal for this time of the year. This was the lowest minimum temperature recorded in November since 2006, said officials of India Meteorological Department (IMD). On November 29, 2006, the minimum temperature had dropped to 7.3 degrees Celsius, said officials. According to IMD scientists,the minimum temperature does not usually drop below 10 degrees Celsius in November. However, during the last week of November in 2017, the minimum temperature had dipped to 7.6 degrees Celsius. In November 2019, the lowest temperature was 11.4 degrees Celsius and in November 2018, it was 10.5 degrees Celsius. Also Read: Winter arrives early in some parts of NW India; Delhi records 7.5°C“It’s unusual for the minimum temperature to drop to single digits in mid-November. Winter is setting in early this year. The sharp drop in night temperature is mainly because of a combination of cold winds blowing from the snow-clad Western Himalayan region as well as largely clear skies in Delhi. When there is no cloud cover, the heat trapped in the ground dissipates fast, resulting in lower temperatures,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. He added that snowfall in the Himalayas is an annual phenomenon, which impacts the temperature in all of northwest India, but local factors such as the absence of a cloud cover play an important role. “The minimum temperature is likely to remain around 7-8 degrees Celsius over the next two days,” said Srivastava. Delhi also saw the coldest October in 58 years with the mean minimum temperature for the month recorded at 17.2 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-records-lowest-morning-temperature-in-14-years/story-2LklzmRFXUcpsJqErUYkPL.html
20-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Shiv Sena hits back at BJP, dares it to wrest control of BMC||Hitting out at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over a remark that Shiv Sena’s saffron flag needs ‘purification’, the latter said that BJP has no connection with the saffron flag. An editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana said the saffron flag of Shiv Sena is fluttering atop the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for over three decades and dared BJP to remove it. The allies-turned-rivals – BJP and Shiv Sena – are warming up to an intense fight for control over the BMC, the richest civic body in the country, which goes to polls in early 2022. Sounding the poll bugle on Wednesday, Devendra Fadnavis said the BJP will take control of the BMC after February 2022. BJP leader Ashish Shelar remarked that Sena’s saffron flag needs purification after it abandoned Hindutva to ally with Congress and Nationalist Congress Party last November. “BJP leaders did not say they hoisted saffron flag in Bihar after their recent win. It is because they are not connected to the saffron flag. They got connected to the saffron flag after allying with the Shiv Sena. It is fluttering on Mumbai [civic body] since the time BJP was not with Shiv Sena. This saffron flag is pure, radiant and effective,” the editorial said on Friday.It added that though the BJP has inducted the descendants of Maratha warrior king Shivaji in their party, the saffron flag of Shivaji still belongs to Marathi people. “The ones who are plotting to remove the original saffron flag of Marathi pride and Hindu radiance are betraying Hindutva in the country,” the editorial added.On Thursday, Sanjay Raut, Sena’s chief spokesperson and a member of the Rajya Sabha (RS), took the battle to the opposition BJP’s camp. Taking a veiled dig at actor Kangana Ranaut, he told media persons in Delhi that Mumbaikars would never hand over control of BMC to a party which backs people who had insulted Mumbai and equated it to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-shiv-sena-hits-back-at-bjp-dares-it-to-remove-saffron-flag-from-bmc/story-QSpZn8HDdT7bredvPRfybM.html

20-11-2020||Chandigarh||Moga epidemiologist sacked for issuing fake negative report to Covid NRI patient||Three months after doctors at the Moga civil hospital were accused of running a racket in connivance with agents to conduct early Covid-19 tests, especially of non-resident Indians (NRIs) and providing fake negative reports even for positive patients for a bribe, the state government has terminated the services of the district epidemiologist. The probe conducted by the district administration found Moga epidemiologist Dr Naresh Kumar Amla guilty of providing a fake Covid-19 negative report to an NRI who had tested positive. Dr Amla changed the NRI’s positive report to negative after taking bribe. Kumar Rahul, the mission director of the National Health Mission (NHM), Punjab, said: “This has had a bad impact on the image of the health department and sent a wrong message to the public regarding its working. Dr Amla has violated rules by misusing his position. Dr Amla’s contract under NHM has been terminated after giving him a seven-day notice.” Moga civil surgeon Dr Amarpreet Kaur said the epidemiologist was found guilty and the government had terminated his services but no criminal action had been initiated so far. In August, Charanjit Singh, a resident of Dehadka village in Ludhiana district, complained to deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans, alleging that he had paid ₹3,500 for each test of nine of his NRI family members to get the reports early. He said his parents are residents of Hong Kong were stranded in India for six months due to the pandemic. “Our flight to Hong Kong was scheduled on August 4. We had only 72 hours to get the test reports. When I reached the Moga civil hospital along with my parents and my sister-in-law’s family on August 2, the doctors informed me that they cannot conduct our tests that day due to the long waiting. In the meantime, Om Parkash of Moga came to me and said that if we pay ₹3,500 each, the tests will be done that day itself. We had no option but to pay ₹31,500 for the nine tests,” Charanjit Singh said. Later, Om Parkash also submitted an affidavit to the deputy commissioner, stating that he had given ₹1.7 lakh to Dr Amla to get reports of 48 NRIs early. He said Dr Amla assured him that if any of them is tested positive, they will be given a fake negative test report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/moga-epidemiologist-sacked-for-issuing-fake-negative-report-to-covid-nri-patient/story-UNw3ZPlOaVgL4frPvu7JzM.html

However, incineration followed by emission and other waste treatment procedures will be carried out away from the city.”SMS plant operators said they were devastated by the decision. “We do not have any other option. We now have to bear a cost of ₹50 crore for setting up the entire facility at Khalapur and all efforts made in Mumbai will be wasted,” said Amit Nilawar, director, SMS Envoclean.Nilawar added that with a drop in Covid-19 cases, the quantity of Covid-19 and other biomedical waste had reduced by 47% since September-October.“We are now receiving 17 to 18 tons per day against 32 tons till October first week. However, we are sending 6-7 tons to another unit in Taloja - Mumbai Waste Management Ltd for treatment,” he said.A local resident from Govandi, requesting anonymity, said citizens welcomed the decision but hoped that the shifting out process could be expedited. “Breathing issues continue especially for senior citizens and children,” the resident said.Also Read: BJP leader Kirit Somaiya targets Aaditya Thackeray; Shiv Sena rubbishes allegationsMahul firms comply with all directions under state’s pollution abatement plan: Aaditya ThackerayFirms at the city’s polluted Mahul area have complied with most commitments made for pollution abatement as directed by the environment department, Thackeray said after a meeting with state bodies and the firms on Wednesday.“It is a huge relief that all industries in the Mahul area have complied with almost all directives from the environment department. A few still remain but will be completed soon. Now, the National Green Tribunal appointed committee will be looking into other details of pollution abatement as directed by the court,” said Thackeray.Firms at Mahul-Trombay area are said to be responsible for high air pollution for the past two years posing a health risk for local residents. Activities such as logistic services, storing oil, gas and chemical items, and oil companies releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during loading, storage and unloading of hazardous chemicals, have led to high air pollution.Industrial firms, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL), Aegis Logistics Ltd (ALL), and SeaLord Containers Limited (SLCL, a subsidiary of ALL), had all agreed to a series of measures proposed by the state environment department during a meeting in February, when an action plan was proposed.Also Read: Rajasthan to de-notify forest area to allow stone miningSome of these measures included – nitrogen blanketing (a method of applying nitrogen gas to the vapour space or top layer of a container carrying chemicals to control its composition and reduce oxygen access to curb emission), bottom-filling of trucks to ensure liquid does not spill out, supplying a parking area to avoid congestion of vehicles, developing a green belt, and traffic permissions to use the eastern freeway during non-peak hours for smoother movement and curb spillage.According to Thackeray, ALL has agreed to relocate their laboratory which was one of the concerns for increase in air pollution. “We are working with the traffic department to complete the process of bottom-filling of trucks to ensure zero volatile liquid splashing on roads. Secondly, for the development of the green belt, BMC has been tasked with planting 30,000 saplings in this area by May, and have been directed to procure saplings from their nurseries,” said Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/biomedical-waste-incineration-plant-to-shift-out-of-mumbai-by-feb-2022/story-prt3F4YkymRZNHSBpdryuI.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality deteriorates again, may improve marginally tomorrow||Air quality in Delhi plunged to the far end of the "poor" category on Friday morning. The city’s air quality index (AQI) reading at 6am was 290, higher than the average AQI reading of 283 recorded on Thursday. Government agencies had on Thursday forecast that air quality may deteriorate slightly and may touch the lower end of the "very poor" zone on November 20-21. As per the System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing said air quality may touch "very poor" on Friday and may improve marginally on Saturday. It attributed the deterioration in air quality to a rise in the contribution of stubble fires to the city’s PM 2.5 levels. Also Read: Winter arrives early in some parts of NW India; Delhi records 7.9°C“The wind direction is north-westerly and is bringing fumes from stubble fires in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab,” the Safar bulletin had stated. The contribution of stubble-burning to the city’s PM 2.5 levels was estimated to be 20% on Thursday, up from 8% the previous day. The deterioration is despite the average wind speed being around 10-15 kmph, which is favourable for the dispersion of pollutants. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the rise in fire count and a dip in temperature both could be the reasons behind deterioration in air quality. Delhi had recorded the lowest minimum temperature of the season on Thursday --- 9.4 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal. It is mainly because of cold winds blowing from the snow-clad Himalayan region. The maximum settled at 25.6 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. “The minimum temperature may fall further over the weekend. However, wind speed is likely to remain high until November 21,” said a senior IMD scientist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-deteriorates-again-may-improve-marginally-tomorrow/story-U8zY7J943GH72sVyQMy1tJ.html

To ensure implementation of the said order, the Uttarakhand high court had initiated a suo moto petition last year to monitor the progress of work done by the state.Appearing for the state government, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a three-judge bench of the apex court that out of a total of 793 identified illegal religious structures, only five remained to be demolished. These included four structures in Haridwar and a gurdwara in Udham Singh Nagar.Due to the approaching Kumbh, the Uttarakhand government had requested for time to carry out the demolition of the four illegal structures at Haridwar, where Kumbh is to take place. The state argued that during Kumbh, the state will be required to allocate space to the akharas for placing their deities and removing these structures now will entail law and order problems.Also Read: Restoration of Uttarakhand’s 400-year-old Ganga temple beginsThe bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah accepted this request of the state government and gave them time till May 31, 2021 to clear these structures.These structures included Shri Gopaldas through Mehent Rajendradas Nirmohi Akhada, Beragi Camp, Haridwar, (182.25 square metres), Shri Brahmdutt Dharamdas (Jagannath) Beragi Camp, Nirmani Adi Akhada, Haridwar (273 square metres), Shri Ranchood Das, Bhaiyadas Digamber Akhada, Beragi Camp, Haridwar (16.81 square metres), and Shri Amitpuri Niranjan Dev, Niranjani Akhada, Gangeswar Beragi Camp, Haridwar (37.44 square metres).Also Read: Hovercraft, ferry boat waterway service on anvil for Haridwar Mahakumbh 2021 The bench held, “For the reasons given in the application and especially that ‘Kumbh Mela’ is to commence in 2021 and will end on April 15, 2021, we are of the view that the State should be permitted to demolish the illegal structures by May 31, 2021.”The Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad also sought intervention in the matter and requested the court to consider regularizing the structures. They admitted that the structures were made on land belonging to the irrigation department. According to Vanshaja Shukla, who drafted the state’s appeal, these structures were constructed during the Ardh Kumbh of 2010. “When the Kumbh Mela is organized, all the Akharas are given temporary places for them to place their deity, and camp around it and live there for the whole period of Kumbh Mela and perform their religious practices and rituals,” Shukla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/kumbh-in-view-sc-extends-time-to-demolish-4-illegal-religious-structures-in-haridwar/story-zYp7x6HpxXQ4WasejglViK.html

On the advice of the chief minister, Governor Phagu Chauhan accepted Choudhary’s resignation. Choudhary, a Janata Dal (United) MLA from Tarapur in Munger district, was accused of irregularities in the appointment of assistant professors and junior scientists at Bihar Agriculture University (BAU), Sabour, in Bhagalpur when he was its vice-chancellor from 2010 to 2015. He was expelled from the party in 2017 after an FIR was lodged against him for forgery, cheating and other charges. He rejoined the party in January 2018.On Thursday, Choudhary was summoned by the CM. After a closed-door meeting that lasted around 30 minutes, he submitted his resignation. JD(U)’s Ashok Chaudhary has been given the charge of department.The Opposition, however, kept up its attack on the CM. “Nitish Kumar is the real culprit. Why did he make a corrupt person the minister?” said RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.CPI-ML state secretary Kunal (he uses only one name) said, “The government had to bow down to pressure of the public.” According to sources, an FIR was lodged against the minister on February 20, 2017, with the Sabour police station in Bhagalpur on the directives of the then governor, who was also the chancellor of universities in Bihar, Ram Nath Kovind, who set up a probe committee after several applicants alleged irregularities in appointments.Choudhary was booked under sections 409 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine of forged document) and 120 (B) (conspiracy) of the IPC.

Bharatpur district collector, Nathmal Didel, said the mining, forest and revenue departments have surveyed the hills of Banshi Pahadpur and found no wild animals or forests. This would help for denotification of the Banshi Pahadpur block, he said.“After the initial survey, a report will be sent to the chief wildlife warden of the forest department” seeking denotification to allow legal mining, he said.A mining department official, privy to the development, said that the Bharatpur mining engineer would apply for permission to denotify and allow mining in the hills through the forest department’s portal.A proposal would then be sent to the environment ministry seeking approval to denotify the area under the Forest Conservation Act, the official said.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which has been sourcing stones from the Banshi Pahadpur hills for the construction of the Ram Temple for the past five years, had approached the Bharatpur district administration over a delay in supply of stones in September-October. The district administration had then said that the stones were being illegally mined after three trucks, loaded with the pink sandstones, were seized on September 27 in a joint operation of the police, forest and revenue departments.“The pink and yellow sandstone is in high demand. Illegal mining activity in the area feeds processing units in the district. The district administration takes action against illegal mining randomly,” Didel said.According to the state mines department officials, until December 1996, around 42 legal mines of pink, red and yellow sandstone operated in the Banshi Pahadpur forest area.However, the Supreme Court prohibited non-forest activities in forest areas without diversion under the Forest Act through its order dated December 12, 1996||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-to-denotify-forest-area-to-allow-stone-mining/story-0QnptYhojxmZlajhXpeCEM.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The bangle seller’s pandemic||The lady in ghoonghat (headcovering or headscarf) sceptically scans the cart’s content, as if she were certain to find rotten brinjals there, and just wanted to spot one so as to confront the hawker with his dishonesty.But this isn’t a vegetable cart. Across the road from Gurugram’s Anaj Mandi, it is stacked up with thousands of glass bangles. “Don’t show me any cracked choori (bangle),” she snubs at vendor Aamir Khan who fervently wants the woman to buy the bangles. His business has severally nosedived due to the pandemic. “Last year, in the week around Karva Chauth, I was making ₹20,000 daily, but this Karva Chauth week it came to just ₹4,000 daily.”Karva Chauth, a festival during which women traditionally keep a day-long fast for their husband’s well-being, got over some days ago. It used to be the highlight of Mr Khan’s year.All these glass bangles on his cart are from Firozabad, the town in UP famous for manufacturing glass products, especially bangles. It’s also Mr Khan’s home district, where he regularly goes to get fresh batches of bangles. But his work trips have grown less frequent. Indeed, Mr Khan’s decade-old bangle-selling trade has plummeted so low since the coronavirus-triggered lockdown that he has been forced to work as a “palledar” (labourer) every night in the adjacent Anaj Mandi. There, he helps in the unloading of freshly arrived vegetables and fruits. “I make ₹300 a day from bangles, and ₹400 in the (vegetable) mandi.”By now the woman appears to have chosen half a dozen red bangles. It has exactly the same shade of red as her sari blouse. She tries to check their size by trying to slide one onto her arm. It’s not going. With one hand, Mr Khan gently holds her wrist, and with the other he tries to slide in the bangle, with some effort.Next moment, the bangle is in.Now the bargaining starts. Mr Khan explains that he is charging a higher price for the chosen bangles because “I decorated them with sitare and jhilmil at home.”The lady buys six bangles, three for each arm, and goes away.Mr Khan now waits for his next customer. He says he shall return to his home in Pataudi Chowk by 8pm, where he lives with his wife and two kids in a one-room dwelling. There won’t be a long restful night for him. He will wake up at 3am to go to the Anaj Mandi for his shift as a labourer and will return home by 8 in the morning. Two hours later he will have to leave home again to set up his bangle cart for the new day. “If this bad situation continues, I’ll have to forever leave NCR (National Capital Region) and return to my village.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-bangle-seller-s-pandemic/story-49zHEHXJ172EEpRajfahLL.html

20-11-2020||City||Ludhiana: Farmers, industry body join hands to fight stubble trouble||Perceived to be at loggerheads with each other due to the ongoing agitation against central laws, farmers and industrialists are scripting a success story in 51 villages of Raikot and Doraha block, by joining hands to end the stubble burning menace.The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), along with societies such as Gadri Baba Dulla Singh Giani Nihal Singh Foundation, Jalaldiwal, and the extension cell of Guru Nanak National College, Doraha, has set up an equipment bank to lease out farm machinery for harvesting and sowing of crops.This has not only brought down the spending incurred by farmers, but has also brought about a social change wherein farmers themselves are thwarting attempts of stubble burning.How it worksEach farmer is required to visit the machine bank and reserve the day for which they need the farming equipment. After using the machine, the farmers return the equipment to the bank, where maintenance work is carried out, and thereafter provided to another farmer.Cost-effective practiceThis proves cost-effective for the farmers as they don’t have to spend lakhs on special equipment and can instead take it on lease for a nominal fee. Jagminderpal Singh, a farmer, says, “I stopped stubble burning about five years ago. Earlier, my land used to produce negligible yield but now, with the incorporation of the new method, the soil’s health has also improved and I had a bumper yield this year.” Easy maintenance Bhupinder Singh, an NRI who returned from Canada to take up farming in Burj Hakiman village, said that government-aided cooperative societies also provide equipment on lease, but due to lack of maintenance, the machines become defunct quickly. But with the industry contributing to the endeavor, this problem has been solved, he said.Gursharan Singh, a postgraduate who decided to take up farming, said, “The government policies are not designed keeping in mind the micro and small farmers. Rather than giving subsidies to farmers on buying these machines such societies should be encouraged to lease out the equipments at subsidised rates. These equipments are to be used for few days in the whole year and keeping these machines is and added burden.”‘Was not an easy task get everyone on-board’Harminder Singh Sidhu, a progressive farmer and the director of Gadri Baba Dulla Singh Giani Nihal Singh Foundation, who started the campaign against stubble burning five years ago, says convincing farmers to give up this age-old practice wasn’t easy. “Initially, I faced a lot of criticism from all quarters. It was difficult to convince farmers to get on board but luckily the industry also pitched in and agreed to work with the farmers,” said Harminder, who has been honoured by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) and the Union department of agriculture and farmers’ welfare last year for his efforts. 5,061 farmers part of the initiative CII programme lead Chandrakant Pradhan said that currently 5,061 farmers are part of the initiative. Pradhan claims that due to their efforts, farmers are following the in-situ practice on 7,759 acres and not setting their fields on fire.SM Tahir Hussain, programme coordinator, Punjab and Haryana Climate Change Resilience, CII Foundation, said, “We noticed that although farmer cooperatives, FPOs and other farmer groups have tried to procure machines in most villages, it was not sufficient and as a result most small and marginal farmers were being left out.”Hussain said that the CII has helped procure 500 machines, including in-situ straw management machines such as Happy Seeder, Mulcher, Super Seeder, MB Plough, besides balers and tractors to support small and marginal farmers. “We have also piloted various ex-situ straw management measures, such as a straw-to-biogas unit in Raikot, Ludhiana,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-farmers-industry-body-join-hands-to-fight-stubble-trouble/story-6HFPRVqY0jt4pCHONVqn0L.html

Instalments of those working in Haryana will be paid by the state government,” Vij said on Thursday. “The government will pay the loan for the next seven years and those who won’t work here will pay it themselves. This is like any other education loan,” he added.Parent of an MBBS aspirant, Parvesh Goel, who had met Vij on Wednesday with a request to review the policy, said that the department of medical education and research in its November 6 notification didn’t give clarity on the admissions to MD (doctor of medicine) programme.“My daughter has scored 620 marks out of 720 in the NEET examinations, but the state is yet to declare her Haryana rank. Also, many students here belong to middle-class families. How will their parents arrange ₹10 lakh service bond every year?” Goel asked. Several Congress leaders from Ambala, including Mullana MLA Varun Chaudhary, former CPS Ramkishan Gujjar, former MLA Jasbir Mallour and state treasurer Rohit Jain, on Thursday handed over a memorandum to DC Ashok Kumar Sharma for governor, demanding a stay on the policy.The memorandum stated that the policy will rather push students from economically weaker sections or reserved categories towards private universities.“A report stated that every year, the state produces 1,500 medical students, while the government provides jobs to only 300-400 of them.

Two more persons, including his brother Satish Sharma and friend Rajesh Sharma, also jumped to rescue him, but failed to take him out. While Satish was rescued by a local, Sonu Saluja, Rajesh couldn’t be traced.The trigger behind the extreme step is yet to be ascertained, but it has been learnt that Harish was upset after police booked him and his councillor daughter Anjali Sharma, along with eight others, for allegedly selling firecrackers and assaulting some cops. His family members have alleged that he feared arrest and reached his friend’s house on Wednesday. Soon after getting the information about the incident, police reached the spot and launched a search and rescue operation. Panipat DSP (headquarters) Satish Vats said that the search operation was going on to fish out the bodies and water level in the canal has been reduced to help the divers.

20-11-2020||City||Health department starts sampling in Jhajjar, Rewari, Jind schools||In order to tackle the rise in Covid-19 cases in government schools, the health department on Thursday started conducting sampling in Jhajjar, Rewari and Jind schools where over 150 children tested positive for the virus.Dr Sanjay Dahiya, chief medical officer, Jhajjar, said, “We have collected samples of 423 students from five schools in the district, report of which is expected to be out tomorrow. We are planning to cover all schools in the district in next two weeks.”The department has also collected samples of students from Sonepat, Fatehabad and Bhiwani districts.A senior official of the Haryana education department said nearly 1.58 lakh students out of 6 lakh are attending the schools across the state everyday. “A total of 174 students and 107 teachers have tested positive for the virus across the state. This means that the number of students who have tested positive is not even 0.5% of the total students attending the classes. The health department has collected random samples from over 7,000 students across the state. It is too early to reconsider shutting down the schools,” the official added.He further said the total students attending the schools has increased from the last week’s 1.29 lakh to 1.59 lakh this week.“We have no option other than conducting classes as less than 100 days are left for the board exams. We cannot pass a student without conducting practical and pre-board exams, besides organising exams of at least four subjects,” he added.Haryana’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary, said the infection rate among students can be decreased up to 80% if they start wearing masks and practice social distancing. “Teachers must ensure that windows of classrooms are kept opened. Most of the students are not wearing face masks and their teachers are also taking it lightly. The parents should inform the health department if their ward experiences any symptom of the disease and bar them from sending to school. It is not advisable to shut down the schools as the students have suffered a lot. If schools will follow the safety guidelines, students will be able to continue with their studies,” he added.Rakesh Sheoran ,a parent from Dadri’s Badhra, said he has been sending his both kids to the school by taking all precaution measures.“My children were struggling with the online mode of learning and they started improving after the government ordered reopening of schools from November 2. We can’t allow our kids to sit at home and waste their one crucial academic year. The parents must ensure their ward reaches school while following all safety guidelines,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-department-starts-sampling-in-jhajjar-rewari-jind-schools/story-fI2jJsMeDrAApGX1p8wpON.html
20-11-2020||City||Need to reconsider decision to resume regular classes: Khattar||Surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in Haryana has left the schoolchildren and their parents worried as the government has already granted permission to resume regular classes.Since more than 150 students have tested positive in the state within two weeks, parents are reluctant to send their wards to the schools. When asked about students contracting the infection, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during his visit to Karnal on Thursday said, “Schools were reopened after seven months as several people were in favour of this decision. But, it is worrisome that some students got infected. Now, we think that there is a need to reconsider the decision.”Haryana education department also held a videoconference with ground-level officers and school principals to assess the situation before issuing further guidelines.Parvesh Rani, a resident of Karnal and mother of a Class 10 student, has asked the government to let the kids continue with the online classes. “Since students are catching the infection, it is risky to send them to school. The government should keep the schools closed for next one or two more months,” she added.Another parent, Shailesh Kumar of Kurukshetra, said, “This is not the right time to reopen schools. We have to wait more as the number of cases is on the rise again. It is also difficult for the teachers to convince students to follow the guidelines.”Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said schools have been directed to strictly follow the Covid-19 guidelines issued by the government. “It is not mandatory for all students to go to schools as they have been given the choice to attend the classes with the written consent of their parents.” Khattar lays foundation stone of BJP office in KarnalOn Thursday, Khattar, who was accompanied by Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia, also laid the foundation stone of BJP’s office in Karnal. He said the party office will help in improving the working of local workers.He said that district-level party offices will be opened in all 22 districts of the state, seven of which have already been opened, while the construction of nine offices is going on.Earlier, in an interaction with mediapersons, the CM said that the state government was committed to increasing the strength of MBBS doctors in the state, which has around 14,000 doctors (including private) against the requirement of 27,000.To a question about the MBBS fee hike, he replied that the government wanted to ensure that doctors, after completing the MBBS, could work in the state and cooperate with the government to improve health services.Nod to proposal to extend special paroleMeanwhile, Khattar has approved a proposal to extend the duration of special parole or interim bail granted to 4,585 prisoners till December 31 in view of the prevalent Covid-19 situation. These include 1,459 undertrials and 3,126 convicts. An official spokesperson said that the CM acted on the recommendation of the high-powered committee headed by Justice Daya Chaudhary of Punjab and Haryana high court. Justice Chaudhary, who is the executive chairperson of Haryana State Legal Services Authority, in a November 12 meeting had approved a proposal in this regard. However, authorities will be free to cancel the special parole or interim bail as the case may be, in case any complaint regarding misuse of special parole or interim bail is received against any convict or undertrial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/need-to-reconsider-decision-to-resume-regular-classes-khattar/story-DKcEKWXZF1Bt0qvmyPED2L.html
20-11-2020||City||RTI query reveals ₹11-crore discrepancy in stamp duty collection in Panipat district||A difference of ₹11.84 crore in stamp duty collection has been detected in the land registrations done in Panipat district tehsils in the past two financial years. As per the information provided by tehsildars of Panipat district under the Right to Information (RTI) Act to a local activist, Amit Rathi, a difference of ₹11.84 crore was found during the audit in the stamp duty deposited in all five tehsils of Panipat, Bapoli, Matlauda, Samalkha and Israna blocks for 557 land registrations done in 2018-2019 and 2019-2020.“As per the reply from the tehsildars concerned, the stamp duty was not charged as per the rate fixed by the government, causing a revenue loss of ₹11.84 crore to the state exchequer,” the RTI activist said. According to him, difference of ₹10.22 crore in the registration of 409 land deeds was reported in Panipat tehsil, ₹92.83 lakh in 24 land deeds in Matlauda, ₹22.55 lakh in 24 land deeds in Samalkha and ₹2.91 lakh in five land deeds in Israna tehsil. As per the activist, the information was provided by the tehsildars, but no action was taken yet, which he claimed hinted at a scam. “Even in the reply to the RTI query, all tehsildars have admitted that no action or inquiry has been ordered for the recovery of stamp duty so far,” he said, adding that he has filed a complaint at the CM Window for a detailed investigation and action against the erring officials for causing a revenue loss of around ₹12 crore to the state exchequer.Panipat tehsildar Kuldeep Malik said this was not a scam as claimed by the RTI activist. “The difference in the collection of stamp duty was highlighted by the auditor of the revenue department and the amount is based on their assumptions. This is a routine process as there are provisions of recovery of the stamp duty highlighted by the auditor and if required, the matter will be taken up in the collector’s court,” he addedDespite repeated attempts, Panipat deputy commissioner Dharmender Singh’s comment could not be elicited as he neither responded to phone calls nor text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rti-query-reveals-11-crore-discrepancy-in-stamp-duty-collection-in-panipat-district/story-NmAUSOQEA2eDiUFbFwWjvN.html
20-11-2020||Chandigarh||Dushyant hits back at Congress for doubting stability of coalition government in Haryana||A day after Congress MP Deepender Hooda said there were “cracks of mistrust” in the BJP-JJP coalition in Haryana, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Wednesday hit back at the Congress leaders for raising questions on the stability of the ruling BJP-JJP coalition government. Addressing mediapersons, Dushyant said the Congress leaders needed self introspection instead of being concerned about the stability of the coalition government. The JJP leader said there is a possibility that Congress president Sonia Gandhi will empower AICC general secretary Randeep Surjewala in Haryana and weaken former CM Bhupinder Hooda and his son Deepender. “So, the leaders who talk about mistrust among the alliance should look into their own affairs and introspect,” he said in a reference to remarks made by MP Deepender. ‘Registered a record in GST collection’Dushyant also said that despite Covid-19 situations, the state government has registered a record in goods and services tax (GST) revenue collection. Dushyant, who also hold the portfolio of excise and taxation, said the GST collection in April 2019 was ₹1,499 crore whereas only ₹237 crore was received in April 2020. The GST collection was ₹1,501 crore in May 2019 and ₹891 crore this year. He claimed that after the department’s officers encouraged taxpayers and simplified the process of tax refunds, the GST collection started increasing. As compared to ₹1,563 collected in September 2019, the GST collection in September 2020 was ₹1,583 crore. A total of ₹1,543 crore was collected in October last year, while ₹2,563 crore was collected in October this year, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dushyant-hits-back-at-congress-for-doubting-stability-of-coalition-government-in-haryana/story-LKgNvn3rlMUx4NCFmFAh0J.html

Only one person can accompany women performing the puja in the artificial lake premise. Barricades will be installed to maintain social-distancing while antigen testing vans will be stationed to check those with symptoms. The north Indian community has agreed to adhere to these rules and tone down the festivities this year.The arrangements for the puja are set up at seven artificial lakes in the city while an additional lake at Upvan is also set up.The state has given certain guidelines for the puja on Wednesday, which the corporation has ensured will be followed.Vipin Sharma, TMC commissioner, said, “We suggest devotees maintain social-distancing and not wait at the lakes for long; children and senior citizens have been advised to stay at home. Everyone should mandatorily wear masks and if possible celebrate within the confines of their homes.” On November 20, prayers and offerings will be made on the occasion of Chhath puja to any water body that faces the rising sun. Women observe a three-day fast and present offerings to the rising and setting sun near the lakes within the city.Manisha Pradhan, Pollution Control Officer, TMC, said, “To prevent overcrowding, we have made provisions for volunteers and officials to manage the crowd. It is the womenfolk who conduct the rituals, but they are accompanied by the entire family every year. This year we are restricting entry and only one person will be allowed with those conducting the rituals. Moreover, they will have to move quickly and make provisions for others as well.”TMC has made arrangements for antigen testing vans at various spots, those with symptoms will be tested then and there.

20-11-2020||Mumbai||New schemes for Maharashtra farmers, no relief from inflated power bills for residents||In a bid to recover arrears from farmers for electricity bills of agricultural pumps amounting to ₹41,000 crore, the Maharashtra government declared an amnesty scheme on Thursday. It has decided to waive off interest, penalty and rebate on payment of pending power bills. It has also declared a new policy under which a target of providing two lakh new connections in two years and at least eight-hour power supply during the day to all farmers in the next three years has been set. The government has decided to spend around ₹1,500 crore annually till 2024 to implement the policy.However, the state is yet to clear a proposal for providing relief from inflated power bills to residential consumers. In August, it had planned to bear the financial burden of the surplus amount from the inflated bills for three months of the lockdown period — April, May and June, but the scheme is yet to get an approval that will cost around ₹1,100 crore to the state exchequer.State energy minister Nitin Raut on Tuesday said that the government cannot provide any relief to consumers over-inflated bills as the state has a huge financial burden and it is not getting any aid from the Central government. This has led to sharp reactions, with opposition parties declaring to start agitations from Monday.The issue of arrears against electricity bills of agricultural pumps was discussed in the state cabinet meeting held on Thursday. The ministers were informed that the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) is yet to recover power bills from farmers for agricultural pumps since the past couple of years. The unrecovered amount has ballooned to around ₹41,000 crore, said a senior official privy to the development.“Every year, ₹5,000-₹6,000 crore gets added to the arrears as only 8% of farmers pay their power bills regularly. Now the amount of pending bills has increased so much that financially they can’t pay. Thus, the state government has decided to come up with the amnesty scheme,” said Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, state energy department.According to the scheme, penalty and interest on the actual amount of the bill pending prior to 2015 will be waived off. For bills pending since 2015, penalty will be waived off and the interest amount will be reduced to half. In addition, rebates of 100%, 30% and 20% will be given to those who pay their pending bills in the first year, second year and third year, respectively, since the declaration of the scheme.“The recovered amount will be divided into three parts. As much as 33% of the recovered amount will be reserved for the concerned gram panchayat to improve the infrastructure of the local power network. Another 33% will be reserved for the concerned district for the same purpose, and the rest of the money will be used to purchase power by the state,” Gupta said.The state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit has declared to start a statewide protest from Monday where they will be burning copies of power bills. “People had received inflated power bills during the lockdown period. The state government has declared to provide relief to the people and now the energy minister has taken a U-turn. The government has betrayed the people,” State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said on Thursday.MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande, on Thursday, hinted at taking the issue to the streets, stating that they have already tried to have a dialogue with the state government. “Applications, requests, meetings, it’s all done. But the state government is not listening,” Deshpande tweeted. On Wednesday, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena’s (MNS) Avinash Jadhav also said that the party will not tolerate if people are forced to pay bills.With inputs from Tanushree Venkatraman||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/new-schemes-for-maharashtra-farmers-no-relief-from-inflated-power-bills-for-residents/story-CMCWrU7WLCGlGNm4SmTmAJ.html
20-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro-4: Controversial land proposal tabled again by Thane civic body||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has again tabled the two-year-old proposal of allotting land at Kolshet for casting yard to the Metro Line 4 project (Wadala to Kasarvadavli) in the general body meeting to be held on Friday. The proposal was earlier stayed as several corporators had opposed it claiming that the corporation was losing crores of Rupees in revenue by allotting land free of cost to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).The TMC, on the other hand, maintained that as per government rule (GR), it was supposed to allot land on a temporary basis free of cost for Metro projects.BJP corporator Archana Manera has continued to oppose the project.The work of Metro Line 4 is in progress in Thane. The MMRDA has completed more than 55 per cent of the piling works, 30 per cent of pier work and 20 per cent of girder casting.A civic official said, “The MMRDA needs a plot as casting yard and labour camp among others. We have proposed to allot a 75,390 sqm plot to the MMRDA to be used on a temporary basis. The plot is given free of cost as the Metro project is beneficial to the city.”The civic body had allotted the plot to the MMRDA two years ago. However, it did not have the approval from the general body as a few corporators opposed it. The BJP is still against the proposal.Manera alleged, “The corporation had given the plot free of cost to the contractor two years ago. However, the corporation gets nothing in return. Had the plot been given at a ready reckoner rate, the corporation would have earned revenue worth ₹96Cr in two years.”She alleged that the administration allotted the plot without approval of the general body and are hands-in-glove with the contractor.The civic officials, however, claimed that the plot was given as per the state directives. The officer said, “As per the state’s GR, the local governing bodies are supposed to give a plot in their jurisdiction to the Metro project either free of cost or by imposing a basic fare on it. We have merely followed the GR.”The Metro authorities, on the other hand, claimed that there was no personal use on the plot. An officer from MMRDA requesting anonymity said, “We are paying the contractor only for the casting work he is doing at the plot. There is no rent paid nor is it used for personal gain.”BG Pawar, joint metropolitan commissioner of MMRDA, said, “We had demanded the plot from the corporation for the purpose of casting yard at Kolshet.

20-11-2020||Chandigarh||Non-BJP candidates not allowed to campaign freely: Gupkar alliance leaders||Leaders of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), an amalgam of Jammu and Kashmir’s mainstream parties demanding restoration of Article 370, have alleged that candidates of parties opposing the BJP were not being allowed to campaign freely for the upcoming district development council (DDC) on the pretext of security while the saffron party was being given a free hand. Omar Abdullah took to twitter to allege that the administration was going out of its way to help BJP candidates: “What sort of elections are being held in J&K where candidates are being stopped from campaigning? Is this the safe, terror free J&K the Home Minister was tweeting about yesterday?” he asked.“The J&K administration is going out of its way to help the BJP & it’s recently created king’s party by locking up candidates opposed to the BJP, using security as an excuse. If the security situation isn’t conducive to campaigning what was the need to announce elections? (sic)” he wrote.PAGD vice-chairperson Mehbooba Mufti also said that non-BJP candidates were being treated unfairly. “Non-BJP candidates are not being allowed to campaign freely and are being locked up on the pretence of security. But BJP and its proxies are given full bandobast to move around. Is this the democracy that the government of India said it was promoting while speaking to the US President elect?” Mufti asked.Security being provided according to threat perception: AdmnOfficials of the Jammu and Kashmir administration have refuted the allegations. “This is not the case. Security is being provided be according to threat perception. There is no disparity between the candidates of different parties,” said Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole, adding that candidates should approach him in case of any difficulty. Kashmir inspector general of police Vijay Kumar said they were putting candidates in secure areas as it was difficult to provide security individually.“We are providing collective security measures. Everyone is being put in secure areas and those who go out for campaigning are provided double escort besides securing the area for campaigning,” Kumar said. Multiple calls to J&K BJP spokesperson Altaf Thakur elicited no response. PAGD candidate and NC leader from Budgam’s Khag constituency Rayees Mattoo said, PAGD candidates from Beerwah and Khag are not being allowed to campaign, while our competitors are freely working in the field,”He said he was being detained at a hotel in Srinagar as the district administration allegedly did not have vehicles and security available. “…I don’t need protection, vehicle or anything else. Requesting them with folded hands let me be in the field and run the campaign,” he said.The allegations of the two former J&K chief ministers come after the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) and BJP leader and union home minister Amit Shah indulged in a verbal spat on Tuesday.Shah had termed the six-party bloc a ‘gang’,to which the PAGD had said the BJP was trying to delegitimise a coalition that was taking part in a democratic process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/non-bjp-candidates-not-allowed-to-campaign-freely-gupkar-alliance-leaders/story-5Jk5xbOH5Qz5aIJRa3Y3RP.html

20-11-2020||Mumbai||Marginal dip in noise levels witnessed in Mumbai this Diwali: Maharashtra Pollution Control Board||Noise levels on the day of Diwali (November 14) had dip marginally in the Mumbai as compared to the decibel levels recorded in the previous years of Diwali, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has said. However, the pollution control body also stated that the noise levels remained above the permissible limits on the festival, even as five locations in the city witnessed ‘poor’ air.MPCB released its Diwali noise and air monitoring report on Thursday.On Diwali, the average noise levels in Mumbai ranged between 59 and 71 decibels (dB). South Mumbai recorded average (6am to 10pm), which was higher than the safe limit of 65 dB. during the day. During the same period last year, the noise levels in MMR were 70.6dB. The western suburbs recorded 70.7dB this year against last year’s 65.8dB, while the noise levels in the eastern suburbs were at 71.1 dB, as compared to 69.4dB in 2019.At night (10pm to 6am), when the safe limit is 55dB, south Mumbai recorded 59dB on the day of Diwali. In 2019, during the same period, the noise level was 60.3dB at south Mumbai. Meanwhile, western suburbs recorded 59dB against the 62.3dB recorded in 2019. The eastern suburbs were the loudest at night, with the noise levels reaching 60.9dB, same as the decibel recorded last year. “There were fewer fireworks in Mumbai this year as compared to the previous years. The citizens has cooperated very well by refraining from bursting crackers and that has helped in curbing the noise and air pollution this year,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB.The pollution control board had recorded noise levels across 10 locations in Mumbai before, during, and after Diwali. Noise levels before Diwali (recorded on November 11) during the day and night were 71.3 dB and 59.8 dB in south Mumbai, 70.3 dB and 58.7 dB in western suburbs, and 71.1 dB and 60.3 dB in eastern suburbs, all of which were marginally louder than last year. Noise levels after Diwali (November 16) at day and night were 70.6 dB and 60.8 dB in south Mumbai, 72.5 dB and 64.1 dB in western suburbs, and 72.1 dB and 61.5 dB in eastern suburbs, all of which were louder (2-3 dB) as compared to last year.“This showed that ambient noise levels are already much higher than the safe limits in Mumbai, with human-induced sources such as traffic and construction, contributing to the decibel levels. While it indicates that the city celebrated a milder environmentally polluting Diwali, it also opens up avenues for reducing overall ambient noise in Mumbai,” said Srivastava.MPCB also monitored noise levels across 158 locations at all the 27 municipal corporations in the state before, during and after Diwali. Pimpri-Chinchwad recorded the highest noise pollution levels in Maharashtra on the day of Diwali at 77.1dB, followed by Akola at 76.9dB in the day. At night, Nashik was the loudest location on Diwali day at 71 dB, followed by Nagpur at 66.9dB.Meanwhile, an air quality analysis on the second day of Diwali (November 15) has revealed that the city’s overall air quality index (AQI) was in the ‘moderate’ category, and seven of the 15 locations (Colaba, Kalyan, Kurla, Vasai, Vile Parle, Worli, and Nerul) in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region where the air quality index (AQI) was recorded on Saturday recorded poor AQI (201-300). Borivli and Powai had the cleanest air on Diwali with ‘satisfactory’ AQI (51-100). The other locations (international airport, Bandra, Kandivli, Sion and Mahape) recorded ‘moderate’ (101-200) AQI. SC Kollur, chief scientist, MPCB, said, “Apart from the reduced use of firecrackers, a rise in the wind speed and increase in temperature helped keep the AQI in the moderate category throughout Diwali period.”Day temperature drops in Mumbai, AQI continues to be in ‘moderate’ categoryThe maximum temperature in Mumbai fell below the normal mark on Thursday. It was 32.4 degrees Celsius, a degree Celsius below normal, at Colaba, and 33.3 degrees Celsius, 0.4 degree Celsius below normal, at Santacruz.

20-11-2020||Chandigarh||Panchkula cow shelter deaths: Hydrogen cyanide found in fodder||High hydrogen cyanide (HCN) concentration in fodder supplied to two cowsheds at the Mata Mansa Devi Gaudham in Panchkula district of Haryana could have killed 71 heads of cattle on October 27, it has been learnt.The trust has been issued a notice and asked to give an explanation.A report on the deaths was submitted on Thursday by an investigation team set up by deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja. It comprised the chief executive officer of the district rural development agency Nishu Singhal, assistant commissioner of police Raj Kumar and animal husbandry department deputy director Dr Anil Kumar.Though the DC did not respond to the calls despite repeated attempts, Haryana Vidhan Sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta said he had learnt from Ahuja that the probe team found high concentrations of HCN in the green fodder served to the cattle, which led to the deaths.Apart from the notice sent to the Gaudham Gaushala Trust, the administration had also written to the Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Board which had given the cowshed to the trust, inquiring about the terms and conditions under which this had been done, Gupta added.“Green fodder like sorghum, bajra and maize store HCN during the growing stage as part of a self-defence mechanism from animals,” explained Dr Anil Kumar. HCN concentrations could have increased during the summer due to lack of water. Cattle consuming it can die, he added.Traditionally, farmers used to dry the crop to be fed to the animals, which was cut in the growing stage as HCN is volatile and at 25 degree it evaporates. However due to commercialisation it was cut at the growing stage and not dried or mixed with dry fodder, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/p-kula-gaudham-cattle-deaths-hydrogen-cyanide-found-in-fodder/story-QYysFP7cgz2hHPNeHvznsK.html

The railways finally repaired the ₹28Cr subway, stopping the flooding of creek water. The railways, however, denied the water logging was due to faulty design or insufficient pumping capacity.The subway was opened for commuters on November 9. On Wednesday, the commuters had to encounter chaos as the water level was above one foot.Haresh Keni, local corporator, said, “The railways have, at present, installed a 22.5hp capacity pump to drain water. However, taking into account the water accumulating in the subway, at least a 100hp capacity pump is required. I have informed the railway authorities about the problem and asked for immediate action.”The subway has been constructed as Taloja residents have had to spend hours in traffic jams caused by the railway crossing in the area.When contacted, chief public relations officer of central railway, Shivaji Sutar, said, “The subway is located much below the ground level. There are proper drainage arrangements in place with pumps installed at the lower and also upper level to pick up water and remove it through the drainage. Since the upper level pump had shut down on Wednesday, water had seeped in for a few hours and accumulated. The pump at the location has been repaired and the water is drained. This was a temporary issue and has been sorted out. There is no fault with the subway design or capacity of the pump.”He said pumps with additional capacity will be installed during monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/waterlogging-at-taloja-subway-in-navi-mumbai-within-days-of-opening-for-commuters/story-WCEeezG7mBQwPtbiJ4dcYI.html

Dedicated to Lord Surya and Chhathi Maiya, Chhath Puja is an important festival for the natives of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Speaking about this, treasurer of the Purvanchal Sabha, Arvind Singh, said, “As per tradition, most people were fasting on Thursday after the festival began on Wednesday evening and performed puja at their homes. People are expected to come to the lake from Friday afternoon onwards. Those who are fasting will stay there till Saturday morning.”This year, the administration and the Purvanchal bodies had decided that only those fasting will be allowed to enter the lake premises. Besides, only tea will be served to the devotees and wearing masks will be mandatory. Some people expressed concern that some private labs had set up Covid testing booths in the parking of the lake.Former general secretary of the Purvanchal Association, Prabhunath Shahi, said he had gone to the Sector-42 lake to offer prayers on Wednesday, but he will be performing the rest of the puja from home. “It is important that people stay home as a rise in Covid cases is being witnessed in the city.

20-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra hikes toll tax for commercial vehicles only||The state cabinet on Thursday decided to continue the toll waiver for small vehicles, school buses and state transport (ST) buses, but hiked the toll tax for commercial vehicles on 15 state highway projects. The move is expected to reduce the burden on the state — the public works department (PWD) shells out nearly ₹400 crore annually to compensate for the waiver.The state PWD has now increased the category of vehicles from the earlier four to five, by separating three-axle vehicles and multi-axle (truck-trailer) vehicles as two different categories, where the latter will pay the highest toll tax.According to the proposed hike for the Sion-Panvel Highway, the increase in toll tax is from ₹75 to ₹85 (13.33% ) for minibus and tempos, ₹160 to ₹175 (9.75%) for buses and trucks, ₹250 to ₹275 (10%) for three-axle vehicles, and ₹340 to ₹420 (23.52% increase) for multi-axle vehicles.Similarly, the hike has been passed on various highways under PWD in the state.PWD officials said that the move was to reduce the burden of the state. “Instead of giving this compensation in cash to the toll operator, the government decided to increase the toll tax for heavy vehicles,” an official said. With the hike in toll tax for different categories, the concession period on each of the project has decreased.At present, these vehicles are exempted from paying on 15 PWD roads where private contractors collect toll tax. Because of the exemption, the government has to pay ₹350crore-₹400 crore as compensation to these contractors every year, a statement from the state government said. The statement added that the hike is lower than what National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) levies on its roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-hikes-toll-tax-for-commercial-vehicles-only/story-ruOn33KHYwU4LQoL6MMtWL.html

The work on survey of these first six URPs that include Kopri, Rabodi, Lokmanya Nagar, Kisan Nagar, Tekadi Bungalow and Hajuri is in the final stages. The work of cluster development was also inaugurated in Hajuri and Kisan Nagar areas. However, it was halted during the pandemic situation.An officer from town planning said, “We have almost finalised the list of beneficiaries in all these clusters while a proposal to implement the second lot of six clusters is also tabled. We had called for suggestions/ objections on all the 44 clusters and received 17,770 replies.“Out of these, there were no suggestions/ objections for Anand Nagar cluster, one from Gokul Nagar, 355 from Mahagiri, 27 from Charai, 17 from Siddheshwar and 37 from Station area. We have given a hearing to most relevant of these suggestions/ objections in the first two weeks of October.”More than 70 per cent tenants of legal buildings in Mahagiri have not given their consent. The area is still included in the scheme as of now. However, it can be removed at a later stage. With opposition from gaonthans and koliwadas to the cluster scheme, the corporation had excluded these areas from its URPs last year.The officer added, “However, in the six clusters, no area is clearly demarcated as gaonthan, especially in Charai, Station area and Mahagiri as per the developmental plan of the city. It is true that some of the areas here are congested and comprise old community settlements. It will be beneficial to these residents to get redeveloped in the cluster scheme. However, with opposition from most residents in Mahagiri, the decision to include or exclude these settlements will have to be taken after detailed discussions.”The corporation has tabled the proposal for approval of these six new clusters while including these clarifications, suggestions and objections before the general body.The gaonthans, however, claimed that the scheme can be properly implemented only after a demarcation of their areas is made. A member of the Thane Gaonthan Koliwada Conservation Committee, who did not wish to be named, said, “The government had asked the corporation to create a separate development plan for the gaonthans and koliwadas before the elections last year. However, the corporation, though, is claiming the areas are excluded, most of the congested areas that are not demarcated as gaonthans are included in the scheme. We have approached the collector and the state government for proper demarcation of all the gaonthans in Thane and a separate development plan for them.”Additional posts generated to boost projectThe TMC has also created new posts for two town planning officers and four assistant town planning officers. The additional posts were approved by the state government and the corporation will now seek approval from the general body. These new posts will fasten the process of formulating a new developmental plan for the city and also the implementation of the cluster development scheme.ABOUT THE FIRST SIX CLUSTERSThe TMC has prepared 44 Urban Renewal Plans for Cluster Development Scheme for the entire Thane city. The scheme will be implemented on 1,489 hectares of land. In the first phase, six clusters – Kopri, Rabodi, Tekadi Bungalow, Hajuri, Kisan Nagar and Lokmanya Nagar – are to be developed in an area of 316.63 hectares. Of these 93.15 hectares will be reserved plots and roads. The work of biometric survey of beneficiaries in these clusters is in the final stages.CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT SCHEME IN A NUTSHELL11: Total sectors44: Total URPs13.8 lakh: Total Population residing in these URPs1,509 hectares: Total area developed under clusters 23%: Total area developed under cluster123.36 hectares: Area under CRZ20.58 hectares: Area under forest18 lakh: Population of the city in 201132 lakh: Projected population in 2041URPs to be developed in the first phase: Kopri, Rabodi, Lokmanya Nagar, Kisan Nagar, Tekadi Bungalow and Hajuri URPs to be developed in the second phase: Azadnagar, Thane Station area, Charai, Mahagiri, Siddheshwar and Gokul Nagar CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT SCHEMEAs per the TMC survey, around 58 per cent of the city’s population is unable to find affordable and quality housing in a well-deserved neighbourhood. Eight per cent people cannot even afford housing due to their weak financial situation. Ghodbunder is the only area in the city where the demand for homes is in par with the supply. Cluster plans to increase housing stock in the city areas. The Cluster Development Scheme will create 1.25 lakh homes in Thane benefiting more than 13 lakh people. Cluster scheme also plans to attract around eight lakh migrants to the city, bringing in investment of ₹5,000Cr to ₹10,000Cr to the city. Around 51 per cent job opportunities in the total MMR region will be created in Thane. Each URP is planned, balancing both housing and employment opportunities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/six-approved-thane-civic-body-now-plans-6-more-clusters/story-qImACPfZrU8OHs1cWIaExM.html

20-11-2020||Chandigarh||Our lives were shattered in the blink of an eye, say Balkote shelling victims||In the courtyard of a two-storey stone and mud house perched on a hill overlooking the Pakistani posts hidden within pine and deodar thickets, the five children of Faruqa Begum, who was one of the civilians killed in the November 13 Pakistani shelling, look scared. In the blink of an eye, the young siblings lost their 40-year-old mother when a shell fired from across the Line of Control (LoC) directly hit their house. The children and their father had a narrow escape. Faruqa, who was on the first floor, when the shell hit their home was not so lucky and died instantly from shrapnel injury. Four civilians and five security force personnel were killed in the shelling, which started in Hajpeer and continued through Kamalkote, Nowgam, Tanghdar and Gurez sectors. All four civilians were killed in Uri.“We were on the ground floor and our parents where on the top floor when a shell hit the backside of our house. My mother was hit by shrapnel while my father who was nearby had a narrow escape,” says 17-year-old Shaista Bano, as she sooths her 18-month-old sister Aliaza, who doesn’t quite understand what happened to her mother.Her brother, Irshad Ahmad, a Class-8 student, was taking an exam at school when the shelling started around noon. “Many shells landed in the forest around the village but we went ahead with our exam. When a few shells landed near our school we took shelter. We hurried home at around 5pm when there was a lull in firing. I was surprised to find relatives and neighbours weeping and a portion of our house destroyed. Everything had been well when I left for school but my mother was dead by the time I returned.” Faruqa was buried, with few people in attendence, late at night. The shelling did not stop for a long time and people were afraid to step out, explains her nephew 22-year-old Naseer Ahmad, adding that the only time the village felt at ease was between 2003 and 2015 when India and Pakistan were obeying ceasefire rules. “Now, there is shelling and firing every month. During shelling, zero-line villages turn into a battlefield. We keep praying for peace,” he said. Balkote village falls right on the zero line, the houses of the Khawjabandi village on the other side of the fence are visible from the middle of the village. ‘My life’s work went up in flames’ On the same fateful day, two houses belonging to government employee Abdul Gani Shiekh were damaged after shells hit the houses setting them aflame.“I had built two houses after working in the government for three decades and on November 13 I lost everything. We don’t even have plates to eat in,” he says, showing a heaps of ash that were once all his belongings.  “My wife had saved around ₹50,000 to ₹60,000 and kept it in the corner of the house. However, it too, has turned to ash. Shells have landed in our village earlier too but the houses had always remained safe. Thankfully, our family of seven, escaped unscathed. The neighbours rescued them,” says Shiekh, who was at the office where is works on a Class-4 post. He only saw the devastation when he reached home. Only 17 families remain in the neighbouring Silikote village, which is right on the LoC. Most families have vacated the area. “Our village used to see death and destruction before ceasefire. Now, it has again become the target. Only people who have nowhere else to go have stay put, the rest of the people have left,” says Sajjad Ahmad, a resident of Silikote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/our-lives-were-shattered-in-the-blink-of-an-eye-say-balkote-shelling-victims/story-n4gpfetZO14owSnUOBLFYI.html

The number of cops on field duty were also increased, and the traffic circulation plans of the markets were uploaded online for the convenience of the people.”Mandatory refresher course for traffic violatorsThe traffic police have also started a mandatory refresher course for traffic violators to ensure that they get updated about the traffic rules and violations of the city. Sharing details, Meena said, “This is for those who have their licence suspended in non-compoundable offences including overspeeding, talking on the phone while driving and jumping a red light.

20-11-2020||Mumbai||Infections on the rise? Maharashtra sees 5,535 Covid-19 cases and 154 deaths||After reporting a daily average of 4,359 Covid-19 cases and 129 deaths in the first 17 days of this month, infections in the state have started rising as anticipated by experts and authorities.The past two days saw more than 5,000 cases each, after a gap of nine days, and over 100 deaths per day. With the addition of 5,535 cases and 154 deaths on Thursday, Maharashtra’s case tally was pushed up to 1,763,055 and toll to 46,356.Mumbai clocked 924 new infections and 12 more deaths in 24 hours, taking the tally to 272,455 and toll to 10,627. Mumbai’s daily caseload average between November 1 and 17 was 774.With a daily average of 52,511 tests in November, the state is inching towards completing 10 million Covid-19 tests, with the count standing at 9,965,119 tests on Thursday.The surge in cases has been registered across the state, but it’s more in cities where crowding at public places has increased. Cities like Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nashik and Nagpur have witnessed a surge in cases over the past two days. Pune clocked 789 cases, followed by 369 in Nagpur, 334 in Nashik district and 272 in Thane district.Of the 154 deaths reported on Thursday, 60 occurred in the past two days, 39 over the past week, while the remaining 55 were from the period before it, as stated by the state health department. Maharashtra’s case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 2.63%.According to officials from the health department, cases are expected to increase in the areas with low temperature and high density of population. “High variations in temperature, crowding at public places and complacency leading to not adopting Covid-19 appropriate behaviour are the reasons that have resulted in rise in the cases. The district administrations have been directed to gear up for the surge, which could see more active patients than reported in the third week of September. We had 3.02 lakh active patients on September 17. The second wave could see the number reaching4 lakh active patients,” the officer said.He also added that experts and members of the state-appointed task-force were divided over the time of the second wave. “A section of the task force feels that the second wave will be between December 25 and January 26, while another group of members feel that it could be between mid-December and January-end. They also have projected a gradual rise in cases immediately after Diwali,” he added.Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, civic surgeon, Pune district, said, “Besides augmenting health infrastructure, we have been implementing awareness programmes among people to ensure that they adopt Covid-appropriate behaviours. We have been emphasising on early detection of the infection and timely treatment to avoid fatalities. The health machinery is in a better position than in the initial stage of the outbreak as we have been now trained and have better clarity on the protocols to be followed for tracing, testing and treating patients,” he said.There are 79,738 active patients in the state after 5,860 discharges in the past 24 hours. The recovery rate of the state stands at 92.79% as the tally of recovered patients touched 163,5971. Currently, 560,868 people are in home quarantine, while 4,284 are institutionally quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/infections-on-the-rise-maharashtra-sees-5-535-covid-19-cases-and-154-deaths/story-NvcsUXcovL0qCd4pAxBi7K.html
20-11-2020||Chandigarh||Finally, Chandigarh MC shortlists firm to manage legacy waste at Dadumajra plant||After failing in its previous attempts to award the legacy waste mining project, the municipal corporation (MC) has said it has finally shortlisted a firm.In the latest tender floated for the project, three bids were received, of which two qualified after technical bids were opened. Of these two, one Kher Constructions submitted the lowest bid at ₹0.3 per kilogram.Approval for allocating the project to the shortlisted firm will be presented before the Finance and Contract Committee of the MC on Friday.Even as it was refloating tenders for the project, the MC had started removing the legacy waste lying at the Sector-25 waste processing plant. So far, it has removed 6,700 metric tonne (MT) out of the total 25,000 MT legacy waste; an additional 1,000 MT will be removed by the MC. The rest, around 16,000 MT legacy waste, will now be lifted by the private firm at a cost of ₹48 lakh.Legacy wastes are the wastes that have been collected and kept for years at a site. A large amount of unprocessed solid waste, more than 25,000 MT, has collected at the site, resulting in odour and leachate, impacting the efficient functioning of the plant. The MC General House in its meeting held in July had given the go ahead for shifting of the waste.At present, there is five lakh MT of legacy waste at the Dadumajra dumping site. The waste is in the process of being removed as part of a ₹35-crore project.The MC had taken over the waste processing plant from the Jaypee Group on June 19 and has been running the plant since. The MC had signed an agreement with Jaypee in 2005 for setting up a garbage processing plant, but in February this year the MC general house ordered a takeover because it observed that the plant was not being operated to its optimum capacity.Requirements to be fulfilled by hired firmAs per the project terms, the hired firm will provide a minimum one poclain machine, one excavator-cum-loader, seven tippers and one chain dozer (for leveling the said waste) to dumping ground or any other designated place decided by the MC. It will also bear the cost of the driver, helper, fuel, etc.The work has to be completed within two months from the date of allotment of the contract. In case the work is not completed in the stipulated time, the performance security of the firm can be forfeited.Notably, the MC General House, in January this year, had considered and resolved that the garbage lying at the plant should be lifted by the MC using its own infrastructure and/or by hiring the required machinery, and that the floated e-tender should be cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/finally-chandigarh-mc-shortlists-firm-to-manage-legacy-waste-at-dadumajra-plant/story-iO95QyHqPB2U4tM7LPCgcP.html

20-11-2020||City||Second Covid-19 wave may spoil New Year celebrations in Mumbai||Although the number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai has witnessed a decline, health experts’ anticipation of a second wave is expected to dampen the New Year’s Eve celebrations on December 31. Officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) have said that a final decision on allowing the New Year celebrations at hotels, party halls and restaurants will be taken next month after a review. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “The situation is evolving and an appropriate decision regarding the New Year celebrations will be taken in the coming days.” According to the BMC officials, if there is a surge in the Covid-19 cases in December, there might be several restrictions over the celebrations. BMC officials have said that the state government will first issue guidelines for the December 31 celebrations, following which the civic body will also state its guidelines. BMC cannot take any decision independently as of now, officials said. “If we witness a second wave or a surge in the cases in December, we might limit the New Year celebrations. However, if the cases remain stable, celebrations might be allowed with certain restrictions,” a BMC official said. The state government and the BMC are anticipating a surge in the number of cases after Diwali. Fearing a second wave, the civic body had on Wednesday appealed to citizens to continue taking Covid-19 precautions. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “Looking at Delhi, I feel Mumbai might be at its peak [of Covid-19 outbreak] around Christmas and New Year. Hence, not just in Mumbai, but globally too, the Christmas and New Year celebrations for this year should be low key and in fact be held virtually.” Currently, as a part of the state government’s ‘Mission Begin Again’ initiative for unlocking the city, BMC has allowed restaurants and bars to operate at 50% capacity. There is also a limit of 50 people imposed for gatherings such as marriages. Two months before outbreak of Covid-19 in the city, BMC had approved the 24x7 nightlife plan for Mumbai, permitting establishments such as malls and eateries in non-residential areas to remain open throughout the night. However, after the pandemic broke out, the execution of the nightlife plan was suspended and establishments were directed to stop operations. Covid-19 case tally at 272,455 On Thursday, the city reported 924 Covid-19 cases, taking its tally to 272,455. The toll surged to 10,627 after 12 more deaths were recorded. The fatality rate in the city is 3.90%. The recovery rate stands at 91.52%, with 249,357 patients discharged after treatment. There are 11,694 active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai now. Dharavi, which was once a hot spot, recorded only three cases on Thursday, taking its tally to 3,629, of which 3,307 have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/second-covid-19-wave-may-spoil-new-year-celebrations-in-mumbai/story-jcRewBZjUvo3iNFoz2offI.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi Riots: Police opposes Ishrat Jahan’s bail plea, court reserves order||The Delhi police on Thursday opposed the bail application of former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan, who was booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in connection to her alleged role in the north east Delhi riots. In her plea, Jahan had stated that she was suffering from some minor psychological problems due to her isolation in wake of Covid-19 outbreak.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat reserved the order after hearing the submissions of Jahan’s counsel and Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad on behalf of the Delhi Police. Prasad strongly opposed the bail while contending that all of Jahan’s medical reports primarily related to minor spinal issues and it was not serious.He said that even if she is let out on interim bail on humanitarian grounds, it will have to be treated as an order short of regular bail as it gets extended from time to time due to the pandemic.The jail authorities also stated in their reply that Jahan was suffering from hypertension and was on anti-hypertensive medicines and her blood pressure was controlled. It further stated that nine inmates who had tested Covid-19 positive were admitted to the GTB Hospital and their medical condition was stable.Jail authorities said Jahan has been tested twice for the virus but she was found negative. Jahan, who is currently lodged in the Mandoli jail, contended through senior advocate Ramesh Gupta that she was suffering from some minor psychological problems due to her isolation in wake of Covid-19 outbreak. Gupta told the court that Jahan had also suffered injuries in her back due to slipping on the floor in Mandoli prison where she is lodged.Gupta further said some of the inmates in Mandoli prison have been found Covid-19 positive and have been kept in isolation.“She (Jahan) is a practising advocate and doesn’t have any criminal antecedents. Earlier she was granted bail for 10 days for her marriage and she did not misuse it. The court can grant interim bail to her in the current circumstances and she will not misuse the relief,” the senior counsel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/riots-police-opposes-ishrat-jahan-s-bail-plea-court-reserves-order/story-uJfcmreUny1Q0EUhx25RwL.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Crematoriums feel the pressure as Covid death toll mounts||A day after Delhi reported its highest single-day Covid-19 death toll of 131, crematoriums in the national capital are struggling to cope with the increased fatalities. In light of the high toll, the Delhi high court, too, had asked the government to indicate steps that it has taken to manage crematoriums and graveyards in the national capital.According to authorities at crematoriums, families are having to wait longer at Nigambodh Ghat and Punjabi Bagh facilities to conduct the last rites of their loved ones who succumbed to Covid-19. However, municipal authorities said they have an adequate number of covid-designated crematoriums and graveyards and sufficient facilities to conduct the last rites. According to the data from the three municipal bodies, there are 19 crematoriums and graveyards where Covid-19 bodies (of confirmed and suspected cases) are being cremated/buried. Of these, eight are run by North Delhi Municipal Corporation (north DMC), six by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and five by East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). Officials said these facilities can cumulatively dispose of nearly 140-150 bodies daily. Authorities assisting in the last rites of those dying of Covid-19 at Nigambodh Ghat said for the past fortnight, there has been a surge in bodies -- every day, about 100 to 110 bodies are being cremated there, of both Covid-19 related deaths and others.“More than 60% of them had died of Covid-19 (confirmed cases). Due to Covid death toll spike, the rush at Nigambodh Ghat has increased and people are having to wait longer -- at least five to six hours,” a functionary at the Nigambodh Ghat said, who wished not to be named, said.Also Read: Delhi hospitals treating Covid patients told to reserve more bedsHe said the crematorium has all arrangements in place to handle the increased numbers. He said other than three incinerators running on CNG, there are around 104 wood pyres of which 50% are reserved for Covid deaths.At the Punjabi Bagh crematorium, there are four CNG incinerators and around 30 to 35 wood pyres for Covid related deaths. Ashok Rawat, municipal health officer (MHO), north corporation, said during the pandemic, every crematorium and graveyard is assigned to certain hospitals and people have to take bodies to the designated cremation ground only. “But, for past one or two months, as Covid-related deaths were fewer, families from other neighbourhoods were also bringing bodies to Nigambodh Ghat and Punjabi Bagh crematoriums. Ideally, Nigambodh Ghat should accept Covid bodies from seven hospitals in north Delhi, including LN Hospital, GB Pant and Hindu Rao, but, lately, people from east and central Delhi have also been cremating bodies at Nigambodh Ghat,” he said. “Now that the number of Covid deaths has increased,there is a rush at Nigambodh Ghat and Punjabi Bagh crematoriums. We will now examine it and ensure that guidelines are being followed,” Rawat said. As per data from the SDMC, between November 1 and 18, as many as 883 Covid-19 confirmed dead bodies have been cremated while this figure was 720 in October. Between June 1 and October 31 as many as 3,697 Covid-19 confirmed dead bodies were handled by SDMC crematoriums and graveyards. The other two municipalities were yet to compile this data. Anamika Mithilesh, mayor, SDMC, said the number of cremations has increased in November. “We have sufficient space to increase the capacity, if the situation arises. If required, we will further increase the number of wood pyres,” she said.Also Read| Keep aside politics, fight Covid-19 together: Kejriwal at all-party meetingBurials rise, but no pressureThe New Cemetery for Muslims at Delhi Gate is also under stress and may have no space left for burials soon, a member of the graveyard’s management committee said requesting anonymity.The graveyard, near Daryaganj, which has been functional since 1924, had been receiving 10-12 bodies of Covid-19 bodies daily since June and then there was a lull. The count again started increasing about 10 days ago. Since April 1, nearly 300 bodies have been buried by following Covid-19 protocol at the graveyard. There is space for 100-150 more burials at the cemetery spread over nearly 50 acres, the committee member said. A Delhi Waqf Board official said burials following Covid-19 protocol are also being conducted at other graveyards in Mongolpuri, Dwarka, Khadar and Ghazipur.A functionary at Feroz Shah Kotla burial ground, which is managed by the SDMC, said the number of dead bodies has increased in the past 10 days. “The burials are being conducted without any hassle. We have all arrangements in place and there is no rush as such at the facility at present,” he said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/crematoriums-feel-the-pressure-as-covid-death-toll-mounts/story-IEi4LWPw5qUoBLmDeohlEM.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Cap on wedding guests should have been put sooner: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday said the Delhi government should have capped the number of people allowed to attend weddings and other related functions sooner while observing that the capital was reeling under the massive surge in cases of the coronavirus disease in the last fortnight. A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said that both the Delhi government and the Centre must put their heads together to tackle the situation. “Why did you wait for a court’s direction to reduce the number of people? The city is reeling and you allowed the transport in full capacity. Tell us the rational object behind this decision. Why didn’t you wake up even after the situation worsened since November 1?” the bench said.The court remarked that the Delhi government had anticipated the situation and still chose to open all the activities. “You had very well anticipated the situation because you had passed the September 12 order (reserving 80% ICU beds in the city). The cold wave along with the pollution during the winter months is a cocktail of death for the citizens, especially those who have breathing issues,” the court said.Also Read| Penalty for not wearing mask to be hiked from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000: KejriwalReferring to the rising toll due to Covid-19 --- 131 people died of the infection on Wednesday, the high court bench asked why was the Delhi government waiting for the Centre and L-G for directions before taking measures to arrest the spike in cases. “You were shaken out of slumber. Do you know about the number of lives that has been lost in the last 18 days? Yesterday there were 131 deaths in a single day and the government is claiming that you were alive to the situation. The ground is full of dead bodies. Why were you have to look at the Centre and the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) for directions,” the bench said.The court was hearing a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking directions to the Delhi government to ramp up the number of tests in the city.On Thursday, senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that they have reduced the number of wedding attendees. He said that people are being fined for not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing norms. He also submitted that the decision to shut down a few markets is pending with the Centre.During the day, the Delhi government said the fine for not wearing mask in public places will be increased from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000. The L-G has approved the order. However, the court said that even fining people is not acting as a deterrent and people who have not stepped outside of their houses due to the fear of the infection have also contracted the virus. The court said that there should be a strong deterrent.“Considering that Delhi has a population of over two crores, it appears that the number of Enforcement vehicles and the Enforcement teams are insufficient,” the court said.Also Read: Delhi hospitals treating Covid patients told to reserve more bedsDuring the proceedings, the government also informed the court that they have collected Rs 11.8 crore between September 7 to November 16 in fines from people who were found violating the norms that make it mandatory for everyone to wear the mask and maintain physical distance and not spit in public places. As many as five persons were also arrested during this period, the government said.Justice Kohli asked the Delhi government to indicate the steps they are taking to ensure that there are adequate facilities for victims of Covid-19 at the ghats and crematoriums.“….Considering the steep rise in the death rates in the last 14 days, the Delhi government is directed to indicate the steps it has taken for adequate arrangements for those who have lost their lives to Covid-19,” the court said in its oral order.The court also said that the Delhi government should be cognizant of the fact that rapid antigen tests are no longer helping because of the large number of asymptomatic persons, while adding that more RT-PCR tests should be conducted for better results. The judge also noted that only about 50% RT-PCR tests have been conducted as against over two lakh rapid antigen tests between November 9 and November 17. The court noted in its order that the Delhi government is not conducting the fifth sero-survelliance stating that the third wave of Covid-19 is still in progress, even though the government told the press that the third wave has already peaked in the city. “The stand taken is that the third wave has already peaked in Delhi and cases of Covid-19 infection are gradually going down, though the same is not borne out from the daily reported cases of the infection,” the court said.Also Read| Keep aside politics, fight Covid-19 together: Kejriwal at all-party meetingWhen additional standing counsel of the Delhi government Satyakam objected and urged the court not to take not of anything that has been published in the press, the court said, “Why would not we take this? We can take judicial note of the statements made by your ministers in the court. If you retract from whatever you have said in the media, I would remove it.”The court also asked the Delhi government to indicate the steps taken by them to create facilities of care homes to shift those who live in small and confined spaces and do not have adequate space to self-isolate and “necessarily need a care home instead of hospitalisation to overcome the infection”.The court also asked the Delhi government to properly publicise its order of September 12, reserving 80% ICU beds in 33 private hospitals in the city both in print and electronic media.During the hearing, Satyakam told the court that the government would be adding 663 ICU beds (both ventilator and non-ventilator) to the current 1,167 ICU beds in government hospitals. He also told the court that about 750 ICU beds are being added after assistance from the Centre, and a decision to shut down a few busy markets is yet to be taken pending confirmation from the Union government.The court directed that the ICU beds in the government hospitals should be made functional within the next week.Reacting to court’s observations, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the government will strictly adhere to all orders and suggestions of the high court. The bench also stated that the Delhi government should have roped in the readily available network of Residents Welfare Associations and the market associations in containing the infection in their respective localities/market places.“We hope and expect that Delhi Government will examine the said suggestion and come up with a concrete plan in the next status report,” the court said.The matter will be now heard on November 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cap-on-wedding-guests-should-have-been-put-sooner-hc/story-xXhRG4L8tHbrNjI0n0W4gM.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Seven inmates at Mandoli women’s prison test positive for Covid-19||There were fears of a major Covid-19 outbreak at the women’s prison at Delhi’s Mandoli jail last week, after seven inmates tested positive for Covid-19 and were admitted to the GTB hospital, but the authorities acted quickly and sanitised the entire prison complex to prevent a further spread. While six of them have been discharged and are currently in isolation at the prison, the seventh person is still undergoing treatment. Prison officers said none of the seven was a new entrant and they suspect that the infection may have spread from an asymptomatic jail officer.HT spoke to several jail officers who said following the scare, many prisoners were apprehensive that the virus may have entered the prison through the winter clothes brought by relatives. Jail officers, however, said they are yet to confirm any such link. The relatives have been bringing in winter clothes as the temperature has been dipping steadily -- the city recorded a minimum temperature of 9.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday morning. As per rules, a prisoner is allowed an extra set of clothes, apart from the one (s)he is wearing at the time of entering the prison. With visits of outsiders such as NGOs and lawyers mostly banned, except in special circumstances, and most court hearings happening over video conferencing, the extra pair of clothes is the only item from outside that prisoners currently have access to. Such restrictions were imposed in March to curb Covid-19 spread. Also Read| Covid-19: Delhi orders districts to double test centres as city adds 7,546 new casesSince the lockdown in March, the bi-weekly meetings between prisoners and their relatives were also cancelled and they resumed only on October 1. A jail officer said the 16 sub-jails at the three complexes of Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli have come up with a standard operating procedure for the handling the clothes. A mid-level prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “There was a Covid-19 scare inside jail number 16 of Mandoli prison. The prison headquarters has made it mandatory to wash all clothes before a prisoner uses them. All clothes brought by families are wrapped in plastic sheets and kept in a room. The clothes are collected by a prisoner wearing gloves and face mask, and they are soaked in water overnight, before being washed and dried.” In another sub-jail, winter clothes brought by relatives are sanitised within the jail complex by the prison’s in-house sanitiser, washed thoroughly and then handed out to prisoners.

They were admitted to the hospital as a precautionary measure and are stable. We have sanitised the complex. Clothes brought from outside are used only after they are washed. We are taking all the necessary precautions.” Till date, two elderly inmates have died of Covid in the three prisons. There are currently seven Covid-19 positive prisoners and 23 jail personnel. Till date, the jails have reported 386 Covid-19 cases among prisoners and jail staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/seven-inmates-at-mandoli-women-s-prison-covid-19-positive-jailers-start-sanitising-clothes-brought-by-relatives/story-fI2VaooMXjvkwHS0Smg9JN.html
20-11-2020||Education||More teachers put on Covid duty, schools worry about curriculum loss||With more Delhi government teachers and municipal school teachers being roped in for Covid-19 related survey work , several schools are apprehensive about the curriculum loss that the deployment may entail.In view of the rising cases of Covid-19 in the national capital, hundreds of teachers, along with other government employees, have been asked to undertake a door-to-door survey in hot spots and vulnerable areas, as well as assist with testing and contact tracing.For instance, in the south-west district, around 535 teachers have been deployed for the survey work. A total of 140 teachers have been on similar duties in the south district and as many as 1,000 teachers in the north-west district. The number includes primary teachers, trained graduate teachers (TGTs) and post graduate teachers (PGTs). While TGTs can teach up to class 10, PGTs are eligible to teach classes 11 and 12. According to the teachers’ associations of both Delhi government and municipal schools, as many as 15,000 teachers of government schools and around 13,000 teachers from municipal schools are presently involved in Covid-19 related duties.Also Read| Covid-19: Delhi orders districts to double test centres as city adds 7,546 new casesSchool officials said the deployment of more teachers will affect the continuity of online classes. A PGT at a government school in Dharampura, on condition of anonymity, said he will not be able to take online classes or correct assignments while on Covid-19 duty. “We are already lagging on the syllabus -- classes have already been disrupted by the pandemic. I have to call many students daily to make sure they see the links for the study material that we send. Many of my students don’t have smartphones and so we have to call them regularly to guide them. Who will do all these in my absence?” he said.An official at another school in the locality said they have only two TGTs for Hindi and one of them will now be engaged in the survey work. “There will only be one teacher for around 1,000 students in classes 6 to 10. How is it possible for one teacher to teach so many students?” the official said, requesting anonymity.With schools being shut since March and classes shifted online, government institutions -- where a majority of the students do not have access to smart devices and the internet -- are dependent on worksheets or study material for virtual learning.Similar concerns are being raised in schools run by the three civic bodies --east, north, and south. Naveen Sangwan, a teacher at Nigam Pratibha Vidyalaya in Mangolpuri, said there are 10 teachers in his school and nine are on survey duty. “This will certainly impact the classes. We don’t know yet what will be the survey timings and the area that we need to cover. So how can we reschedule online classes?” he said.Another primary teacher in Sultanpuri, who wished not to be named, said eight of 10 teachers in school are on survey duty. “The process of new admissions will also be affected. How is it possible for two teachers to handle the enrolment process of the entire school?” the teacher said.

Presently, we have to come together to fight this pandemic. Who will study if everyone in the city gets affected? Meanwhile, we will make some arrangements for students to avoid any academic loss.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/more-teachers-put-on-covid-duty-schools-worry-about-curriculum-loss/story-mPa3mtZcaA33UrNuow5n2M.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Penalty for not wearing mask to be hiked from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000: Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said that the penalty for not wearing masks at public places in Delhi will be increased from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 in the light of the severe spike in Covid-19 cases in the capital.“I met the L-G today and briefed him about the Covid-19 situation. We have observed that most people wear masks, but several do not adhere to the rule. It has been decided that the penalty for not wearing masks will be increased from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000. We have agreed that it should create an effective deterrent. I appeal to social, religious and political organisations to distribute masks and urge people to wear masks. Masks are a major saviour against Covid-19,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing.The Lieutenant governor’s office has approved the proposal. A government official said that a notification will be issued soon.Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal’s office said in a statement: “It was considered necessary to enhance the fine for not wearing face masks, from the existing Rs 500 to Rs 2000 with a view to penalise the violators in an exemplary way . The decision was taken as an extraordinary measure in the face of a sudden surge in the Covid-19 cases in Delhi during the last fortnight despite best efforts being put in by various field agencies on all fronts.”Also Read: Delhi records 7,546 fresh Covid-19 cases; 4,501 containment zones in cityDelhi, on Thursday, recorded 7,546 new Covid-19 cases and 98 more deaths, taking the toll to 8,041. With 62,437 tests conducted on Thursday, the positivity rate was recorded at 12.09%%, according to the government’s daily health bulletin. The police and the government’s revenue department are the two enforcement agencies which prosecute individuals for not wearing masks in public places.“We are awaiting the written order. As soon as we receive it, we will start issuing challans for R2,000 rather than R500,” said a senior Delhi Police officer, who did not want to be identified.So far, the police have penalised 498,984 individuals for not wearing marks and the revenue department has penalised 249,021 people, showed records maintained by the agencies.Other than not wearing masks, agencies can also impose a penalty of Rs 500 for spitting in public spaces and violation of social distance norms. The fine for the offences other than not wearing masks are not likely to be increased as of now, said a senior government official. Experts agreed on the importance of masks but offered mixed reaction to the decision on increasing penalty amount.Charoo Hans, former head of microbiology department in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, said: “There is currently no definite treatment approved for coronavirus infection and vaccines are still under study. Face masks -- along with other preventive measures -- when worn correctly and by a large percentage of the public can slow the transmission of the disease which is often due to droplets spread by patients who may even be asymptomatic. Hence, action for compliance of mask use is judicious for controlling the high infection rates”. Also Read: Don’t play politics over Chhath Puja: Kejriwal’s message to BJPDr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases department in Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the enhanced penalty will not be easy to enforce. “Masks are important in the fight against Covid-19 but such enforcements are easier said than done. For a large number of people, Rs 500 is a high amount too, but people are still violating the rule. The government should now focus on prevention from infections. They should rather create conditions which reduce human interactions in the first place -- such as staggered market timings and limiting passengers in public transport.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, however, criticised the government’s decision.BJP MLA and leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said: “It is a wrong move. A poor person will not be able to afford Rs 2,000 and several of them are yet to understand the importance of masks in the fight against Covid-19.”Delhi Congress chief Chaudhary Anil Kumar said: “The government should rather focus on awareness, ensuring social distance and free distribution of masks instead of focusing on making people pay in the garb of controlling a health emergency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/penalty-for-not-wearing-mask-to-be-hiked-from-rs-500-to-rs-2-000-kejriwal/story-JjTApu1SIVr1YtOsWCIR7L.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Keep aside politics, fight Covid-19 together: Kejriwal at all-party meeting||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday urged leaders across political lines to keep aside politics in the fight against Covid-19 and said the Delhi government is prohibiting Chhath Puja celebrations in public places this year considering the health risk it could entail in the light of the pandemic.Kejriwal, on Thursday, convened a meeting in the Delhi Secretariat with representatives of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress on the Covid-19 situation in the Capital. The discussions ranged from the shortage of ICU beds, air pollution adding to infections, Chhath celebrations and the government’s recent decisions to restrict the size of marriage-related gatherings to 50 individuals and seeking permission from the Centre to temporarily shut down markets that are likely to become Covid-19 hot spots. The BJP and the Congress urged the government to reconsider its decision to impose a cap on wedding attendees and give up on the proposal to impose restrictions in markets. The meeting, however, led to no specific decisions on any of the matters that were discussed, said senior leaders who attended it.Also Read: Delhi hospitals treating Covid patients told to reserve more bedsIn a video press briefing after the meeting, Kejriwal said, “All political parties have agreed to collectively serve the people of Delhi by leaving politics aside in this time of Covid-19 calamity.”After the meeting, all three parties said they will start an initiative from Friday in which volunteers will be deployed in crowded areas to ensure social distancing, participate in awareness campaigns and distribute free masks.Kejriwal said, “There have been arguments regarding Chhath Puja in the past few days. We want people to celebrate Chhath Puja in Delhi but this year there is a pandemic and there is an immense amount of health risk. Imagine, how much transmission can happen in the Chhath ghats where people take dips in common water bodies. Water can make the transmission worse. People will surely get infected. The prohibition this year is only in public places. Let’s celebrate Chhath Puja in our residences this year. Gujarat, Maharashtra and Haryana too have imposed such restrictions.”There was a lack of consensus, with the BJP and Congress representatives insisting the Delhi government should have allowed Chhath Puja at Yamuna ghats with certain safety measures and restrictions in place.Soon after the meeting, Kejriwal announced that the penalty for not wearing masks in public places would be increased from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000.Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “We told the CM and representatives of the AAP that shutting down markets would do no good. People will lose jobs and the crowd will only move to other markets and eventually, more of them will have to be shut one after another. The government should rather scale up screening and enforcement in the markets, ensure social distancing and distribute masks. We shall be engaging our volunteers from Friday. The government should also withdraw the restrictions related to weddings. People have already planned events and distributed invitations.”Also Read: Delhi records 7,546 fresh Covid-19 cases; 4,501 containment zones in cityBidhuri, who is a BJP MLA, said, “We have questioned the AAP government on why they failed to increase ICU beds when expert panels had long ago predicted the surge in cases after the festive season. We asked about measures taken to fight air pollution, which is making the Covid-19 crisis worse.”Delhi Congress chief Chaudhary Anil Kumar said, “We have stressed that the government should have scaled up tests and containment efforts long ago. We demanded that the decisions on a cap on marriage gatherings and temporarily shutting down markets be rolled back. We pointed out that the government should have allowed Chhath Puja in public places with certain safety protocols in place instead of imposing a prohibition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/keep-aside-politics-fight-covid-19-together-kejriwal-at-all-party-meeting/story-UieW6s9SyzqADM2dHYD6RM.html
20-11-2020||India||Punjab farm fires up by nearly 90% over daily average of past 5 years: Study||The number of crop stubble fires in neighbouring Punjab registered an increase of 89.7% this year when compared to the average daily fire counts over the past five years, according to an analysis of satellite data done by a team of scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi.Scientists at IIT-Delhi’s Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air (CERCA), who did the analysis, said the number of fire counts almost doubled this year in most districts of Punjab, which contributed majorly to the high PM 2.5 levels --- the most harmful aerosols in Delhi’s air in October-November.. In the case of Haryana, however, the fire counts reduced by 18% when compared to the average daily fire counts over the past five years.“This year, crop stubble burning started earlier than usual because of early harvest of some paddy varieties. Farm fires started from late September itself, which usually starts from the first week of October. The satellite data analysed from September 22 to November 18 of farm fires in Punjab shows there was an 89.7% increase in the number of fire counts, as compared to the average daily fire counts over the past five years,” said Sagnik Dey, associate professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences and coordinator, CERCA at IIT-Delhi. On any given day, Dey said, the number of daily fires was almost double the average daily count over the past five years. Between November 5 and 10, Delhi saw six consecutive days of ‘severe’ air. On November 5, the number of total fire counts in Punjab was 5,107, much higher than 3,191, the average fire count recorded on the same day during 2015-19. Similarly, on November 6 and 7 this year, the fire counts were 4,130 (against the average count of 3,043 in the past five years) and 5,076 (against the average count of 2,747).Also Read: AAP writes to air quality panel, points role of farm fires in Delhi’s pollution“The fire counts started showing a downward trend only after November 14. However, a slight increase was again noticed on November 17-18, the impact of which could also be seen in the current air quality,” said Dey. Krunesh Garg, member secretary, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), said the number of fire counts this year was higher, but data was still being collated to ascertain the reasons behind the rise.“In the analysis so far, the burnt area has not increased. Even though the area under paddy cultivation was less this year than last year, what could possibly be one of the factors behind the rise (of fires) is an increase in productivity. Data is being collated to substantiate it and it will take another 8-10 days for a complete analysis,” said Garg. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing, the contribution of farm fires to PM 2.5 levels in Delhi’s air had peaked to around 40% in October. It came down only after Diwali (November 14). The low fire counts combined with rain and good winds post-Diwali helped clean up Delhi’s air from ‘severe’ to ‘poor’ and even ‘moderate’ for a day.Delhi’s AQI has fluctuated between poor to severe and moderate in a matter of five days between November 13 and 17. From an AQI of 435 on November 15, which is in the severe zone, the air improved to poor (221) on November 16 and moderate (171) on Tuesday. However, it fell to poor again on Wednesday (211), as the contribution of stubble fires increased.On Thursday, the air quality deteriorated further to the higher end of the ‘poor’ zone. The average air quality index (AQI) was 283 in the ‘poor’ zone. SAFAR said the deterioration in the air quality was mainly on account of a rise in the contribution of stubble fires to the city’s PM 2.5 levels to 20% on Thursday from 8% the previous day.“The overall air quality of Delhi is likely to deteriorate to very poor by Thursday evening itself. Stubble burning’s share in PM2.5 in Delhi’s air is estimated at 20%. The air quality may improve marginally on November 22 with good wind speed likely around this time,” the SAFAR bulletin stated.Also Read: Haryana logs 46% rise in farm fires this yearAccording to scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the average wind speed has been around 12-15 kmph, which is favourable for the dispersion of pollutants. The deterioration in air quality can be attributed to a slight increase in fire counts, as the wind direction is north-westerly and is bringing fumes from Haryana and Punjab. Also, a fall in temperature may add to slow dispersion.On Thursday, Delhi recorded its lowest minimum temperature of the season at 9.4 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal. The maximum settled at 25.6 degrees C, two notches below normal.“The wind speed has remained good and is likely to be the same over the next two days. A dip in mercury and continuing stubble fires may result in slight deterioration,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/punjab-farm-fires-up-by-nearly-90-over-daily-average-of-past-5-years-study/story-Ayjg3dsege2rU62Wme65rN.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Body of businessman dumped from moving train recovered from Bharuch in Gujarat||The body of a Delhi businessman, which was dumped from a moving Rajdhani Express train on November 13, was recovered by the railway police from along the tracks in Bharuch, Gujarat, late Wednesday, the Delhi Police said on Thursday. According to police, the businessman, 46-year-old Neeraj Gupta, was murdered on November 12 and his body stuffed in a suitcase that was left in the pantry of the train for 12 hours by his alleged killer, Muhammad Juber, who is employed with the Railways’ pantry department. Juber, his fiancee Faisal and her mother Shaheen Naaz were Wednesday arrested for Gupta’s murder. Police said Faisal was having an affair with Gupta for the past 10 years and the businessman had opposed her getting engaged to Juber. He wanted her to call off the wedding. Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west), said the suitcase containing the body was found lying along the tracks some distance from the Bharuch railway station. “It is being brought back to Delhi,” he said. Arya said Gupta ran a finance firm in Karol Bagh and lived with his wife and two children in North Delhi’s Model Town. “For the past 10 years, he was in a relationship with Faisal, who was his employee,” said the DCP. According to the police, Gupta’s family knew of the relationship.“Recently, Faisal got engaged to Juber and Gupta was not for it,” said the DCP, adding that Gupta still had no intention of leaving his wife and children. “On the night of November 12, Gupta visited Faisal’s home in Adarsh Nagar and tried to persuade her to not get married. Juber and Shaheen Naaz were also there at that time and an argument ensued. Gupta allegedly pushed Faisal and an enraged Juber smashed Gupta’s head with a brick. He then used a knife to stab Gupta before slitting his throat,” said the officer. To dispose of the body, the trio allegedly stuffed it in an extra large suitcase. “The next morning, they booked a cab and left for Nizamuddin railway station with the suitcase,” said Arya. “Since Juber was already employed with the pantry department, he found it easy to gain access to the Rajdhani train leaving for Goa that afternoon,” said Arya. Juber then left the suitcase in the pantry car and waited till nightfall. An official with the Railways said while meals are currently not being prepared in the pantry cars due to Covid-19 restrictions, tea is sometimes readied in those compartments. On November 14, Gupta’s friend first filed a missing report at Adarsh Nagar police station and that was followed by his wife registering an FIR of kidnapping on Wednesday. “Since we were informed about Gupta’s extramarital affair and that he had last visited Faisal’s home before going missing, we began questioning the woman and her mother,” said the DCP.The women allegedly confessed to the crime and revealed Juber’s role as well, following which they were arrested.. “Juber couldn’t tell us the exact place where he had dumped the body -- he said he dumped it from the moving train was around 11.30pm on November 13,” said Arya. The Delhi Police were making efforts to find the body when the railway police from Gujarat got in touch with them..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/body-of-businessman-dumped-from-moving-train-recovered-from-bharuch-in-gujarat/story-p5ExMDShZgrVPy4x8Z4kQL.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Bengal tiger Bittu breathes his last at Delhi zoo; new tigress arrives from Kanpur||B-2 (Bittu), a 15-year-old male Royal Bengal tiger at the Delhi zoo, who was suffering from acute chronic kidney disorder (CKD), breathed his last Thursday morning, even as the zoo welcomed a Bengal tigress from Kanpur, under an exchange programme, earlier this week.Zoo officials said Bittu was not keeping well for the past few months and died at 9.25am Thursday. Delhi zoo director Ramesh Pandey said Bittu was brought from Van Vihar Zoo, Bhopal, in 2014 and had completed his average life span of 15 years. “The best possible treatment was being given to him in consultation with experts from Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly. The animal was under intensive care for more than 20 days. The post-mortem will be conducted by a panel of veterinary doctors and the viscera will be sent to lVRI for histopathological and other examinations to ascertain the cause of death,” said Pandey. With Bittu’s death, the zoo is now left with just one male Bengal tiger, Karan. The Delhi zoo had three Bengal tigers until a year ago. One of them, eight-year-old Rama died of kidney failure in September last year. Besides the Bengal tiger, the zoo also has six white tigers. Meanwhile, the zoo got a Bengal tigress, the first one in six years, from the Kanpur zoo for conservation breeding under an animal exchange programme. However, no animal was given in exchange for the tigress, said officials.“The tigress, Barkha, is six years old. She will form a pair with Karan, who is also aged around six. The zoo did not have a female tiger for a long time. She was brought to Delhi zoo just this week,” said Pandey.Conservation breeding is done mainly for critically endangered species. The Delhi zoo is one of the participating zoos for the breeding programme for five species --- Bengal tiger, Asiatic lion, rhinos, thamin (also known as Sangai deer) and red jungle fowl.“Our focus is to take conservation breeding forward. It is the science of conserving a species by preventing imminent population collapse in the wild due to a large number of eliminative pressures such as habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, industrialisation, poaching, illegal trade and climate change, among others. The Delhi zoo has a history of participating in the conservation programmes of different species,” said Pandey.Besides, he said the zoo has proposed different exchange programmes to increase the number of species from the existing 88 to 100. The total animal population at the zoo is 1,100. Recently, it had acquired five species under an exchange programme with Chandigarh’s Chhatbir Zoo. These included wild boar, black and grey partridge, golden pheasant, Eurasian dove and jungle cat.“In the second phase of the exchange programme with Chandigarh zoo, we plan to get a pair each of ostriches and chinkaras while we will give them a bison and a white buck. The last chinkara at the Delhi zoo died in June last year,” said Pandey.In another exchange programme, the zoo has proposed getting a male rhino from Patna. The rhino was given to Patna zoo by Delhi in 2014. The Delhi zoo doesn’t have a male rhino since the past six years while it has two female rhinos. “At the same time, we have proposed exchanging one of our female rhinos with a female rhino from Guwahati zoo. It is called a bloodline exchange and is good for breeding. However, the proposal is yet to be approved by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA),” he said.He added that another exchange is likely to take place by November-end with Jaipur zoo. Delhi will exchange a pair of hog deer for a pair of striped hyenas, Pandey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bengal-tiger-bittu-breathes-his-last-at-delhi-zoo-new-tigress-arrives-from-kanpur/story-5f9uKAYEqXLNZWj10mGBsK.html

The decision to form a committee was taken during the 155th academic council meeting held Thursday. The members of the JNU Teachers Association (JNUTA) alleged that they and student body representatives were excluded from the meeting.Chintamani Mahapatra, rector-I, JNU, issued a statement saying, “The council members felt that JNU should take the lead in implementing NEP-2020 in earnest and authorised the formation of an apex committee consisting of representatives from different schools and centres to deliberate and come up with recommendations.”The Union cabinet in July 2020 approved the New Education Policy (NEP), which is set to bring a slew of major changes including allowing top foreign universities to set up campuses in India, a greater proportion of students getting vocational education, and a move towards institutes including IITs turning multidisciplinary.According to Mahapatra’s statement, some of the major steps for the implementation of NEP, as discussed during the meeting, included the possibility of converting the existing three-year undergraduate programmes into four-year courses; the introduction of new four-year undergraduate programmes; offering master’s level programmes in online mode on subjects that do not require lab or experimental work; strengthening further the inclusive policy of the university to provide better opportunities for students from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds; and, increasing the intake of international students, among others.“The university will also focus on promoting innovation and entrepreneurship among students and faculty. This committee will also look into other aspects of NEP-2020 which are relevant to a research-oriented university such as the JNU,” Mahapatra said.The academic council also decided to establish a Special Centre for Systems Medicine (SCSM) in the university. “Systems medicine is an approach to understand the complexity of the interactions of all molecular and cellular determinants involved in the pathophysiology of a disease,” Mahapatra said.JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said, “This proposed centre would serve as a national hub for the development of India specific clinical and molecular data and its application in the area of systems medicine.”The JNUTA issued a statement alleging that both the faculty members and student association members were not invited to the meeting. “Faculty and students undoubtedly represent important constituents of the university system and the repeated attempts by the current administration to sideline their representation in statutory bodies is highly condemnable.”“These decisions were taken without any formal consultations with existing Schools and Centres, let alone the requisite approvals from the Boards of Studies of the Schools, and notwithstanding reservations expressed by many of the faculty members present,” it said. Responding to the allegations, Mahapatra said, “The AC has not taken any decision. It has only formed an apex committee which will make a report after discussing the matter with all stakeholders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jnu-may-introduce-four-year-ug-programmes-forms-committee-to-implement-nep-2020/story-dFBtzaQyadOen3S980XO1L.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Instagram influencer held for snatching dollars from Forex firm employee||A 25-year-old Instagram “influencer” and her friend have been arrested for snatching $3,000 from a Forex exchange employee in south Delhi’s Hauz Khas earlier this month and then using the money to go to Goa where they stayed at a five-star hotel and played poker, the police said on Thursday.Earlier in September, the Instagram account of the woman showed she had accused the same friend of “fraud, blackmail, robbery and extortion” and of threatening her.Atul Kumar Thakur, the deputy commissioner of police (south), said the woman, Amrita Sethi, and the man, Akshit Jhamb, have been friends for long even though they have an “on-off relationship”. “She would file a case against him, write defamatory posts about him one day and patch up the next day,” the DCP said about their relationship but added that these aspects would still be probed further.The Instagram account of Sethi has 80,000 followers. Her profile on the same platform said she was a social activist, fashion designer, “professional poker player Asia’s top 10” and “Miss Delhi”.The DCP said while her claims of being Miss India are yet to be verified, Sethi is an avid poker player who took part in some tournaments in Goa. “However, these so-called rankings are mainly arbitrary and self-declared. She mostly plays poker for a living, it appears,” the DCP said.Jhamb, 26, on the other hand, is an unemployed man who is into gambling, the DCP said.Since November 3, two days before the alleged crime happened, Sethi’s Instagram account shows no new posts.The DCP said the alleged crime took place on November 5 when Manoj Sood, an employee of a Forex exchange firm, was asked by his boss to deliver $3,000 to a client near south Delhi’s Panchsheel Club and seek an online transfer of R2.45 lakh in return.“When Sood reached the location, he found Sethi and Jhamb sitting in a car,” the DCP said. The two suspects posed as the client. “Together, they visited an ATM, but Indian currency couldn’t be withdrawn,” the DCP said.They asked Sood to hand them over the dollars but he refused to oblige them until they produced the Indian cash, the officer said. “They asked him to at least show them the dollars. The moment he did that, they snatched the dollars from him and escaped in the car,” the DCP said.On receiving the complaint, the police scanned CCTV footage to identify the car. They reached out to the owner who allegedly told the police his son and his two friends had driven out his car. “Since the owner’s son hadn’t returned home for three days, it seemed suspicious,” the DCP said.The police finally learnt that the two suspects were staying in a five-star hotel in Goa. “We requested Goa Police for help and they went on to catch the duo on Wednesday. It turned out that even the car owner’s son, Kushaal, was staying in the same five-star hotel,” the DCP said.They first allegedly tried to mislead Goa Police by saying they were on a work-related tour, but later confessed to the crime, said the officer. “They have spent much of the money on their hotel stay and playing poker,” Thakur said.Kushal too has been arrested because he had allegedly given his car to the suspects and had gone with them to Goa, said the DCP. “His role in the actual robbery is still being probed,” the officer said.The officer said Sethi claimed to have lent a few lakh rupees to Jhamb in the past for gambling in Goa, a dispute over which she had also filed a civil case in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/instagram-influencer-held-for-snatching-dollars-from-forex-firm-employee-spending-money-in-goa-five-star-hotel/story-BRIQwxrvrD5QLGPKY0jBIN.html
20-11-2020||Delhi||Court rejects police’s plea against relief for Jamaatis||A Delhi court on Thursday dismissed 44 pleas filed by Delhi police challenging a magisterial court’s order discharging 44 foreign nationals, who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in March, of various violations under the Foreigners Act . While eight nationals were completely discharged of all offences, including malignantly spreading infection of a disease dangerous to life and disobeying quarantine rules, the rest 36 were exonerated of charges of violation of visa rules under the Act but were charged with negligence. Additional sessions judge Sandeep Yadav said the revision petitions were devoid of merit. Earlier, charges were framed against 36 persons accused of disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant, a negligent act that likely to spread infection of a disease dangerous to life. Charges were also framed under the Disaster Management Act.On August 24 they were discharged of offences under section 14 (1) (b) (violation of visa norms) of the Foreigners Act, sections 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) of IPC.The court had said there was no iota of evidence to suggest the accused had in any manner professed or propagated the principles and doctrines of the Tablighi Jamaat or had indulged in Tablighi work as alleged, and discharged eight foreigners of all charges.Challenging their discharge, the police filed revision petitions seeking framing of charges against the 36 foreigners.The police also filed revision petitions against the order of the magistrate court, discharging eight foreign nationals from six countries of all charges under which they were charge-sheeted in the absence of any record or any credible material against them.Dismissing these applications, the court said the magistrate’s order “was well reasoned, which did not call for interference”.The court said the evidence collected during the investigation is wholly insufficient to frame the charge against the foreign nationals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/court-rejects-police-s-plea-against-relief-for-jamaatis/story-KzLFFo7g6uJaduTaVZsmLN.html

20-11-2020||Education||Delhi’s happiness curriculum gets featured in Harvard’s International Education Week||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia was invited as a guest speaker on an online panel discussion on the happiness curriculum of the Delhi government by the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) during its International Education Week.During the discussion titled, “systematic social-emotional learning of the happiness curriculum”, held on Tuesday, Sisodia said the Delhi government wanted to design a curriculum for students that would prepare them to become lifelong learners. He said, “Happiness curriculum is not a value education class that preaches moral values to students. Instead, it focuses on developing the mindset of the students to adopt values in their everyday attitude and behaviour.”Sisodia said education is the only way to reform society and politicians should work as facilitators of education. “Education is the only tool available that can reform society, and give us a society that we all dream of. Education, globally, is being used to fill unemployment gaps and lessen poverty, but it still doesn’t address more human problems that society faces.”“So far, successful education models around the world have been producing professionally sound people, but not emotionally sound people. Happiness curriculum works towards building a confident and a holistic mindset towards caste, creed, and religion so students become more self-aware and open towards each other,” he said.Professor Fernando Reimers, Ford Foundation professor of practice in international education at HGSE, praised Sisodia’s vision and said the happiness curriculum was path-breaking, and impressive in tackling the huge challenge of building capacity of teachers, and enforcing happiness classes in all Delhi government schools. “In a world that is changing very rapidly, with an uncertain future with this pandemic being a reminder, it’s important to question the deep purposes of schools and education,” he said.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi introduced the ‘happiness curriculum’ in its schools from July 2018. Under the curriculum, nursery and kindergarten students twice a week and students from classes 1 to 8 spend once daily engage in meditation, storytelling, and activity sessions. The curriculum includes storytelling and activities, followed by question-and-answer sessions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-s-happiness-curriculum-gets-featured-in-harvard-s-international-education-week/story-uxf644dcJKC1oY1MtEq6rK.html

20-11-2020||Pune||PMC, PCMC deny permission for Chhath puja celebration at public places||Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations have denied permission for Chhath puja celebration at public places, including riverbeds, dams and open grounds. The main day of the four-day festival falls on Friday this year. It is celebrated by residents hailing from Bihar, Jharkhand and other parts of north and east India where women fast and offer prayers to the Sun god near water bodies. While Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) issued the order on Wednesday, its Pune counterpart (PMC) released it on Thursday, after the state government issued the guidelines on Wednesday. The authorities have asked police to ramp up vigilance near public water bodies. PMC has appealed to people to conduct rituals at home and follow the Covid prevention measures while performing Chhath puja. “We generally go to Khadakwasla dam during Chhath Puja, but this time it will be a different experience as there will be no gathering of friends. Our group has decided to have video calls after the puja,” said Kinjal Yadav, a resident of Aundh. “Every year we used to celebrate the festival at Jhulelal ghat, Pimpri. With an appeal for cracker-less Diwali and possible Covid spread, the members of our housing society have decided to avoid mass gathering. There is nothing wrong in celebrating the festival at home,” said Mehul Kaushik, a native of Ranchi and staying in Pimpri since five years. Manju Yadav, who resides at Kharadi and hails from Varanasi, said, “We have decided to celebrate the festival at home. As the festival involves preparation of ‘prasad’ made in ‘Ganga Jal’ on traditional ‘clay çhulha’, we have decided to get the mud from neighbourhood rather than visiting public water bodies. We will perform the rituals at water tub and follow the Covid prevention guidelines given by the authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-pcmc-deny-permission-for-chhath-puja-celebration-at-public-places/story-z6IabFbRgzYcJ7R9PRZKCI.html
20-11-2020||Pune||BJP targets govt for backtracking on power bills, says Sena-NCP destroying their ally Congress||Pune: The leader of opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC) and state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Pravin Darekar on Thursday accused the ruling Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) of trying to destroy their ally Congress in the state by ignoring the latter’s demands. Darekar was in Pune to campaign for BJP’s candidate from Pune graduate constituency Sangram Deshmukh, who is locked in fight against NCP’s Arun Lad. Targeting the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over backtracking on its promise of power bills, Darekar said that while those in power provided financial relief to public transport department, it left out the energy department. “The MVA government announced aid to the department headed by a Sena minister, but refused any relief to the energy ministry held by Congress’s Nitin Raut. It is clear that Sena-NCP are trying to destroy their Congress ally Maharashtra,” Darekar said at a press conference. Earlier this month, Raut had hinted at providing relief to electricity consumers facing the issue of inflated power bills, saying that a Diwali gift was in the offing. Later, the minister reportedly said that the government will not be able to provide any relaxation in domestic electricity bills. Darekar said, “It is an unfair decision...The government must give relief to consumers.” He also alleged that the government has ignored the issues of employment and education. At least 97 candidates are in the fray for election to two seats of the Maharashtra Legislative Council, an official said on Wednesday. Of these, 62 candidates are in the poll fray from the Pune graduate constituency and 35 from the teacher seat, said a Pune district administration official. The seats are a part of the five graduates and teachers’ constituencies of the legislative council for which voting will take place on December 1. While the BJP has fielded Deshmukh, the NCP has given ticket to Lad and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) to Rupali Patil for the Pune graduate constituency. Of the five poll-bound segments, three are graduate constituencies from Aurangabad, Pune and Nagpur divisions, and two are teacher seats from Pune and Amravati divisions. These are constituencies in which only teachers and graduates, respectively, are eligible to vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-targets-govt-for-backtracking-on-power-bills-says-sena-ncp-destroying-their-ally-congress/story-FRFLaxmKZigmZVJEnJqgKO.html
20-11-2020||Pune||Pune civic body orders 50K antigen kits to check possible Covid second wave||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department has ordered 50,000 antigen (rapid) testing kits as it prepares to handle the possible second wave of Covid-19. A central team has predicted the next wave of deadly virus in the city during December-January. The civic administration has also decided to increase the number of swab collection and RT-PCR test centres. The civic body anticipates a rise in infections following heavy rush on streets during Diwali. “The number of daily tests came down to around 1,000 to 1,500 after positive cases tally also dropped, and an average of 200 patients was found positive. After November 25, the number of positive patients might see a rise. With second wave predicted in December- January, we have started preparations to tackle the possible surge. With fall in positive cases, PMC had closed three of its 21 swab centres. With rise in cases expected, all the 21 centres will be functional soon,” said Dr Sanjeev Wavare, PMC assistant health chief. According to a health department official, around 2,500 new cases may be found daily during the possible second wave and for that around 6,000 daily tests will be done. The civic body has already arranged 2,500 beds to handle these cases. “We need to be prepared. Taking daily tests from the present 1,500 to 6,000 is a task and we will need more kits for it. Thought the number of RT-PCR test will be high, antigen test kits will also be used on daily basis and so the order of 50,000 new kits has been given,” the official said. The number of average daily tests has been reducing since September from 13,000 to 8,000 in October and 3,000 in November Maha advisory A circular-cum-advisory issued by the state directorate of health services last week stated that the second wave of the pandemic is likely in January-February. It advises concerned officials to ramp up Covid-19 testing in the state. The circular said, “Several European countries are witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 currently. On the basis of that there is a possibility we may also get a second wave in January-February.” It has asked district administrations, municipal corporations and medical officers to ensure there is no laxity in laboratory testing, and asked them to carry out tests as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-orders-50k-antigen-kits-to-check-possible-covid-second-wave/story-PI8Kke5xuxBdnsY38Im6RO.html
20-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Shiv Sena functionary orders Karachi Sweets owner to change shop’s name||A video of Shiv Sena functionary Nitin Nandgaonkar ordering the owner of Karachi Sweets, a shop in Bandra, to rename the premises and remove Karachi from the name has gone viral on social media, creating a stir. The party, however, has distanced itself from Nandgaonkar’s actions. In the video clip, Nandgaonkar is seen telling the owner that he has to rename the shop, and when the owner tries to explain that the shop has nothing to do with Pakistan, Nandgaonkar is heard saying he is ready to give him as much time as he wants to make the change, but he has to do it as soon as possible. “We are giving you time to change the name. You can name the shop after anything you want. You can name it after your ancestors, but not Karachi. Write the name in Marathi, and change it on the signboard as well as the shop registration papers,” he said in the video.After Nandgaonkar’s visit, the shop’s name has been covered with newspapers.Sena, meanwhile, said the shop had nothing to do with Pakistan. Party chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut tweeted, “Karachi bakery and Karachi sweets have been in Mumbai for last 60 years. They have nothing to do with Pakistan. It makes no sense to ask for changing their names now. Demand for changing their name is not Shiv Sena’s official stance.”A senior Shiv Sena leader said Nandgaonkar acted on his own accord. “So far there is no decision whether to take any action against him or issue a show-cause [notice] to him. But when a senior leader issues a statement, it is a message to the person to not overstep the line,” the leader said, on condition of anonymity.When asked about the party’s stand, Nandgaonkar said it was a “spontaneous” decision to confront the shop owner. “So far I have not been asked to explain my action. I am a proud Shiv Sainik and a follower of Balasaheb. I will stand by my action. I was shopping in Bandra on Wednesday and was unaware that a shop with such a name exists. I politely went to him and asked him to change the name, and he had agreed as well,” Nandgaonkar said.Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam slammed Nandgaonkar’s actions and said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should protect the shop owner. “Like Chinese food in Indian restaurants has no connection with China, similarly Karachi Sweets in Bandra has nothing to do with Pakistan. When will the unintelligent Shiv Sena workers understand this? Threatening to change the name of a 70-year-old shop is wrong. The chief minister should merely see this spectacle, but must help him,” tweeted Nirupam.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), too, slammed the Sena for blatant “dadagiri” and asked Mumbai Police to take cognisance of the threat by Nandgaonkar. “Nitin Nandgaonkar must apologise immediately. Mumbai Police should take cognisance and act as per law. The Shiv Sena leadership resorting to this vigilantism during a pandemic speaks volumes of its misplaced priorities,” said AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon in a statement.भारत के चाइनीज़ होटलों का चीन से कोई लेना-देना नहीं है,वैसे ही बांद्रा के #कराँची_स्वीट्स का पाकिस्तान से कोई नाता नहीं।यह सत्य #शिवसेना के बेवक़ूफ़ कार्यकर्ता कब समझेंगे ?70 साल पुरानी दुकान का नाम बदलने की जो धमकी दी गई है,वो गलत है।मुख्यमंत्री तमाशा न देखें, उसकी रक्षा करें।In a tweet, Nirupam said, “Like Chinese food in Indian restaurants has no connection with China, similarly Karachi Sweets in Bandra has nothing to do with Pakistan.

20-11-2020||World||Satellite to track rising seas as climate warms||An Earth-observation satellite developed by European and US space agencies set to lift off Saturday will measure sea level rise, tracking changes threatening to disrupt tens of millions of lives within a generation.If all goes according to plan, the payload will be hoisted into a low-Earth 1,300-kilometre (800-mile) orbit by a Space X Falcon 9 rocket, with lift-off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 17:17 GMT. Sentinel-6a will be the first of two identical satellites -- the second to be launched in five years -- that will provide measurements of unprecedented precision until at least 2030.Each Sentinel-6 probe carries a radar altimeter, which measures the time it takes for radar pulses to travel to Earth’s surface and back again.The satellites will circle the planet in the same orbit as earlier missions that supplied sea-surface height data over the last three decades, mapping 95 percent of Earth’s ice-free ocean every ten days.Accelerating sea level rise is arguably the climate change impact that will affect the largest number of people over the next three decades.Nearly 800 million people live within five metres of sea level, and even an increase in sea level of a few centimetres can translate into vastly more damage from high tides and storm surges.Sea level rise acceleratingAlready today, there are more than 100 million people living below high tide levels. “Extreme sea level events that are historically rare -- once per century in the recent past -- are projected to occur frequently, at least once per year, at many locations by 2050,” especially in the tropics, the UN climate science advisory panel, the IPCC, concluded in a major report last year.Satellites tracking the world’s oceans since 1993 show that global mean sea level has risen, on average, by over three millimetres (more than a tenth of an inch) annually. More recently, that rate has increased to 5 mm per year.“It is crucial that we are able to see these accelerations,” said Alain Ratier, outgoing Director-General of Europe’s meteorological satellite agency, EUMETSAT.China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand are home to the greatest number of people who today live on land that could be threatened by permanent inundation by 2100.The IPCC forecasts an increase in global sea level rise of up to 1.1 metres (43 inches) by the end of the century.The Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission is a collaboration of the European Commission, the European Space Agency (ESA), EUMETSAT, NASA and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).The Sentinel satellites are each about the size and shape of a large minivan topped with slanted solar panels, and weigh nearly 1,200 kilos (2,600 pounds), including rocket fuel.They are designed to last for five-and-a-half years, but could provide data for far longer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satellite-to-track-rising-seas-as-climate-warms/story-4Pw3VWxLm9LYylZulgfNRO.html
20-11-2020||World||India tells UNSC it’s time to speak unequivocally against terrorism||India on Friday told the UN Security Council “it is time” for it to speak “unequivocally against violence and terrorist forces and act against terrorist sanctuaries and safe havens”, and drew its attention during a discussion on Afghanistan to a South Asian neighbour from where terrorism has flowed into the region.While there was consensus in the council on the need to combat terrorism in all forms and shapes, some of its members have sought to distinguish between terrorists to be condemned and fought and those that need to be defended. China has done that time and again, extending its protective shield to Pakistan’s terror groups, which have targeted India to its east and Afghanistan to its west.“It is time that the Security Council speaks unequivocally against violence and terrorist forces and acts against terrorist sanctuaries and safe havens,” T S Tirumurti, the Indian permanent representative, said during an “Aria formula meeting” on Afghanistan. India participated in the discussion as an incoming member; it starts its eighth term as A non-permanent member in January.“For durable peace in Afghanistan, we have to put an end to terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries operating across the Durand Line (which separates Afghanistan and Pakistan),” the diplomat said, adding, citing a UN report that pointed to the continued presence of foreign fighters in Afghanistan, “For violence to end in Afghanistan, these terrorist supply chains must be broken.”Though Tirumurti’s remarks were in the context of Afghanistan, they were relevant to the region. India on Thursday apprehended four alleged operatives of Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Pakistan-based and -funded terrorist outfit founded by Masood Azhar, whose designation by the UNSC had been blocked by China for years, until it faced the combined force of other permanent members in 2019.The top Indian diplomat at the UN reiterated India’s support for “Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled” peace process, but also stressed that need for expressly calling attention to terrorism.Tirumurti said, “There needs to be zero-tolerance of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Afghanistan can succeed only when terrorism no longer flows across the Durand Line. Terror and violence cannot be the instrument to shape Afghanistan’s future or dictate the choices Afghans make. It is important to ensure that no one provides sanctuary to terrorists who threaten Afghanistan or any other country in the region. Those who do so must be held accountable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-tells-unsc-it-s-time-to-speak-unequivocally-against-terrorism/story-S1kMOE6dpJwYzM1qc209QI.html
20-11-2020||World||Donald Trump seeks to overturn US election outcome as Georgia recount reaffirms Joe Biden victory||As President-elect Joe Biden’s 306-232 lead in electoral college votes was reaffirmed on Thursday by a recount in the state of Georgia, President Donald Trump yet again launched efforts to overturn the US election’s outcome after having failed to mount a credible legal challenge in the battleground states that he lost.Biden, who turned 78 on Friday, and his team have maintained a public posture of confidence in the outcome. “It’s hard to fathom how this man thinks,” he told reporters on Thursday. “I’m confident he knows he hasn’t won, and is not going to win, and we’re going to be sworn in on January 20.”The Democrat president-elect did speak disapprovingly of Trump’s behaviour, which he felt was “totally irresponsible” and sent “damaging” messages to the rest of the world about how democracy works, conveying a “horrible message about who we are as a country”.Georgia’s hand recount of votes lasted six days, but brought no real relief to Trump. He can, however, still seek another recount under the state’s election rules. Wisconsin, meanwhile, began a recount in two counties on Friday, as demanded by the Trump campaign.Trump and Republican allies have filed more than 30 lawsuits since November 3, when polling closed for the 2020 election. They first alleged election fraud and irregularities, and then dropped them, indicating how tenuous they were. They have also put forward wild conspiracy theories - as did Rudy Giuliani, the US president’s personal lawyer, and others at a press briefing on Thursday that was widely panned as “crazy” even by Trump’s allies. Mitt Romney, a Republican senator who has been critical of Trump, said, “Having failed to make even a plausible case of widespread fraud or conspiracy before any court of law, the president has now resorted to overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election. It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic act by a sitting American president.”Trump has invited a group of Republican legislators from Michigan, a battleground state he lost, to the White House on Friday in a reported bid to persuade them to reject the election’s outcome. Trump lost Michigan, which has 16 electoral college votes, by more than 150,000 popular votes and tried earlier to persuade local Republican officials to not certify the result in the state’s largest county, which is mostly black. He has had no success yet.The US president will need to deploy this strategy based on the use of the power of his office in other states to overturn the 306-232 verdict and could next target Georgia (16 electoral votes) and Arizona (11) - states with Republicans in control of the legislatures and the governorships.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-seeks-to-overturn-us-election-outcome-as-georgia-recount-reaffirms-joe-biden-victory/story-ECOcSmZqtCYcf8IFMJtJjJ.html

He has been refused the party whip in the House of Commons for a few months, but that is a very lame response to a very big crisis,” Lord Desai said.“I have been very uncomfortable and slightly ashamed that the party has been injected with this sort of racism. Jewish MPs were abused openly, and female members were trolled. It is out and out racism,” he said.Also Read | UK’s Labour party readmits Jeremy Corbyn after brief suspensionThe Labour Party has been plagued by allegations of antisemitism over the years, with its disastrous electoral defeat in the December 2019 election also linked to the crisis. Sir Keir Starmer took over as the new party leader this year with the promise of ridding the party of the scourge and had taken the step to suspend Corbyn last month after he seemed to downplay the very critical findings of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The watchdog had found that Labour had broken the law in its failure to handle antisemitism, or anti-Jewish, complaints and there were “serious failings” by its leadership at the time.“I don’t see things really changing in the foreseeable future and have to ultimately live with my conscience. I can’t go on being in an antisemitic party,” said Desai, even as he stressed that he has no plans of joining any other political party.He has sent in his resignation letter to the Leader of the Labour Party in the House of Lords, Baroness Angela Smith, and despite many appeals for him to reconsider, he will now sit as an independent peer while his application to be part of the Crossbench group of the UK Parliament’s Upper House is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-peer-lord-meghnad-desai-quits-labour-party-over-racism/story-CFu1RzAFRfnFjQyP6m9htL.html

But a large WHO-led trial known as the Solidarity Trial showed last month that it had little or no effect on 28-day mortality or length of hospital stays for Covid-19 patients.The medication was one of the drugs used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump’s coronavirus infection, and had been shown in previous studies to have cut time to recovery. It is authorised or approved for use as a Covid-19 treatment in more than 50 countries.Gilead has questioned the Solidarity Trial’s results and said in a statement on Friday it was “disappointed” at the new WHO guideline.“Veklury is recognised as a standard of care for the treatment of hospitalised patients with Covid-19 in guidelines from numerous credible national organisations,” it said.“The WHO guidelines appear to ignore this evidence at a time when cases are dramatically increasing around the world and doctors are relying on Veklury as the first and only approved antiviral treatment for patients with Covid-19.”The WHO advice raises questions about whether the European Union will need the 500,000 courses of the antiviral, worth 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), it ordered last month.The European Commission said on Friday it had taken note of the WHO updated guideline on remdesivir but that “at the moment, there are no changes” to its authorisation for the drug.It said the region’s drugs regulator, the European Medicines Agency, had requested the full data from Solidarity Trial and “will assess the evidence ... together with other available data, to see if any changes are needed”.Italy’s drugs regulator, AIFA, said it had been “stressing for weeks the modest effectiveness of remdesivir”.“In practice we have been saying for some time that it is not use for much,” a spokeswoman said.NO MEANINGFUL EFFECTThe WHO’s Guideline Development Group (GDG) panel said its recommendation was based on an evidence review that included data from four international randomised trials involving more than 7,000 patients hospitalised with Covid-19.After reviewing the evidence, the panel said it concluded that remdesivir, which has to be given intravenously and is therefore costly and complex to administer, has no meaningful effect on death rates or other important outcomes for patients.Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at Britain’s Oxford University, said the WHO’s new advice should prompt “a rethink about the place of remdesivir in Covid-19”.“Remdesivir is an expensive drug that must be given intravenously for five to 10 days, so this recommendation will save money and other healthcare resources,” he said.At the end of October, Gilead cut its 2020 revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand and difficulty in predicting sales of remdesivir.The recommendation, which is not binding, is part of its so-called “living guidelines” project, designed to offer ongoing guidance for doctors. The panel added that it supported continued enrolment into clinical trials evaluating remdesivir in patients with Covid-19, which it said should “provide higher certainty of evidence for specific groups of patients”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-use-gilead-s-remdesivir-in-hospitalised-covid-19-patients-says-who/story-GeqehtjchhtHDr26qqu3cI.html

His death sparked worldwide protests and triggered a re-evaluation of the legacy of slavery and racism.As protesters worldwide fell monuments honoring slave owners, Confederates and disgraced white leaders of decades past, their downfall opens a debate over who should rise up to take their place.“What the tragedy of what happened to George Floyd has done is to really amplify the discussion,” said Ambassador Michael Kanu, Deputy Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone to the United Nations, who co-authored the paper.“It’s all part of the quest for justice,” he said in an interview, adding he hoped West African nations could put the proposal before the ISA some time next year.The memorial would add a cultural aspect to the economic and environmental considerations before the ISA about deep-sea mining exploration, particularly of copper and cobalt, said Turner.About 40,000 slave voyages crossed the Atlantic, carrying more than 12.5 million captive Africans from the early 1500s to the late 1800s, according to the authors.The routes of the slave ships became the burial sites of those who were thrown overboard, killed themselves or drowned when ships sank, the paper said.The memorial would be the first of its kind to honor slave trade victims. The undersea wreck of the Titanic, which sank in the Atlantic Ocean in 1912, was declared a memorial by the U.S. Congress in 1986.On land, well-known slavery memorial sites include a wharf in Rio de Janeiro, where an estimated 900,000 African slaves were shipped, and a 15th-century slave trading house in Calabar, Nigeria.(Reporting by Ellen Wulfhorst; Editing by Zoe Tabary.

20-11-2020||World||Pfizer, BioNTech plan emergency move to use Covid-19 vaccine in December||Covid-19 vaccine makers Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE on Friday said they plan to file for an emergency use authorisation that could allow their Covid-19 vaccine to be used in the US next month.In a respite to a pandemic-hit world, the US drugmaker and its German partner had confirmed earlier this week that a final analysis of clinical trial data showed the shot was 95% effective at preventing the disease. The filing with the Food and Drug Administration could permit the vaccine to be administered to high-risk populations in the US by the middle to the end of December, the companies said in a statement.In their application, Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have also included safety data on about 100 children 12-15 years of age. The company said 45 per cent of US trial participants are 56-85 years old.Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla has said that this move by the drugmakers marks a critical milestone.““Filing in the U.S. represents a critical milestone in our journey to deliver a Covid-19 vaccine to the world and we now have a more complete picture of both the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine,” Bourla said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-plan-emergency-move-to-use-covid-19-vaccine-in-december/story-6sQGY8LXLOI5lZ6s5KwxZP.html
20-11-2020||World||Pfizer seeks emergency use of its Covid-19 vaccine in US||Pfizer said Friday it is asking US regulators to allow emergency use of its Covid-19 vaccine, starting the clock on a process that could bring limited first shots as early as next month and eventually an end to the pandemic -- but not until after a long, hard winter.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The action comes days after Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech announced that its vaccine appears 95% effective at preventing mild to severe Covid-19 disease in a large, ongoing study.The companies said that protection plus a good safety record means the vaccine should qualify for emergency use authorization, something the Food and Drug Administration can grant before the final testing is fully complete. In addition to Friday’s FDA submission, they have already started “rolling” applications in Europe and the UK and intend to submit similar information soon.With the coronavirus surging around the US and the world, the pressure is on for regulators to make a speedy decision.“Help is on the way,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert said on the eve of Pfizer’s announcement, adding that it’s too early to abandon masks and other protective measures. “We need to actually double down on the public health measures as we’re waiting for that help to come.”Friday’s filing sets off a chain of events as the FDA and its independent advisers debate if the shots are ready. If so, still another government group will have to decide how the initial limited supplies are rationed out to anxiously awaiting Americans.How much vaccine is available and when is a moving target, but initial supplies will be scarce and rationed. About 25 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine may become available in December, 30 million in January and 35 million more in February and March, according to information presented to the National Academy of Medicine this week. Recipients will need two doses, three weeks apart.Not far behind is competitor Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine. Its early data suggests the shots are as strong as Pfizer’s, and that company expects to also seek emergency authorization within weeks.MAKING THE DATA PUBLICThe public’s first chance to see how strong the evidence really is will come in early December at a public meeting of the FDA’s scientific advisers.Also Read | Oxford scientists expect Covid-19 vaccine data by ChristmasSo far, what’s known is based only on statements from Pfizer and BioNTech. Of 170 infections detected to date, only eight were among people who’d received the actual vaccine and the rest had gotten a dummy shot. On the safety side, the companies cites results from 38,000 study participants who’ve been tracked for two months after their second dose. That’s a milestone FDA set because historically, vaccine side effects don’t crop up later than that.“We’ll drill down on these data,” said FDA adviser Dr. Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.Think of it like science on trial. A few days before the meeting, the FDA will release its own internal analysis. That sets the stage for the advisers’ daylong debate about any signs of safety concerns and how the new vaccine technology works before rendering a verdict.They’ll recommend not just whether FDA should allow broader use of the vaccine generally but if so, for whom. For example, is there enough proof the vaccine works as well for older, sicker adults as for younger, healthier people?There’s still no guarantee. “We don’t know what that vote’s going to be,” said former FDA vaccine chief Norman Baylor.EMERGENCY USE ISN’T THE SAME AS FULL APPROVALIf there’s an emergency green light, “that vaccine is still deemed investigational. It’s not approved yet,” Dr. Marion Gruber, chief of FDA’s vaccine office, told the National Academy of Medicine this week.That means anyone offered an emergency vaccination must get a “fact sheet” describing potential benefits and risks before going through with the shot, she said.There will be a lot of unknowns. For example, the 95% protection rate is based on people who developed symptoms and then were tested for the virus. Can the vaccinated get infected but have no symptoms, able to spread the virus? How long does protection last?That’s why the 44,000-person study needs to keep running -- something difficult considering ethically, participants given dummy shots at some point must be offered real vaccine, complicating the search for answers.And at least for now, pregnant women won’t qualify because they weren’t studied. Pfizer only recently began testing the vaccine in children as young as 12.A decision on Pfizer’s vaccine won’t affect other Covid-19 vaccine candidates in the pipeline, which will be judged separately.Also Read | HTLS 2020: There is light at the end of the tunnel, say top Covid expertsMANUFACTURINGBrewing vaccine is more complex than typical drug manufacturing, yet the millionth dose to roll out of Pfizer’s Kalamazoo, Michigan, factory must be the same purity and potency as every dose before and after.That means the FDA decision isn’t just based on study data, but on its determination that the vaccine is being made correctly.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine -- and Moderna’s shots -- are made with brand-new technology. They don’t contain the actual coronavirus. Instead, they’re made with a piece of genetic code for the “spike” protein that studs the virus.That messenger RNA, or mRNA, instructs the body to make some harmless spike protein, training immune cells to recognize it if the real virus eventually comes along.GETTING INTO PEOPLE’S ARMSAnother government group -- advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- decides who is first in line for scarce doses. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said he hopes that decision can be made at the same time as FDA’s.The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed has worked with states to line up how many doses they’d need to cover the populations offered vaccine first.Pfizer will ship those supplies as ordered by the states -- only after FDA gives the OK.Company projections of how much it will ship each month are just predictions, Baylor warned.“It’s not like a pizza,” he said. Manufacturing is so complex that “you don’t necessarily end up with what you thought.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-seeks-emergency-use-of-its-covid-19-vaccine-in-us/story-smaCA20nISwSIps7Aldp0M.html
20-11-2020||World||EU warns UK hasn’t compromised enough for Brexit trade deal||The European Union warned that the UK hasn’t moved sufficiently to overcome the three main obstacles to a post-Brexit trade deal as three of the bloc’s leaders called for contingency plans to be stepped up in case one isn’t reached.At a meeting in Brussels on Friday, envoys from the EU’s 27 member states were told that progress has been slow, and negotiations could now slip into December, according to people in the meeting who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. The pound trimmed its earlier gains.The talks were roiled this week by the disclosure that a member of the EU team had tested positive for coronavirus. Face-to-face negotiations have been now suspended, and Michel Barnier, the bloc’s chief negotiator, is to go into quarantine just as time to reach a deal runs out.Late on Thursday, the leaders of France, Belgium and the Netherlands called on the bloc to make contingency plans in case a deal fails to materialize. If that happens, businesses and consumers will face disruption as tariffs and quotas return.In recent days, though, officials on both sides had privately voiced cautious optimism that a deal could be concluded as soon as next week. The EU briefing to the ambassadors and the comments by the three leaders may be an attempt to pressure the U.K. government to compromise further before a deal is struck at a later date.Officials said talks are at a delicate stage and envoys were not briefed in detail so as not to undermine the negotiations and put possible compromises at risk.While the EU has been saying for weeks that the disagreements on fishing, the level playing field and how any agreement will be enforced, the reality appears more nuanced. Both sides have made concessions and some progress in recent days, according to people familiar with the negotiations.Some progress has been made on state aid, two EU officials said, but on other so-called level playing field issues, the U.K. is still resisting EU pressure include ratchet clauses -- which would force Britain to raise its legal standards in areas including environment and social protection if EU legislation changes in the future.On fishing, the two sides still can’t agree on how much of the British catch EU boats will be allocated. On governance, the two sides haven’t agreed on cross retaliation clauses, the official said.“We are working hard to get an agreement and to find solutions that fully respect U.K. sovereignty” a British official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-warns-uk-hasn-t-compromised-enough-for-brexit-trade-deal/story-UFQHsJXTjDSdJBnel75TeI.html
20-11-2020||World||Rishi Sunak’s spending challenge laid bare as deficit hits record||UK government borrowing climbed to a record 214.9 billion pounds ($286 billion) in the first seven months of the fiscal year, underscoring the tough choices facing Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak as he prepares for a major announcement on spending next week.Office for National Statistics figures Friday showed the deficit in October alone totaled 22.3 billion pounds, leaving Britain on course for a shortfall approaching 400 billion pounds for 2020-21 as a whole and debt above 100% for the first time since the early 1960s. There was better news on retail sales, which rose for a sixth straight month.The scale of the damage inflicted by the pandemic will be laid bare on Nov. 25, when Sunak unveils the cash each department will get to fund public services and investment in the coming year. While the spending review is expected to deliver on key commitments, millions of public-sector workers are facing a renewed pay squeeze as the government tries to contain borrowing.The plans will be underpinned by new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is expected to echo the Bank of England and private-sector analysts by predicting the sharpest economic contraction since the Great Frost of 1709 -- and only a gradual recovery to pre-pandemic levels.At almost a fifth of the economy, the deficit is set to be the largest in British peacetime -- a staggering deterioration from March, when the OBR was expecting just 55 billion pounds, or around 2.5% of GDP.Sunak is expected to focus on environmental projects and delivering on election commitments made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to level up poorer regions of the country. But with the fiscal position so weak, the chancellor is set to squeeze overseas aid and pay in the public sector, where workers have fared better than their private-sector peers during the crisis.An announcement on pay restraint is likely to exempt health-care workers who have been on the front line of the battle against coronavirus, according to people familiar with the matter. But the decision will be a blow to millions of teachers, police officers and civil servants, who just over a year ago were promised an end to almost a decade of austerity.With many public services pared to the bone, tax increases to repair the government finances appear inevitable once the crisis has passed. Sunak is under no under immediate pressure, however, with the BOE’s vast bond-buying program keeping borrowing costs at record lows.Friday’s ONS figures show that revenue was down 8.8% in the financial year to date compared with a year earlier, while spending surged 29% amid the huge cost of programs to support workers and businesses through through the crisis.A cash measure of borrowing totaled 260.8 billion pounds between April and October, suggesting the Debt Management Office may need to sell around half a trillion pounds of government bonds, or gilts, in the current fiscal year. Net debt climbed to 2.08 trillion pounds, or 100.8% of GDP.The first six months of the fiscal year saw the headline borrowing figure revised down by almost 16 billion pounds, largely reflecting stronger estimates for value-added tax and the timing of wage-subsidy payments to furloughed employees. In cash terms, the figures were little changed.Retail sales volumes rose 1.2% from September, the ONS said in a separate report. Economists expected a decline of 0.3%.Statisticians said evidence from businesses suggests part of the increase was driven by consumers starting their Christmas shopping earlier. That could reflect concerns about coronavirus lockdowns that would close stores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-s-spending-challenge-laid-bare-as-deficit-hits-record/story-K0co6Y3EFWkDCKrufBNrhM.html
20-11-2020||World||Britain may ease curbs for Christmas as Covid-19 cases start flattening||Britain could ease its stringent Covid-19 lockdown to allow families to gather for Christmas because there are signs that coronavirus cases are starting to flatten as a result of current lockdowns, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Friday.The United Kingdom has the worst official Covid-19 death toll in Europe and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has imposed some of the most stringent curbs in peacetime history in an attempt to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus.Hancock said that he was working with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for a UK-wide approach to rules for Christmas.England has been under lockdown for two weeks, which Hancock said was helping to flatten case numbers - an important sign that things are starting to move in the right direction ahead of a decision on Christmas.“There are encouraging signs that the number of cases is starting to flatten, and that the lockdown that we brought in, earlier this month, is working,” Hancock told Sky News.England’s lockdown is due to end on December 2, although ministers have not ruled out that it could be extended.Asked about his own Christmas plans, Hancock said that he was currently planning a small Christmas within the existing rules, but he said he hoped there would be some relaxation, even if some restrictions had to remain.“It of course won’t be like a normal Christmas, there will have to be rules in place,” he said.“But we hope that they’ll allow for a bit more of that normal Christmas that people really look forward to.” (Reporting by Alistair Smout, writing by Sarah Young; Editing by Kate Holton/Guy Faulconbridge)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-may-ease-curbs-for-christmas-as-covid-19-cases-start-flattening/story-YMmi9tPKrFEF5h2CqKIHeO.html

20-11-2020||World||China FM to visit Japan to discuss coronavirus, regional concerns||Japan’s foreign minister announced Friday that his Chinese counterpart will visit Tokyo next week to discuss ways to revive their pandemic-hit economies as well as regional concerns over China’s growing influence.“There are various issues of concern between Japan and China, and it is important that we resolve them one by one through high-level meetings like this,” Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said. “I hope to frankly exchange our views on regional issues, the global expansion of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as other international issues.”During his Nov. 24-25 visit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Motegi are expected to discuss resuming business trips between the world’s No. 2 and No. 3 economies through a “business track” program that would allow visitors to engage in limited business activity during 14-day quarantine periods. Japan recently launched such arrangements with South Korea and Vietnam.Motegi noted that Chinese visitors topped the number of tourists in Japan before the pandemic and said he hoped to discuss how they can resume travel while taking disease prevention measures.He said the two countries are not currently considering rescheduling Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Japan, postponed from the spring due to the pandemic, because they are focusing on their fight against the pandemic.Relations between the two countries have been strained over territorial disputes and wartime history.The visit comes amid growing concerns stemming from China’s increasing influence in the region.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison held talks this week with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga in which they agreed to step up their military partnership and cooperation to promote peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region as a counter to China’s rise.The two countries, along with the U.S. and India, are also trying to bring in Southeast Asian nations and others to join their cooperation, which Beijing has criticized as an attempt to form an “Asian NATO” to counter China.Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters Friday that the vision, known as “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” is not targeting a specific nation and “we plan to achieve it by cooperating with any country that shares the view.”Motegi said a meeting is being arranged between Wang and Suga during his visit, the first with a Japanese prime minister by a top Chinese official since the February visit of Chinese foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi.___Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mariyamaguchi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-fm-to-visit-japan-to-discuss-coronavirus-regional-concerns/story-wZvvFzRNmQUeWlmS68aItK.html
20-11-2020||World||Republicans defending Trump’s ‘bogus’ claims of voter fraud as they are ‘intimidated,’ claims Obama||Barack Obama has voiced concern over the Republican leaders’ attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and said that they are defending President Donald Trump’s “bogus claims” of voter fraud because they are “intimidated” by it. Democrat Joe Biden was declared the winner of the November 3 presidential election, but President Trump, a Republican, has refused to concede defeat and has filed multiple lawsuits, challenging poll results in several states. “I have been troubled, like I think every American, whether you’re a Democrat, a Republican or an independent, should be troubled, when you start having attempts to block, negate, overturn the people’s vote when there’s no actual evidence that there was anything illegal or fraudulent taking place,” former president Obama told MSNBC. He also criticised the conservative-leaning news outlets for giving a platform to Trump’s unsubstantiated claims. “And the degree to which you’ve seen some news outlets that cater to the right and the conservative viewpoint, somehow try to prop up these, you know, bogus claims,” Obama, the first Black American president said. In the last phase of the campaign, Obama had campaigned for former vice president Biden and Kamala Harris Harris in some of the key battleground States of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Georgia. The embattled Trump campaign has challenged vote count in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, among other states. A number of their lawsuits have been dismissed. “They’ve been repeatedly rejected by the courts. I’m less surprised by Trump doing this; he has shown only a flimsy relationship to the truth. I’m more troubled that you’re seeing a lot of Republican officials go along with it, not because they actually believe it but because they’re intimidated by it,” Obama said. Obama said that there is a difference between 2008 and now in 2020. “The way Trump is behaving in transition is very different than the way George Bush behaved in his final months, when he was in office — and because we’re in the middle of a pandemic we don’t know what inauguration is going to look like,” he said. President-elect Biden is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021. “But I think Biden is right to say that we should all make an effort to do our best to lower the temperature and listen to the other side. But, I think when you have a current president whose entire style is to fan division, that’s hard while he’s on the stage,” Obama said. Biden on Thursday won the Republican stronghold of Georgia, becoming the first Democrat to have won the key battleground state since 1992. With Georgia’s 16 electoral votes, Biden will now have 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232. To win the race to the White House, the successful candidate should have at least 270 electoral votes out of the 538-member Electoral College.

The first one, Aghdam, is to be turned over on Friday.Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left not only Nagorno-Karabakh itself but substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands.Heavy fighting that flared up Sept. 27 marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict between the two ex-Soviet nations in over a quarter-century, killing hundreds and possibly thousands of people.The truce last week halted the violence after several failed attempts to establish a lasting cease-fire. It was celebrated as a victory in Azerbaijan, but sparked mass protests in Armenia, with thousands regularly taking to the streets to demand the ouster of the country’s prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/azerbaijani-army-enters-territory-ceded-by-armenian-forces/story-2sJUNyxEBzQVdke3fRbsGO.html
20-11-2020||World||Pakistani cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi dies at 54||Days after signing an agreement with the Pakistan government and calling off a sit-in of his party supporters that had blocked an important junction between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the chief of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party, Khadim Hussain Rizvi, died in Lahore. He was 54. The cause of the Pakistani cleric’s death was not known. Some media reports hinted that he had symptoms similar to that of Covid-19, although that couldn’t be verified.TLP supporters had crippled parts of Islamabad and Rawalpindi last week when they held a sit-in to demand the expulsion of the French ambassador to Pakistan and the recall of his Pakistani counterpart in Paris. The sit-in was called off after Rizvi and ministers from the Imran Khan administration signed an understanding that took note of their demands. However on Thursday, Rizvi was taken ill and died soon after. According to the party’s spokesperson Muhammad Hamza, the TLP chief had been experiencing difficulty in breathing and was running a fever since Wednesday.The spokesperson added that Rizvi was at his madrasa on Multan Road when his condition deteriorated on Thursday evening. He was subsequently rushed to Farooq Hospital in Iqbal town, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. He was later taken to Sheikh Zayed hospital where doctors pronounced him dead.There was some confusion over his death after some reports on social media suggested that Rizvi had resumed breathing and had only been unconscious for a while. A party spokesman confirmed this, but added that soon after, the TLP leader had stopped breathing and was declared dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-cleric-khadim-hussain-rizvi-dies-at-54/story-LS6Ed52NaRvoyif97NR5aP.html
20-11-2020||World||Canada to return 18th century Annapurna statue to India||A stone statue of goddess Annapurna, which may have been stolen and transported to Canada over a century back, will be returned to India. The statue, dating back to the 18th century, was handed over by interim president and vice-chancellor of the University of Regina, Thomas Chase, to India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, in a virtual event that was also attended by officials from Global Affairs Canada and Canada Border Service Agency.The statue is believed to be originally from Varanasi and was part of the university’s collection in its MacKenzie Art Gallery. According to a release from the Indian high commission, the university recently discovered that the Annapurna statue may have been acquired “under suspicious circumstances and did not conform to current principles of ethical acquisition”.Bisaria expressed his gratitude for the proactive action of the university, which is located in the capital of the province of Saskatchewan, and said, “The move to voluntary repatriate such cultural treasures shows the level of maturity and understanding in India-Canada relations.”The statue was added to the gallery’s collection as part of a 1936 bequest by Norman Mackenzie, after whom it is named. That it may have been illegally brought to Canada was first raised by artist Divya Mehra as she was going through the collection while preparing for her exhibition, which began in August this year.According to a statement from the university, Mehra’s research showed that Mackenzie may have brought it back after a trip to India in 1913 after a stranger heard the collector’s “desire to have the statue, and stole it for him from its original location - a shrine at stone steps on the riverbank of the Ganges at Varanasi”.The Annapurna statue was then identified by Dr Siddhartha V Shah, curator of Indian and South Asian Art at the Peabody Essex Museum. Once alerted, the university sought to remedy the century-old wrong. Chase said, “As a university, we have a responsibility to right historical wrongs and help overcome the damaging legacy of colonialism wherever possible. Repatriating this statue does not atone for the wrong that was done a century ago, but it is an appropriate and important act today.”His views were echoed by Alex King, curator-preparator of the University’s president’s art collection, who said, “Today, we conduct due diligence on the provenance of incoming artwork, but will take steps to review objects that have been in our care before such standards were commonplace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-return-18th-century-annapurna-statue-to-india/story-3EQAbghVUq5yWf3vunmpeO.html
20-11-2020||World||Amid US-China trade war, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to meet at virtual Asia Pacific meet||U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping will attend a virtual summit of Asia Pacific leaders on Friday to discuss the coronavirus and global economic recovery, with lingering trade differences likely to cloud the meeting.The pair will be at a meeting of the leaders of the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) hosted virtually by Malaysia just two weeks after Trump lost his re-election bid. Asia Pacific leaders have called for more open and multilateral trade to support the economic recovery, and warned against protectionist trade policies. After coming to power in 2017, Trump slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese products, which launched a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.At the last APEC summit in 2018, member countries failed to agree on a joint communique for the first time in the bloc’s history as the United States and China disagreed on trade and investments.In the run up to Friday’s meeting, several APEC leaders warned against protectionism as the world grapples with the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.“As we confront this generation’s biggest economic challenge, we must not repeat the mistakes of history by retreating into protectionism,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Friday, speaking at the APEC CEO Dialogues. “APEC must continue to commit to keeping markets open and trade flowing.”Xi on Thursday said “mounting unilateralism, protectionism and bullying as well as backlash against economic globalisation” had added to risks and uncertainties in the world economy.He said China will remain committed to multilateralism, openness and cooperation.Other Asia Pacific leaders have also expressed hope that a Joe Biden administration would engage more and support multilateral trade.Japan aims to expand the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Friday, potentially catering for China’s and Britain’s interest in joining the deal.Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, the predecessor to CPTPP. The United States is also absent from the world’s largest free-trade bloc, the Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement (RCEP) - a 15-nation pact backed by China that was signed last week.The Trump administration has been criticised for a lower level of engagement in Asia. The only time he has joined an APEC summit - held annually - was in 2017. Last year’s summit in Chile was cancelled due to violent protests.Trump also missed two virtual Asia meetings last week: the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit and the broader East Asia Summit. Other than working on a joint communique, the APEC leaders are also expected to discuss the bloc’s post-2020 vision, which would replace the 1994 Bogor Goals - a set of targets on reducing barriers to trade and investment - that expire this year.

20-11-2020||World||France turns the screws on Imran Khan, declines upgrade for Mirage, subs and more||France has decided against helping Pakistan upgrade its fleet of Mirage fighter jets, air defence system and Agosta 90B class submarines, a direct fallout of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s loud criticism of French President Emmanuel Macron’s defence of the right to mock religion following the murder of a French schoolteacher, people familiar with the matter said.France has also told Qatar, one of the countries that bought the Rafale fighters, not to allow Pakistan-origin technicians to work with the plane over concerns that they could leak technical information about the fighter to Islamabad as the omni-role jet is the front-line fighter of India. Pakistan is known to share vital defence data with China in the past. Paris has already started putting the asylum requests from Pakistanis under detailed scrutiny in view of the strained ties between the two countries and the stabbing incident outside the former Paris office of the controversial Charlie Hebdo magazine. In September, Ali Hassan, an 18-year-old of Pakistani origin, stabbed two persons with a meat cleaver outside the magazine’s previous office, unaware that the magazine had shifted out. His father, who lives in Pakistan, later told a local news channel that his son had “done a great job” and he is “very happy” about the attack.Watch | France snubs Pakistan, refuses to upgrade Mirage fighter jets, submarines Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla was told about the French government’s decisions when he visited Paris on 29 October after New Delhi criticised the personal attacks on President Macron. France also reassured Shringla that it is very sensitive to security concerns of its strategic ally and had issued directions about keeping Pakistan-origin technicians away from Rafale fighter jet under the export control regime in light of India’s security concerns that has inducted Rafale fighters in the Indian Air Force.The French government’s decision not to upgrade the Mirage III and Mirage 5 fighter jets could severely impact the Pakistan Air Force which has had about 150 Mirage fighter jets manufactured by the French firm Dassault Aviation. Only half of them, however, are serviceable.Pakistan had been buying Mirage jets for decades, some of them discarded by other countries, according to a 2018 AFP report, and has a facility outside Islamabad to refurbish the ageing fighter jets to keep them flying. Diplomats in New Delhi and Paris told Hindustan Times that Pakistan had recently requested France for upgrades to keep the fighter jets in the air. “The request has been declined,” one diplomat in Paris said.A similar request for upgrading the French-Italian air defence system has also been denied.Diplomats said a third request from Pakistan to upgrade its Agosta 90B class submarines with air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems that would allow them to stay underwater for longer has also been rejected by France. Pakistan has three Agosta 90B submarines: Khalid, Saad and Hamza.Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel had earlier turned down a similar request for supply of the AIP systems to upgrade submarines in Pakistan’s inventory due to its role in promoting terror, particularly Islamabad’s failure to cooperate in identifying the perpetrators of the truck bomb attack on the Germany Embassy in Kabul in May 2017.The French government’s decisions came soon after PM Khan, along with close ally Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, led the charge against President Macron after his statement on the beheading of a teacher near the school where he had shown his pupils caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad, considered blasphemous by Muslims.PM Khan followed up on his sharp criticism with an open letter to leaders of Muslim-majority countries that asked them to unite against “growing Islamophobia in non-Muslim states”. Pakistan’s National Assembly went a step further to pass a government-supported resolution that demanded recall of Pakistan’s envoy to Paris. It later realised that Pakistan hadn’t had an ambassador in Paris for three months.On the streets of Pakistan, there have been calls to boycott French goods. Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan, a hard-line Islamist group, which held a sit-in in Islamabad over republishing the caricatures in France, last week revealed that the government had agreed to boycott French goods. The group had made public an agreement with signatures of the federal minister for religious affairs and the interior minister agreeing to the boycott.The sharp criticism from Islamabad and Ankara is a contrast to the muted response from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Egypt, the traditional Sunni world leaders, over President Macron’s effort to take corrective steps in his country. France and Turkey have been on opposite sides elsewhere as well including Libya, Mediterranean, Syria and Nagorno Karabakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-turns-the-screws-on-imran-khan-declines-upgrade-for-mirage-subs-and-more/story-QOPvQYDfvTfwGyJHQY80dN.html
20-11-2020||World||China’s carbon neutrality pledge hurt by new coal power plans, says climate report||China cannot build more coal-fired power plants after 2020 as planned if it wants to honour its pledge to go carbon neutral by 2060, new research by two environmental groups said on Friday.The Chinese government’s plans to build more coal-fired power plants “contradicts” its carbon neutral targets, Draworld Environment Research Centre of Beijing and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Finland said in the report published on Friday.China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, the country’s President Xi Jinping promised at the general debate of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September.“China will scale up its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions by adopting more vigorous policies and measures,” he had said.China is the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gases, accounting for 28% of global emissions.The rise in global emissions in 2019 was almost entirely due to China, which increased its CO2 output by 0.26GtCO2 (Gt: Gigatonnes), according to data published on the website CarbonBrief last year.The new report, published simultaneously from Beijing and Helsinki, titled “China’s carbon neutrality target implies planned coal power expansion cannot go ahead”, questions the lofty promise given Beijing’s plans to build more coal-fired plants.The report points out that China has around 130GW redundant coal power capacity among the total coal-fired capacity of more than 1,000GW. “However, power industry players have advocated for an expansion to 1,300GW or even higher by 2030,” it said.Here’s what needs to be done, according to the report’s authors.“The report’s authors call for China to initiate a policy process to phase out coal-fired power plants. At the same time, the rate of wind and solar power expansion needs to double over the next ten years to fulfill domestic targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” they said.“Short- and medium-term plans to decarbonise the power sector before 2050 are essential to achieve China’s much-lauded objective for carbon neutrality by 2060,” the authors added.Lead author, Dr. Zhang Shuwei, Draworld Environment Research Centre’s chief economist, said, “The proposed expansion of total installed capacity in a sector already riddled with overcapacity and low returns on assets will result in more than 2 trillion RMB of stranded assets during the entire life cycle.”“The policy on coal-fired power plants needs to consider employment and management of state-owned assets to promote a transition to renewable power. A further expansion of the coal-fired power industry would greatly complicate this challenge, requiring a cliff fall of coal power generation after 2030,” Zhang added.China has nearly 250 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power under development, a study published in June had said.New coal project approvals have accelerated in 2020, the joint study by Global Energy Monitor (GEM) and CREA said in June.“While much of the world is moving away from coal, China continues to make it a central part of its energy mix,” said Christine Shearer, coal programme director at GEM in June.The Draworld and CREA report says that power system planning of the “14th five-year Plan” should include a clear signal to at least double the annual rate of renewable energy installations, to more than 100GW annually. The required scale-up of emission-free power has already been envisioned in official documents: China’s 2016 energy strategy proposed that non-fossil fuel sources should account for at least 50% of total electricity generation by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-carbon-neutrality-pledge-hurt-by-new-coal-power-plans-says-climate-report/story-lHY7U2cOZCINLkg7qjR4ON.html
20-11-2020||World||Georgia affirms Joe Biden’s victory as Trump attempts to undermine election||After a painstaking recount, Georgia officials confirmed on Thursday that President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump in the battleground state on Nov. 3, further narrowing the president’s dubious effort to overturn the election results.The result of the six-day hand recount of the state’s 5 million ballots had been widely expected, despite baseless allegations from Trump and his allies that Georgia’s vote tallies were suspect because of widespread fraud.Amid a series of losses in court, Trump’s re-election campaign has shifted to a new strategy that relies on persuading Republican state legislators in crucial states to ignore the election results and intervene on Trump’s behalf, according to three people familiar with the plan.The campaign has filed multiple lawsuits to try to challenge the results in battleground states that Biden won, as election officials across the country have affirmed that there is no evidence of major irregularities. Judges in three states delivered new legal setbacks to the campaign on Thursday, rejecting claims of improper vote counting.Biden, a Democrat, has captured 306 electoral votes to the Republican Trump’s 232 in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner of the election, well above the 270 needed for victory.Georgia’s audit, launched after unofficial results showed Biden leading Trump by about 14,000 votes cast, ended with Biden winning by 12,284, according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office. The state is expected to certify Biden’s victory on Friday.Trump and his allies, including Georgia’s Republican U.S. senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who both face runoff elections in January, have accused fellow Republican Raffensperger without evidence of overseeing a flawed election, an allegation Raffensperger has angrily disputed.In remarks on Thursday after a call with 10 state governors, Biden called Trump’s attempt to reverse the results “totally irresponsible.”“It sends a horrible message about who we are as a country,” said the president-elect, although he expressed no concern that the gambit would succeed in preventing him from taking office on Jan. 20.While legal experts see Trump’s last-gasp effort as unlikely to succeed, they say the strategy represents an unprecedented assault on the country’s democratic institutions by a sitting president.The Trump campaign has already asked a judge in Pennsylvania, where Biden won by 82,000 votes, to declare Trump the winner, allowing the Republican-controlled legislature to choose the state’s 20 Electoral College voters.Several prominent law firms have pulled out of the campaign’s legal challenges, leaving Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to spearhead the efforts.GIULIANI ALLEGES CONSPIRACYAt a news conference on Thursday, Giuliani said he planned to file more lawsuits and that Democrats had engaged in a “national conspiracy” to manipulate vote totals, although he admitted he did not have any evidence.Other members of the legal team floated a theory involving Venezuela and George Soros, a bogeyman of conservatives, although they said they would probably not pursue it in court.Giuliani said accounts of suspicious activity would ultimately overturn the election, which Biden won nationwide by 5.9 million votes. Some of those accounts have already been thrown out of court.“We cannot allow these crooks - because that’s what they are - to steal this election. They elected Donald Trump. They didn’t elect Joe Biden,” Giuliani said.Giuliani’s agitated performance, featuring rivulets of hair dye running down his face, was widely mocked by Democrats. Others expressed alarm.“That press conference was the most dangerous 1hr 45 minutes of television in American history,” tweeted Christopher Krebs, who headed up the U.S. government’s efforts to combat election disinformation until he was fired by Trump earlier this week.‘NO EXCUSE’Critics say Trump’s refusal to concede has serious implications for national security and the fight against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 250,000 Americans.Biden is not receiving the classified intelligence due a president-elect, and his transition team has not received the funding, office space and briefings from current government officials normally afforded to an incoming administration.He warned the delay could cause additional deaths as the pandemic surges to record levels across the country.“There is no excuse not to share the data and let us begin to plan, because on Day One it’s going to take us time, if we don’t have access to all this data,” he said in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. “It’s going to put us behind the eight ball by a matter of a month or more, and that’s lives.”The former vice president has focused on preparing his incoming administration, naming senior staff members and getting briefed by his advisers. He said on Thursday he had selected a Treasury secretary and could announce his pick as soon as next week.Democratic leaders in Congress sent a letter on Thursday to the administrator in charge of releasing transition funds, Emily Murphy, demanding that she explain why she has yet to recognize Biden as president-elect.Part of the new Trump campaign effort involves trying to delay certification, the normally routine process by which election results are finalized, a senior campaign official said.In Detroit on Tuesday, Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers refused at first to certify the results, then reversed themselves, then signed affidavits that they wanted to rescind their certification.One of the members told Reuters that Trump called her after she agreed to certify the results.Trump’s campaign dropped a federal lawsuit on Thursday challenging the election results in Michigan, citing the Wayne County officials’ affidavits. Officials said the affidavits were too late to stop certification.Republican legislative leaders from Michigan are scheduled to visit the White House on Friday at Trump’s request, a source in Michigan said, adding the lawmakers planned to hear what the president had to say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-affirms-joe-biden-s-victory-as-trump-attempts-to-undermine-election/story-Ztc014NteYsE8AwA6MgXcL.html

This modus operandi, Interpol said, can also be used to target other vulnerable groups.The international agency did not mention any specific instances of contaminated letters sent to politicians.Interpol said certain individuals may deliberately move from Covid-19 affected areas to non-affected areas despite their medical condition and travel restrictions.It said that instances of individuals claiming to sell contaminated samples of body fluids online have also been reported.Interpol has said that those in-charge of protecting prominent public figures should be made aware of these risks and specialised cyber-crime or counter-terrorism investigators should pay particular attention to online market places.It said postal and front-desk services should be informed of biological threats posed by suspicious packages and follow the regular protection measures.Interpol has also warned that malware and ransomware campaigns infecting computer systems of individuals are currently on rise. It added cyber-criminals were targeting sites where system access or data is critical for the deployment of ransomware.It said criminals are using health related equipment or services business to cover up suspicious transactions to integrate their ill-gotten money into the legal economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/letters-contaminated-with-covid-19-likely-to-be-sent-to-political-leaders-says-interpol/story-itY2M8WS53O7CNslrj1IwL.html
20-11-2020||World||Pfizer and BioNTech to seek emergency Covid-19 vaccine approval in US Friday||An emergency use authorization request for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech was expected to be filed with the FDA on Friday, the US government and BioNTech’s co-founder said.This type of Food and Drug Administration authorization is temporary or conditional and is granted in response to an emergency situation such as a pandemic.“Pfizer’s partner BioNTech has announced that tomorrow they intend to file for emergency use authorization at the FDA,” health secretary Alex Azar told a press conference Thursday in Washington.Click here for latest updates on coronavirus here BioNTech co-founder Ugur Sahin earlier told AFP in a Zoom interview: “The documents will be finalized today and tomorrow and submitted to the FDA.”The FDA did not say how long it would take to review the data on vaccine efficacy and safety, the two main criteria. The scientific head of the US operation to develop a vaccine, Moncef Slaoui said Monday that the green light would probably come in December -- a timeframe echoed by Sahin.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageHe told AFP there is a chance they could receive the green light from the US “this year,” and even starting delivering the vaccine by December.The BioNTech/Pfizer shot and another one being developed by US firm Moderna have taken the lead in the global chase for a vaccine, after large-scale trial data this month showed that their jabs were around 95 percent effective against Covid-19.The twin breakthroughs have lifted hopes for an end to a pandemic that has infected more than 56 million people and caused over 1.3 million deaths worldwide since the virus first emerged in China late last year.“We would expect to see Moderna filing soon also,” Azar said at the press conference.The US, the European Union and a slew of other nations have already placed orders for hundreds of millions of doses of the top vaccine candidates in development.Health workers, carers and people considered at high risk for severe Covid-19 are set to be first in line for the jabs. ‘This is really solid’ Both vaccines are based relatively new technology that uses a synthetic version of a molecule called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.No vaccine based on this platform has ever been approved.The speed at which the vaccines have been developed has raised alarm in some quarters. Traditional virus vaccines use actual viruses that can take months or years to develop.But top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci sought to dispell those concerns during a rare briefing by the White House task force Thursday. “The process of the speed did not compromise at all safety nor did it compromise scientific integrity. It was a reflection of the extraordinary scientific advances in these types of vaccines which allowed us to do things in months that actually took years before,” Fauci said.“It was actually an independent body of people who have no allegiance to anyone -- not to the administration, not to me, not to the companies -- that looked at the data and deemed it to be sound,” he continued.“So we need to put to rest any concept that this was rushed in an inappropriate way. This is really solid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-and-biontech-to-seek-emergency-covid-19-vaccine-approval-in-us-friday/story-W1h5FG5E1DBSF96ADaVFPL.html

20-11-2020||World||In one of world’s toughest lockdown in South Australia, only one family member allowed to leave home||South Australia began one of the world’s toughest lockdowns Thursday with even outdoor exercise and dog-walking banned as the state tries to contain a cluster of Covid-19 infections.For six days, only one person from a household will be allowed to leave home each day, and only for essential reasons, authorities said. Schools, universities, cafes and restaurants are closed, weddings and funerals are banned and mask-wearing is mandatory.“We want to go hard, go early, but get out of it as quickly as we can,” State Premier Steven Marshall said of the measures.Twenty-three people in the state capital Adelaide have been infected after a cleaner at a hotel used to quarantine people arriving from overseas was exposed to the virus, and health authorities say the “circuit breaker” measures are necessary to avoid a wider outbreak.Marshall said the strain of the virus that’s circulating is “nasty” as many of those infected are not showing any symptoms. He said it was highly likely to be transmitted from surfaces and that the incubation period was as low as 24 hours.“It’s a real worry, especially because people who become infected are not showing the typical symptoms that we are used to,” he said.The state of 1.7 million people, who are spread out over a landmass five times the size of the UK, had largely eradicated community transmission of the virus after a nationwide lockdown earlier this year.The cluster, and a more severe outbreak in neighboring Victoria state that triggered a three-month lockdown in the city of Melbourne, show that ongoing vigilance is required to control the virus -- even in a nation that has been spared the scale of infections and deaths experienced in Europe and the U.S.Victoria is proof that hard lockdowns do work. The state, which saw a daily peak of around 700 infections in August, has now gone 20 days without new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-one-of-world-s-toughest-lockdown-in-south-australia-only-one-family-member-allowed-to-leave-home/story-4SjpQJlJQWjwvqztIeceLN.html
20-11-2020||World||Covid-19 could disrupt global recovery, says IMF director||The head of the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that the while the United States and other major economies turned in better-than-expected economic performances in the third quarter, the world now faces slower momentum with a resurgence in coronavirus cases.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a note prepared for a virtual meeting of the leaders of the Group of 20 major economies that significant progress on the vaccines raised “hopes of vanquishing the virus that has taken more than a million lives and caused tens of millions of job losses” around the world.The G-20 virtual leaders summit, which Saudi Arabia is conducting this week in its role as this year’s head of the G-20, will focus on efforts to stabilise the global economy and hopefully, foster a rebound next year.Last month, the IMF forecast that the global economy would contract by an historic 4.4% this year and then mount a partial and uneven recovery, with global growth rebounding by 5.2% next year.“While a medical solution is now in sight, the economic path ahead remains difficult and prone to setbacks,” Georgieva said. Many risks remain, including the threat that new outbreaks may require more stringent shutdowns, she said.Such a development, she wrote in her memo to accompany the IMF’s G-20 surveillance report, would mean that “growth will be lower, public debt higher and the scars on the long-term potential of the economy more severe.” It is important that governments avoid a premature withdrawal of economic support, Georgieva said. She recommended that major economies consider a synchronized investment in infrastructure as a way to provide jobs.“The bottom line is that we can build the impetus for growth, jobs and address climate change far more effectively if we work together,” she wrote.The G-20 leaders’ summits were begun in 2008 in an effort to find ways for the world’s major economies to cooperate to address the global downturn that occurred after the 2008 financial crisis pushed the global economy into a deep recession.In addition to traditional economic powers like the US, Japan, Germany, France and Britain, the G-20 includes major developing countries such as China and India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-disrupt-global-recovery-says-imf-director/story-8MjZ35T7w1lELOcwjQtRWK.html

Oxford is developing its vaccine in conjunction with the drugmaker AstraZeneca.“I think we’re getting close, and it’s definitely going to be before Christmas based on the progress,” Pollard said in an interview with the BBC.Two other drugmakers, Pfizer and Moderna, this week reported preliminary results from late-stage trials showing that their Covid-19 vaccines were almost 95% effective.Pollard said there is no competition between the various research teams, because several vaccines will be needed to bring the global pandemic under control and allow life to return to normal.Despite recent progress, Pollard said the world is still in the early stages of the effort to protect people against Covid-19. Even after vaccines are approved by regulators, drugmakers and public health officials still face the task of producing billions of doses and administering them to people around the world, he said.Pollard, an amateur mountaineer, compared the task to the work involved in climbing a mountain.“I think we’re still at the bottom of that mountain in some ways,” he said. “We’ve done the route into the bottom of the mountain, the long trek to get to the start. Now we’ve got to get the data about the vaccines in front of regulators for them to scrutinise it and approve the first vaccines. And then we’ve got that huge effort to climb up to the top where we’ve got a vast majority of those who are at risk vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-scientists-expect-covid-19-vaccine-data-by-christmas/story-4mRdHwlq5l2zLwpJiQ4QPK.html
20-11-2020||World||Conspiracy film about vaccines grabs eyeballs||A controversial documentary film questioning the purpose of coronavirus vaccines has gone viral in France after endorsements from politicians and celebrities, some of whom later withdrew their support.Hold Up got more than 4 million views on Google’s YouTube and other platforms over a couple of days last week, helped along on social media by public figures including lawmakers, former first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy and actor Sophie Marceau.Suspicions over the safety and effectiveness of vaccines are widespread in France. In a study released this week by the think tank Fondation Jean-Jaures, 43% of respondents said they would refuse to get a shot - 7% more than in the US, and twice as many as in the UK.The video, which is more than two hours long, suggests the global response to Covid-19 is a plot hatched by big drug companies and governments to create a surveillance state and a submissive population.The film has echoes of the English-language documentary Plandemic that also went viral earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/conspiracy-film-about-vaccines-grabs-eyeballs/story-4apstNUxG6crDoViozaq6I.html
20-11-2020||World||WHO advises against Gilead’s Remdesivir for all hospitalised Covid-19 patients||Gilead’s drug Remdesivir is not recommended for patients hospitalised with Covid-19, regardless of how ill they are, as there is no evidence it improves survival or reduces the need for ventilation, a World Health Organization panel said on Friday.“The ... panel found a lack of evidence that Remdesivir improved outcomes that matter to patients such as reduced mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, time to clinical improvement, and others,” the guideline said.The advice is another setback for the drug, which grabbed worldwide attention as a potentially effective treatment for Covid-19 in the summer after early trials showed some promise.At the end of October, Gilead cut its 2020 revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand and difficulty in predicting sales of Remdesivir .The antiviral is one of only two medicines currently authorised to treat Covid-19 patients across the world, but a large WHO-led trial known as the Solidarity Trial showed last month that it had little or no effect on 28-day mortality or length of hospital stays for Covid-19 patients.The medication was one of the drugs used to treat US President Donald Trump’s coronavirus infection, and had been shown in previous studies to have cut time to recovery. It is authorised or approved for use as a Covid-19 treatment in more than 50 countries.Gilead has questioned the Solidarity Trial’s results.The WHO’s Guideline Development Group (GDG) panel said its recommendation was based on an evidence review that included data from four international randomised trials involving more than 7,000 patients hospitalised with Covid-19.After reviewing the evidence, the panel said, it concluded that Remdesivir , which has to be given intravenously and is therefore costly and complex to administer, has no meaningful effect on death rates or other important outcomes for patients.“Especially given the costs and resource implications associated with Remdesivir ...the panel felt the responsibility should be on demonstrating evidence of efficacy, which is not established by the currently available data,” it added.The latest WHO advice comes after one of the world’s top bodies representing intensive care doctors said the antiviral should not be used for Covid-19 patients in critical care wards.The WHO’s recommendation, which is not binding, is part of its so-called “living guidelines” project, designed to offer guidance for doctors to help them make clinical decisions about patients in fast-moving situations such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The guidelines can be updated and reviewed as new evidence and information emerges.The panel said, however, that it supported continued enrolment into clinical trials evaluating Remdesivir in patients with COVID-19, which it said should “provide higher certainty of evidence for specific groups of patients”.The recommendation may raise further questions about whether the European Union will need the 500,000 courses of the antiviral worth 1 billion euros it ordered last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-advises-against-gilead-s-remdesivir-for-all-hospitalised-covid-19-patients/story-GfooFQ9QGdpWSTw2VbJJ3N.html
20-11-2020||World||Douglas Stuart wins 2020 Booker Prize; Avni Doshi misses out||Scottish writer Douglas Stuart, whose debut novel ‘Shuggie Bain’ described a boy growing up in Glasgow in the 1980s with a mother battling addiction, has won the 2020 Booker Prize for Fiction from a six-member shortlist that included Indian-origin writer Avni Doshi’s ‘Burnt Sugar’.The awards ceremony was broadcast on BBC with the six authors joining virtually. The event included messages from former US President Barack Obama, the Duchess of Cornwall and former Booker winners Kazuo Ishiguro, Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo.Stuart, 44, who won the £50,000 prize after being announced the winner by chair of the judges Margaret Busby, delivered an acceptance speech and received a trophy, a designer-bound edition of his book and a further £2,500 for being shortlisted.Based on his own childhood, Stuart’s book is described as a searing account of the boy growing up in Thatcher’s Glasgow. He dedicated the book to his own mother, who died of alcoholism when he was 16.After graduating from the Royal College of Art, he moved to New York to start a career in fashion design, and started writing in his spare time a decade ago. His work has since appeared in LitHub and in The New Yorker, which has published two of his short stories this year. He is currently finishing his second novel, Loch Awe, also set in Glasgow.Busby, editor, literary critic and former publisher, said: “‘Shuggie Bain is destined to be a classic — a moving, immersive and nuanced portrait of a tight-knit social world, its people and its values. The heart-wrenching story tells of the unconditional love between Agnes Bain — set on a descent into alcoholism by the tough circumstances life has dealt her — and her youngest son”.“Shuggie struggles with responsibilities beyond his years to save his mother from herself, at the same time as dealing with burgeoning feelings and questions about his own otherness. Gracefully and powerfully written, this is a novel that has impact because of its many emotional registers and its compassionately realised characters”, she added.Obama said in his message: “I’ve always turned to writing to make sense of our world … And at their best Booker Prize listed books remind me of fiction’s power to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes, understand their struggles, and imagine new ways to tackle complex problems and effect change”.The 2020 shortlist was: The New Wilderness by Diane Cook (Oneworld Publications); This Mournable Body by Tsitsi Dangarembga (Faber & Faber); Burnt Sugar by Avni Doshi (Hamish Hamilton, Penguin Random House); The Shadow King by Maaza Mengiste (Canongate Books); Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart (Picador, Pan Macmillan); Real Life by Brandon Taylor (Originals, Daunt Books Publishing).First awarded in 1969, The Booker Prize is considered one of the leading prizes for literary fiction written in English. The list of former winners features several of the literary giants of the last five decades: from Iris Murdoch to Salman Rushdie, Kazuo Ishiguro to Hilary Mantel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/douglas-stuart-wins-2020-booker-prize-avni-doshi-misses-out/story-AO1GvCDs0TYpYZzYmmshHL.html
20-11-2020||World||Donald Trump, allies make frantic steps to overturn Joe Biden victory||President Donald Trump and his allies are taking increasingly frantic steps to subvert the results of the 2020 election, including summoning state legislators to the White House as part of a longshot bid to overturn Joe Biden’s victory.Among other last-ditch tactics: personally calling local election officials who are trying to rescind their certification votes in Michigan, suggesting in a legal challenge that Pennsylvania set aside the popular vote there and pressuring county officials in Arizona to delay certifying vote tallies.Election law experts see it as the last, dying gasps of the Trump campaign and say Biden is certain to walk into the Oval Office come January. But there is great concern that Trump’s effort is doing real damage to public faith in the integrity of US elections.“It’s very concerning that some Republicans apparently can’t fathom the possibility that they legitimately lost this election,” said Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky who researches and teaches election law.“We depend on democratic norms, including that the losers graciously accept defeat,” he said. “That seems to be breaking down.”Trump’s own election security agency has declared the 2020 presidential election to have been the most secure in history. Days after that statement was issued, Trump fired the agency’s leader.The increasingly desperate and erratic moves are not expected to change the outcome of the 2020 election, where Biden has now received more votes than any other presidential candidate in history and has clinched the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.But the president’s constant barrage of baseless claims, his work to personally sway local officials who certify votes and his allies’ refusal to admit he lost is likely to have a lasting negative impact on the country. Legions of his supporters don’t believe he lost.Also Read: Trump’s lawyer alleges voter fraud in ‘big cities’, says loss in Pennsylvania ‘statistically impossible’“It’s about trying to set up the conditions where half of the country believes that there are only two possibilities, either they win or the election was stolen,” said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law scholar and professor at Loyola Law School. “And that’s not a democracy.”The two GOP canvassers in Michigan’s Wayne County said in a statement Thursday they lacked confidence that the election was fair and impartial. “There has been a distinct lack of transparency throughout the process,” they said. But there has been no evidence of impropriety or fraud in Michigan, election officials have said.Trump’s allies have homed in on the way that the president’s early lead in Michigan and some other states on Election Night slipped away as later votes came, casting it as evidence of something nefarious.But a massive influx of mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic leaned largely to Biden, who encouraged his supporters to vote by mail, and those votes were the last to be counted. So it appeared Trump had an edge when he really didn’t.In fact, Biden crushed Trump in Wayne County, a Democratic stronghold that includes Detroit, by a more than 2-1 margin on his way to winning Michigan by 146,000 votes, according to unofficial results.Earlier this week, the county’s two Republicans canvassers blocked the certification of votes there. They later relented and the results were certified. But a person familiar with the matter said Trump reached out to the canvassers, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, on Tuesday evening after the revised vote to express gratitude for their support. Then, on Wednesday, Palmer and Hartmann signed affidavits saying they believed the county vote “should not be certified.”They cannot rescind their votes, according to the Michigan secretary of state. The four-member state canvassing board is expected to meet Monday and also is split with two Democrats and two Republicans.Trump appears intent on pushing the issue. He has invited Michigan’s Republican legislative leaders, Senate Majority Mike Shirkey and House Speaker Lee Chatfield, to the White House, according to two officials familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. The two have agreed to go, according to one official, but they haven’t commented publicly, and it’s not clear what the purpose of the meeting is.The Michigan Legislature would be called on to select electors if Trump succeeded in convincing the state’s board of canvassers not to certify Biden’s 153,000-vote victory in the state. But both legislative leaders have indicated they will not try to overturn Biden’s win.“Michigan law does not include a provision for the Legislature to directly select electors or to award electors to anyone other than the person who received the most votes,” Shirkey’s spokeswoman said last week.During a press conference in Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday, Biden said Americans are “witnessing incredible irresponsibility, incredibly damaging messages are being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions.”“I just think it’s totally irresponsible.”A few hours earlier, Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and others had held a press conference to allege a widespread Democratic election conspiracy involving multiple states and suspect voting machines. But election officials across the country have said repeatedly there was no widespread fraud.Many of the allegations of fraud stem from poll watchers who filed affidavits included with lawsuits in battleground states aimed at delaying vote certification. Those affidavits lean into innuendo and unsupported suggestions of fraud.For example, they refer to suitcases in a polling place, but make no suggestion that ballots were being secretly counted. There are allegations of ballots being duplicated — something routinely done when a ballot is physically damaged. There are claims that partisan poll watchers were too far away to observe well and therefore something fishy was probably going on. But they don’t have proof. Poll watchers have no auditing role in elections; they are volunteer observers.Also Read: Why is President Trump pursuing recount of 2 Wisconsin counties?Giuliani cited a few sworn affidavits that he said showed a vast Democratic conspiracy, but added that he could not reveal much of the evidence. One he cited was from Jessy Jacob, identified as a city employee in Detroit who said she saw other workers coaching voters to cast ballots for Biden and the Democrats.A judge who refused to block certification of Detroit-area results noted that Jacob’s claims included no “date, location, frequency or names of employees” and that she only came forward after unofficial results indicated Biden had won Michigan.Trump legal adviser Jenna Ellis, who joined Giuliani, said more evidence would be forthcoming and that Trump’s allies would have more success in courts going forward. But so far, most of their legal actions have been dismissed.Chris Krebs, the Trump administration election official fired last week over the comments about the security of 2020, tweeted: “That press conference was the most dangerous 1hr 45 minutes of television in American history. And possibly the craziest.”In Pennsylvania, where the Trump campaign is challenging the election results in federal court, a legal team led by Giuliani suggested in a filing Wednesday that the judge order the Republican-led state legislature to pick delegates to the Electoral College, potentially throwing the state’s 20 electoral votes to Trump. A judge canceled an evidentiary hearing in the case.In Arizona, the Republican Party is pressuring county officials to delay certifying results. The GOP lost a bid on Thursday to postpone certification in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous. In northwestern Arizona, Mohave County officials postponed their certification until next week.Judge John Hannah ruled without explanation, except to bar the party from refiling the case. The judge promised a full explanation in the future.Maricopa County officials are expected to certify elections results on Friday.Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes, and Maricopa County put him over the top. The county performed a hand count of some ballots the weekend after the election, which showed its machine counts were 100% accurate. The same was found Wednesday during routine post-election accuracy tests.In Georgia, where officials have been auditing the results of the presidential race, Trump has repeatedly attacked the process and called it “a joke.”He has also made repeated incorrect assertions that Georgia election officials are unable to verify signatures on absentee ballot envelopes. In fact, Georgia requires that they be checked.The secretary of state’s office planned to release results of the audit on Thursday.During the hand tally, several counties found previously uncounted ballots that the secretary of state’s office has said would reduce Biden’s lead to just under 13,000 votes, with roughly 5 million total votes cast. Georgia law allows a candidate to request a recount within two business days of certification if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. That recount would be done using machines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-allies-make-frantic-steps-to-overturn-joe-biden-victory/story-aUgiD7iFs28lcWDe8MdxOJ.html

Past and future cyber operations have and will continue to operate under existing laws, including those granted by the Intelligence Services Act and the Investigatory Powers Act.General Patrick Sanders of Strategic Command, which leads on cyber, intelligence, special forces and information capabilities for Defence, said: “Just over 100 years ago we created a new force to defend the UK from threats in a new domain – the air”.“Today’s announcement of the formation of the National Cyber Force to defend the UK in cyberspace marks a similar milestone and the imperative is just as vital because cyberspace is the most contested domain where our adversaries and our allies will meet over the next decade and beyond”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-16-5-billion-push-ramps-up-uk-s-offensive-cyber-capabilities/story-qlUTwdJE7Wp05k2XVZLR4H.html

I think that would be counterproductive,” Biden, who takes office on January 20, told reporters, according to news agency AFP. The United States continues to be the worst hit country from the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Worldometer figures, 12,017,723 people have been infected whereas over 250,000 have died so far. New York has the maximum number of deaths due to the disease followed by Texas, California and Florida. Biden on Wednesday highlighted that a range of information had not been made available to his campaign, including the distribution plan for coronavirus vaccines.Also Read: CDC recommends Americans don’t travel for Thanksgiving to limit spread of CovidOn Thursday, Democratic senator Chris Murphy said that officials from President Donald Trump’s vaccine distribution effort have not briefed anyone on Biden’s transition team and have no plans to do so. “Just off a conference call with Trump Administration vaccine distribution team. They confirmed that they have not briefed anyone on President-elect Biden’s team and have no plans to do so. This is potentially catastrophic,” Murphy tweeted. Meanwhile, The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended citizens to not travel during the Thanksgiving holiday to curb the spread of coronavirus. The travel recommendation is a “strong recommendation,” not a requirement, a CDC official said. Thanksgiving along with Christmas is the busiest time for domestic travel across the country.

The White House declined to say on Wednesday whether President Donald Trump plans to address the gathering in Malaysia, held virtually this year because of the pandemic.“We will not reverse course or run against the historical trend by decoupling or forming a small circle to keep others out,” Xi said by video. “Opening up to the outside world is a basic national policy, and it will not waver at any time.”Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said after Xi that a US government led by Biden was more likely to adopt a multilateral approach to trade that was supportive of existing international institutions and forums. Lee, whose city-state is dependent on trade as well as US security support, took a swipe Trump’s at “America First” economic policies.“They have not been supportive of trade as a win-win proposition,” Lee said. “The attitude of the Trump administration is that this is a win-lose proposition: ‘If I have a trade surplus with you, that is good for me. If I have a trade deficit with you, that is bad for me.’ Trade is not like that.”Prime Ministers Scott Morrison of Australia, Yoshihide Suga of Japan and Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand were among those expected to speak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-we-will-avoid-decoupling-despite-tensions/story-K3hFWHV0Hr6zCRXnoRUXdL.html

She urged people to take measures to prevent the spread of the deadly disease, but didn’t yet ask businesses to curtail activities.Across the Pacific, US deaths from Covid-19 surpassed 250,000, marking a grim milestone as the nation struggles to contain a new surge in cases. New York City said it will shut all schools after coronavirus infections crossed a critical threshold. New York state has the most US fatalities, at more than 34,000. Texas is second, followed by California and Florida.There was alarm and caution in the southern hemisphere as well. South Australia began one of the world’s toughest lockdowns, with even outdoor exercise and dog-walking banned as the state tries to contain a cluster of Covid-19 infections.In Tokyo, new coronavirus cases reached 534 on Thursday, taking the cumulative total to 36,256. Japan’s daily Covid-19 cases rose to a record of more than 2,000 on Wednesday. Japan’s capital raised its Covid-19 alert to the highest of four levels, as daily infections topped 500 for the first time. New York’s recovery from the outbreak suffered twin blows with the announcement of citywide school closings and the warning of massive cuts to public-transit service. Parents of hundreds of thousands of kids must find alternative arrangements by Thursday, after mayor Bill de Blasio said the city had reached a 3% positivity rate that triggered a temporary halt to in-class instruction.Russia has resumed the vaccination of new volunteers in its trial for its Sputnik V vaccine after a short pause as Moscow moves to accelerate plans to inoculate the population. It comes as Russia topped 2 million Covid-19 infections, pushing its hospital system to the brink.As coronavirus cases surge across West Asia, the regional director for the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday the only way to avoid mass deaths is for countries to quickly tighten restrictions.In a press briefing from Cairo, Ahmed al-Mandhari, director of WHO’s eastern Mediterranean region, which comprises most of West Asia, expressed concern that countries in the area were lowering their guard.The fundamentals of pandemic response, from social distancing to mask wearing, “are still not being fully practised in our region”, he lamented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-deaths-top-250-000-tokyo-on-high-alert-as-covid-19-cases-soar/story-uFLDWZpFttWYWFmTPAfyRO.html

An additional 12 million user posts were removed entirely from Facebook and Instagram for Covid-19 misinformation that the company believed could lead to immediate physical harm.The numbers were disclosed Thursday alongside Facebook’s quarterly Community Standards report, which details how much content the company removes for rule violations. Misinformation appears to be Facebook’s most widespread problem, though the company removed or labeled millions of posts in other categories as well, including bullying, harassment and spam.Facebook also divulged the prevalence of hate speech on its service for the first time. The company estimates that hate speech content accounts for 0.11% of all content views on the service. Facebook is often criticized for its handling of hate speech and other offensive content, but the company said it removed or labeled 22.1 million posts about hate speech in the third quarter, and detected roughly 95% of those posts before users reported them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-tagged-167-million-user-posts-for-covid-19-misinformation/story-wgaEwy8tPnbEFyAQjOabkM.html
20-11-2020||World||National Science Foundation announces closure of huge radio telescope at Puerto Rico||The National Science Foundation announced Thursday that it will close the huge telescope at the renowned Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico in a blow to scientists worldwide who depend on it to search for planets, asteroids and extraterrestrial life.The independent, federally funded agency said it’s too dangerous to keep operating the single dish radio telescope -- one of the world’s largest -- given the significant damage it recently sustained. An auxiliary cable broke in August and tore a 100-foot hole in the reflector dish and damaged the dome above it. Then on Nov. 6, one of the telescope’s main steel cables snapped, leading officials to warn that the entire structure could collapse.NSF officials noted that even if crews were to repair all the damage, engineers found that the structure would still be unstable in the long term.“This decision is not an easy one for NSF to make, but the safety of people is our number one priority,” said Sean Jones, the agency’s assistant director for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. “We understand how much Arecibo means to this community and to Puerto Rico.”He said the goal was to preserve the telescope without placing people at risk, but, “we have found no path forward to allow us to do so safely.”The telescope was built in the 1960s with money from the Defense Department amid a push to develop anti-ballistic missile defenses. In its 57 years of operation, it endured hurricanes, endless humidity and a recent string of strong earthquakes.The telescope boasts a 1,000-foot-wide (305-meter-wide) dish featured in the Jodie Foster film “Contact” and the James Bond movie “GoldenEye.” Scientists worldwide have used the dish along with the 900-ton platform hanging 450 feet above it to track asteroids on a path to Earth, conduct research that led to a Nobel Prize and determine if a planet is potentially habitable.In recent years, the NSF-owned facility has been managed by the University of Central Florida.Alex Wolszczan, a Polish-born astronomer and professor at Pennsylvania State University who helped discover the first extrasolar and pulsar planets, told The Associated Press that while the news wasn’t surprising, it was disappointing. He worked at the telescope in the 1980s and early 1990s.“I was hoping against hope that they would come up with some kind of solution to keep it open,” he said. “For a person who has had a lot of his scientific life associated with that telescope, this is a rather interesting and sadly emotional moment.”The announcement saddened many beyond the scientific world as well, with the hashtag #WhatAreciboMeansToMe popping up on Twitter along with pictures of people working, visiting and even getting married or celebrating a birthday at the telescope.Ralph Gaume, director of NSF’s Division of Astronomical Sciences, stressed that the decision has nothing to do with the observatory’s capabilities, which have allowed scientists to study pulsars to detect gravitational waves as well as search for neutral hydrogen, which can reveal how certain cosmic structures are formed.“The telescope is currently at serious risk of unexpected, uncontrolled collapse,” he said. “Even attempts at stabilization or testing the cables could result in accelerating the catastrophic failure.”Officials suspect a potential manufacturing error is to blame for the auxiliary cable that snapped after a socket holding it failed, but say they are surprised that a main cable broke about three months later given that it was supporting only about 60% of its capacity. Engineers had assessed the situation after the first cable broke, noting that about 12 of the roughly 160 wires of the second cable that eventually broke had already snapped, said Ashley Zauderer, program officer for Arecibo Observatory at NSF.“It was identified as an issue that needed to be addressed, but it wasn’t seen as an immediate threat,” she said.She and other NSF officials said that all standard maintenance procedures had been followed.The closure is a blow for many of the more than 250 scientists that have used a telescope that is also considered one of Puerto Rico’s main tourist attractions, drawing some 90,000 visitors a year. It also has long served as a training ground for hundreds of graduate students.“It was my Disney,” wrote Edgard Rivera-Valentín, a Universities Space Research Association scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Texas, in a series of tweets. He recalled first visiting when he was 4 or 5.“Think about what the Golden Gate Bridge means to San Francisco, Statue of Liberty to New Yorkers. Arecibo is this and more to Puerto Rico because it has gone beyond an icon.”The NSF said it intends to restore operations at the observatory’s remaining assets including its two LIDAR facilities, one of which is located in the nearby island of Culebra. Those are used for upper atmospheric and ionospheric research, including analyzing cloud cover and precipitation data. Officials also aim to resume operations at the visitor center.Wolszczan, the astronomer, said the value of the telescope won’t instantly disappear because he and many other scientists are still working on projects based on observations and data taken from the observatory.“The process of saying goodbye to Arecibo will certainly take some years,” he said. “It won’t be instantaneous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-science-foundation-announces-closure-of-huge-radio-telescope-at-puerto-rico/story-w2jzixla4NcLrH7OEpKSxL.html
20-11-2020||World||US Senator Chris Murphy says Donald Trump’s vaccine team have no plans to brief Joe Biden’s team||Officials from President Donald Trump’s vaccine distribution effort have not briefed anyone on President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team, and have no plans to do so, a Democratic US senator said after a White House call Thursday.“Just off a conference call with Trump Administration vaccine distribution team,” Senator Chris Murphy said on Twitter. “They confirmed that they have not briefed anyone on President-elect Biden’s team and have no plans to do so. This is potentially catastrophic.”The call, for all senators, was conducted on Thursday morning by General Gustave Perna and Dr. Moncef Slaoui, leaders of “Operation Warp Speed,” the administration’s vaccine-development effort, a Congressional aide said.Asked for comment, White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern did not address whether Biden’s team would be briefed, saying vaccine distribution plans from the Centers for Disease Control and state governors were publicly available.“Manufacturing is well underway, and Dr. Slaoui confirmed that 20 million Americans are on track for vaccinations in December with tens of millions per month thereafter,” Morgenstern said.A wave of coronavirus infection has gripped the United States and the death toll surpassed 250,000 this week. A vaccine may be available in the coming months, but distributing it to over 300 million Americans might be complicated by special storage and transport conditions.Biden said on Wednesday that a range of information had not been made available to his campaign, including the distribution plan for Covid-19 vaccines. His administration is scheduled to take over the US government on Jan. 20, when he is inaugurated.Failure to promptly share critical Covid-19 data with Biden’s team will cause needless, deadly delays in tackling the pandemic, leaders of the US medical establishment said in a letter to Trump Tuesday.Biden’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Emily Murphy, administrator of the General Services Administration, a generally little-known agency that keeps the US government running, has so far refused to “ascertain” the winner of the Nov. 3 presidential election between Biden and Trump, a condition for releasing funds and resources to the winner.Despite a clear margin of victory for Biden, Trump has refused to concede, and his legal challenges are fizzling. But he has been backed up by many of his fellow Republicans, both in Washington and around the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-vaccine-team-will-not-brief-biden-administration-says-us-senator/story-ivHzLgVvEraCcnS1IszCdM.html
20-11-2020||World||French court gives deadline to Emmanuel Macron for proving climate actions||France’s highest administrative court on Thursday gave the government three months to show it is enacting climate policies that will ensure it meets its commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.The Conseil d’Etat’s ruling raises questions about the credibility of President Emmanuel Macron’s climate plan and affirms the binding nature of greenhouse gas reduction targets that are contained in legislation.France, which brokered the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, has committed to reducing greenhouse gases by 40% of their 1990 levels by 2030. But the court noted that France was already missing targets and had delayed much of the reduction effort until after 2020.“If the justifications so provided by the government were not satisfactory, the Conseil d’Etat may then consider requiring to take further steps in order to achieve the target of 40% by 2030,” the court said in a press release.The case was brought to the court by the commune of Grande-Synthe in northern France. The town is built on reclaimed land and local officials say it risks being inundated by rising sea levels caused by global warming.The court will make a final ruling, which would be binding on the state, after the three-month period expires. Rulings by the Conseil d’Etat cannot be appealed.Climate activists hailed what they called an “historic” ruling.“By affirming the binding nature of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets contained in the law, the highest administrative court is putting the state face to face with its responsibilities in the climate crisis,” Greenpeace and Oxfam said in a joint statement with two other environmental NGOs.Between 2015 and 2018, the rate of decline in greenhouse gas emissions in France was about half as fast as it should have been for the country to be on the right trajectory to achieving its 2030 target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-court-gives-macron-deadline-to-prove-he-s-serious-on-climate/story-8OCWm1r4tDVtCDlLZjcvVI.html
20-11-2020||World||Joe Biden’s team to meet with congressional panels on transition||Members of Joe Biden’s transition team have begun to contact staff of the congressional appropriations committees for information about federal agencies as President Donald Trump continues to block the president-elect’s efforts to build an administration, people familiar with the meetings said.Because the General Services Administration will not ascertain the results of the election, the incoming administration cannot communicate with federal agencies or begin the transfer of power that happens with every previous new president. Biden is also unable to receive the full national security briefings he is entitled to.The transition team has been finding workarounds. They have been in contact with state and local leaders and private companies. Later Thursday, Biden is meeting virtually with some of the nation’s governors and plans to speak afterward.The president, meanwhile, is standing by his unfounded claims that widespread fraud invalidate the election and insisting he will prevail.A House Democratic aide said that Biden’s transition aides will meet with staff from the House Appropriations Committee, which deals with all federal agencies and their budgets. And a Senate Democratic aide said that phone calls have already taken place between the Senate Appropriations Committee staff and Biden aides.Business groups are joining the list of those clamoring for the presidential transition to begin. US Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Officer Tom Donohue, the National Association of Manufacturers and Joshua Bolten, president of Business Roundtable trade group for CEOs have all said it is time for the process to move forward.The contacts with lawmakers’ staff come as the Trump White House is continuing to push forward with a fiscal 2022 budget proposal on the assumption that Trump will have a second term, and as the appropriations committees are attempting to finish fiscal 2021 funding bills by a Dec. 11 deadline.Biden’s transition team assembled agency review teams, made up of more than 500 people, who are charged with contacting federal agencies to better understand their policies and operations, but those efforts cannot begin until the GSA officially designates that the transfer of power from the Trump administration to a Biden one can begin.Biden advisers have warned of serious consequences if the Trump administration continues to deny access to the federal government, especially real-time data about the coronavirus pandemic and plans for distributing a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-team-to-meet-with-congressional-panels-on-transition/story-GzMXCqF7LFgx7g6slugMVK.html
20-11-2020||World||Chinese experimental Covid-19 vaccine given to 1 million people||A million people have taken an experimental Covid-19 vaccine developed by the government-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) under an emergency inoculation programme, the company has said.No serious adverse reaction has been reported from those who received the vaccine in emergency use, Sinopharm said in an article on the social media platform WeChat, citing a recent media interview by chairperson, Liu Jingzhen.China launched the emergency vaccine use programme in July, mainly directed towards essential workers and those going abroad.The vaccine has been administered even as clinical or human trials of the vaccine are yet to be completed, leaving question marks on its efficacy and safety.Two vaccine candidates developed by Sinopharm’s subsidiary China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and a third one developed by Sinovac Biotech have been used for the emergency programme, though it remains unclear which vaccine Liu was referring to, Reuters news agency said in a report.Earlier this month, Liu had told a press conference that none of the 56,000 people who were inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine and travelled abroad have contracted the coronavirus.Until the beginning of November, some 100,000 people had been vaccinated with the company’s vaccine and have shown no adverse reactions so far.“Some of the others who received the emergency-use vaccine are employees of China National Petroleum Corporation, China Petrochemical Corporation and Technology giant Huawei,” Chinese state media had reported, quoting Liu.On Wednesday, scientific journal The Lancet said Sinovac Biotech’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine CoronaVac triggered a quick immune response, but the level of antibodies produced was lower than in people who had recovered from the disease, mid-stage trial results showed.While the early to mid-stage trials were not designed to assess the efficacy of CoronaVac, researchers said it could provide sufficient protection and could be used for emergency use.China is among the countries racing to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.China has five vaccines for Covid-19 currently undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials in some foreign countries.A leading Chinese expert on Thursday said that Chinese vaccines are very effective.“Currently, no vaccine has completed Phase 3 clinical trials, but Pfizer and Moderna claimed their vaccines are very effective. Please trust me, and I want to tell the public that China’s vaccines are also very effective,” Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in an online seminar on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-experimental-covid-19-vaccine-given-to-1-million-people/story-Gektan6fyzSg4dRHjEHPQP.html
20-11-2020||World||27-month jail term for Indian-origin builder in UK||Vijay Madhaparia, a London-based builder, has been jailed for 27 months after falsifying documents from UK tax authorities and also banned from running limited companies for 10 years, the Insolvency Service said on Thursday.Madhaparia, 44, was director of Laxmi Development Limited, a building development company incorporated in 2010 based out of northwest London. The company was placed into compulsory liquidation in 2015 after it failed to pay the tax authorities a debt of £124,000, which was later revised to £4.4million.The service said the official receiver was initially appointed as liquidator and further investigations uncovered several instances of misconduct by Madhaparia. In 2012, he was disqualified by the court for three years after committing health and safety offences.However, despite being disqualified, he continued to act as a director and took on various construction and development projects until the company was dissolved in September 2013 after the company had failed to file company records.To get the company reinstated, Madhaparia submitted company accounts in breach of his disqualification, which he falsely claimed had been audited and prepared by regulated accountants.Further enquiries uncovered that Madhaparia had taken on two renovation contracts in 2015 despite the company having been wound up, and he did so without informing the official receiver.The service said that Madhaparia then proceeded to siphon £91,000 worth of payments for the renovation works into his personal account, which he spent on holidays and gambling, depriving his creditors of payment.Judge Dafna Spiro of the Harrow Crown Court described his conduct as “a sustained, deliberate and repeated pattern of calculated deliberate deceit and dishonesty committed over a number of years”.Ian West, chief investigator for the Insolvency Service, said, “Vijay Madhaparia has been jailed for a significant amount of time after the court recognised the severity of his numerous misconduct offences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/27-month-jail-term-for-indian-origin-builder-in-uk/story-ALEjnxzZC8hXzhZ5Vxc56H.html
20-11-2020||World||Italy’s PM Conte warns of lowkey Christmas as Covid-19 cases pick up||Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned Italians on Thursday they would have to shun “hugs and kisses” at Christmas to help contain the coronavirus, as the country struggles to curb a surge in deaths and infections.Italy registered 36,176 new cases and 653 Covid-19-related fatalities over the past 24 hours with the northern Lombardy region, centred on the financial capital Milan, once again bearing the bulk of the contagion.Many Italian regions are under partial lockdown to try to slow the outbreak, with restrictions due to stay in place until at least Dec. 3.Shopkeepers and restaurateurs are pinning their hopes on a revival of business around the normally busy Christmas period to revive their battered fortunes, but Conte said in a speech there would be no return to normal anytime soon.“We will have to spend the festivities in a more sober way. Big parties, kisses and hugs will not be possible, this would mean an abrupt rise in the (infection) curve in January,” he said, adding: “We hope that we can still buy and exchange gifts.”Italy has seen 47,870 Covid-19 deaths since its outbreak emerged in February, the second highest toll in Europe after Britain’s. It has also recorded 1.309 million cases.The number of excess deaths leapt in October, with the mortality rate more than 20% higher in a string of major cities across the country by comparison to the average of the previous five years, health ministry data released on Thursday showed.Covid-19-related deaths have more than doubled in November by comparison with October, hitting a high of 753 on Nov. 18.Italy managed to beat back the first wave of the epidemic in the spring thanks to a rigid, nationwide lockdown between March and April, and removed most restrictions before the summer as cases steadily decreased.However, autumn has brought a resurgence of infections and while the initial outbreak was largely confined to the north, the second wave has hit almost every region hard, stretching the health service to breaking point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-s-pm-conte-warns-of-lowkey-christmas-as-covid-19-cases-pick-up/story-Mc3BJ8BvPIEZPsE6dT4XAK.html

A Chinese official gave a dossier to Australian media containing 14 grievances, highlighting the increasingly fractious relationship between the two nations.“If you make China the enemy, China will be the enemy,” a Chinese government official reportedly told three prominent outlets on Wednesday.Among the complaints are Australia’s strict foreign interference laws, the country’s ban on Huawei’s involvement in its 5G network and decisions that blocked Chinese investment projects on “national security grounds”.Morrison said the “unofficial document” came from the Chinese embassy and would not stop Australia from setting “our own laws and our own rules according to our national interest”.“We won’t be compromising on the fact that we will set what our foreign investment laws are or how we build our 5G telecommunications networks or how we run our systems of protecting against interference Australia’s way we run our country,” he told Channel Nine. The document also claimed Canberra had engaged in “incessant wanton interference” in China’s affairs while singling out Australia’s call for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.It accused Australia of “siding with the US’ anti-China campaign and spreading disinformation” about where the virus originated -- a particularly sore point for Beijing. The United States weighed in on the diplomatic rift Thursday, with the White House National Security Council saying on Twitter that “Beijing is upset Australia took steps to expose and thwart Chinese espionage & to protect Aussie sovereignty”.“It’s encouraging to see a growing number of countries following Canberra’s lead in taking such steps,” the tweet continued.Relations between Canberra and Beijing have reached a new low in recent months, leaving Australian government ministers unable to persuade Chinese counterparts to even accept their phone calls.The rift has left Australian exporters exposed as their largest trading partner places a series of retaliatory bans on agricultural goods including beef, barley and timber.The latest diplomatic salvo comes just days after Morrison reached an in-principle agreement on bolstering defence relations with Japan’s leader Yoshihide Suga, a move widely viewed as aimed at countering Chinese influence in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/won-t-compromise-on-how-we-run-australia-morrison-s-sharp-rebuttal-to-china-s-greivance-list/story-EZQYmUJJ2GedNwndz9rtZO.html

Meerut leads the list with 126% rise in 15 days. Other districts that have shown a rise in daily cases in two weeks are Lucknow, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Gautam Buddha Nagar, and Ghaziabad. Expert say there are various reasons for the spike. “Meerut is a city where people in large numbers visit from other places particularly Delhi. We are studying the travel pattern, which could be one reason why cases are going up, and will soon devise a fresh strategy for Meerut,” said Dr Ved Prakash, HoD pulmonary critical care medicine department at the King George’s Medical University. Dr Prakash is also the OSD for Meerut medical college. Also read | Pandemic causes break in 36-year-old tradition of UP’s Indira MarathonThe number of deaths has also increased. According to the state health department data, 21 deaths were reported on November 16, 20 on November 17, 29 on November 18 and 40 were reported on November 19. The active cases in the state also increased from 21,954 on Wednesday to 22,757 on Thursday. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad ,said the state government has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to check the second wave of Covid-19 in the state. Along with collecting samples, increase in testing, surveillance across the state and contact tracing is being carried out to break the infection chain, he said. In Lucknow, the lack of social distancing is stated to be a big factor behind rising cases. “People have virtually stopped following the Covid-19 protocol and hardly maintain distance when out in the market,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, association of international doctors. “People going to vegetable, grocery markets are seen standing close together at shops. Wearing masks on the chin isn’t preventing infection,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president IMA, Lucknow. The surge in cases in Delhi has led to increase in the cases in the bordering districts, including Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar and Meerut whereas in the remaining districts the Covid cases are under control, said additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal, and added that the state government has started random sample tests in the districts bordering Delhi. Keeping an eye on the surge in neighbouring Delhi, the state government has sounded an alert in the neighbouring districts.People have been urged to follow the guidelines strictly. A health department officer said the festive season leading to a sudden increase in the activities, increase in the pollution, dip in the temperature with the onset of the winter and people ignoring the Covid-19 protocol are leading to the spike. The high recovery rate of 94.18 %, positivity rate of below 5 % and fatality rate at 1.44% are boosts for the health department in the fight against the pandemic, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-up-districts-see-surge-in-cases-in-fortnight/story-wYkh1VnVQqWoBdaM6hk45L.html

He later sold the content on the dark web to other paedophiles.An official said Bhavan is not a very tech-savvy person and they suspect some other people assisted him in preparing video clips and clicking photographs of children using hidden cameras and webcams. He said the same content was later uploaded on the web for sale.The official said Bhavan’s emails suggested he was in constant touch with Indian and foreign nationals for sharing child sexual abuse material. He added Bhavan created and shared child pornography for years via social media platforms and websites.The official said Bhavan is suspected to be one of the point persons of a large network involved in child pornography available on the dark web. “The CBI is scanning his emails and mobile phones to check for the people who were in frequent touch with him. Eight mobile phones have been recovered from the accused. The laptop of the accused is also sealed for further examination.”The CBI has found Bhavan targeted street vendors, daily wagers, pavement dwellers, and domestic helps. The agency is trying to trace these children to record their statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-child-molester-case-cbi-suspects-involvement-of-more-people-in-sexual-abuse/story-6D1qQQQgQa11dXDkB2TdBO.html
20-11-2020||India||70% of women considered for permanent commission in the army make it||Almost 70% of women officers who were considered for permanent commission in the army by a special selection board have been selected to serve a full term in the army, officials said on Friday.Of the 615 women considered for permanent commission, 422 have been found to be fit for the role by the board, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The results of the special board were declassified on Thursday. The board was convened months after the government issued a formal order in July granting permanent commission to women following a Supreme Court verdict. The government’s July 23 order specified grant of permanent commission to women officers in 10 streams—Army Air Defence (AAD), Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME), Army Service Corps (ASC), Army Ordnance Corps (AOC), and Intelligence Corps in addition to the existing streams of Judge and Advocate General (JAG) and Army Educational Corps (AEC). The army had set August 31 as the deadline for short-service commissioned (SSC) women officers to submit their applications for permanent commission. The Supreme Court in February ruled that women should be considered for command roles and that all women officers are entitled to permanent commission. It asked the army to give them permanent commission within three months in a major boost to gender parity. The Centre got a one-month extension on July 7 to implement the Supreme Court’s verdict after it moved an application before the apex court seeking the extension of the deadline by another six months citing the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to check its spread from March 25. The Supreme Court’s judgment was hailed for creating a new equality paradigm in the armed forces. It upheld a 2010 Delhi high court verdict. The Supreme Court ruled that women officers, who joined the Indian Army through short-service commission, are entitled to permanent commission even if they have more than 14 years of service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/70-of-women-considered-for-permanent-commission-in-the-army-make-it/story-uPQRPezqZW5z8flmf3Ak0H.html

20-11-2020||India||Analysis | India has rightly shunned RCEP for now||India’s decision to stay out of the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, Asia’s mega free-trade agreement (FTA), has been met both with a sense of approval and disappointment and divided economists on the issue.The RCEP is an FTA between the 10 members of the ASEAN as well as China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. Will India lose out on opportunities of trade and investment an FTA expectedly offers, or are we better off without it?Free trade should drive prosperity for all. After all, humanity has ventured far and wide since ancient times to trade, guided by the principle of comparative advantage i.e. countries export stuff they can make cheaply at home and import goods costlier to produce domestically. That’s the theory.Also Read: China perceives rising India as ‘rival’; wants to constraint its partnership with US, allies: reportIn reality, trade imbalances can result in big winners and losers, impacting wages, and employment. For instance, importing goods from China that rely on a lot of unskilled workers can reduce the demand for unskilled workers in India.The objective of the RCEP is to create a mammoth regional-trading bloc. It comprises one-third of the world’s population and some 29% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP).Yet, without India, Asia’s third-largest economy, there will be limited gains to be had from the RCEP, some analysts say. One of the most in-depth studies of RCEP by Renuka Mahadevan of the University of Queensland and Anda Nugroho of Indonesia’s finance ministry found that an RCEP minus India will add just 0.08% to China’s estimated 2030 GDP. That’s because India on average has higher tariffs than other RCEP countries and, therefore, has the largest scope to reduce them.FTAs like the RCEP are thought to be advantageous simply because they create preferential treatment among member nations, who get freer access to one another’s markets through lower tariffs, leading to re-orientation of supply chains and greater interdependence.A recent paper from the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, authored by Sunitha Raju and V Raveendra Saradhi, suggests India’s concerns about Chinese imports are exaggerated. The study found that, between 2007-08 and 2015-16, India’s import of Chinese intermediate goods, which refer to semi-finished items that go into the making of a final product, had raised domestic industrial output and efficiency. Import of Chinese capital goods, such as machinery, also had a positive impact, the study notes.Yet, India has a sound basis to shut the doors on the RCEP for now. It’s important to note, in this context, that India already has FTAs with the ASEAN nations since 2009, South Korea since 2009 and Japan since 2011. India’s experience of these FTAs hasn’t been encouraging.It has generally been the case that India’s lack of competitiveness in exports has meant it can’t take advantage of FTAs. Simply put, our industry lacks the scale, technology, and productivity required to compete.The RCEP proposed that 92% of India’s traded goods must have zero tariffs by the end of a 15-year period. India fears it will end up importing far more than it will be able to export, which is the trade deficit. This remains the core concern.India’s trade deficit with the ASEAN nations as a whole ballooned from $13 billion to $22 billion between 2014-15 and 2018-19, official data show. A recent analysis by ICICI Securities Ltd showed that in 2018-19, India’s trade deficit with RCEP countries, as it were, stood at $105 billion. With China alone, India runs a massive US$60 billion trade deficit.India fears greater market access will impact its key manufacturing sectors like steel, leather goods, electronics, and textiles, which other nations can produce more cheaply.Opening up agricultural markets, which enjoy tariff protection as high as 30-40%, could hurt farm incomes. Highly efficient dairy sectors of Australia and New Zealand, which export 90% of their dairy produce could pummel domestic profitability. A proposed FTA between India and the EU has been languishing for years, with both sides unwilling to open up their agricultural markets.Higher standards for intellectual-property protection that RCEP-like FTAs entail could impact the domestic pharma industry and cause drug prices to soar. India fears the RCEP will also limit its policy-making room in areas such as foreign investment.It’s wrong to assume that, since India has a comparative advantage in the services sector, the RCEP could be beneficial. India’s advantage is limited to software services and it would have lost out in areas such as business processes, telecom, and fintech services to technologically more advanced members.While India should choose economic openness, it should simultaneously increase its trade competitiveness. This will require higher labour productivity, bigger firms, as opposed to a large unorganised sector, access to better technologies and investment. The need, therefore, is to create an economy that can compete in global markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/analysis-india-has-rightly-shunned-rcep-for-now/story-axsa89GgH5Wtsl21SjLf3O.html

Drika, the brother of the deceased, had alleged Manda and another person named Dambaru Sikka had gone to the hill top to collect local brew ‘salap’ when they came under fire. Manda fell to the bullet injuries, while Sikka escaped and alerted the villagers. Later, Kadraka’s body was brought to the village and last rites performed.OHRC chairperson BP Das and member secretary Asim Amitabh Das in their order said the claim that Kadraka was a Maoist could not be substantiated. Also Read: BJP seeks Naveen Natnaik’s resignation after two custodial deaths in Odisha“There was no evidence against Kadraka that he had indulged in Maoist-related offences and was planning to kill the collector and SP. It would not suffice to just make a claim that he stayed in the Maoist camp and was part of any Maoist group. The state is liable to pay compensation. The state home department should pay Rs 1.5 lakh compensation to the next of the kin of the deceased,” the OHRC order said.The police had claimed that Kadraka was at a Maoist camp organised by their leader Sukdev alias Bunty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-tribal-killed-declared-maoist-rights-body-rejects-theory-4yrs-later/story-lxxhS8iWsUUSotYjSG1N6H.html

The miscreants, who spoke in Hindi and Odia, then rounded up the branch manager and other staff into a toilet and snatched the keys to the locker.“Except two-three packets of gold, the robbers mopped up almost all the gold that would be around ₹12 crore. The incident happened in just 10 minutes,” said Satya Pradhan, manager of the branch, adding that the CCTV camera was not functional when the theft took place. Cuttack deputy commissioner of police Prateek Singh said seven special teams have been formed to nab the suspects and all are investigating separate leads. The borders of the city have been sealed, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cash-jewellery-worth-12cr-looted-in-odisha/story-y3zLarPRdS3IMWeSJBLCLM.html
20-11-2020||India||Spotlight on Ladakh, China secretly made moves in central, Sikkim and eastern sectors||China has surreptitiously undertaken a large military infrastructure upgrade in the central, Sikkim and eastern sectors with simultaneous strengthening of surface-to-air missile sites, an increase in unmanned aerial vehicle numbers, and an expansion of airbases in Tibet while the world’s attention has been focused on Beijing’s hostile moves on the line of actual control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh and its tense stand-off with India, according to people familiar with the matter.While Hindustan Times has already reported the PLA’s force accretion in East Ladakh, something that reduces the chances of the status quo ante being restored at friction points, Indian military commanders are concerned about the build-up across the LAC, from Kaurik Pass in Himachal Pradesh to Fish Tail I and II in Arunachal Pradesh.Military commanders and national security planners who spoke on condition of anonymity said that over the past month they noticed the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) engage in road construction at Churup village right across Kaurik pass in the central sector and that it has placed new container housing modules around Tunjum La, north of the contested Barahoti plains in Uttarakhand, just 4km from the 565km LAC in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Also Read: China is biggest stumbling block in India’s UNSC permanent membershipShiquanhe, a garrison depot 82km from Demchok LAC with Gar Gunsa airport, has become a hub for Beijing’s relocation of troops and heavy equipment. The position of Shiquanhe is such that it can serve as the main logistics supply depot from Demchok to Barahoti plains, Indian military planners said.The situation in the eastern sector is no different, with an electronic warfare unit being deployed at Nyanglu, 60km from the Arunachal Pradesh border, in an old 1962 war PLA camp. This unit is a strategic support force with four counterspace jammers, possibly oriented towards Indian GSAT communication and commercial satellites, the military planners said. India has also noticed redeployment of troops at Yebi with heightened PLA surveillance at Bum La. The PLA’s intelligence and surveillance activity has picked up all along the 3,488km LAC with specific focus being noticed across Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and the Galwan sector in East Ladakh, the military planners added. Evidence of this heightened surveillance comes in the form of the construction of communication towers at Changmu, 27km from the LAC and north of Sebu La in Sikkim. The India (Sikkim)-Bhutan-China trijunction saw the 73-day Doklam stand-off in 2017.The Chinese have also speeded up the strengthening of depth areas with new missile transporter erector launchers seen at the surface-to-air missile site in the Kashgar airbase, 475km from the western sector LAC, Indian military commanders said. The Kashgar and Hotan bases are patrolling the skies in Aksai Chin with both the military bases showing the presence of heavy transport lift planes. There have been fresh troop and equipment dugouts under camouflage nets reported from Kangxiwar, 112km from the LAC across Karakoram Pass.Also Read: China is fortifying defences across Ladakh border, not prepping to disengageThe number of military UAVs has increased at the Hoping airbase in Shigatse, opposite the Sikkim sector, with military logistics capacity being increased at the Lhasa airbase. The massive road-communications-surveillance upgrade all along LAC indicates that the PLA could open other fronts on the LAC if the worst-case scenario materialises in East Ladakh. In the wake of this, India’s national security planners are closely monitoring the movement of the military dialogue between the two armies while keeping troops on high alert even in the central and eastern sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spotlight-on-ladakh-china-secretly-made-moves-in-central-sikkim-and-eastern-sectors/story-GuwPWJKoYjQ3hGlNx7rZUP.html
20-11-2020||India||Congress issues notice to Jharkhand leader||The Jharkhand Congress on Thursday issued a show-cause notice to senior leader Furqan Ansari for criticising senior leader Rahul Gandhi and the party’s state incharge RPN Singh, people aware of the matter said.The development coincided with Bihar Congress president Madan Mohan Jha offering to step down from the post taking moral responsibility for the party’s poor show in the just-concluded assembly elections. The All India Congress Committee (AICC) incharge of Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil along with Gujarat incharge Rajeev Satav had already offered to quit their posts for the poll debacles in their respective states. Ansari, a former Lok Sabha member and a prominent Muslim leader in Jharkhand, had raised questions on Rahul Gandhi’s campaigning in Bihar. He also claimed that the people working in Gandhi’s office and also his advisers were mainly MBA graduates. “As a result, they are not able to give him the right advice or suggest key talking points for his campaign speeches. To strengthen the Congress, it is important for Rahul Gandhi to have a political advisor,” said Ansari, whose son Irfan is currently a legislator from Jamtara.Ansari said he would write to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and seek major changes in the party organisation. Ansari also attacked Jharkhand incharge RPN Singh. “If I were at the helm, I would have not appointed him (Singh) even a block president,” he said. There were demands from state leaders for strict action against Ansari to send a “stern message” to dissenters. Acting on requests from several leaders, party’s Jharkhand working president Kamlesh Mahto Kamlesh issued the show-cause notice to Ansari on behalf of state unit chief Rameshwar Oraon. In the notice, Ansari has been asked to explain his remarks within seven days.Differences in the Congress have surfaced again after the results of assembly elections in Bihar and by-polls in several states. On Thursday, senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge attacked party colleagues for targeting the Congress leadership following defeat in elections, accusing them of “weakening” the party from within.“We have to fight unitedly. It has pained me that some senior leaders have spoken against the party and its leadership,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-issues-notice-to-jharkhand-leader/story-Uue9HcBHC1k38RUR15PdfP.html

The accident took place at a spot on the Prayagraj-Lucknow highway under Manikpur police station of the district, police said.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath has expressed grief over the road accident and directed senior officials to reach the spot and provide all possible assistance. He also announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each to the next of kin of those who lost their lives in the accident. “Chief minister Yogi Adityanath announces a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each to next of the kin of the deceased, who lost their lives in the Pratapgarh road accident,” his office said. Anurag Arya, Pratapgarh’s superintendent of police, said the primary investigation suggested that the accident took place when the SUV driver failed to spot the stationary truck and collided with it from behind on the highway near Deshraj Ka Inara village. Passengers trapped in the SUV were taken out and moved to the community health centre (CHC) in Kunda where the 14 of them were declared dead on arrival.

They had gone to attend a wedding at Shekhpur village in Nawabganj area and were coming back when the accident took place. Locals said the SUV was badly damaged in the collision and police faced difficulties in rescue operation due to darkness.

20-11-2020||India||Famers plan protest in Delhi from Nov 26||Leaders of different farm bodies from across the country on Thursday announced an indefinite protest in Delhi from November 26 against the recent farm laws passed by the Centre, even as they warned that they would block roads leading up to the Capital if they were not allowed to enter the city.At a meeting of the United Farmers Morcha, an umbrella body of at least 500 farmers’ unions formed to lead the protest, in Chandigarh, it was decided that the members would stage protests outside Parliament – the nation’s power centre – till their demands are met, a leader aware of the developments said. “Whether we are allowed to protest or not, farmers will reach Parliament,” the leader said. “We do not know for how long the protests will continue, but we will not stop till our demands are met. The farmers are making arrangements to stay for three to four months,” said Gurnam Singh Chadhuni, who heads the Haryana chapter of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).The Parliament in September passed three bills that the government said were aimed at unleashing reforms in agriculture and allow farmers more flexibility in selling their produce. While some experts have hailed the move, farmer bodies and opposition parties allege that the laws will benefit only big businesses.Chadhuni said the government cannot stop people from travelling to the Capital. “If that happens, we have an alternative plan ready,” he said, without divulging what the alternate plan is.According Hannan Mollah, president of the All India Kisan Sabha and seven times MP from West Bengal, and Shiv Kumar Kakaji, convener of All India Kisan Maha Sangh in Madhya Pradesh, the protests will conclude only after their demand to repeal the farm laws are met. They said farmers from Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh will also join the protest that will see active participation of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.Farmers’ bodies from Punjab will drive 11 tractors from each village in the state and reach Delhi, the members said. “Farmers across rest of the country will protest simultaneously in their respective states for which a plan is ready as we have asked them to gherao central government offices,” said Mollah.BS Rajewal, a farm leader from Punjab, said that if the Centre invites them for talks, they will attend the meeting, “but the protests from November 26 will continue”.In Thursday’s meeting, the United Farmers Morcha urged political parties to join the protest. “Leader of any political party can join us, but they have to be with the farmers. They should not come as representative of their party,” said Yogendra Yadav, member, All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee. A seven-member national committee of farm leaders Yadav, VM Singh, Raju Shetty, Jagjit Singh Dallewal, Rajewal, Kakaji and Chadhuni has been formed to coordinate the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/famers-plan-protest-in-delhi-from-nov-26/story-wG5g7ugIum0xABTQQlz55O.html
20-11-2020||India||LeT founder Hafiz Saeed gets 10-year sentence in terror financing cases||A Pakistani court on Thursday gave Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed, held responsible by India for masterminding the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and two close aides prison sentences totalling ten-and-a-half years in two cases of terror financing -- a decision likely influenced by the pressure brought to bear on Islamabad by the Financial Action Task Force. It is also being seen as an indication of Saeed’s decreasing utility to PakistanBesides Saeed, the others sentenced by the anti-terrorism court in Lahore are Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) leaders Zafar Iqbal and Yahya Mujahid, who served as JuD’s spokesperson for many years. All three have been sanctioned by the UN Security Council. Saeed’s brother-in-law Abdul Rehman Makki, also a top leader of JuD, was given a six-month sentence in the same cases. Saeed, currently serving a prison term in connection with other terror financing cases, was produced for the sentencing by anti-terrorism court judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta. Saeed was given two separate five-year prison terms under provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act for using and providing funds for acts of terrorism. He was also given a six-month prison term for being a member of a banned group. The judge ordered the seizure of Saeed’s “movable and immovable property” and directed him to pay fines totalling Pakistani ₹110,000. All three sentences will run concurrently. Since Saeed is already in jail serving two sentences of five-and-a-half-years given to him in February, he will not serve any extra jail time. Also Read: Pak updates terror list, India says it omits key 26/11 Mumbai attackers“Since the convict has already been convicted... by this court vide judgment dated 12.02.2020, so the punishment awarded to him in this case shall also run concurrently with punishment in said cases,” the court’s order said. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the sentencing of Saeed was largely due to pressure on Pakistan from western powers and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to crack down on terror groups and terror financing, including prosecution of those funnelling funds to terrorists. The people added Saeed’s conviction in four separate cases this year could be an indication the military establishment no longer considers him an asset. Virtually all of Saeed’s top aides have been arrested and put on trial, and there are indications that they are no longer playing a role in directing LeT’s operations. “It appears that LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, who was arrested for the Mumbai attacks and later released on bail in 2015, is the main person directing the operations (of the terror group),” said one of the people cited above. Lakhvi’s current whereabouts are not known. A total of 41 cases were registered against Saeed and his aides by Punjab Police after he was arrested in July 2019. Of these cases, two were decided on Thursday, bringing the tally of cases decided so far to 24. The rest are still being heard by anti-terrorism courts. Saeed and his aides are being held in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail.  There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to Saeed’s sentencing. Asked about Pakistan-backed terror groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir at a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India had protested against Pakistan’s “continued support to cross-border terrorist infiltration into India” and reminded Islamabad of its bilateral commitment to now allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism. Srivastava also the “incessant infiltration of terrorists and induction of weapons to fuel terror activities continues unabated” and these activities weren’t possible without the support of Pakistani forces deployed along the Line of Control. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said Pakistan could say after Saeed’s sentencing in several cases that it has delivered on FATF’s demand for prosecution of those involved in terror financing, and claim a moral victory. “But it’s more important to see what Saeed does next, including the outcome of any appeals in higher courts. The Pakistani establishment may have sacrificed Saeed but his network remains and his son Talha Saeed and Lakhvi are still active. The game is not over yet,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-founder-hafiz-saeed-gets-10-year-sentence-in-terror-financing-cases/story-UjVsXCMrGbAUOfwTB7AmAI.html

The border standoff in Ladakh sector of the LAC, where both sides have deployed thousands of troops backed by artillery and armoured vehicles, has entered its seventh month. Recent reports suggested the two sides are considering several proposals for thinning troops at some friction points but are yet to make a breakthrough. The eighth round of talks between senior military commanders of the two sides, which was held in Chushul on November 6, was also joined by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry. “The objective of these discussions is to ensure complete disengagement and full restoration of peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the western sector,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-hold-another-round-of-talks-on-border-stand-off/story-fK7vYVKnxzegq7dpnmHhcP.html
20-11-2020||India||Joint Parl Committee grills Twitter on Kamra; row erupts over jurisdiction||Microblogging site Twitter faced heat at a meeting of a joint parliamentary panel on Thursday for not taking down comedian Kunal Kamra’s tweet targeting Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, and was asked to clarify its policy of blocking and removing users and tweets.But the proceedings sparked a political tussle with four Congress lawmakers suggesting that such issues should be dealt by Parliament’s IT Panel headed by Shashi Tharoor. Panel chairperson Meenakshi Lekhi later dismissed the charge. In the meeting, Twitter policy head Mahima Kaul faced a barrage of questions from angry members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Data Protection Bill when she was summoned for giving “incongruous” written replies to some questions related to the bill. The company, the previous day, submitted a written apology for wrongly showing Ladakh as part of China.JPC chairman Lekhi and Congress’s Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Tankha raised several questions, with Lekhi telling the Twitter official that both Tankha and she might sue Twitter over Kamra’s tweet even though they belong to different political parties.The comedian’s tweet in question came after a barrage of tweets where he criticised the Supreme Court’s favourable ruling on Arnab Goswami’s bail request. Lekhi, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP, also questioned Twitter’s policy of blocking or removing handles and tweets, and gave seven days to submit detailed response on the policy. “In their submission to the committee they said they follow healthy practices; and that only obscene and profane tweets are blocked. But there is no clear-cut policy on what amounts to profanity or obscenity; their affidavit is not clear on what is their policy is because when we showed them Kunal Kamra’s obscene tweets about the CJI they had no explanation for it,” she said.MPs present in the meeting said it was Tankha who first raised the issue of Kamra’s tweet and said, it amounts to Twitter ridiculing the nation. “In our country, we cannot allow obscene remarks against anyone. And if Twitter is allowing such obscene remarks against CJI, then it can’t be tolerated,” Tankha said, according to the MPs who spoke on condition of anonymity.The MPs quoted above added that the Kamra issue came up in connection to the affidavit by Twitter as discussions veered on the company’s policies on regulating objectionable content.According to two MPs at the meeting, Twitter didn’t assure the panel that the tweet would be removed but said that the issue would be flagged to the appropriate officials at Twitter. “We’ve asked for an answer in seven days. Since there are no laws in India regarding these, we have to talk to the top executives of such service providers,” Lekhi said. But Lekhi’s order asking Twitter to clarify on its policies led to a political row.Senior Congress leader and Parliament’s IT panel chief Tharoor tweeted, “Dear @M_Lekhi, as far as I am aware your Committee was formed for consultations on the Data Protection Bill & its mandate is to report on the statutory provisions continued in the draft Bill. Could you clarify if you have taken on additional responsibilities & on whose authority?”Tharoor’s colleague and member of the JPC, Jairam Ramesh, joined the debate and tweeted, “I could not attend the meeting today, but had I been there I would have raised this very issue. It is not the first time this has happened. The committee headed by @M_Lekhi has no authority over this issue.” Jairam later told HT, “We have a hyper-enthusiastic chairperson with wide-ranging concerns and interests.”Two other Congress MPs, Karti Chidambaram and Saptagiri Ulaka, said the JPC has no jurisdiction to look into the Kamra issue.Lekhi hit back at the party. “I won’t run a law tutorial for Shashi Tharoor when his own party colleague Vivek Tankha has already concurred with me...A member of the IT panel should have better understanding of data protection and algorithm manipulation.”Later, Tharoor responded: “Seems some people do need “tutorials” on the mandate of special committees formed to discuss specific bills. This JtCmt is to discuss the provisions of a draft data protection bill&report thereon. Parliament has not been informed of an expansion of its mandate beyond this task.”Twitter and Facebook were summoned for the second time on Thursday by the JPC after they appeared before the panel last month and opposed the proposed data protection law, India’s first targeted legislation to protect personal data.Members of the panel asked how some posts get 4,000 to 5,000 “likes” while other posts (by the same person) attract more than 100,000 likes -- a question related to a long-held opinion in many quarters in India and overseas that such companies amplify some content and downplay others. Facebook executives maintained they are just a platform and not a publisher of posts or content. But Lekhi and Biju Janata Dal MP Bhartruhari Mahtab dismissed this legal argument and said Facebook can’t escape accountability on what is being posted on its platform. Twitter was also asked why it took more than a month to rectify its mistake on Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joint-parl-committee-grills-twitter-on-kamra-row-erupts-over-jurisdiction/story-gfuf3VcYpfJt8JaBKfT0vL.html
20-11-2020||India||Non-BJP candidates not allowed to campaign, say Gupkar alliance leaders||Members of the Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration on Thursday accused the Jammu and Kashmir administration of “going out of its way” to help the Bharatiya Janata Party by “locking up” PAGD candidates for the upcoming DDC polls citing security concerns.Taking to Twitter, National Conference leader and former chief minister Omar Abdullah said, “The J&K administration is going out of its way to help the BJP & it’s recently created king’s party by locking up candidates opposed to the BJP, using security as an excuse. If the security situation isn’t conducive to campaigning what was the need to announce elections?”The NC, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Peoples Conference, the Communist Party of India (Maoist), and the Awami National Conference have formed the PAGD seeking restoration the erstwhile state’s special status under Article 370 of the Constitution.The constituents of the PAGD are unitedly contesting the upcoming District Development Polls.“What sort of elections are being held in J&K where candidates are being stopped from campaigning? Is this the safe, terror free J&K the Home Minister was tweeting about yesterday?,” Abdullah said.Mehbooba Mufti, the vice-chairperson of the PAGD, alleged that BJP candidates were allowed to campaign freely as against non-BJP candidates.“Non BJP candidates for DDC polls aren’t allowed to campaign freely & are being locked up on the pretence of security. But BJP & its proxies are given full bandobast to move around. Is this the democracy that GOI claimed its promoting in yesterday’s phone convo with US Pres elect?,” Mufti said.The administration, however, has denied the allegations, saying that security was being provided as per the individual’s threat perception. “This is not the case. It may be according to security perception. There is no disparity between the candidates of different parties,” said Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole. Kashmir Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said that they are putting candidates in secure areas as it was difficult to provide security individually. “It is difficult to provide security to each candidate individually. We are providing collective security measures. Everyone is being put in secure areas and those who go out for campaigning are provided double escort besides securing the area for campaigning,” Kumar told reporters in Srinagar.“Since yesterday, the candidates have started their campaigning. There is no need to fear,” he said. J&K BJP spokesperson Altaf Thakur was not immediately available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/non-bjp-candidates-not-allowed-to-campaign-say-gupkar-alliance-leaders/story-LEbQbMfEJgF1cJpI8vplZP.html
20-11-2020||India||4 Jaish terrorists gunned down in J&K encounter||Four terrorists affiliated with the Pakistani terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad were killed in an encounter near Nagrota in Jammu district, security officials said on Thursday. Two policemen of the Special Operations Group were injured in the exchange of fire, the officials said. The encounter broke out at around 4.50 am at Ban toll plaza on the Jammu-Srinagar highway following specific input, Jammu zone inspector general of police Mukesh Singh said. “A truck ferrying the terrorists was checked at the toll plaza because we had intelligence inputs. The driver fled from the spot and as soon as a joint team of police and CRPF officials started checking the vehicle, they met with heavy firing,” Singh said. The terrorists also lobbed grenades on security forces, he said. “The truck caught fire after few grenades exploded inside it,” Singh said.“In the exchange of fire, four terrorists were eliminated and two constables were injured. The area is now being sanitised,” he said. The injured constables have been identified as Kuldeep Raj (32) of Akhnoor in Jammu district and Mohammad Ishaq Malik (40) of Neel Qasim Banihal in Ramban district. They have been admitted in GMC Jammu with bullet injuries and their condition is said to be stable, the official said.Several incriminating materials and ammunition, including eleven AK-47 rifles, three pistols, 29 live grenades, six UBGL grenades, mobile phones, compass, pithy bags, were recovered from the slain terrorists, he added.The four terrorists were affiliated with the Jaish-e-Mohammad, the IGP said. “It appeared that they were given a task to carry out a major terror strike, “ he added. A senior police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the terrorists had infiltrated from across the international border in Jammu region before boarding a Kashmir bound truck on Pathankot-Jammu national highway the preceding night. “However, forces eliminated them in a swift operation,” the official said. The Jammu IGP said that since the announcement of the schedule for District Development Council (DDC) polls, security forces have been receiving intelligence inputs of possible infiltration by Pakistan-based terrorists.“For the last few days, Pakistan has increased attempts to infiltrate militants into this side and to disturb the elections for which the process is on. In this context, Jammu Police and security forces have done a good job by neutralising four Pakistanis (militants). Their aim was to come to Kashmir to disturb the election process,” Singh said.In Srinagar, IGP, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar said the four terrorists were on their way to the Kashmir valley to disturb the DDC polls scheduled later this month, as Pakistan has been trying to cause trouble in the political process.DDC polls will be held from November 28 to December 22. Results will be declared on December 22.These polls will be the first major political activity in Jammu and Kashmir since August 5 last year, when the Centre revoked the special status of the erstwhile state under Article 370 of the Constitution and split it into two Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-jaish-terrorists-gunned-down-in-j-k-encounter/story-bIXd6ewfFBQw2P2lIBqi1J.html
20-11-2020||India||Paddy procurement up amid farmers’ agitation||The Union government has procured 28.6 million tonnes of paddy, 18.6% higher than the quantity in the corresponding period last year, with Punjab’s share being the highest at nearly 70%, according to the food ministry’s data until November 17. The government has paid a minimum support price (MSP) value of Rs 54,147 crore so far to nearly 2.7 million farmers in key rice-growing states, such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, the data showed. Punjab alone has contributed over 19.6 million tonnes, which is 69.7% of the total procurement. Last year, till November 17, the government had procured 24.1 million tonnes of paddy. To be sure, production of kharif or summer crops this year is likely to be a record 144.5 million tonnes, marginally higher than the 143.4 million tonnes produced during the kharif season of 2019-20, according to an official forecast. Higher output, buoyed by a robust monsoon, is one of the reasons behind higher procurement this year. The Union government is on course to buying a record quantity of paddy this year also to blunt a politically challenging farmers’ agitation against a set of laws enacted to liberalise the farm sector. Farmers protesting the laws fear the reforms would erode their bargaining power and lead to a collapse of the procurement system, which refers to the government’s buying of farm produce at federally fixed assured prices. Also Read: Punjab farm fires up by nearly 90% over daily average of past 5 years: StudyThe food ministry’s official projections show the government’s total procurement for summer paddy (2020-21) will likely touch 74.2 million tonnes, up from the total quantity of 62.7 million procured during 2019-20, an increase of 18%. The food ministry has expanded its procurement operations for summer-sown crops to cover an estimated 10.5 million paddy growers, against last year’s 10.2 million. The government has also raised by 27% the number of paddy purchase centres, which now stand at 39,122, up from 30,709 last year, official figures show. Higher procurement may make managing stocks difficult unless the government offloads more as food grant to the poor, according to Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm. From April to November 2020, the government has made additional offering of free food under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), launched due to Covid-19. This has freed up storage capacities of bulging state-held granaries and made way for higher paddy procurement. The total allocation under the PMGKY is 32.1 million tonnes. This included 21.4 million tonnes of rice and 10.6 million tonnes of wheat. As on September 1, 2020, total federally held food stocks stood at 77.3 million tonnes, up from 71.2 million tonnes on the same date last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paddy-procurement-up-amid-farmers-agitation/story-4ehJCjyxdZZzV9VZSxxNhO.html
20-11-2020||India||Covid-19: Decoding the nature of the economic recovery||A series of high frequency indicators has pointed to a growing momentum in the Indian economy. How far this has helped the economy make up for the sharp fall from pre-pandemic levels will become clear only when the second quarter (July-September) GDP figures are released later this month. When disruptions as massive as the current one hit an economy as complex as India’s, growth rates are not the only thing affected. An equally important parameter to track is income distribution, which has its own effect on the economy’s growth trajectory. While the Indian economy does not offer much in terms of high-frequency data to analyse such changes, it is increasingly becoming clear the current economic recovery might not be based on a very broad base. Here’s why:1. Households in India saved more during the lockdownLast week, the Reserve Bank of India released provisional estimates of household savings for the first quarter (April-June) of the current fiscal year. As a share of GDP, household savings were 20.1% in the quarter ending June 30. This number was 10% in March and 7.8% in June 2019. In absolute terms, household savings increased from Rs 3.84 lakh crore in the quarter ending June 2019 to Rs 8.15 lakh crore in June this year. The increase in this savings-GDP ratio is higher than the increase in absolute savings. This is because the denominator (GDP) itself suffered a huge fall – it contracted by 24% on an annual basis – in the June 2020 quarter. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know today2. Did India see a paradox of thrift in the first quarter?The term paradox of thrift owes its popularity to John Maynard Keynes who argued that if people try to save more during a recession, it will eventually end up hurting the economy rather than helping it. This is because an increase in (precautionary) savings leads to a fall in consumption and therefore aggregate demand or income. The economic logic of this is not very difficult to understand. If the additional savings of Rs 100 substituted the money spent on eating out, then the people working in the restaurant lose out on incomes. This leads to the restaurant workers cutting down on their purchases, say new clothes for their children. This triggers a vicious cycle of sorts. The Covid-19 pandemic has added another layer to this — forced savings. This is because social distancing requirements stopped a lot of people from undertaking spending such as eating out, travelling or taking vacations, even if they wanted to. The fall in PFCE more than compensated for the increase in household savings in the quarter ending June 30. While things would have improved after the June quarter — much of April and May was in an almost complete lockdown — the magnitude of this improvement will only be known once we have more data. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();3. Rising food inflation’s impact on poor householdsRetail inflation, especially the food component of it, has been very high in the past one year. Food inflation has been growing in double digits in the months of September and October. The fact that this comes on an already high base — food inflation grew at 5.1% and 7.9% in September and October last year — means that absolute prices are really high. Food items have a weight of 39% (47% in rural areas and 30% in urban areas) in the average CPI (consumer price index) basket. As is to be expected, food items have a much bigger weight in consumption spending of poor households. According to the 2011-12 Consumption Expenditure Survey of the National Sample Survey Office — these are the latest available figures — the bottom 50% of household spent more than half their consumption expenditure on food. At a time when pandemic-related headwinds to income and employment continue to persist, the sharp rise in food prices must have created a big squeeze on non-food spending by poor households. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();4. Stocks rally driven by an ‘investment of last resort’?India’s benchmark equity index, the BSE Sensex reached an all-time high on November 18. That this has happened is not surprising. The stock market has shown what is referred to as a V-shaped recovery after falling temporarily in the initial phase of the lockdown. This is despite the fact that most institutional forecasts have predicted a double-digit contraction for the Indian economy in the current financial year. What explains this? A look at one of the most basic indicators of stock market performance, the price to earnings or PE multiple, suggests that the current stock market rally is not backed by objective performance. The PE multiple measures price of a share to earnings per share. This multiple has increased rapidly after the lockdown, underlining the speculative nature of the current boom. This, when read with the fact that the rest of the economy does not have many investment opportunities to offer could also mean that it has been acting as “an investment of last resort” of sorts for people with a glut of savings. An economy where the relatively poor have lost incomes and jobs, are having to spend more on buying food, and where the rich are facing a savings glut because they cannot spend even if they want to and are perhaps therefore investing in stocks presents a mixed picture. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-decoding-the-nature-of-the-economic-recovery/story-0p02Z5Syux6xlVgoUQltrI.html
20-11-2020||India||UP child molester nabbed: Whistleblower tipped off CBI, gave key proof||An anonymous whistleblower tipped off the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and provided evidence against a Uttar Pradesh government employee who is facing life imprisonment for allegedly sexually exploiting 50 children for a decade and distributing photos and videos of their abuse to paedophiles across the world, said officers of the agency on Thursday.This anonymous whistleblower -- whom CBI referred to as a “reliable source” in its first information report (FIR) --gave the investigators a pen drive with 34 videos, 679 pictures, three phone numbers and three email IDs used to post the videos on the dark web, according to the FIR, a copy of which has been seen by HT. This tranche of evidence, along with the agency’s own investigation, helped the CBI zero in on Ram Bhavan Singh,a suspended junior engineer with the Uttar Pradesh irrigation department who was posted in Chitrakoot district for the past 11 years and allegedly molested children between 5 and 16. “This reliable source told the CBI that Ram Bhavan and others were involved in transmission of obscene material depicting children in sexual acts, as well as unnatural offences committed on minors, in Banda, Chitrakoot and nearby areas in Uttar Pradesh,” said one of the officials quoted above. The whistleblower may be connected to the operation, added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.Singh -- who is charged under the Information Technology Act, Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Act and Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code -- is currently in Banda jail. On Thursday, additional district and sessions judge Rizwan Ahmad fixed November 24 for the hearing and ordered that the accused remain in judicial custody till November 30.The deferral came following objections raised by defence counsel Anurag Singh Chandel on Thursday. The CBI’s lawyer Ashok Kumar Singh sought time to file a rejoinder. Singh, 40, is accused of sexually abusing children from Banda, Chitrakoot and Hamirpur districts -- often targeting victims from poor and underprivileged families who he lured with gadgets and electronics. He is also accused of victimising the children of some of his relatives. A second official said during investigation, the CBI found one of the numbers provided by the whistleblower was used to post child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on the dark web, the portion of the internet not covered by search engines and, hence, mostly beyond access for typical users. Often, dark web sites are used for cyber crime because it cannot be accessed by traditional methods or browsers.This particular number was registered to the junior engineer on his address in Banda -- where he was arrested from on Monday by the CBI’s special unit called Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Prevention/ Investigation (OCSAE) that deals with matters pertaining to online child sexual abuse and exploitation.A third official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said investigators suspect Singh may not have been working alone, but was part of a syndicate. This is the reason the CBI has added “others” to the FIR.The first official said the three email IDs used to post the videos on the dark web needed sign-in credentials, as otherwise the content was locked behind a paywall to maintain a high degree of anonymity.The FIR mentions that Singh used three mobile phone numbers and three email addresses to upload videos of child abuse. During searches, the CBI recovered eight mobile phones, around eight lakh rupees in cash, sex toys, laptop, and other digital evidence carrying huge amount of CSAM. CBI alleged Singh targeted children of street vendors, daily wagers, pavement dwellers and domestic helps who worked at his two-room rented house in Chitrakoot, where he lived for 10 years. The children hailed from Banda, Chitrakoot and Hamirpur districts.“During interrogation, the accused revealed that he targeted children who could easily be lured with money, electronic gadgets, eatables or any other thing they were deprived of. Ram Bhavan believed that he could easily handle the families,” said the third official.This official said on two occasions in the past 10 years, the children complained about him to their parents, but Singh allegedly hushed up the matter by paying money to the poor parents. The parents also may have chosen to remain silent, fearing that going public with the accusation would bring their families a bad name.Singh came on the radar of the CBI’s OCSAE unit after the agency busted the location of uploading child pornography recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-child-molester-nabbed-whistleblower-tipped-off-cbi-gave-key-proof/story-8twCeoMv7ex9ceTRziJe0L.html
20-11-2020||India||Court summons law student who accused Chinmayanand of rape for appearance on Nov 27||The special MP-MLA court on Thursday ordered the law student who had accused former Union minister Swami Chinmayanand of sexual harassment, to appear on November 27 before it to record her statements.“The court has ordered the law student to appear before it to record her statements as to why she has disowned her allegations of sexual harassment against Chinmayanand,” said Abhay Tripathi, prosecution lawyer representing the state. Meanwhile, accountant Gaurav Gupta of the Swami Shukdevanand Post-Graduate College, Shahjahanpur, where the law student studied, appeared before the court to record his statement. He was the sixth prosecution witness to appear before the court of Pawan Kumar Rai, special judge. The former minister is president of the managing committee of the college. Gupta testified that the law student was also working in the college library while studying law and was drawing salary. The prosecution has listed 33 witnesses to appear before the court. Thereafter, the defence will get an opportunity to produce their witnesses. The law student had disowned her accusations before the court, through her lawyer, on October 13 last and denied that she had levelled any allegation of sexual harassment against Chinmayanand. A case has been filed against her under Section 340 of the Cr PC for lying in court. This is a miscellaneous case in addition to the ongoing State Vs Chinmayanand case. “In all her FIRs, even the one lodged in New Delhi, the law student had levelled allegations of sexual harassment against the former minister. Now she has disowned these allegations. This is a clear case of perjury,” Tripathi pointed out. The sexual harassment case came to light in August last year when the woman went missing from Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh. Later, she released videos alleging rape and sexual harassment by the former minister. The state government formed a special investigation team (SIT) to investigate the matter and SIT lodged an FIR against the former minister under Section 376-C of the IPC. It also implicated the law student for extortion.Chinmayanand and the law student were arrested and sent to jail in September last year. In February this year, the Allahabad high court granted bail to Chinmayanand. The woman also secured bail and is currently out of jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-summons-law-student-who-accused-chinmayanand-of-rape-for-appearance-on-nov-27/story-Ou4Wrrwzmrp3pCX3kOlzVO.html
20-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Wednesday, New York City decided to shut its public schools from Thursday after the city reached a positivity rate (seven-day average) of 3%. This is among the lowest bars anywhere in the US, but given New York’s debilitating first brush with the pandemic back in March and April, it is one that is perhaps justified. New York moved quickly to reopen some of its public schools in September, but with the second wave of the pandemic beginning to take hold of the city (and the state), it has been clear for days now that a closure was imminent.The announcement of the closure came around the same time Unicef released a report on the impact of Covid-19 on children, which said that only 24% of schoolchildren around the world have access to Internet channels. India is relatively better off. A recent study by Azim Premji University found that 40% of children in 1,522 schools surveyed across 26 districts in five states had access to online methods of learning.Also Read: New York City schools to close again to stop renewed spread of Covid-19India’s approach to schooling during the pandemic has been very different from that of most other countries. In Europe and the US (and even Australia), the emphasis has been on keeping schools open as long as possible. During phased lockdowns imposed in some regions in these countries and in Europe, schools have usually been the last to close – and the first to reopen. India kept schools closed for months, and allowed their partial and conditional reopening only in mid-October, although many states and Union territories didn’t do this till November. Some still haven’t. India’s decision wasn’t entirely unexpected; nor is it unjustified. It is difficult to ensure social distancing, masking, and other protocols, in both public schools as well as private ones of varying hues. There’s also the issue of transport – many children use public or shared transport to get to school and back, and a large-scale reopening of schools could overwhelm a transport system that itself is returning to normal only now.Yet, science is reasonably clear that the risks of returning to school are extremely low for younger children.As the Unicef report points out “data from 191 countries collected from February to September show no consistent association between school reopening status and Covid-19 infection rates”. The report also refers to a study across 31 countries by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control that found “child-to-child transmission in schools was uncommon and not the primary cause of Covid-19 in children who were infected during the time that they attended school”. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIt is older schoolchildren who are more at risk (and, of course, teachers and staff). Many Indian states have allowed schools to reopen for older children, though, worried especially about those in Class X and Class XII (the two years when children appear for examinations conducted by their respective boards) who may either not have access to online resources or not be taking well to online education.This columnist believes that states and Union territories should have reopened schools for younger children – despite the logistical and other challenges, it is safer for them to be in school, than older children – and also ensure, as Dispatch 108 on July 18 suggested, that every child has access to a device and an Internet connection. This would have helped address contingencies, such as the one New York is facing now, and also dealt with the issue of older children. Indeed, children from Classes IX to XII who are currently allowed in school in most states should be the ones staying at home simply because they face higher risks of infection (than younger children).Finally, as the Unicef report explains, young children depend on schools for more than just education – “… nutrition, psychosocial support and health services…”It would be unfair to deprive them of those.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-aEYa5wGhep3qMxnx3mO3pN.html
20-11-2020||India||BJP seeks Naveen Patnaik’s resignation after 2 custodial deaths in Odisha||Odisha’s director general of police on Thursday promised action as per NHRC guidelines hours after two custodial deaths in Sundargarh and Puri district triggered massive protests with people trying to force their way into a police station and the opposition BJP demanding the resignation of chief minister Naveen Patnaik.DGP Abhay said police were waiting for post-mortem reports in the case of two alleged cases of custodial deaths in Puri and Biramitrapur town in which a 33-year-old and 26-year-old youth died respectively. The police chief said the autopsies were being videographed.“Necessary action would be taken as per NHRC guidelines,” he said.In Puri, family members of a Telugu youth named K Ramesh and members of Puri Bar Association staged protest after reports that Ramesh of Baseli Sahi had died in police custody. The family members of the youth had a face-off with police at district headquarters hospital where the post-mortem was being conducted. The members of Puri Bar Association also joined the protest alleging police excesses.Denying any excesses, Puri’s superintendent of police Akhileswar Singh said they got a tip-off on Wednesday that Ramesh, a known anti-social, was planning to execute a crime. “When a team of police chased to catch him, Ramesh attacked the security forces. There was a scuffle between the police and Ramesh during which he sustained injuries. Some of our officers also got minor injuries. He was taken to the police station and later shifted to hospital after he complained of body pain. He was declared dead by the doctors. We are however treating the death as custodial death,” said Singh.The SP said the accused was recently released from Talcher jail and several cases were pending against him in Sadar, Sea Beach and Kumbharpada police stations in Puri.In Biramitrapur town of Sundargarh district, an irate mob tried to storm into Biramitrapur police station on Thursday after a 26-year-old youth named Tariq Salim allegedly died in police custody.Tariq worked in a garage and was picked up by cops on Wednesday in connection the case of kidnapping of a businessman. However, his health deteriorated and he was admitted to the Kuarmunda Hospital and later shifted to the Rourkela Government Hospital where he died. Following his death, hundreds of locals gheraoed Biramitrapur police station alleging custodial death.“There were injury marks on Tariq’s body and we suspect he was thrashed inside the police station. We have no idea why police picked Tariq as the officials did not inform us anything,” said a protestor.Sundergarh SP Sagarika Nath however refuted the allegation of custodial death saying the youth died in hospital after complaining of uneasiness. “On advice of the doctors, we shifted him to RGH where he was declared brought dead,” she said, adding that a DSP ranked officer will conduct a probe and strict action will be taken against those found guilty.The twin custodial deaths gave the opposition ammunition a day ahead of the winter session of the Odisha assembly with leader of opposition Pradipta Naik of the BJP demanding chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s resignation.“We would take on the government on deteriorating law and order situation in the state. CM Naveen should leave his chair at once, because he seems to have become morally bankrupt.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-seeks-naveen-natnaik-s-resignation-after-two-custodial-deaths-in-odisha/story-0VSSDsmujqE5QSkDMIDsFK.html
20-11-2020||India||India, EU condemn use of proxies for cross-border terrorism||In an indirect reference to Pakistan, India and the European Union on Thursday called on all nations to take immediate and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under their control is used for terrorist attacks on other countries. The virtual counter-terrorism dialogue between the EU and India also strongly condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations, including the “use of terrorist proxies for cross-border terrorism”, according to a joint statement. Without naming Pakistan, the joint statement said the two sides “reviewed threats posed by UN-sanctioned terrorist entities and emphasised the need for concerted action against all terrorist networks”. The statement added: “They also underlined the urgent need for all countries to take immediate, sustained and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under their control is used for terrorist attacks on other countries.” India and EU are currently negotiating a working arrangement between Europol and the Central Bureau of Investigation to support law enforcement authorities on both sides in preventing and combating organised crime and terrorism. The two sides sought stronger international cooperation to combat terrorism in a comprehensive and sustained manner, and said it is crucial to bring perpetrators of violence and terrorism to justice. “India condemned the recent terror attacks in the member states of the European Union and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. The EU reiterated its condemnation of terrorist attacks in India, including 26/11 Mumbai, Pathankot and Pulwama, and reiterated its support for the people and government of India in the fight against terrorism,” the joint statement said. The two sides described counter-terrorism cooperation as an important element of the EU-India strategic partnership, and discussed the need to work together at multilateral forums such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Global Counterterrorism Forum and the UN, including the UN High-Level Counter-terrorism Week 2021 and the upcoming review of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. They also exchanged views on counter-terrorism challenges, including radicalisation and violent extremism, terror financing, and terrorist use of the internet. “The participants also discussed sanctions as a tool to combat terrorism, including designations of certain terrorist groups and individuals. They discussed ways to deepen cooperation between Indian agencies and their European counterparts, including Europol, to enhance interaction in the sphere of counter-terrorism,” the joint statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-condemn-use-of-proxies-for-cross-border-terrorism/story-icyQSxkiZ23YukS7XU6MrO.html
20-11-2020||India||Bharat Biotech vaccine trial results out soon||Bharat Biotech’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine Covaxin’s phase 2 trial results are ready to be out, according to government officials familiar with the development . “We are expecting the phase 2 results of Covaxin to be made available any time now,” said a senior government official, requesting not to be identified. The company recently announced that it had started phase 3 trials for its vaccine candidate which is India’s first vaccine candidate against Covid-19. VK Paul, member (Health), Niti Aayog, who also chairs the national vaccine administration committee, in a briefing on Covid-19 situation on Tuesday had also said that they were expecting the phase 2 results soon. “For the Bharat Biotech-ICMR vaccine candidate, Covaxin, has also progressed, and phase 3 has started. The results of their phase 2 trials are expected anytime now,” Dr Paul had said. For the Phase 2 trial, Bharat Biotech had recruited 400 participants, and for its phase 1 trial 375 participants were recruited. The vaccine candidate seems to have been largely safe, and significantly triggered body’s immune response needed to fight off the infection, according to the officials. Covaxin has been developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV) using inactivated Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The virus was isolated in an ICMR lab. The company is looking at a production capacity of about 150 million doses annually. Five vaccines against Covid-19 are at various stages of human trials in the country, of which two candidates are currently undergoing the advanced phase 3 trials. Apart from Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India is conducting the phase 3 trial with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate. Cadila’s vaccine candidate, ZyCovD, has also completed the phase 2 trial, and is awaiting results even as the follow up period is nearing its end. The sputnik V Russian vaccine phase 2/3 trial, for which India’s Dr Reddy’s labs has tied up with the Russian vaccine developers and is moving ahead in collaboration, is going to start next week. Also, Biological E vaccine candidate will also start early phase1/2 trials soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-vaccine-trial-results-out-soon/story-XkyFXE6KuDOmdhQmShynZO.html
20-11-2020||India||Feluda test kit to be made available in 8 metro cities||New Delhi Feluda, the indigenously developed testing kit for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) based on the gene-editing technology Crispr will be rolled out across eight centres of Apollo hospitals in eight metro cities, beginning with Delhi, people familiar with the matter said. The kit was launched by the Tata group in collaboration with the Apollo group of hospitals on Thursday.The test kit would first become available in Apollo labs in Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, and Ahmedabad, people aware of the matter said, identifying the first week of December for the rollout. The Apollo group has 100 clinics and 75 labs nationwide, which will progressively adopt the new technology for testing. The kit has been commercially branded as TataMD Check, and offers results within 45 minutes with accuracy levels comparable to the gold standard of Covid-19 tests: the RT-PCR method. The new test will work by collecting a swab sample from which RNA is extracted and amplified using a thermocycler. The sample is then tested using a paper strip barcoded with the Cas-9 protein of the Crispr system, which recognises the genetic material of the Sars-CoV-2 virus . The strip displays lines to show whether a person has the virus that causes Covid-19, just like a home-based pregnancy testing kit. The Tata MD Check will use an artificial intelligence based mobile application to capture a photograph of the test strip and give the results to eliminate errors. “Initially, the samples will be read both manually and with the AI technology just to be doubly sure. Eventually, the process can be completely automated,” said Chandrashekhar, CEO of Apollo Healthcare and Lifestyle Limited.  “RT-PCR tests have to be conducted in a batch and then every result has to be validated by a trained person, which takes time. In this, smaller number of samples can also be tested and the AI-based system means that the test can be quickly read and uploaded,” said Girish Krishnamurthy, CEO of Tata MD. “This is not just a test kit, it is a testing solution,” said Krishnamurthy. The test results will also have photographs of the sample collected and the sample in the laboratory to increase transparency. The kits can be monitored at every level of transportation and a sensor on the packaging checks that they were stored at the right temperature. “The addition of Tata MD Check as part of the testing arsenal will be a boost to the ongoing efforts against this pandemic. We are happy to further the cause of AatmaNirbhar Bharat in providing the launch pad for adoption of this indigenously developed test. Individuals can download Apollo 24/7 app with the benefit of availing reports within 2 hours,” said Dr Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals. Although the Tata Medical and Diagnostics Ltd (TataMD) did not give the actual cost to consumers, they maintained the price would comply with “government capping” for other molecular tests such as RT-PCR, CBNAAT or TrueNat. The team of scientists that had developed the test at Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology had said that not only would the test be simpler and as accurate as RT-PCR but is likely to be cheaper than it. The new kit has a high sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 98%, meaning it can accurately detect both positive and negative cases. It was approved for use by the Indian Council of Medical Research in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/feluda-test-kit-to-be-made-available-in-8-metro-cities/story-sOAr6repyHYSWkkylPsGsK.html

Reports cited Covid-19 pandemic restrictions which don’t allow political meetings as the reason for his detention. “Entire Tamil Nadu is against a repressed AIADMK under the fascist BJP regime,” tweeted Udhayanidhi after being detained. “I launched this campaign to unite us in this sentiment.” DMK on Friday introduced a 75-day long statewide campaign called ‘Stalin’s voice towards a new dawn’ in the run-up to the assembly elections in early 2021 in Tamil Nadu. Udhayanidhi launched the campaign in Thirukkuvalai (in Nagapattinam) -- the birthplace of DMK patriarch and former chief minister M Karunanidhi. The two-fold objective of the campaign is to highlight “10 years of misrule under the AIADMK government” and to consult with people to shape DMK’s policies. Senior party leaders condemned his arrest and called for his immediate release. DMK MP Kanimozhi questioned how chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami travelled for meetings. As news of the arrest unfolded, AIADMK’s consultative meeting at their party headquarters in Chennai was going on, ahead of Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to the city.Superintendent of Police of Nagapattinam district, Om Prakash Meena confirmed that Udhayanidhi and DMK party workers were arrested for violating Covid-19 restrictions and were later released. While they were briefly detained at a marriage hall, the party staged road blockades in different districts in the state. Udhayanidhi has said he will continue with the campaign “despite obstacles”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmk-chief-s-son-udhayanidhi-stalin-detained-while-launching-poll-campaign-released-later/story-pBUjUKlaSrZgad0dYygw6K.html

20-11-2020||India||Crucial Kerala BJP meet fails to placate senior party rebels||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) core committee meeting in Kerala on Friday failed to placate a section of leaders who had raised the banner of revolt against the style of functioning of state president K Surendran, said a senior leader who attended the meet. In the midst of local body elections, considered a semi-final before the assembly election due in five months, the party central leadership had issued an ultimatum to the state unit to set the house in order and summoned Surendran to Delhi last week. Dissension in the unit came out in the open after a section was sidelined after the elevation of Surendran. Senior leaders Shobha Surendran, P M Velayudhan and K P Sreesan have expressed their displeasure openly. In the state unit there are two prominent groups-- one led by Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan and the other by senior leader P K Krishnadas. The state president is reported to be close to the junior MEA and the other faction alleged that many senior functionaries were sidelined after his elevation. But Surendran denied this saying dissension in the party was the creation of a section of the media. “We had the core meeting to discuss strategy for the local body elections. Dissension is only a media creation. The state unit is united and we will face the poll as a single bloc,” he said. But a senior leader among the dissenters said if the party goes to the local body polls in the present condition, the outcome will be disastrous. There are reports that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is also upset with the growing dissension in the party. Shobha Surendran and many other leaders kept away from the core committee meeting on Friday. When contacted, Shobha Surendran refused to talk. “Some of the senior leaders who were in the party for long were sidelined for more than seven months. The present leadership failed to recognise people who really toiled. It is the duty of the leadership to take everyone along,” said the senior leader admitting the situation was fluid. He said at least 300 district and block-level leaders were keeping away from active politics. A senior RSS leader also said the political situation was fertile for the party in the backdrop of the gold smuggling and narcotics cases that had gripped the ruling dispensation but infighting is threatening to spoil the party’s chances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crucial-kerala-bjp-meet-fails-to-placate-senior-party-rebels/story-rAxO2WnC2GzXufH18FtlcO.html

Particularly lauding the concept of home isolation, the Delhi chief minister said that a large number of people had effectively managed to recover from the viral disease since they had been put in isolation and treated within the safety net of their homes.WATCH | ‘Every Delhiite will get health e-card’: Kejriwal govt’s new plan #HTLS2020“We initiated a home isolation concept very early this year. Currently, there are 43,000 active Covid-19 cases in Delhi but I do not have that many number of beds in hospitals dedicated for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Nearly 25,000 patients of the viral disease are being treated at home under proper supervision of doctors appointed by the government,” he said.ALSO READ | Delhi’s Covid-19 positivity rate dipped by 5% in 5 days, says Arvind Kejriwal at HTLS 2020Plasma therapy which has been one of the key treatment strategies of Delhi’s handling of the Covid-19 health crisis also came in for a fair share of praise. The Delhi chief minister said that plasma therapy was introduced in the national capital for the first time as early as the month of May. Later, he pointed out that the therapy was also adopted by the United States for treating critically ill Covid-19 patients.The Delhi chief minister pointed out that tele-counselling was another innovation put in place by the Delhi government to provide infrastructural support to those infected with Covid-19 and placed under home isolation. Doctors have been calling such patients twice a day to monitor their health condition and offer appropriate advice. Oximeters were also provided by the Delhi government so that Covid-19 patients under home isolation could monitor their oxygen levels and alert their family members in the event of a dip in their oxygen levels.Kejriwal was participating in the 18th edition of the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit (HTLS) in conversation with HT’s Executive Editor Kunal Pradhan.

Around 32,000 travellers had already arrived from infected countries in the capital without any screening,” the chief minister said.He added that as on March 22, when the Delhi government first asked the district officials to identify all the passengers and attempt to isolate them. It was practically impossible to identify these people,” Kejriwal reasoned.He cited the above example to argue that Delhi had faced “several extraordinary situations” during the past days and there have been several factors that were “not in our (the government’s) control” but we (the city) still stood up to the challenge.“Delhi didn’t start its fight (against coronavirus) with a zero, it started with, who knows how many thousand positive cases,” Kejriwal said.The CM was in conversation with HT’s executive editor Kunal Pradhan for 18th Hindustan Times Leadership Summit on Friday evening.HTLS 2020: Delhi likely to get cloud-based medical services next year, says Arvind KejriwalThe chief minister also stated that the rise in pollution levels in winters since October 10 due to stubble burning is another factor that is not in the city’s control but contributes to worsening of the infection in the capital.“Delhi has taken several steps to control pollution generated by the city but it has no control over pollution contributed by outside factors. All experts say that pollution has contributed in a big way in bringing the third wave of coronavirus in Delhi,” he said.Pollution also aggravates the coronavirus in patients, he said citing experts.Also Read: Lockdown was necessary, Covid-19 cases were brought under control: Arvind Kejriwal at HTLS 2020Kejriwal further claimed that despite the big peak of cases seen in the third wave, which was way bigger than the one seen in cities like New York, the city had managed the crisis well.“The third wave-- on 11th November, 8593 cases were registered in Delhi. New York City saw a peak on april 6 with 6353 cases. 575 patients died in NY city that day. Patients couldn’t find beds, they were made to lie on roads outside hospitals; there were corpses lying in a heap. NewYork, one of the best cities in one of the most developed countries, had collapsed but Delhi didn’t (during the Covid peak). Delhi is still sustaining,” Kejriwal said.“We have 7.5 thousand corona beds and 450 vacant ICU beds in Delhi as of today. We will add another 100-1500 ICU beds to this capacity in the next couple of days,” he added, backing his argument that Delhi planned and dealt with coronavirus in a much better manner.He revealed that the city’s positivity rate had come down in the last five days by 5% to around 10% and this offers hope that the third wave will blow away very soon if the trend of drop in positivity rates continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htls-2020-delhi-s-covid-fight-didn-t-start-from-zero-yet-we-have-done-well-says-kejriwal/story-fsgvvvUmL4NalSKd9BY9NN.html
20-11-2020||India||Marriage between first cousins illegal: Punjab and Haryana HC||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has said that marriage between first cousins is illegal.The court said that marriage which petitioner man wants to perform with a girl, who is his first cousin, was also per se illegal. “...the submission in the present petition that as and when she (the girl) attains the age of 18 years, they will perform marriage is also per se illegal,” the judge said on Thursday while hearing the petition. The assertion came after a 21-year-old man moved the high court against state of Punjab seeking anticipatory bail in a case registered under Sections 363 (kidnapping), 366A (procuration of minor girl) of the IPC at police station Khanna City-2 in Ludhiana district on August 18. The state counsel, while opposing the bail plea, contented that the girl was a minor and her parents had lodged the FIR as she and the man were first cousins and their fathers were brothers. The man’s counsel told Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan that the petitioner had also filed a criminal writ petition, along with the girl, for protection of life and liberty. The court file of the criminal writ petition was summoned during the hearing and as per its memorandum of parties, the girl was stated to be 17 years of age and the petitioner man had filed the petition with the submission that both of them were in a “live-in-relationship”. It was stated in the petition that date of birth of the girl was August 2003 and on the date of filing the petition on September 3, 2020, she was of the age of 17 years and 14 days. Along with petition, a representation was also annexed, in which the girl had stated that her parents loved their sons but ignored her, therefore, she decided to live with her friend (petitioner) and on that account, she was apprehending that her parents can harass them and disturb the peace of their mind. The court disposed of this petition on September 7. The state was directed to grant them protection if any threat was perceived to the man and the girl. However, the judge made it clear “that this order shall not be taken to protect the petitioners (man and the girl) from legal action for violation of law, if any, committed by them”. The judge, after hearing counsel for the parties in the present petition, said, “I find that in the present petition also, the petitioner has not disclosed about the fact that he is first cousin of the girl and, therefore, the submission in the present petition that as and when she attains the age of 18 years, they will perform marriage is also per se illegal.” While opposing the anticipatory bail plea, the state counsel argued “that the girl was aged about 17 years and is a minor, therefore, her parents have got the FIR registered as the youth and the girl are the first cousins as their fathers are real brothers”. “Hence the petitioner has concealed the fact in the petition that they fall in the prohibited ‘sapinda’ (which prohibits marriage between two individuals if they have common ancestor) under the Hindu Marriage Act and cannot perform marriage with each other,” the state counsel argued. “Once the petitioner and the girl are prohibited from performing marriage with each other, there is no question of their being in any live-in-relationship, which is per se immoral and not acceptable in the society,” it was argued. The counsel for the petitioner has sought time from the court to address arguments and the case was adjourned to January next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marriage-between-first-cousins-illegal-punjab-and-haryana-hc/story-QgO0F6OdyEim5TdY5WTfxH.html

There has been no change,” a top diplomat told Hindustan Times, responding to buzz in Kathmandu that New Delhi could put off Shringla’s visit amid the uncertainty around PM Oli.The visit is the first formal diplomatic contact between the two sides after relations between the two neighbours nosedived after Nepal opposed an 80 km-border road to Lipulekh region, which is claimed by Nepal. Kathmandu responded by issuing a new map that showed Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal.The Indian foreign secretary’s visit is expected to help put bilateral ties back on an even keel and will focus on deepening people-to-people ties. Apart from PM Oli, Shringla is scheduled to meet his counterpart Bharat Raj Paudyal, who took charge just last month, foreign minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, and call on President Bidhya Devi Bhandari as well.Shringla’s visit will take place at a time PM Oli faces the third, and according to reports from Kathmandu, the most serious challenge to his authority from within the ruling Nepal Communist Party where he is pitted against Pushpa Kamal Dahal, better known by his nom de guerre Prachanda.Pushpa Kamal Dahal, according to Kathmandu Post, has presented a political document that accuses PM Oli of failing to govern the country that has provoked a stinging response from the prime minister at a party meeting this week. The communist party’s secretariat is due to meet on November 28, which will be followed by its 44-member Standing Committee meeting on December 3.

More than 50,000 (50,025) Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) are now operational across the country.“Aiming at providing Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) services to the communities closer to their homes, 1.5 lakh AB-HWCs are to be established by December 2022. With more than 50,000 having been established, one-third of the target has been met. This has led to improved access to affordable primary healthcare services for more than 25 crore people,” according to the press release issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare congratulated the States/UTs for their efforts in operationalizing the HWCs despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.“This has been possible due to the joint efforts of the Center and the States/UTs in planning, monitoring at all levels, standardization of processes, the flexibility for adaptation provided to the States/UTs, and building on the health systems created thus far”, he stated.The Union Health Minister especially thanked the frontline health workers, the Medical Officers, the Community Health Officers and ASHAs for their dedication to the cause of providing Comprehensive Primary Health Care services and for supporting millions of people with necessary services in these difficult times.“They are the backbone of the healthcare delivery system. Their contribution during the Covid-19 period has been exemplary”, he said.Also Read | Elderly, those with chronic diseases to get vaccine first: Harsh VardhanHowever, the national capital, Delhi will not be implementing the program. “HWCs have helped in interventions such as risk communication, contact tracing, community surveillance and early identification of cases, and seamless provisioning of non-Covid-19 essential health services for ensuring the protection of vulnerable groups, such as the newborn, elderly and those with co-morbidities.”, the press release added.Ayushman Bharat was launched in 2018 with its twin pillars of Health & Wellness Centers (HWCs) and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) with bidirectional linkages between the two for providing the full range of services across the continuum of care. The first AB-HWC was launched by Hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on the 14th of April 2018 at Jhangla in Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh.The 50,025 operational AB-HWCs are now spread across 678 districts, and include 27,890 Sub Health Centres, 18,536 Primary Health Centres and 3,599 Urban Primary Health Centres.

More than 6.43 crore people have been screened for hypertension, 5.23 crore for diabetes and 6.14 crore people for cancers. About 1.0 crore people are being provided free drugs for the treatment of hypertension and about 60 lakhs for diabetes.The Health & Wellness Centers provide CPHC services to people and sustain the efforts for provision of reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child, adolescent and nutrition (RMNCHA+N) services and control of communicable diseases. They also focus on disease prevention, especially for chronic and non-communicable diseases, wellness through community engagement and creating awareness about health lifestyles, appropriate nutrition and physical activities such as Yoga.Focus on wellness is one of the novel interventions under the ABHWC Programme. Over 30 lakhs wellness sessions have been conducted at these centers including activities such as Yoga, Zumba, Community Walks, Shirodhara, Meditation etc.HWCs also provide a strong backbone for the implementation of the eSanjeevani platform of Health Ministry which includes the eSanjeevani Patient-to-Doctor OPD and eSanjeevani-HWCwhich provides Doctor-to-Doctor teleconsultation service. 23,103 HWCs have started providing teleconsultation services to citizens. More than 7.5 lakh teleconsultations have already been conducted through these platforms. The eSanjeevani-HWC was rolled out in November 2019.

In fact, I shot for a film in 2020 too. So, my stage debut in Lucknow is finally happening in style that too for such a wonderful cause. Being part of LU’s 100-year celebration is something that will be cherished always,” said ‘Chakravartin Ashoka Samrat’ actor.Amit has a career spanning three decades with numerous plays, shows and films but feels theatre is and will be his first love. “Theatre gives me that instant creative satisfaction that no other mediums can give — be it on the spot audience connect or using every bit of you as an actor. In TV, you have limited shots to etch your role as the show progresses. Though I do find strong synergy between theatre and cinema.”With films like ‘Shivay,’ ‘LOC-Kargil’, ‘Lakshya’ and shows like ‘Veer Shivaji’, ‘Adaalat’, ‘Savitri’ and over 75 plays Amit feels his background in Hindi due to his mother’s academic background which helped him to take up work in Hindi easily. “Not just Hindi, I have command over Marathi due to my origin so I have worked across regions be it Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Telugu and of course Urdu as I have worked for Ebrahim Alkazi saheb, one of the biggest theatre stalwarts in the country. So, I enjoy acting wherever I get an opportunity to outdo my earlier characters,” said the versatile actor.Amit will be performing with Salim Arif in the city for play ‘Paansa.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/my-stage-debut-in-lucknow-is-finally-happening/story-eBJHZfolrUbW4SmdoUHAWK.html
20-11-2020||India||‘LU days prepared my groundwork for right career growth’||Theatre personality, costume designer and actor Salim Arif credits his Lucknow University days (1977-80) for his across the spectrum growth. In his hometown, for LU’s Centenary Celebrations, he told HT City, “To do a project like ‘Bharat Ek Khoj’ contribution of Lucknow is more than my National School of Drama (NSD) training. Legends Shyam Benegal (BEK), Gulzar saheb (Mirza Ghalib), Chandra Prakash Dwivedi (Chanakya) all had confidence in me because of my groundwork that was prepared in LU campus. Thankfully, to understand them, I had a base which I learnt from my University legends.” He recalls that more than the classroom wisdom his understanding of various subjects percolated in him by the mentors in and around campus. “Campus was a bigger attraction than classroom. We learnt from Raj Bisaria saheb, Vilayat Jafri, Kunwar Narain, Raghubir Sahai, KN Kakkar, Mrs (Mohini) Manglik, Bisht and Nagar saheb.” Arif adds, “I read all classics in that period and studied paintings. My subjects were Maths, Psychology and English but my focus was extracurricular activities. During Shakespearian plays, I had an inclination towards performance studies which was a big learning for me.” During university days Arif successfully ventured into publishing a magazine. “I used to bring out a ‘jugadu’ magazine ‘Dhanakte Peepo Ka Shor’ (Echoing Drums) which I used to get typed, cyclostyled and distribute. Rakesh Chandra, Mehboob Mehndi Abdi and Sanjay Kapoor used to write while it had artwork of Madan Lal Nagar and Ranvir Singh Bisht. Those were post-emergency days and atmosphere was electric.” The playwright feels the synergy of campus with city’s cultural activity is now missing. “At campus academic is mandatory but also very important its extra-curricular activities. There was a deep bond between campus and cultural scene of the city. We need to bring that back!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lu-days-prepared-my-groundwork-for-right-career-growth/story-U4NIYHp4TjtsxlqRZ0K5EK.html

To implement skill-based, competency based education there is a need to transform and follow entire pedagogy based teaching-learning process be it classroom teaching, face-to-face teaching or online teaching.“The pedagogy based teaching-learning process is more about making students more curious, innovative, creative and providing them experiential learning and this can be achieved only when schools, teachers and principals change the teaching pedagogy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-board-exams-to-happen-for-sure-schedule-to-be-announced-soon-says-cbse-secretary/story-C1gC36Whax8BGy2zpkG1xJ.html

20-11-2020||India||Indo-Pacific concept a rejection of spheres of influence: Jaishankar||The concept of Indo-Pacific is a rejection of the spheres of influence and a reiteration that the world cannot be frozen for the benefit of a few even if that is the case with the United Nations, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Friday. Addressing a global town hall event via video-conferencing, Jaishankar also said that the Indo-Pacific was an indication of a future not a throwback to the past and “only those harbouring a Cold War mindset will see such intentions”. His remarks come in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle-flexing in the region which has become a major talking point among leading global powers. Jaishankar said there has been a growing recognition of the logic of the Indo-Pacific in recent times and the ASEAN’s outlook on it was a notable step. “Apart from the nations of the larger region, we’ve also seen Germany, France and the Netherlands subscribe recently to this approach. The need of the day is to give it a practical shape, this can be done by plurilateral diplomatic consultations such as the QUAD or it can be furthered in a structured fashion by the Indo-Pacific Oceans initiative that India tabled at the East Asia Summit in 2019,” Jaishankar said at the town hall session, titled ‘The Indo-Pacific and the COVID crisis’. “This is built on the seven pillars of maritime security; maritime ecology; maritime resources, capacity building and resource sharing; disaster risk reduction and management; science, technology and academic cooperation; and trade, connectivity and maritime transport,” he said. Jaishankar said that from any objective viewpoint, Indo-Pacific is a more contemporary description of the current reality. Such a landscape creates an ethos for greater cooperation -- one particularly necessary at a time when global goods are in short supply, he said. Jaishankar said that when challenges multiply but capacities do not keep pace, the answer is only in more intensified cooperation. Issues like maritime security, transparent and market-based connectivity or counter-terrorism do require such solutions, he said. “Indo-Pacific is also a rejection of spheres of influence and all that this may imply. It is a reiteration that the world cannot be frozen for the benefit of a few even if that is the case with the United Nations,” Jaishankar said. “It is an indication of a future not a throwback to the past. Only those harbouring a Cold War mindset will see such intentions,” the External Affairs Minister said. Every era produces its own strategic concepts and analytical constructs and the current one is no exception, Jaishankar said, adding that after all the sharp distinction between the Pacific and the Indian Ocean theatres was only made after the World War II. On June 1, 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined India’s vision for the Indo-Pacific region in his speech delivered at the Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore. India’s concept of the Indo-Pacific is inclusive in nature, and supports an approach that respects the right to freedom of navigation and overflight for all in the international seas. Jaishankar said that it was natural that different ideas and suggestions were at interplay and harmonising them was very much part of the pluralistic political culture that many support. In India’s case, the Indo-Pacific was a natural extrapolation of its Act East policy that has made China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Australia, amongst others, its major partners, he said. In his address, Jaishankar also highlighted India’s effective response to the COVID crisis and its emphasis on global cooperation to deal with global challenges. Noting that India had responded with determination and discipline to the Covid-19 challenge, he said an economy which did not make ventilators, testing kits, PPEs and N-95 masks, today not only caters to its own needs, but those beyond. “By setting up more than 15,000 dedicated COVID treatment facilities, we created an infrastructure to respond effectively. A high recovery rate and low case fatality rate speak for themselves, indeed does the social distancing culture and mass adoption of preventive measures,” Jaishankar said. But, for the world what is more important is the emphasis India has put on global cooperation to deal with global challenges, he said. Covid-19 created a spike in demand for pharmaceuticals, especially for hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol, and India ramped up production, as it responded to the requirement of others, he said. Pointing out that that now the focus has shifted to vaccine production and testing, he said both were essential to the return of travel normalcy. “India is deeply involved in many international collaborations and initiatives. Prime Minister Modi has committed to the UN that we will help make vaccines accessible and affordable to all,” Jaishankar said. He also said that it was revealing that in the midst of a pandemic, Indian diplomacy has put the Indo-Pacific approach into practice and provided assistance to Solomon Islands, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Tonga, Tuvalu and Palau for procurement of medical equipment and supplies to assist them in their response to Covid-19. “In a world where trust and transparency are now at a greater premium, it highlights the importance of building more resilient supply chains. It is also a reminder of the importance of multilateralism and that in turn requires adherence to a rule-based global order,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indo-pacific-concept-a-rejection-of-spheres-of-influence-jaishankar/story-60qd4dhJQye8yqxcrn4fuK.html

20-11-2020||India||‘BJP coined love jihad to divide nation,’ says Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for coining the term “love jihad” to divide the nation and create communal discord. He said there is no jihad in love while citing the term the Hindu right uses to describe marriages between Muslim men and Hindu women.“Love jihad is a word manufactured by the BJP to divide the nation and disturb communal harmony. Marriage is a matter of personal liberty, bringing a law to curb it is completely unconstitutional and it will not stand in any court of law. Jihad has no place in love,” Gehlot tweeted.Gehlot’s remarks came two days after Madhya Pradesh announced it will enact a law to regulate interfaith marriages with a provision of five years in jail for forcible conversion. Other BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have also said they will legislate to regulate inter-faith marriages.Also read | ‘Only Congress can keep nation united’: Gehlot attacks Sibal, takes Congress versus Congress a notch higherGehlot is the first senior Congress leader to speak out on the issue. He criticised the BJP for creating an environment, where consenting adults would be at the mercy of state power for marriage.“Marriage is a personal decision and they are putting curbs on it, which is like snatching away personal liberty,” he said. “It seems a ploy to disrupt communal harmony, fuel social conflict & disregard constitutional provisions like the state not discriminating against citizens on any ground.”Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat reacted to Gehlot’s tweets saying will deceit after religious conversions and changing of names not be called “love jihad”.“Dear Ashok ji, Love Jihad is a trap that has thousands of young women believing the marriage is a personal affair, where later it turns out it isn’t. Also, if it is a matter of personal liberty, then why are the women not free to keep their maiden name or religion?” Shekhawat asked. “Ashok ji, Since Congress wants to support this act of deceit under the garb of personal liberty, isn’t it becomes a blatant display of its communal agenda… The BJP has believed in Sabka Vikas hence will ensure our women folk are not subject to injustice of any kind.”BJP MLA and former education minister Vasudev Devnani also asked Gehlot to bring law in state, like Madhya Pradesh, stating that ‘love jihad’ needs to be stopped. “The CM holds the home department and the matter is of serious concern. A strong law should be made against love jihad,” he said.Political analyst Narayan Bareth said an atmosphere has been created wherein it is believed that such laws would be brought for targeting a specific community. He added it is aimed at polarisation. “Gehlot, being a prominent leader of Congress, would have understood the need to speak on the issue as it was getting traction and cannot be left unaddressed. His comments come at the time when the Congress leadership is busy handling infighting after the debacle in Bihar and show Gehlot’s growing political stature.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-coined-love-jihad-to-divide-nation-says-ashok-gehlot/story-e1teyTaP7eI2dLAAHUuLsK.html
20-11-2020||India||SC to hear plea on framing of rules to ensure data security on UPI platforms||The Supreme Court Friday said it would hear on November 23 the plea filed by Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam seeking direction to the RBI for framing regulation to ensure that data collected on UPI platforms is not “exploited” or used in any manner other than for processing payments.The matter came up for hearing before a bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian which listed it for hearing next week.On October 15, the apex court had sought responses from the Centre, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and others including Google Inc, Facebook Inc, WhatsApp and Amazon Inc on the plea.Viswam, the Communist Party of India (CPI) leader, has sought a direction to the RBI and the NPCI to ensure that data collected on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platforms is not shared with their parent company or any other third party under any circumstances.“In India, the UPI payments system is being regulated and supervised by Respondent no. 1 (RBI) and Respondent no. 2 (NPCI), however the RBI and the NPCI instead of fulfilling their statutory obligations and protecting and securing the sensitive data of users are compromising the interest of the Indian users by allowing the non-compliant foreign entities to operate its payment services in India,” the plea has alleged.“The RBI and NPCI have permitted the three members of ‘Big Four Tech Giants’ i.e. Amazon, Google and Facebook/WhatsApp (Beta phase) to participate in the UPI ecosystem without much scrutiny and in spite of blatant violations of UPI guidelines and RBI regulations,” it claimed.The plea has alleged that this conduct of RBI and NPCI put the sensitive financial data of Indian users at huge risks, especially when these entities have been “continuously accused of abusing dominance and compromising data”, among other things.It said these allegations have become particularly worrisome at a time when India has banned host of Chinese applications on the ground that those applications were or could be used for data theft and could lead to security breaches.It has further sought a direction that RBI and NPCI should ensure that WhatsApp is not permitted to launch full scale operations of ‘WhatsApp Pay’ in India without fulfilling all legal compliances to the satisfaction of the court regarding requisite regulatory compliances.It said that in April 2018, the RBI, with a view to secure the data of Indian users, had issued a circular directing all system providers to ensure that entire data relating to payment systems operated by them are stored in systems only in India and they were asked to ensure compliance by October 15, 2018.The plea claimed that later, the RBI toned down the April 2018 circular by issuing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and permitted processing of all payment transaction abroad, including domestic transactions.In the said FAQ it was clarified that in cases of data processing done abroad, the data should be deleted from the systems abroad and brought back to India within 24 hours, the plea said.It has sought the apex court’s direction to declare the FAQ dated June 26, 2019 issued by the RBI as ultra vires to the circular dated April 6, 2018.The plea referred to another pending petition in the apex court and said that in that matter, the counsel appearing for WhatsApp had undertook that his client would not go ahead with payment services without complying with all the regulation in force.It alleged that Google and Facebook already have access to “immense personal data of millions of Indian users” and if they are permitted to collect “unrestricted financial data” of Indian users while operating at the UPI platform, the same would give them “draconian control” over sensitive Indian data.

The two sides signed a framework agreement on Thursday for enhancing cooperation in the peaceful uses of space that will foster collaboration between several institutions of the two countries. “I am happy that work is progressing fast for Isro to send Bhutan’s satellite into space next year. For this, four young space engineers from Bhutan will come to Isro in December [for training],” Modi said during the virtual launch ceremony for the second phase of the RuPay Card scheme.

A ground earth station in Bhutan for using India’s South Asia satellite was inaugurated during Modi’s visit to the country in August last year, and Thimphu is using the facility for broadcasting and disaster management. Bhutan launched its first nano-satellite Bhutan-1, which was built with Japan’s assistance, on a SpaceX rocket in June 2018. Modi and his Bhutanese counterpart Lotay Tshering jointly launched the second phase of the RuPay Card scheme that will allow Bhutanese card-holders to access ATMs and point-of-sale terminals across India. The project’s first phase, which enabled Indian visitors to access ATMs and point-of-sale terminals across Bhutan, was launched during Modi’s visit last year. There have been 11,000 successful RuPay transactions in Bhutan so far and the figure would have been higher if travel between the two sides hadn’t been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Modi said. The RuPay cards issued to Bhutanese citizens will allow them to access more than 100,000 ATMs and two million point-of-sale terminals across India. Tshering said the two countries are “connected at heart” and thanked India for support in countering Covid-19. He also said he was thankful for India’s assurance to make Covid-19 vaccines available for Bhutan once they are ready.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-launch-bhutan-s-satellite-next-year-train-space-engineers/story-KDBqyTHtSdCga4iZn7uwLJ.html
20-11-2020||India||Post-poll rumblings: AICC Bihar in-charge, BPCC chief offer to resign||All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil and Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha have offered to resign from their respective posts in the wake of poor electoral performance of the party in recently held state assembly polls. However, both the leaders refused to comment on the development, saying that it was an internal issue of the party. “Currently, I am admitted in the hospital. It will not be appropriate to share an internal matter of the party,” said Gohil in response to an SMS. Jha also declined commenting. The Congress managed to win just 19 out of 70 it had contested under the Grand Alliance (GA) in the assembly polls, held in October-November this year. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Left parties, which are part of the GA, wrested 75 and 16 seats respectively and were left short of 13 seats from simple majority. In 2015 assembly polls, Congress had fared better and had won 27 seats out of 41 it had contested. Also read | Bihar Assembly Election 2020 Result: Were these the closest Bihar polls in 43 years?Chairman of the BPCC election campaign committee Akhilesh Prasad Singh, who did not find any reason to resign from his post, said he was not part of any of the decision-making of the AICC. “Let the Congress president discuss the causes of defeat and fix accountability. I am ready to do anything if I am held guilty,” said Singh, adding that he was not like those who step back in the face of challenge. Singh, also a Rajya Sabha member, said that he had sought an appointment with Rahul Gandhi to explain the reasons for defeat in detail. “Reviews shall be done... from identification of seats to contest to the selection of candidates to be fielded and management of campaign,” he added, apparently putting the blame on the AICC leaders involved in the process. Serious blame-game erupted in the party following the crushing defeat of its candidates in the fray. Even the RJD leaders blamed the Congress’ abysmal show in the election, which denied the GA a shot at running the state. Party insiders also felt that continued ad-hocism in the Congress from the state unit to the block-level had impacted the workers’ morale. They said the party had erred in identifying potentially winning seats and strong candidates to bet on during the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/post-poll-rumblings-aicc-bihar-in-charge-bpcc-chief-offer-to-resign/story-Srpb91E46LAIU7Rg00W6VK.html

20-11-2020||India||Kerala journalist PFI secretary, was using ID to create social unrest in Hathras: UP files affidavit in Supreme Court||The Uttar Pradesh government has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court alleging that the arrested Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan was the secretary of Popular Front of India (PFI) and was using his identity card that expired in 2018 to create social unrest in Hathras.On Monday, the top court had issued notice to the UP government and the state police seeking their response on a petition filed by Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ), challenging Kappan’s detention.The affidavit by the state was presented before a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde during the hearing of a petition filed by KUWJ to release Kappan, who is in custody since October 5. He was arrested while he was on his way to report the death of 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras who was brutally gang-raped in September.The state said, “The person in custody namely Siddique Kappan is the Office Secretary of Popular Front of India (PFI) using a journalist cover by showing identity card of a Kerela based newspaper named as ‘Tejas’ which was closed in 2018. It is revealed during investigation that he along with other PFI activists and their student wing (Campus Front of India) leaders were going to Hathras under the garb of Journalism with a very determined design to create a caste divide and disturb law and order situation.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the top court that the bail petition of Kappan was argued for nine days and this petition ought to be dismissed as remedy lies before Allahabad High Court. Mehta said that the petition falsely alleged that neither the family members nor the lawyers were allowed access to the accused. On the contrary, the state told the top court that no lawyer or family member of Kappan had contacted jail authorities to meet him. Kappan did not express any desire to contact any relative although his call records showed that he spoke with a lawyer on three occasions - November 2, 11 and 17. This fact was also not disclosed by the accused to the authorities, the affidavit said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal appearing for KUWJ sought time to file a response to the UP government’s reply. He further stated that the magistrate at Hathras did not permit the lawyer to meet Kappan to obtain his signature in order to represent him in a court.Mehta said there was no objection to the lawyer meeting the accused. The court recorded the statement and directed the petition to be taken up next week.Kappan has been charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for his alleged links with banned outfit PFI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-journalist-pfi-secretary-was-using-id-to-create-social-unrest-in-hathras-up-files-affidavit-in-supreme-court/story-Uft95gBMDK37LsRtIUFvWP.html
20-11-2020||India||BJP’s Babul Supriyo takes jibe at Mamata by starting President’s Rule in Bengal debate||Union minister Babul Supriyo has triggered a row by saying that there was a dawai (medicine) in the Indian Constitution that can prevent a state government from terrorising people and hinted that it is not impossible for the Centre to adopt that path.Supriyo said this while referring to the alleged killing of Bharatiya Janata Party workers in West Bengal by the ruling Trinamool Congress. Till date, more than 100 BJP workers have been killed in the state, allegedly by TMC but the latter has always rubbished the allegations every time fingers were pointed at it. “BJP workers are being killed. If didi (Mamata Banerjee) thinks that there is a weak government at the Centre, she would be making a grave mistake. The BJP will not have to do anything because there are provisions laid down in the Constitution itself on how to stop such a destructive and fierce government. The dawai for such governments is clearly mentioned in the Constitution. It is not impossible to take that path. So didi should not think she would keep on torturing the people over the next six months to keep the people away from casting their votes,” said Supriyo. The crucial assembly elections are less than six months away in West Bengal and the BJP has emerged as the principal opposition to the ruling TMC. After its impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, where the BJP bagged 18 of the 42 seats and around 40% of the vote share, it is now eyeing for the Bengal assembly. The TMC, however, has lashed out saying that the law and order situation is better in Bengal compared to Uttar Pradesh and that the party is not giving any importance to such statements. “By saying dawai, Babul Supriyo was referring to imposition of Article 356 of the Constitution in the state. But TMC is not taking this seriously. The Supreme Court has clearly stated on what needs to be done before Article 356 could be invoked. He is just making some political statements, which has no importance. If the Centre has to invoke Article 356, they first need to look into Uttar Pradesh,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP. This is, however, not the first time that Supriyo has made such remarks. In September, he had made similar statements of invoking President’s Rule in the state while referring to alleged killings of BJP workers. “The recent chain of events, ranging from the attack on a Sikh community member, the arrest of Al-Qaeda operatives to brazen murder of Manish Shukla and other political opponents, shows that it is a fit case for imposition of Article 365 in West Bengal,” Supriyo had earlier said. Political leaders said that demands made by some BJP leaders for imposition of President’s Rule would increase pressure on the TMC government. “The law and order in West Bengal has deteriorated definitely but not to the extent that President’s Rule needs to be imposed. The law and order in UP is much worse. This is just a political statement to keep the pressure up on the TMC government,” said Pradip Bhattacharya, veteran Congress leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-babul-supriyo-takes-jibe-at-mamata-by-starting-president-s-rule-in-bengal-debate/story-uprUfxMdDlXzsasbEAQ7yI.html
20-11-2020||India||BJP-BPF alliance headed for split before Assam assembly elections||Ahead of assembly polls in Assam next year, the partnership between ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and coalition partner Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) is headed for a split. Both parties, which along with the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) have been in power since 2016, are contesting next month’s polls to the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) independently. On Thursday evening, Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, state BJP chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass and senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma left for New Delhi on a chartered flight to discuss the party’s strategy for the assembly polls. The leaders will meet BJP national president JP Nadda on Friday, where a decision on separation from BPF is expected to be taken. Both BJP and AGP are expected to continue the alliance and contest the assembly polls scheduled in March-April together. “Our partnership with BPF was only for five years and it won’t continue beyond that. We are contesting the BTC polls alone and will fight the assembly polls without alliance with BPF,” Himanta Biswa Sarma told journalists on Thursday.Also read: ‘We don’t vote, but hear our voices’, Assam children tell parties ahead of pollsBJP state chief Dass also stated that he wasn’t in favour of continuing the alliance with BPF and will convey the same to the party leadership. The final decision on the partnership will be taken in Delhi, he added. “Whether we will stay with the BJP or join the Congress hasn’t been decided yet. Only after BTC polls are over, we will decide on partnerships for the assembly polls. It is for the BJP to decide whether they want to continue with us or not,” BPF chief Hagrama Mohilary told journalists on Thursday. “We have heard about a meeting between JP Nadda and Assam BJP leaders, but have no clue what it is about. They (BJP) are a national party and it’s for them to decide whom they want to join hands with. BPF will emerge stronger if the partnership breaks,” he added.

BJP (60) and AGP (14) have a total of 74 legislators in the 126-member assembly. Differences between BJP and BPF intensified in March this year after polls to BTC, which was under the latter’s control, was postponed due to Covid-19 and the areas under the council were placed under governor’s rule. BPF wanted the tenure of the council extended till polls. Election to BTC will be held in two phases next month and a bitter campaign between both parties is underway to take control of the council which has a total of 40 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-bpf-alliance-headed-for-split-before-assam-assembly-elections/story-Y7MeZGRLWYHP3mtgvJ8xfJ.html

Of the 464 Assembly segments that the BJP contested both in 2019 and in subsequent Assembly polls and by polls, the BJP has won only 218 segments,” Chidambaram tweeted. Of the 464 Assembly segments that the BJP contested both in 2019and in subsequent Assembly polls and by polls, the BJP has won only 218 segments.On the contrary, the BJP had won 392 segments in 2019, Chidambaram posted in a subsequent tweet. “As I have pointed out, the Mahagathbandhan lost to the NDA by a whisker of 0.03%,” he added. “The elections turned on 8 seats. If the MGB had won 8 more seats, the result would have been 118 to 117 (instead of 110 to 125). Significantly, the HAM and VIP won 8 seats!,” the former Union finance minister said.Since its thumping victory in the Lok Sabha polls last year, in which it won a second consecutive time and with a bigger majority, the BJP has fared poorly in several assembly polls. While the BJP managed to retain Haryana after stitching an alliance with the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), the party failed to form a government in Maharashtra after a fallout with the Shiv Sena. The BJP then lost its incumbent government in Jharkhand followed by a second successive poor show in Delhi, where it won just eight out of 70 seats.Chidambaram’s Twitter thread comes as the Congress faces severe backlash from its Bihar ally, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Of the total 110 seats that the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan or Grand Alliance won, the Congress managed only 19 out of 70 seats. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), meanwhile, managed to cross the majority mark, winning 125 seats in the 243-member assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-bihar-win-bjp-s-performance-declining-p-chidambaram/story-g8OpagzJ4UjdA2PWVpfVjN.html

A senior Congress functionary said the doctors also advised her to shift to a warmer place for some time till the air quality improves in Delhi. “Two places have been identified—the outskirts of Chennai and Goa—for the purpose,” he said. Sonia Gandhi, 73, will be accompanied by former Congress president Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. She had made a brief appearance at the Indira Gandhi Memorial on Thursday to pay tribute to the late Prime Minister on her 103rd birth anniversary. Also Read: Tughlaqi lockdown, lip service: Rahul Gandhi’s jibe at Centre on workers’ plight“Mrs Gandhi has chronic chest infection for over a month now and it is not improving because of hazardous air quality in Delhi. The heavy pollution has aggravated her asthma and her chest condition. Accordingly, doctors advised her to shift out of Delhi till air quality improves,” said the functionary on the condition of anonymity. Sonia Gandhi was admitted to the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi on July 30 after chairing a meeting of the party’s Rajya Sabha members. “She has been under heavy medication pursuant to her discharge from hospital in August,” added the functionary. On September 12, Sonia Gandhi, accompanied by Rahul Gandhi went to the United States for a few days for her routine medical check-up. The two missed the monsoon session of Parliament from September 14 to 23. Before leaving for the United States, Sonia Gandhi had carried out major organisational changes, reconstituted the Congress Working Committee (CWC) and her team of office bearers, and also formed a special panel to help her in organisational and operational matters. Sonia Gandhi is going out of Delhi at a time when there are rumblings in the Congress over the debacle in Bihar assembly elections and bypolls in several states with the group of 23 dissenters, who had written a letter to the party chief in August this year, seeking organisational overhaul, calling for introspection over electoral setbacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poor-air-quality-forces-sonia-gandhi-to-shift-out-of-delhi-on-doctors-advice/story-4OzCCg8sQIUHi9u0f6OwYJ.html

However, the exact amount of looted jewellery would be known after we crosscheck the ledgers of the company,” said Singh.On Thursday morning, four armed men wearing masks and helmets had entered the office of the Nayasarak branch of IIFL Finance after it opened around 9.40 am and threatened the lone unarmed security guard at gunpoint. The miscreants, who spoke in Hindi and Odia, then rounded up the branch manager and other staff into a toilet and snatched the keys to the locker containing the jewelleries that were mortgaged by hundreds of IIFL customers for loans.Also Read: Odisha tribal killed, declared Maoist, rights body rejects theory 4yrs laterThe company’s branch manager said the entire robbery was over in 10 minutes. The DCP said seven special teams have been formed to nab the suspects and all are investigating separate leads. The borders of the city have been sealed and police from neighbouring Jagatsinghpur, Jajpur, Dhenkanal and Kendrapara districts have been alerted.Commissioner of police Sudhansu Sarangi said the finance company, though dealing with a large amount of gold jewelleries, violated all existing provisions of security that banks and financial companies should have taken.“The CCTV camera was not functional. The alarm system was not working. The security guard did not have any arms. The regular security guard was away as his father got infected by Covid-19. Despite our regular advice to banks and finance companies, IIFL did not seem to adhere to any of the security guidelines,” said the commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/39-5-kg-gold-robbed-from-odisha-iifl-cops-chase-clues/story-f6ZmgeHXi0lFyjDUcqivLM.html

Launching the card, PM Modi said that RuPay cards issued by the Bhutan National Bank can be used at ATMs for Rs 1 lakh and for Rs 20 lakh at point-of-sale terminals.“This would make tourism, shopping and other transactions easier for Bhutanese tourists in India,” the Prime Minister said. “I’m happy to know that there have been 11,000 successful Rupay transactions in Bhutan already. Had Covid not happened, this number would have been much higher. We are launching the Phase II of the RuPay Card scheme,” he added.PM Modi also spoke about a framework signed by both the countries for peaceful usage of space and talked about the boost it will give to India-Bhutan ties. “Recently, India and Bhutan signed a framework for Peaceful Usage of Outer Space. This will help institutions in both countries and improve cooperation. India has recently opened its space sector for private enterprises. This will promote capacity, innovation and skills,” PM Modi said.During the launch, PM Modi also welcomed Bhutan’s agreement with BSNL on the Third International Internet Gateway.Bhutanese Prime Minister Lotay Tshering thanked PM Modi for India’s leadership in handling Covid-19 pandemic. “We’re thankful to you and your government for the assurance to make the vaccine available for Bhutan, once it is ready for clinical use,” he said. “The Excellency’s (PM Modi) leadership in tackling the pandemic at home is highly commended.

20-11-2020||India||EPS fears Centre, says Stalin as he launches DMK’s campaign for 2021 assembly polls||DMK president MK Stalin kick-started his campaign for the 2021 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu accusing state chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) of making “a valiant state like Tamil Nadu lie down like a kitten at the BJP’s feet.In a virtual public meeting titled, Tamizhagam Meetpom (let’s reclaim Tamil Nadu), Stalin accused the Centre of snatching rights from Tamil Nadu and the AIADMK government as being subservient to the Centre by remaining silent. Stalin recalled that former prime ministers Indira Gandhi and H D Deve Gowda respected ‘Kalaigar’ (artiste referring to his father and late former chief minister M Karunanidhi) and Tamil Nadu. “Though Delhi is the capital of India, Tamil Nadu is the capital of claiming rights,” Stalin said, paraphrasing Gowda. He added that it was Tamil Nadu that exemplified how the Centre can be a coalition of parties but states should be autonomous and “we have the responsibility to bring back our state’s autonomy.”“There was a time when Delhi and the central government used to be scared of Tamil Nadu. But today EPS’s government is in fear of Delhi,” he said.Stalin accused EPS and his deputy O Paneerselvam of silence, corruption and of being negligent to people’s welfare. He attributed this to wide-ranging issues including the police firing against anti-Sterlite protestors (2018) and the custodial deaths of the traders (Jayaraj and Bennicks in June 2020) in Thoothukudi, delay in payment of GST compensation dues, the state’s low ranking in ease of doing business and imposition of Hindi through National Education Policy. Stalin criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for praising Tamil Nadu’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic saying how that is possible when the state has more than 7 lakh positive cases. “This is why I’m saying we have to reclaim Tamil Nadu,” Stalin said. “The coming elections aren’t for a change in governance. It is war.”The AIADMK accused Stalin of misleading the public. “When the DMK was in power, they never reclaimed Tamil Nadu’s rights. They surrendered our rights and are now playing a dual act with the people,” AIADMK leader and fisheries minister D Jayakumar told HT. “We lost Katchatheevu in 1974 to Sri Lanka because of which our fishermen are still affected.” This issue continues to haunt the DMK despite Karunanidhi stating that the DMK had opposed the Centre’s (led by Indira Gandhi) decision. “Didn’t Amma (Jayalalithaa) withdraw support to the (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee government in the 90s when they did not form a committee to resolve the Cauvery water dispute under the common minimum program,” Jayakumar said. “When the DMK was in power they didn’t confront the centre. They only used mild words.”Stalin began the first of his series of campaign meetings via video conferencing in Erode district on November 1. Party cadres and the public were seated following social distancing norms inside private halls at 350 places in Erode to watch Stalin’s speech on giant screens. “At least 70,000 people attended,” said S Muthusamy, DMK’s Erode south district secretary. Throughout November, the video campaigns will continue in seven other districts- Thoothukudi, Madurai, Villupuram, Pudukottai, Virudhunagar, Vellore and Nilgiris, Muthusamy said.On the ground too, Stalin has led protests focusing on social justice through reservation in education. On October 24, Stalin led DMK’s protest near the Raj Bhavan in Chennai for the urgent implementation of 7.5% reservation for government school students who clear NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) for undergraduate medical courses. This Bill was passed unanimously by the Tamil Nadu assembly in September.On October 29, the AIADMK government passed an executive order through the state health secretary J Radhakrishanan to implement this legislation in the current academic year. The following day, Governor Banwarilal Purohit-- who delayed his decision for more than a month--gave his assent after seeing legal opinion from Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India.“If DMK hadn’t consistently raised this issue, it would have been buried,” M Subramanian, DMK MLA who was in the frontlines of the protest told HT. “It’s a victory for Stalin.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eps-fears-centre-says-stalin-as-he-launches-dmk-s-campaign-for-2021-assembly-polls/story-OtBdd7EN56k0XLKNgaCB7J.html
20-11-2020||Editorials||Why Bengal 2021 matters | HT Editorial||With its return to power in Bihar in alliance with the Janata Dal (United), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has turned its attention to the next set of state elections. In early 2021, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, and most significantly, West Bengal will hold elections. The BJP hopes to retain power in Assam where it will find the discourse around the Citizenship (Amendment) Act — local political sentiment sees it as the legitimising of “outsiders” — a challenge. The party will seek to expand its footprint in Kerala and Tamil Nadu (where it has a behind-the-scenes understanding with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam), but it is aware that winning is not on the cards — in both these states, the BJP has been historically weak, and identity politics is complicated. But its main focus will be Bengal.Bengal matters to the BJP because it is the one eastern Indian state where it has never — except in the last Lok Sabha elections — been able to make substantial inroads. The State was first a bastion of the Left — the key ideological adversary of the BJP — and now the Trinamool Congress, arguably the most important regional adversary of the BJP. Winning here will not just symbolically reinforce the BJP’s position as a national party across geographies, but also allow it to forcefully implement its ideological and political agenda, gain Rajya Sabha seats over time, make eastern India truly saffron, accumulate political capital for the rest of the term till 2024 and demoralise the Opposition. But it faces a formidable adversary in Trinamool and Mamata Banerjee. The outcome of the election will hinge on five factors. One, as the BJP projects itself as a party of change, the extent of anti-incumbency against Ms Banerjee will be a key variable. Two, religious polarisation will affect voting patterns, with the BJP accusing Ms Banerjee of “minority appeasement” and pushing the CAA plank to win over Hindu voters. Three, whether the other forces — the Left, the Congress, and possibly Asaduddin Owaisi’s formation — split the anti-Trinamool vote (thus benefiting the incumbent) or anti-BJP vote (thus benefiting the challenger) will matter. Four, which way the voters tilt on leadership if the battle is framed as a Narendra Modi versus Mamata Banerjee contest will have a role. And finally, and unfortunately, the ground level political violence — often aided by the state government in power — will affect sentiment and voting. India’s political focus will turn east in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-bengal-2021-matters-ht-editorial/story-zGUdDhfmU4vtZ2X7PHgiPM.html
20-11-2020||Editorials||Build a vaccine architecture||Rarely have the worlds of science, public health, economy and global balance of power intersected as they have in times of Covid-19. And rarely has so much hinged on a single variable — the development of a vaccine, or a set of vaccines, to provide immunity to every individual across the world from Sars-CoV-2. The good news is that the worst may be behind us: The world is close to a vaccine breakthrough. Pfizer and Moderna have achieved a high degree of efficacy — at over 90%, it is much safer than initially assumed — using radical technologies which have the potential to tackle other critical diseases. There are other vaccines too, many at the third stage of trial, with a high possibility of success. All of this means that by early next year, the world will have a basket of vaccine options on the menu to choose from. Health minister Harsh Vardhan said, on Thursday, that a vaccine will be available in three to four months and that India has made arrangements to vaccinate 250-300 million people in the first phase. But the science is only one element of the vaccine development. The politics of the vaccine — especially as major powers seek to derive geopolitical advantage from it or nationalism prevails over collective good — will matter. The procurement of vaccines, especially for India, will hinge on agreements it is able to strike both bilaterally and multilaterally — while leveraging its own domestic production capacity. The storage and distribution of vaccines will hinge on embarking on a comprehensive partnership using public infrastructure and collaborating with private sector players — the fact that India has experience, both in its elections and vaccination programmes, to scale up is useful. The prioritisation of the vaccine — all citizens cannot be vaccinated simultaneously, given the limitations of immediate production, the scale of dosage required and logistical challenges involved — will require hard choices to be made; the health minister stated that frontline workers and the elderly will be prioritised, as they should. And most critically, the affordability of vaccines will matter — it would be wisest for the government to pay up and provide it either free of cost or at deeply subsidised rates for the population, given that this will not just save lives, but act as the single-most important stimulus to bring the economy back on track.Tracking and building each element of the vaccine architecture should be the single-most important governance priority over the next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/build-a-vaccine-architecture/story-ANDGPoB0NIRfyhLvT1AV1I.html
