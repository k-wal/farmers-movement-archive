07-11-2020||News||UN: When UK tried to protect Pakistan||India will serve on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for two years, starting January 2021. We were last on the Council during 2011-2012. Permanent members of the UNSC (P5) exercise the veto and their pre-eminence in the scheme of things is there for all to see. However, to give non-permanent members a feeling of importance, some goodies are offered to them, including chairing of different Security Council committees. The Security Council has two committees on counterterrorism — 1267 deals with the UNSC sanctions regime, and the Counter Terrorism Committee (CTC) on capacity-building. Given that India has been a major target of terrorism, chairing at least one of them was important for us politically, and our interest was made known to the other UNSC members in 2010 after we were elected. This should have been no issue even if there were other members interested in working on counterterrorism, as there are several chairing opportunities for the 10 elected members of the UNSC. But India’s interest ran into strong headwinds with the British opposing it. Indeed, at a retreat for incoming elected members of the Council, the British permanent representative (PR) brushed aside the solid reasons for our interest in chairing one of the committees dealing with counter-terrorism and told me that as a P5 member, it was their obligation to see to proper running of things in the Council. It wasn’t even a hint; one was bluntly told no, and this was, ironically, because India was a major stakeholder in countering terrorism.Historically, the United Kingdom (UK) has exhibited a soft corner towards Pakistan possibly because of the size and influence of the Pakistani diaspora in the UK and a feeling that the Raj’s divide and rule policy has benefitted them. The obvious, but unsaid, subtext of the ambassador’s position was that we would steer the work in the committee to the targeting of Pakistan. The hand of the Chinese, certainly pushed by Pakistan, can also hardly be ruled out. It is interesting to note that irrespective of its supposed strong resolve against terrorism, the UK found reason to support China and Pakistan, a main espouser of terrorism, against India, a huge and common stakeholder in the fight against terrorism. It was the first time India had got elected to the UNSC after 9/11, when terrorism became a global focus. Therefore, any idea of giving up on the chair of a committee dealing with counterterrorism was not even an option for us. Of course, this set up a contest between P5 and the will of the General Assembly, which had sent India to the Security Council with a record 187 votes out of 192. It is gratifying that after the diplomatic jostling in New York, New Delhi and London, India prevailed and ambassador (now minister) Hardeep Singh Puri (full disclosure; he is also a cousin) chaired CTC from 2011-2012. Interestingly, seven years later, in 2017, India and the UK squared off again at the UN. And, once more, despite the P5 advantage with the UK, India succeeded in leveraging the will of UNGA when its candidate for judgeship at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) saw success against the British candidate who was forced to pull out. This resulted in a rare situation of a P5 nation not having a judge on ICJ. During India’s chairmanship of CTC, the concept of zero tolerance for terrorism was accepted at the UN. Moreover, action against financing of terrorism was energised working closely with Financial Action Task Force (perhaps the British PR was prescient that Pakistan would be included in the grey list). Rightly, as we take our seat on the UNSC again, counterterrorism will be a major focus for India.(This is a part of a series of monthly articles till the end of the year on India at the UNSC, as it returns to the Council in 2021) Manjeev S Puri is former ambassador and India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/un-when-uk-tried-to-protect-pakistan/story-q95zOheKLMQyThAETV9bbJ.html
07-11-2020||Gurugram||Haryana government drafts policy for setting up retirement homes||The Haryana government has come out with a draft policy for the development of retirement homes for senior citizens that will ensure the facilities and infrastructure required for the comfortable stay of ageing citizens, who want to live independently. As per officials, the policy was drafted because of the high demand for such projects due to the rising number of nuclear families.These projects would only cater to those senior citizens who are willing to pay for this service. As per the policy, only eligible senior citizens will be allowed to buy units and the only the owner be allowed to reside there. Such retirement houses can be set up by colonisers after acquiring a valid licence. The sale of such units is possible if the project is registered with Haryana-Real Estate Authority (H-Rera), said DTCP officials. The minimum and maximum area requirements for such projects would range from 0.5 acre to 10 acres. The maximum ground coverage allowed would be 40 percent while four percent of the area would be reserved for shops. A 12-metre-wide access road would also be required for such projects. The policy also calls for such projects to have medical facilities on the site and accommodation for attendants and staff. The project should also have an on-site ambulance and tie-up with leading hospitals for healthcare. The site also needs to have basic medical facilities and a geriatric care centre, the policy states. It also needs to have an emergency medical room with oxygen facility. Stairs, lifts, rooms and bathrooms must have fixtures which are compliant with the needs of senior citizens, the policy states. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that there is a high demand for retirement homes. “The policy will streamline this sector and allow for the development of quality retirement homes in the district and state. Developers with a good record and experience will enter the sector,” said Bhath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-government-drafts-policy-for-setting-up-retirement-homes/story-6RCPq6UbMcOUTsWVjnHOTO.html
07-11-2020||Gurugram||Education department to start exchange programme between government-private schools||The state education department is initiating an exchange programme for elementary level schools with the aim of facilitating knowledge exchange between schools of different backgrounds. The programme — titled ‘Milan — Partnership between schools’ — seeks to rope in diverse schools in a twinning arrangement with the aim of ensuring that partner schools adopt the best practices of each other. In a letter shared with all district education officers last week, the department said that as part of the programme, different schools will enter into a twinning arrangement as part of which knowledge-sharing will take place through a range of activities. The programme seeks to bring students on a common platform while strengthening school management and administrative capabilities. Sangeeta Chaudhary, district project coordinator, said that the initiative was aimed at linking students in schools of different backgrounds. “As part of this initiative, schools in rural areas will be linked with schools in urban areas, government schools with private schools, so that students can interact with each other and share their experiences,” said Chaudhary. She said that the aim was to familiarise students with diverse experience, beyond their own classrooms. The partner schools will also be expected to share available resources with each other The programme targets children in the age group of 10-14, in classes 6 to 8. The schools that will be considered for the programme will include government middle schools, central government schools and private unaided schools in rural and urban areas. Chaudhary said that the department will start working on the programme soon by identifying schools in different blocks. A joint meeting between the two partner schools will be organised to prepare a detailed outline of the program, she added. “We will be forming a district-level core committee to discuss and finalise the program in line with the directions that we have received. The program will take place from November to January once schools reopen,” said Chaudhary The department has shared a number of collaborative activities which can be chosen by the partner schools. These include sports activities, cultural activities, quizzes, discussion among teachers, visits to laboratories and libraries. In view of the pandemic, the program will be organised as per the SoPs . “Schools have been asked to select activities that can be done with zero contact and physical distancing. NoC from parents will be sought and all Covid-19 precautions will be observed during the visits,” said Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/education-department-to-start-exchange-programme-between-government-private-schools/story-w2Tz7bWkWTv2Hbvvfqi7GJ.html
07-11-2020||Gurugram||MCG and GMDA to construct cycle tracks from HCC to Galleria Market and Vyapar Kendra||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will construct two separate cycle tracks from Huda City Centre (HCC) towards Galleria Market and Vyapar Kendra. This was announced by MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh during a Raahgiri Day event held at the Netaji Subhash Marg on Saturday.Singh said that the construction of the cycle tracks on these two stretches, which run parallel to each other, will commence from this month itself. Overall, 25 kilometres of cycle tracks will be built across the city.The first route — a three-kilometre-long stretch between HCC and Galleria Market in DLF-4 — will be built along the MF Husain Marg and Hamilton Court Road while the second route — a two-kilometre-long, yet-to-be-named stretch — will be built towards Vyapar Kendra in Sushant Lok-1.Although the Hamilton Court Road and the two-kilometre-long stretch are both one-way for motorists, MCG and GMDA will build cycle tracks on both sides of these stretches.Both these stretches would end just before the points where Golf Course Road (GCR) starts.GMDA has plans for constructing cycle tracks along GCR as well.Following the Raahgiri event, Singh along with senior MCG and GMDA officials also conducted a site inspection of both these stretches on cycles.“It was important to conduct a site inspection, along with MCG and GMDA officials, as it gave us a first-hand experience about the problems faced by cyclists on these two stretches on a daily basis. We want to incorporate the lessons learnt from this experience while designing these two cycle tracks. We went ahead with this project only after receiving adequate feedback and observations from our first pilot project along Netaji Subhash Marg,” said Singh.Apart from the residential areas of Sushant Lok-1, DLF-4, and the two markets, the two stretches also provide connectivity between the Golf Course Road and Gurgaon-Faridabad Road to commuters travelling towards HCC and Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road and vice versa, as a result of which there is constantly a high volume of traffic on both of them.Last month, the city’s first cycle track was opened to the public on a 10-kilometre stretch between HCC and Subhash Chowk along Netaji Subhash Marg.Regarding the construction of the other cycle tracks across the city, an MCG official privy to the matter said that after these two stretches, the MCG and GMDA are planning on constructing cycle tracks along the 2.5-kilometre St Thomas Marg, between Kanhai crossing and Genpact Chowk.Incidentally, MCG has constructed cycle tracks along St Thomas Marg even before. During its green Raahgiri initiative, the MCG had built cycle tracks using bollards along the stretch in February 2016. However, just a month later, most of the bollards were broken and the track started to be used by motorists and auto-rickshaws.Sarika Panda Bhatt, co-founder of Raahgiri, a body promoting non-motorised forms of transport said that 12-15% of commuters use cycle as a mode of daily transport by choice and, hence, building cycle tracks along major roads is of paramount importance.“Thousands of residents risk their lives daily by cycling on Gurugram roads. As such, roads need to be accordingly re-engineered. By making roads cycle-friendly, more people can opt to use this as a mode of transport, thereby reducing air pollution levels as well,” said Bhatt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-and-gmda-to-construct-cycle-tracks-from-hcc-to-galleria-market-and-vyapar-kendra/story-84ry2YoLjj3mh0V6gxaSBM.html
07-11-2020||Chandigarh||Congress to take part in DDC elections in J&K||The Congress will take part in the upcoming District Development Council (DDC) elections in Jammu and Kashmir to fight against the ‘unconstitutional’ policies of the BJP through the power of the ballot, the party said on Saturday.Elections to the DDCs and vacant posts of sarpanch and panch will be held in eight phases from December 1 to December 24, according to a notification issued by the State Election Commission on Friday.“The Congress with an open heart is going to put up its best candidates for the upcoming DDC elections to fight the wrong and unconstitutional policies of the BJP which has left the people of Jammu and Kashmir unhappy,” Jammu and Kashmir Congress president G A Mir said.He also said mainstream parties that are demanding the restoration of special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir are not against the country or its people but their “fight is against the wrong policies” of the BJP.The Centre on August 5 last year had abrogated the special status of the erstwhile state and bifurcated it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.The BJP has taken a vow to finish the identity of Jammu and Kashmir through “unconstitutional and undemocratic” moves like abrogation of special status, introduction of new land laws and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into union territories, the Congress leader alleged.Mir appealed to the people to vote in the upcoming elections and said that “the people of Jammu and Kashmir are politically mature and they will use this opportunity”.“The Congress will put forth the best of its candidates who are pro-people,” he said, adding that it was his party which introduced three-tier Panchayati Raj in the country.However, Mir said that there are serious concerns, especially with regard to the security of candidates.“We demand that there should be no back door entry and security concerns are also needed to be addressed to ensure free and fair elections. The focus should be on sensitive areas where extra measures need to be taken,” he said.The Congress has already raised these concerns with the Election Commission, Mir said.To a question on delay in holding of assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, the Congress leader said that there is no alternative to a people’s government.“Whether it is the rule of governor, lieutenant governor or officers, it can never be pro-people… Only an elected government can provide a pro-people government because the representatives are accountable to the public,” he said.If the situation is conducive for elections to urban local bodies and DDCs, then why cannot assembly polls be held to give an elected government to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, Mir asked. On the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), he said that “the Congress is fighting the wrong policies of the BJP at the national level”. Seven mainstream parties of Jammu and Kashmir, including the PDP and the National Conference, formed the alliance for the restoration of special status. “We have made it clear that the August 5 last year decision of the BJP-led government was unconstitutional and undemocratic on all platforms including the floor of the Parliament and in the working committee meeting,” Mir said.“If there is an alliance of regional parties, opposing the wrong policies of the BJP government at the Centre, it is a welcome step. The basic demand of the alliance is the same for which the Congress is protesting for the last 15 months,” he said.However, he said a recent remark by a leader of the alliance was not in good taste.Mir was apparently referring to the controversial statement of PDP president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, who is also the vice chairperson of the PAGD, on the tricolor.“We are not against the country or its people. Our fight is against the wrong policies of BJP,” he said. PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/congress-to-take-part-in-ddc-elections-in-j-k/story-i7V9vEi2bOWD0RiOjgco9I.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||Home delivery of HSRPs to start today; over 45 riders to make deliveries||The home delivery service of high security registration plates (HSRPs) for vehicles registered in Delhi will begin Sunday, senior government officials said Saturday. “On Day One of the drive , around 250 HSRPs will be fixed by our riders at vehicle owners’ homes. Over 45 riders will carry out the home delivery service on Sunday,” said a senior official of Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited (RSSPL), one of the three HSRP manufacturers. Transport department officials said over 17,000 applications have been received until now for HSRPs, in which over 90% applicants have volunteered to pick up the number plate from vehicle dealer outlets. HSRPs are hologram plates made with a laser-branded permanent identification number, which cannot be copied. The colour-coded stickers are meant to identify vehicles based on their fuel type. The stickers also include details such as the registration number, the registering authority, a laser-branded PIN, and the engine and chassis numbers.Currently, the doorstep delivery of HSRPs and fuel stickers is available only in Mayur Vihar, Patparganj, Janakpuri, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, Kirti Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Vasant Vihar, Mohan Garden, Rajender Nagar, Maya Puri, Dilshad Garden and Ghazipur. A Rosmerta spokesperson said after the festival season, the service will be available in others areas as well. Slots for fitment can be booked through www.siam.in, the website of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).To avail of the home delivery, vehicle owners will have to pay an extra sum of ₹125 for two-wheelers and ₹250 for four-wheelers, a senior government official said. “The rates have been decided in consultation with Delhi government and SIAM,” the Rosmerta spokesperson said. Last month, state transport minister Kailash Gahlot had stopped the online booking of HSRPs after complaints were received from vehicle owners about delays in getting HSRPs and fuel stickers. Bookings were then reopened on November 1. “When the plate reaches the dealer, an SMS will be sent to the customer and in case of any delay, the customer will be informed over telephone. Dealers will ensure that HSRP entries are made on a daily basis in the software so that the same can be uploaded on to Vahan, a central database of all registered vehicles in the country,” he said. There are approximately 3 million vehicles, including 1.6 million two-wheelers, 1.2 million four-wheelers and 200,000 commercial vehicles that are required to be affixed with HSRPs. The transport department had issued a public notice on September 22, stating that an enforcement drive would soon start and vehicles without fuel stickers and HSRPs will be penalised. Owners were advised to get these fixed at the earliest. But after overcrowding and violation of Covid-19 norms were reported from dealer outlets, the government decided to have the HSRPs home delivered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/home-delivery-of-hsrps-to-start-today-over-45-riders-to-make-deliveries/story-WtWQ4S7Sjj1PJt2QGrp7xO.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||After doctors and nurses, now north corp teachers threaten strike for wage dues||After doctors and nurses of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation hospitals, the primary school teachers of the north civic body have now threatened to launch an indefinite sit-in protest outside the municipality’s headquarters at Civic Centre from November 11 if their pending salaries are not paid. There are nearly 9000 teachers at 714 primary schools of the north corporation who have not been paid salaries for the last 3-4 months. In four zones of the north corporation, teachers were paid salaries till July 2020 on Friday while in two zones they were paid salaries only till June 2020. These teachers are demanding that all their pending wage dues till October 2020 be cleared before Diwali. If not, the teachers have said that they should for now at least be paid two months salary along with a Diwali bonus.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had on Friday also written a letter to the mayor of north corporation demanding immediate payment of salaries of teachers. Kuldeep Khatri, convener of Joint Council of MCD Teachers’ Union, said that teachers have not been given their wages for 3-4 months. Out of 9,000 teachers, he claimed, there are nearly 3000 who have not been paid since June this year. The remaining 6,000 received their salaries for July only on Friday night. “Instead of being given peanuts in the form of one month’s salary selectively, we want all our pending salaries to be cleared. We want the civic body to give us at least two months of salary and Diwali bonus, which has been due for the last four years. If these demands are not met till Tuesday, then from November 11 (Wednesday) we will go on an indefinite strike outside the civic centre. We will observe a ‘Black Diwali’ there this year,” Khatri said. Khatri also said that a memorandum had been submitted to Union home minister Amit Shah along with officials of the civic authority. The teachers strike may impact work related to online teaching of primary students as well as the process of enrolment and admission of new students for the new academic session, municipal officials feared. Ramniwas Solanki, general secretary of Municipal Corporation Teachers Association said that due to non-payment of salaries, the north civic body teachers are not able to take care of their families and are unable to pay loans. “Diwali is round the corner, but north corporation teachers do not have money to celebrate the festival. We have made several communications with the civic authorities but to no avail. We want our pending salaries to be cleared before Diwali,” Solanki said. This is not the first time that the teachers have threatened to go on an indefinite strike on the issue of non-payment of salaries in the cash-strapped north civic body. In June this year, teachers of north corporation schools had staged a symbolic strike on pending salary issues. But they called off their strike after the civic body paid them a month’s salary at the court’s intervention. Similarly doctors at north corporation hospitals had last month called off their strike after the civic body paid their dues till September 2020. However, the salaries of paramedic and nursing staff were paid till June 2020 and July 2020 respectively, which irked the health workers and they went on a strike on November 2, which was finally called off on November 6 after their salaries till September 2020 was released by the civic body. Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that strike is not the solution and the employees should understand that the civic body is undergoing financial crisis but still efforts are being made to release their salaries.“I had a meeting with the delegation of corporation employees and I have appealed them to withdraw their proposed strike. Salaries of July has been credited and we are making efforts to give the remaining salary of teachers before Diwali,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-doctors-and-nurses-now-north-corp-teachers-threaten-strike-for-wage-dues/story-cwoHJJv7Sc467zSojoXmGI.html
07-11-2020||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Play the rabab, Mardania, November is here||November is the season of numerous festivals. This year, the fasting act came early with women going without food from sunrise to moonrise and defying the pandemic to dance to the DJ’s music after the sacred rituals. And now all eyes are set on the festival of lights, crackers, sweets and songs to Lakshmi the Goddess of Wealth to be kind enough and look the way of sparkling clean and lit homes. And the last day of this autumn month will see the celebration of Gurpurab, the birth anniversary of the founder of Sikhi, Guru Nanak (1469-1534).In recent years there has been an effort by poets, painters, fiction writers and scholars to retrieve the story of Mardana not just as Guru Nanak’s disciple but as a friend of his youth and travel companion in all of his spiritual journeys, stringing the words of love in ragas as he played the rabab. The rabab, a musical instrument, originated in Central Asia, and took its name from the Arabic word rebab (played with a bow). Together they travelled on foot far and wide capturing hearts and souls of people by spelling out as is been beautifully captured by Punjabi poet Surjit Patar in a couplet:Rait te Babur da si, roohan te uss da raaj siO’ ki jehrha aakhda si chherh Mardane rabab(The sands were ruled by Babur, he ruled the soulsThe one who would ask Mardana to play the rabab).This relationship of two persons born to different faiths and different castes reposed faith in humankind free of caste, creed and religion to better the lot of the common man crushed between the oppression of the Muslim rulers and the prejudices of the Hindus. It was not in words alone but in practice. Punjabi novelist Jasbir Mand is perhaps the first writer to explore this relationship afresh, free from the oral tradition of Janamsakhis replete with myth and miracle, and review it in its historical context. The novel, Bol Mardania (Speak out Mardania) breaks many myths, including the popular conception of Mardana as just a Mirasi musician. Mand brings out the dedication, simplicity and understanding in new light. Mardana was a friend to Guru Nanak and appreciative of his teachings which spelt out a new prejudice free path.Amarjit Chandan, a Punjabi poet now based in London, but seeped in the spirit of Punjab, where he had his first encounter with revolutionary movements, looks at this jugalbandi of Guru Nanak and Mardana as the union of two elevated souls. Baba is the word for Guru in Punjabi and he is perhaps the first who calls Mardana a Baba too in his poem, Baba Nanak te Baba Mardana:Baabe di baani mardana gaveBaba apna ucharea aap sune haiJorhi khoob suhaae baba te MardanaEk rabab bajaye dooja anhad baaja(Mardana sings the words of BabaBaba hears the words he utteredOne plays the rabab and the otherutters words of boundless truth).Pakistani anthropologist and writer Haroon Khalid, who literally walked in the footsteps of Guru Nanak across the border, put a question to one of the descendants of Mardana, Ghulam Hussain: “Why weren’t the Muslim rababi protected? They held such high status in Sikhism? Why were they allowed to leave East Punjab at the time of Partition?” Ghulam, whose family elders had been singing and playing the rabab at Shri Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar, spoke thus about their migration from villages around Amritsar: “We were Muslims, therefore we had to leave. It did not matter if we were rababi. What mattered was our Muslim identity. That became our only identity. In fact, a couple of our rababi even lost their lives during the riots. My father-in-law, Bhai Moti, was one of them. He used to play the tabla at a gurdwara in Patiala. Another rababi who used to perform at Guru Amardas Gurdwara at Goindwal was also killed.”The communal polarisation in the early 20th Century and the final death knell of a composite order representing the cultural fabric of Punjab came to an end, and with it the tradition of the rabab, replaced by the less soulful harmonium. The pain of this alienation from the very tenets of Sikhi was best expressed in a heart-wrenching poem by well-known Punjabi poet Harbhajan Singh: Mera Nanak ikalla reh gya/Bahut din beet ga’ay/Sangat ich Mardana nahi aaya! (My Nanak is all alone/Mardana is absent from Sangat for long).nirudutt@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-play-the-rabab-mardania-november-is-here/story-Sxno74KEtVGxL45Q6eBuHO.html
07-11-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: A fawn not spared||A section of Chandigarh’s citizens blindly advocate that the forest areas spreading down to the city from the Shivaliks be fenced off totally so as to avoid road kills of wild animals. No doubt a well-intentioned outrage but it misses the depth and complexity of wild animals’ needs such as seasonal movements for food/water and the imperative to diversify gene pools by interbreeding between subpopulations of the species. These natural needs would be stifled were fencing undertaken in a manner that each jungle area divided by peripheral roads turned into “big zoological enclosures”. That said, there can be no justification for a hazardous and cruel fencing erected within the Sukhna Lake Nature Trail. It has spear-like points that impaled a Sambar fawn on Wednesday. The fawn was probably trying to jump across with the family but failed and paid with its life. The point where this incident took place is the trail that leads left from the observation tower and about 500 m from the entry gate adjacent to the Lake Sports Complex tennis courts.A vigilant and anguished citizen, Divye Mathur, who has morning walked this trail since decades, took a photograph to highlight the wanton killing. His picture posted on social media drew acerbic comments from citizens, who pointed out the contradiction: was fencing meant to save wild animals or to spear them to death with a thoughtless measure?“Why does the forest department have these sharp spikes? Early morning I saw this sad accident. The brutal death of a poor creature behind Sukhna Lake just because this killer boundary has been installed. To save wild animals or to kill them? Very sad. Everywhere around wildlife areas, a net fencing is imposed not these spear tips,” Mathur, a Sector 8 resident, told this writer.GOLF’S GLORIOUS BIRDIESThe tricity’s golfing greens, which are buzzing with professional players from all over India, are also hosting delightful avians, some of whom are altitudinal migrants fleeing the chill in the mountains like the durbar moves of the British Raj and still in vogue in Jammu Kashmir! A delightful bundle of colour with a ceaselessly shivering tail is the Black redstart, observed grabbing insects on the ground in front of the tee box at the Chandigarh Golf Club’s 16th hole. The shy redstart found a lookout perch on the trees flanking the tee box to the left and would sally forth to the ground whenever the golfers were not firing drivers and moving across the redstart’s hunting grounds. On spotting the golfers moving towards it from the corner of the eye, the redstart would dart in flight to the safe, welcoming hug of leafy boughs.At the Panchkula Golf Club, little birds afforded a variety of behaviours, calls and songs to serenade the grim-looking professionals, their minds obsessed with birdies, eagles and albatrosses!. On the tree left flanking the green of the first hole, a male Magpie robin, a Red-vented bulbul and a Black drongo flitted about competing for perches. As the pros drove the ball hard from the 6th hole tee, a migratory warbler perched deep in the tree to the left let out a soft call, very much like beads being rubbed together. Three white, dimpled golf balls drew the close attention of a Pond heron, which was stalking the fairway of the 9th hole for insects/grubs like a respectable-looking but cunning hermit. Upon the golfers’ arrival to their balls, the heron did not fly but scuttled off like a fox driven from the hen coop! vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-a-fawn-not-spared/story-Y2WnpDQyOP6YBzwzNdjtcM.html
07-11-2020||City||Ludhiana MC to propose 60% hike in water-sewer tariff in House meet||At a time when residents’ household budgets have been disturbed by the pandemic, the fund-starved Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) is set to propose a 60% hike in the water-sewer tariff for the city.A resolution regarding this will be tabled during the House meeting on November 10 at the Rose Garden. If the proposal is approved by the MC General House, water-metering system will also be introduced in the city. Until now, the MC had only been charging the fixed slab rates from users. Once the metering system kicks in, residents will have to pay the fixed charges as well the consumption charges. The MC is also likely to do away with the exemption currently being given to residential properties on 125 square yards. The benefit will only be given to houses on 50 square yards or less.3% annual hike in slab rates on cardsThe MC will also be proposing an annual increment of 3% in the slab rates, which will further be revised after the city starts getting 24/7 water supply. Residents will be penalised if they fail to install water meters within the time given to them. The proposal to revise the rates has been hanging fire since the last year and the new rates have been finalised by the sub-committee formed by the House. The committee is headed by senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra while councillors Ashwani Sharma, Mamta Ashu, Sunny Bhalla, Jai Prakash, Harbhajan Singh Dang, Sunita Rani and others are part of it. When contacted, mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “The final decision will be taken only after the House meets.”Residents with no connections will also have to pay user chargesResidents who have their own source of water supply, in addition to the MC connection, will have to pay the fixed user charges for the water lines installed by the civic body. For domestic category, 50% of the slab rates will be charged and for non-domestic categories, charges will be equal to 100% of the slab rates.Private firm to be hired for recovery of taxes/duesIn view of the past instances where the MC was unable to achieve the recovery targets, the House will mull on appointing a private company for recovery of water-sewer charges, property tax etc. The company will also check illegal water-sewer connections in the city. As per information, the MC has failed to recover over ₹200 crore from residents in the form of water-sewer charges. The proposal states that the company will be given 15% incentive on the amount recovered above ₹25 crore.

07-11-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses pre-arrest bail to Chhota Rajan’s niece||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday rejected anticipatory bail application of Priyadarshini Nikalje, niece of gangster Chhota Rajan, booked for trying to extort ₹50 lakh from a local builder.“In the nature of accusation levelled against the applicant (Priyadarshini Nikalje), her custodial interrogation is very much necessary,” said justice Bharati Dangre while rejecting the pre-arrest bail plea. Justice Dangre also took into consideration that crime took place in March 2020, investigation with regards to other accused was complete, and charge sheet was filed against them, but Nikalje has been absconding since. The builder, in his complaint to the anti-ransom squad of Pune Police, said that he had promised to buy a car for his wife and her sister last Diwali, but he could not fulfil the promise. His wife and her sister then left his house and disappeared without trace. In this backdrop, the builder claimed that he received a call on March 8, 2020 from an unknown number. The caller told him that he was calling from the Seth’s office —gangster Chhota Rajan’s office in Chembur, and verbally abused him.Later he received another call wherein the caller identified herself as Tai Nikalje and asked him to meet her in her office in Pune. Following this, an alleged accomplice of Nikalje, Dhiraj Sable, called the builder and told him that Nikalje is Chhota Rajan’s niece and looks after Rajan’s business in Pune. The builder further alleged that when she met Nikalje, she told him that his wife and sister-in-law had approached one of her accomplishes, another accused in the case. She further claimed that a police case has been registered against the builder and demanded ₹50 lakh to settle the matter. In her anticipatory bail plea, Nikalje, however, maintained that she is a social worker and that she was helping the builder’s distressed wife in that capacity. She claimed that the builder himself had criminal antecedents and his version cannot be accepted as truth.The claims, however, failed to impress upon justice Dangre who refused to grant pre-arrest bail to her primarily in view of the seriousness of the allegations against her and the fact that she was absconding for about eight months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-pre-arrest-bail-to-chhota-rajan-s-niece/story-Gvd4Al0GmgWVxDYgDt5xKK.html
07-11-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Court extends interim protection to Karishma Prakash in drugs case||A special Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) court on Saturday extended interim protection from arrest to Karishma Prakash, former manager of actor Deepika Padukone, booked in connection with the drugs case linked to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Prakash came under scanner after her name cropped up during the investigation. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had in the last week of October searched Prakash’s residence in Versova and recovered 1.7g hashish and three bottles of cannabidiol (CBD) oil. Fearing arrest, Prakash, on November 2, moved an anticipatory bail plea before the special NDPS court. The court had on previous hearing granted her interim protection from arrest as NCB assured that it would not take any coercive action against her. Meanwhile, Prakash’s lawyer assured that she would cooperate with the probe and be present for interrogation. The agency so far has called her twice and questioned her on various aspects. On Saturday, during the hearing, the agency submitted a reply on her plea and opposed the same, claiming she has not been answering questions. The hearing on Prakash’s plea is now scheduled for arguments on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the court extended interim protection till further hearing. NCB has, so far, arrested 25 people in the case. It is alleged that Prakash was in contact with the peddlers arrested in the case. The anti-drugs agency had questioned Prakash on September 25 and 26 for approximately 12 hours as part of its probe into Rajput’s death. Actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, Rajput’s staffers Samuel Miranda, Dipak Sawant, alleged drug peddlers Zaid Vilatra and Abdul Basit Parihar were arrested in the course of the case. Chakraborty was granted bail by the Bombay high court (HC) on October 7, while her brother’s bail application was rejected. Showik has now again approached the special NDPS court for bail, citing the recent Supreme Court (SC) ruling, which said that “confessional statements” made to NCB officers cannot be considered as evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-court-extends-interim-protection-to-karishma-prakash-in-drugs-case/story-sAdNrhyv4uQI7f4ae1bHLL.html

07-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s Covid count goes past 15,000 amid rise in active cases||It has taken 234 days for Chandigarh’s Covid-19 tally to cross the 15,000 mark, after the first infection was reported on March 18 this year. With 98 people testing positive for the virus on Saturday, the total has reached 15,025.Meanwhile, two elderly men with comorbidities succumbed, taking the toll to 232. Aged 60 and 79, they belonged to Sectors 38 and 40, respectively. The infection has witnessed an uptick since the beginning of November, with the daily count crossing 100 after a span of more than a month on Friday. Even as the number of deaths has dropped in the past two weeks, with another surge, the number can jump again, warn health officials.In the first two weeks of October, the average number of deaths reported daily was between two and three. In the first week of November, it dropped to less than one. This also led to a marginal decrease in fatality rate from 1.6% to 1.5%. However, the ratio of active cases to the total, which had dropped below 5%, has again reached 5.4%.Active cases had reached their peak amid a surge in infection in September. As many as 3,171 cases were active on September 16. With the pandemic hitting a plateau in October, and recoveries surpassing fresh cases, active cases started a downward trend. However, the number has gone up from 593 on November 2 to 815 on Saturday (November 7). “As active cases increase, the chances of death also increase. We have lately seen a gradual increase in the number of active cases, which is not a good sign,” said a senior health official, who did not wish to be named.As air pollution due to firecrackers could increase fatalities, the authorities have banned them, said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health department. “It will certainly help contain the situation. Residents should adhere to the norms,” she said.85% patients who died had comorbiditiesA few days before the ban, the administration had issued a health advisory, stating: “People should desist from bursting firecrackers in order to prevent air pollution and to protect the elderly and people with comorbidities.”In fact, nearly 85% patients from Chandigarh who died while undergoing treatment for Covid-19 had succumbed to other underlying diseases that got aggravated due to the infection, according to data provided by the UT health department.Chandigarh has reported deaths of 232 Covid-19 patients so far, of whom four had died due to suicide and one by accidental fall. Of the remaining 227 patients, as many as 190 had other diseases (comorbidities). Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, health department, Chandigarh, said comorbidities had emerged as a key factor behind the deaths. “It is clear the patients had other ailments before getting infected,” he said, adding that data suggests the major cause has been uncontrolled conditions, which mainly include diabetes, pneumonia, hypertension and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The other factors include cancer besides kidney and heart ailments.A major cause of worry for the city is the high prevalence of diabetes. Among 15 states and UTs surveyed in a study carried out by the Indian Council of Medical Research in 2017, Chandigarh recorded the highest prevalence rate (14.6%) of diabetes, almost twice the national average of 7.3%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-covid-count-goes-past-15-000-amid-rise-in-active-cases/story-QQUhT1gO6VB58HRcOiYqUM.html

Of the couple’s six sons, one died, Daler lives abroad and the remaining four sons and their nonagenarian mother live in Kurukshetra. Jaswant has alleged that Daler did not inform them of her husband’s death and only sounded them after cremating him on the evening of October 20. The family rushed to Chandigarh and asked the crematorium caretaker for Mahinder’s ashes.However, as Daler was the signing authority at the cremation, they were turned down, with the NRI even threatening them of criminal action, forcing them to approach the police.Daler, however, did not yield even after police intervention, prompting Jaswant to move the high court on October 27, staking claim over the ashes.The Chandigarh administration counsel had then assured the court of mediation to try and pacify both the parties. However, Daler has never turned up for the meetings on five occasions between October 28 and November 3.Appearing for Daler in court on November 4, his counsel sought time to respond to the plea of his mother.Law experts say the ashes can now neither be collected by Daler nor his other family members till a decision by the court that will hear the case next on January 14. Awaiting the final goodbye, Mahinder’s remains will till then stay locked away at the crematorium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fate-of-kurukshetra-man-s-ashes-hangs-in-balance-as-wife-nri-son-spar-to-stake-claim/story-K9QX3uxbYVk7Wnizcc0vDK.html

Incidentally, it’s not Satinder Singh but his subordinates who have been convening press conferences at the drop of a hat to announce the solving of a crime or the arrest of an accused.

Everything illegal about it There was much drama at the Chandigarh district court on Friday during the District Bar Association elections. As the voting ensued the advocates, much to their horror, found a man falsely representing himself as a lawyer all ready to cast his ballot.

No announcement on student council yet As no decision was taken on allowing the members of the Panjab University Campus Students Council (PUCSC) to continue, PU is yet to have the students council in place for this academic year. The matter was also discussed in the university’s last syndicate meeting, but no formal announcements were made. Tch, tch! Sad, that in this tough year with Covid and all that, the students (so far) don’t have anyone to speak up for them.12-year-old pens adventure novelJaiveer Singh Katial, a 12-year-old student of St John’s High School, has written a 238-page adventure novel.

07-11-2020||City||Banks must be more careful in preserving important document of their customers||The minimum standards of banking practices, drawn up by the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India, expects banks to return within fifteen days of repayment of a loan by a customer, all documents and title deeds of the mortgaged property. In case of delay in handing over the papers or loss of such valuable papers, the bank has to compensate the consumer.However, forget compensation, in most cases, banks do not even acknowledge the loss of papers and even when consumers approach the consumer courts, resist paying the compensation, leading to prolonged legal battle. If one considers the appeals filed by banks in such cases before the consumer courts, it is obvious that they spend on their standing counsel, far more than the compensation that they eventually pay the customer.In fact these cases highlight the need for banks to upgrade their system of storing and preserving important documents entrusted to them by their customers. Besides, in all such cases, they should investigate into the loss of papers, identify those responsible for the loss, hold them accountable and also take appropriate measures to prevent recurrence. It is equally important to get the victim, duplicate copies of the document and also pay adequate compensation. A recent order of the apex consumer court underscores some of these issues. In this case, the complainant had taken a loan of Rs 3,50,000 to buy a house and after repayment of the loan, when she asked the bank for return of the original sale deed, the bank denied having ever received them. The lower consumer courts had asked the bank to return the original sale deed along with compensation of Rs 50,000 and costs of Rs 10,000.The apex consumer commission modified this order, asked the bank to issue a certificate that the original deed was lost, pay the amounts awarded by the lower consumer commissions and in addition, pay Rs 1 lakh to compensate the consumer for the decrease in the value of the property on account of the loss of original papers(State Bank of India Vs Vallu Sowjanya, RP No 4550 of 2013, date of order: October 21, 2020)In State Bank of India Vs Amitesh Mazumdar (RP No 2732 of 2019), decided on Jan 3, 2020, the lower consumer courts had asked the bank to give an acknowledgement of the loss of the title deed to the consumer, lodge a police complaint, issue notice on the loss in three newspapers, pay Rs 5 lakh as damages and Rs 30,000 as costs. The bank in its revision petition before the apex consumer court argued against the award of compensation.Dismissing such a plea of the bank and upholding the award of compensation and costs to the consumer, the apex consumer court observed: “The erosion in the value of the property if it is to be sold without the Title Deeds would be substantial and in fact even the compensation awarded by the District Forum and maintained by the State Commission may not be sufficient to make up such erosion in the market value of the property”.Again in Sheel Sohal Vs Axis Bank Ltd (CC No 1021 of 2016, order dated January 8, 2018), while awarding a compensation of Rs 10 lakhs, the Commission observed:. “ No one would extend a loan against equitable mortgage of the property only by deposit of the copies of the title documents of the house….” In fact in a number of such cases, the apex consumer court has pointed to the difficulty in assessing the adverse effect of the loss of original papers on the value of the property. This also explains the varied compensation given in different cases, but damages in all such cases not only need to recompense the consumer, but also act as a deterrent in so far as banks are concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/banks-must-be-more-careful-in-preserving-important-document-of-their-customers/story-sybQKk22l4IR2YebFQxazJ.html

07-11-2020||Delhi||Four couples arrested for cheating 13 banks of over ₹3 cr; they used forged ID papers to procure credit cards, loans||Four couples, three of them of the same family, were arrested for allegedly duping 13 banks of over ₹3 crore by opening accounts using forged papers, procuring credit and debits cards, and then using them for shopping and obtaining loans, police said Saturday.A total of 63 credit and debit cards and 83 cheque books of different banks, all obtained fraudulently, jewellery items, ₹14.67 lakh in cash, and 15 cellphones were seized from the eight arrested persons by teams of the economic offences wing (EOW). Two card swipe machines, 31 PAN cards, 18 Aadhaar cards, and 30 voter ID cards, all prepared using forged documents, were also recovered from them, joint commissioner of police (EOW) OP Mishra said.“We are now looking for the suspects who prepared the fake identification documents. One of the arrested persons said he procured the fake IDs from two persons – Umesh and Ravi Sachdeva. Our teams are looking for the duo and other persons involved in the racket,” Mishra said.The arrested persons were identified as Kawal Raj,66, and his 65-year-old wife; their two sons Manish Kshatriya, 40, and Ajay Kshatriya,35, and their wives aged 37 and 32 years; and Arun Sharma,39, and his 35-year-old wife. The names of the arrested women were not revealed by the police. All of them are residents of north Delhi’s Rani Bagh and each of them had got made at least three fake IDs, the police said.Joint CP Mishra said a private bank, after an internal audit, had filed a complaint with the EOW regarding 36 customers who had cheated the bank by opening saving accounts in different names and addresses, using forged papers, and procuring credit and debit cards.“The suspects used the cards for obtaining loans and shopping; they never paid the money back. During subsequent verification, the bank found that the suspects were missing from the addresses provided on the ID documents,” the joint CP said.A case of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy was registered and investigation was taken up by multiple teams. During the probe, it emerged that the same set of persons used different names, IDs and addresses to open the accounts.“While preparing the IDs, the male suspects used to change their physical appearances -- they sported different styles of beard and moustaches in the photographs. The women also used a software to alter their facial features,” Mishra said.Police said the suspects were arrested from their homes in Rani Bagh between Thursday and Friday, after their identities were established by technical surveillance, human intelligence and scrutiny of forged documents and IDs that they had submitted with the bank.Explaining the modus operandi, an investigator said after opening the accounts and procuring credit or debit cards, the suspects immediately exhausted the credit limits on these cards by buying jewellery and other expensive items.“They had also procured two swipe machines in the name of their bogus business ventures. They further misrepresented to the banks that credit cards were swiped but payment couldn’t be carried out. Thus they got the provisional payments from the banks credited to their accounts. After that, they also obtained loans on these credit cards and then absconded,” said the investigator, who did not want to be named.The joint CP said Manish is the mastermind of the racket. His father Kawal Raj owned a small electric switch manufacturing factory in Rani Bagh and both were directors of the company. “In 2012-13, they suffered huge losses in the business, after which Manish involved himself and his family in cheating banks,” Mishra said, adding that the suspects have disclosed that nearly ₹50 lakh of the money they fraudulently obtained is lying in different bank accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/four-couples-arrested-for-cheating-13-banks-of-over-3-cr-they-used-forged-id-papers-to-procure-credit-cards-loans/story-K5zkDVLuvZRgrKs1osOLIJ.html

The 7,178 fresh cases came out of the 58,860 tests conducted on Thursday, while the positivity rate on Friday stood at 12.19 per cent amid the festive season and rising pollution in the city, according to a bulletin issued by the Delhi health department.The previous highest single-day spike till date here -- 6,842 cases -- was recorded on Wednesday.The number of daily cases had crossed the 6000-mark for three consecutive days from November 3-5.Sixty-four new fatalities were recorded, pushing the death toll in the national capital to 6,833 on Friday. Sixty-six fatalities were reported from Covid-19 on Thursday.Health Minister Jain said, “Yesterday, we issued an order to add 1,185 beds for Covid patients in both Delhi government hospitals and many private hospitals.” “Five hundred beds are to be augmented at city government-run Covid facilities, including 110 ICU beds,” he said.Asked about the spike in cases, Jain said, Delhi had seen first wave around June 23, second wave around September 17 and this is now the third wave of Covid-19 infection, and case should begin to come down as it has been a spell of rising cases in the last five to six days. “Also, we had made preparations and issued orders to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds at many private hospitals, but the high court has stopped that, so we have filed an SLP in the Supreme Court,” he added.Asked about the factors behind the third wave of the coronavirus infection in Delhi, he said among other factors, it could be because of easing of restrictions and the “festive season”, while reiterating the importance of wearing masks.Also Read | Delhi govt orders 22 hospitals to add over 1,100 Covid beds“Many people are going the market to shop because it is a festival season. Markets are crowded in many places...there are many reasons,” Jain said. He again appealed to Delhiites to treat wearing masks as a vaccine, till the real medication is developed. On rising level of pollution and rising cases of Covid-19 in Delhi, he said pollution is not the cause of it. “But both are dangerous. The biggest reason for the increase in infections is our lax behavior. If we do not wear masks, don’t follow social distancing, then it is the main reason for the surge,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-cases-in-delhi-should-drop-soon-says-satyendar-jain/story-i96jjZi72kbPPc7dSpQdIJ.html

07-11-2020||Chandigarh||Voting on farm laws resolution in House would have exposed BJP-JJP govt in Haryana: Hooda||The Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Saturday said Haryana Vidhan Sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta had committed “illegality” by rejecting the Congress’ plea to first put to vote an official resolution on farm laws before discussion in the House on Friday.Hooda, who is also leader of opposition, said had the speaker allowed voting, it would have brought to fore not only the simmering tension within the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP government over the Centre’s three contentious farm laws but also the number of lawmakers supporting and opposing it. Speaking to HT, Hooda said the voting on official resolution hailing the farm laws would have left the government red-faced. “We knew that some JJP MLAs would vote against the government’s resolution,” Hooda said, referring to those who have been openly airing views against the party and the farm laws outside the House.“The lone INLD MLA Abhay Chautala, Independents such as Balraj Kundu and a few others would have backed the Congress in the House. The vote outcome would have been unsettling for the government,” he said, pointing out that pressing for voting was his well thought out plot to ambush the government. On Friday, pandemonium prevailed in the assembly as the Congress did not let the House function after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar moved an official resolution backing the farm laws. Hooda said his party would have supported the official resolution if the government agreed to Congress’ demand to bring in the fourth law i.e promising Minimum Support Price (MSP). “By refusing our repeated pleas that let there be voting first and discussion afterwards on the official resolution, the speaker committed an illegality,” Hooda said, citing Haryana Vidhan Sabha rule number 183 to back his contention. Asked why the farmers agitation in Haryana against the farm laws was not as intense as it was in Punjab, Hooda accused the state government of crushing the farmers movement. “In Haryana, the agitation against the farm laws is being spearheaded by the farmers and the Congress does not want to politicise it by taking the lead,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/voting-on-farm-laws-resolution-in-house-would-have-exposed-bjp-jjp-govt-in-haryana-hooda/story-cWpGpHv5Nc7jhBbuBaRIHM.html

Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat granted bail to Gulfam alias Sonu Chikna and Aatir on a personal bond of Rs 25000. The court also stated that there was no CCTV footage of the incident of the case where the two men could be identified. Both the accused persons were lodged at the Mandoli jail complex. The FIR in the case was registered regarding an incident of stone pelting by a mob, in which a few police personnel suffered injuries and a man named Rohit Shukla was shot allegedly by some members of the mob. As per the FIR, the incident took place on February 24 at about 11.30 pm at Maujpur Chowk. The special public prosecutor while opposing the bail applications of the accused contended that Shukla had told the police on April 1 that two men were among the many in a group shouting slogans against the Citizenship Amendment Act and urging others to kill people. However, the judge while granting bail to the accused said that the “said witness in the previous statement recorded on March 9 had not named the two accused persons”. “It is also relevant that the said witness in the previous statement recorded on March 9 has not named the present applicants (Gulfam and Aatir),” the judge said in its order dated November 6. The judge, while granting bail said that the two men would not contact the witnesses in the present case or try to influence any of them. Meanwhile, the court also dismissed the bail application of another accused Salman, named in the same case, while stating that he was arrested on March 12, on the basis of a statement of a public witness, Tahir, who had identified Salman as part of a mob indulging in rioting in Maujpur Chowk on February 24. Judge Rawat said that Tahir had given a statement to the police on March 9 that he had seen Salman, whom he knew, shouting inflammatory slogans along with others. The court noted his submissions that he had specifically stated that he had seen Salman involved in stone pelting at Maujpur Chowk on February 24. Communal riots between Hindus and Muslims had broken out in parts of north east Delhi in February, which claimed 53 lives and left 607 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-two-get-bail-due-to-contradictory-statements-by-witness/story-a3o1ZrpIzoOTW4UfBxPAGP.html

It should have come at least a few weeks back. After the administration held the draw of lots on November 3 to issue 96 permits, dealers had made advance payments to wholesalers in Kurali and Ambala. They will now suffer huge losses,” said Devinder Gupta, president of the Chandigarh Crackers Seller Association. “Even in the previous years, the administration keeps dilly-dallying on the policy for firecrackers. Such uncertainty is harmful for the business,” he added.Gupta said they will appeal to the high court to allow the 96 traders selected through the draw of lots to sell firecrackers and a two-hour period for bursting firecrackers on Diwali. Else, he added, the administration should compensate the traders for their purchases.Supporting the association, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal’s (CBM) chairman Charanjiv Singh said, “It’s not like the pandemic got worse just one week before Diwali. The administration took the decision too late and we stand by the firecracker dealers in opposing this.”Meanwhile, environmentalists have welcomed the ban, saying it will help keep the Air Quality Index (AQI) in check. “There is a correlation between the worsening air quality and the intensity of symptoms being faced by Covid patients. Rather than bursting firecrackers, Diwali can be celebrated by spending time with family and friends and lighting diyas,” said Debendra Dalai, vice-chairman, Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dealers-in-chandigarh-see-red-over-firecracker-ban-to-approach-hc/story-AcVHTwxttYU0XGLdfpmD8H.html

It was agreed that Mandi will provide labour, land and water from Uhl River for the Hydro Electric Project and in return it will be supplied 500 KW free electricity from the project.It was also agreed that a high tension line will be installed from the project to Mandi State and a power house will be constructed that will be maintained by Mandi State and a subsequent agreement dated December 26, 1935 was executed between the parties conditional to the supply of free electricity, the petitioner submitted. The petitioner said that prior to the freedom of India, the said project was in the territory of the then Mandi State. However, from August 15, 1947 to April 9, 1965, Punjab occupied the project without any justification despite it being in the territory of Himachal Pradesh. “In 1965 and 1975 agreements were executed and a notification was issued in favour of Punjab Electricity but the interests of Himachal and its public was not taken into consideration,” the petitioner alleged. The petitioner submitted that Himachal was a small state with limited sources of income and the project generated ₹100 crore annually. Thus, if the project was handed over to Himachal, it will strengthen the state’s economy.The petitioner requested the court to quash the agreements and notifications of the government of India and to direct the respondent authorities to hand over the Uhal River Hydro Electric Project to Himachal. He has asked the court to direct respondents to provide free electricity to Mandi town and to pay the whole income of the project to Himachal. The court also directed the respondents to file a response within four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/notices-to-centre-punjab-over-handing-over-hydro-project-to-himachal/story-6r7h67y9h2YTI6L51UrXXJ.html

One kg of drugs was also allegedly recovered from Kalani’s possession. His aide, Guru Jaiswal 32, an auto-rickshaw driver, has also been arrested and drugs were also recovered from his possession.Kalani led a police team to his house in Bandra West where over seven kgs of drugs were seized. “A total of 9 kg of high-quality weed [cannabis] worth Rs 1.62 crore were seized from the two accused,” said Nalawade.Kalani studied engineering in Australia and ran his own software systems firm. Police said before the lockdown he would allegedly order high-quality weed for his personal consumption from the US through the dark web and get it shipped to Mumbai. He would make payments through e-wallet services, said Bandra ANC unit head inspector Anil Wadhwane, who arrested Kalani.Wadhawane added since Kalani was under financial stress during the lockdown, he decided to supply the drugs to others and make easy money sometimes in August this year. His point-person in the US helped him, Wadhawane added.“He would order drugs from his supplier in the US and once the drugs were shipped to Mumbai, he would send them to his clients in cities like Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune, etc...,” said Wadhwane.He would make anywhere between Rs 1,500 to Rs 3,500 per gram of drugs. “His everyday profit was around Rs 1 lakh,” Wadhavane said. Kalani allegedly rented a bungalow in Bandra to store the drugs.For the delivery of drugs locally, he would allegedly use auto drivers like Jaiswal and give them a commission.“Kalani was doing the drug business smartly and he would do all his dealings and communications through a messaging app... The anonymity providing app not just has end-to-end encryption, but it also has a self-data deleting feature...,” said Nalawade.Kalani’s contacts and phone call details were being scanned to trace his other associates, the police said.He and his aide have been booked under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and remanded in police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-techie-takes-to-drug-smuggling-after-financial-stress-held/story-Ic3fcJsBvDsng4y57b0FEL.html

Kalia had arrived at the residence of district Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Yadwinder Shanty and was to hold a meeting in the town. The protesters, who have been sitting on dharna outside Shanty’s residence for 19 days now, assembled and raised slogans against the Modi government and the agriculture laws.“Kalia entered Shanty’s residence from the rear gate. He wanted to motivate his party workers. However, farmers will continue Kalia’s gherao, when he comes out. Farmers are united,” said Balour Singh, local leader BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan). Another farmer Baljinder Singh said BJP leaders were still trying to convince farmers about the new farm bills than understanding farmers’ concerns. Kalia said, “Everyone has the right to protest in Indian democracy. The BJP, however, will protect farmers’ rights. The farm laws have been made for their benefit. The private mandi is an option, but farmers can sell their crops to government agencies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-gherao-ex-bjp-minister-kalia-in-barnala/story-AMNQGM8c9JRyWgnFTQoJgK.html

The bench, however, noted that since the petitioners are complainant in the case, they should not be called to the police station without any reason.“They are the complainant and not the accused in the case. We are not saying stop the investigation, but call them only when required and on specific days and for reasonable time,” Justice Shinde said.Kamat agreed and told the court that the petitioners would be called for questioning twice a week for a reasonable time.The bench then posted the petition for further hearing on November 25 and directed the respondents (the government, Param Bir Singh, Sachin Waze and Shashank Sandbhor) to file their affidavits.The petitioner’s advocate C S Vaidyanathan argued that the police was pressurising the petitioners to implicate certain news channels.“The police were repeatedly coercing the petitioners to make false and incorrect statements. When the petitioners expressed inability to do so, they were threatened by the police saying they would be booked in the same offence and placed under arrest,” the petition said.Also Read: Republic disclosing confidential communications, misrepresenting them, alleges BARC IndiaThe company claimed that their senior officials are being harassed by the city police, which calls them for recording of statement at odd hours and then detaining them in the Crime Branch office for long hours and threatening that they would be placed under arrest.“There has been a constant threat by the police that the petitioners would be arrested for conniving and being hand in gloves with Republic TV,” the petition said.It also sought a stay on the investigation being conducted by the city police in the case and a direction to not take any coercive steps against the petitioners.The plea claimed that the FIR was registered on October 6, 2020 and since then the police has been harassing the petitioner company and its officials, asking them to make false and incorrect statements.“Later, media reports quoting the police said that preliminary forensic audit report has revealed suspicious transaction of Rs 32 lakh between the petitioner company and Republic TV.

There has been no dealing in the year 2018 and 2019,” it added.The petition claimed that the company and its officials are suffering collateral damage as they are being used by the police to fight their battle against certain sections of the media.Hansa Research Group had lodged a complaint against its employee Vishal Bhandari on October 6 after he was found allegedly accepting payments illegally to make certain households watch specific TV channels, allegedly to fudge TV TRP ratings.Ten arrests have been made so far, including those of former employees of the company.The police, after preliminary inquiry, had claimed that two local regional channels and Republic TV was also involved in the scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-scam-bombay-hc-seeks-maharashtra-govt-s-reply-over-charges-against-cops/story-IY76yAprD7iXwP9c3ZqW7I.html

The valley has had an unusually long dry spell this year, leading to shortage of water for drinking and irrigation. On November 4, there was light snowfall in the higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh but there was no precipitation in the plains.“This year was abnormally dry. The rainfall from July to October was also 35% below normal,” said meteorologist Mohammad Hussain. MERCURY PLUMMETS IN VALLEY, LADAKHThe minimum temperature in Srinagar dipped to below zero for the first time this season to settle at minus 0.9 degree Celsius on Saturday, while it was 20.8 degrees during the day. The lowest temperature in Kashmir was in the tourist resort of Pahalgam that recorded a minimum of minus 2.7 degrees Celsius, while Ladakh’s Leh was cold at minus 7.4 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rain-snow-in-kashmir-from-november-13-15/story-82tcdrjR4GFfhi834F886N.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||Missing auto rickshaw driver’s body found in water plant, family says murder||The body of a 30-year-old auto rickshaw driver, who had been missing since Monday, was found floating on the water at Delhi Jal Board (DJB)’s water treatment plant in east Delhi’s New Ashok Nagar on Thursday afternoon, police said.The probe so far has revealed that the man died of drowning, there were no external injury marks on his body, an investigating officer said. The man’s family has alleged he was murdered, police said, adding that they have initiated inquest proceeding under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC). The man’s family made the allegations after seeing a CCTV camera footage in which the auto rickshaw driver was seen in a scuffle with another auto driver in the New Ashok Nagar area on Monday night. In the CCTV clip, two men on a motorcycle and a scooter are seen intervening, after which they all leave on their respective vehicles while the autorickshaw driver (deceased) is seen walking alone on the road. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said that on Thursday afternoon, a guard at the Delhi Jal Board’s water treatment plant in New Ashok Nagar informed the police about a man’s body floating on the water in the treatment plant. Police identified the body as that of the auto rickshaw driver. “It’s a case of drowning and not murder. We are following the legal procedure,”said DCP Singh. Police said the man lived with his parents and three siblings in Kondli. His missing report was filed at the New Ashok Nagar police station on Tuesday. In the complaint, the family mentioned that he left home on Monday after the owner of the auto-rickshaw, which he drove, asked him to meet at Kondli bus stop with the auto driver’s uniform. “ The man did not return home thereafter and the family members could not contact him since his phone was switched off. The next day the family lodged his missing complaint,” a police officer associated with the case said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/missing-auto-rickshaw-driver-s-body-found-in-water-plant-family-says-murder/story-OB0HxHjqTXV7OHqUNC6oDL.html
07-11-2020||Mumbai||Month after easing Covid restrictions, only 60% hotels open in Maharashtra||A month after reopening of restaurants and hotels, about 60 percent of establishments across Maharashtra have restarted their businesses.There are approximately four lakh hotels and restaurants in Maharashtra of which 2.40 lakh have reopened their establishments.The reasons are many: fear psychosis of Covid-19 virus, acute shortage of labour, lack of transportation, timing restrictions and also no feasibility due to restriction of allowing only 50.percent clients. Both Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) and Indian Hotels and Restaurants Association (AHAR) argued that multiple reasons have dissuaded hoteliers from reopening their establishments.“People are still afraid to come to the hotels due to fear of the spread of Covid-19. This has hit our business very badly. So many of the establishments who have not opened are adopting a wait-and-watch policy as the hotels which have opened have hardly any business,” said Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, Vice President, FHRAI.According to Shivanand Shetty, President, AHAR, majority of those who have not opened were on leased premises. “It is not feasible for these restaurants to operate in the current circumstances by paying such exorbitant rents. Many of them have even permanently closed down their business,” said Shetty. Many hoteliers who have not opened said that staff shortage and lack of transport are one of the teething problems faced by them.“The staff, mostly migrants, is reluctant to come as they hardly have any cases in their state. My local staff who lives in the suburbs cannot travel as they are disallowed in local trains. In such a situation, I decided not to open,” said Kamlesh Barot, who runs Revival Hotel at Girgaum chowpatty.The Maharashtra government allowed hotels and restaurants to reopen from October 5 after a gap of close to seven months. However, it restricted operation at 33% capacity for Mumbai eateries and hotels and 50% for such businesses across the state in order to enforce social distancing norms deemed necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection.Savio D’sa, a consultant in the hospitality industry, says it will take till the end of the year to get things to normal. “Many of the hoteliers are facing a monetary crisis after being closed for such a long time and hence are not opening up. Many who have taken place on lease are negotiating with landlords to lower the rents. Since there are fewer outstation trains, many are deferring the opening date as they cannot open with such fever staff,” said D’sa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/month-after-easing-covid-restrictions-only-60-hotels-open-in-maharashtra/story-CD32k5ZFuH8n6tmbykDHAJ.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi air in severe zone, no respite likely over weekend||There was no respite from air pollution in Delhi early Saturday as the city recorded an average hourly Air Quality Index (AQI) of 405, which is in the severe category.Delhi’s air quality was also in the same category on Friday, despite marginal improvement. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said rising stubble burning cases in neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana have been the primary factor behind the Capital’s foul air.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that the overall AQI of Delhi on Friday was 406, in the severe category. Even though the wind speed over Delhi improved to around 8-10kmph through the day, it was not enough to bring about much improvement from Thursday’s AQI of 450.IMD recordings showed that the early morning temperature in Delhi hovered around 12 degrees Celsius.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said no significant improvement in the pollution level is likely over the weekend. “The wind will slow down through Friday night, which might lead to deterioration in the air quality early Saturday. The wind direction will also continue to be north-westerly, which will transport smoke from farm fires,” he said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-air-in-severe-zone-no-respite-likely-over-weekend/story-II9hJPpOX4KgLCVbh1wzAJ.html
07-11-2020||Jaipur||Second Covid wave may come prior to Dec 15, says Rajasthan health minister||Rajasthan health minister Dr Raghu Sharma has stated that experts believe, the second wave of Covid-19 may come prior to December 15 hence, people need to be cautious and follow all protocols. “Experts believe that the second wave may come prior to December 15 this year, so people have to be very cautious, wear masks, maintain social distance and wash hands frequently to keep themselves safe,” said Sharma. He said that according to the experts, there will be an increase in the cases of seasonal diseases, swine flu, dengue, cold and cough, pollution, etc in winters, which is going to severe, and if the pollution levels rise, corona cases will certainly surge. “If people wear masks and maintain discipline for a month, then the coronavirus chain can be broken.”“According to the experts, masks are better than vaccines as the effect of the vaccine will not be more than 60 per cent, but by wearing masks regularly, the chances of infection can be brought down by 90 per cent,” said Dr Sharma. He said that chief minister Ashok Gehlot launched the “Public Movement Against Corona” campaign on October 2 in the entire State, with the nodal officer as the district collector. NGOs, NCC, Scout and Guides, Teachers together with the Local Self Government are distributing masks and raising awareness about this deadly virus.The campaign has been extended up to November 30 and people are being told about the importance of wearing masks. Apart from this, the “No Mask, No Entry” campaign is also becoming successful, as not only government offices, but private offices, shops, commercial establishments, and others are abiding by this, and people are not allowed to enter until they wear a mask.“Rajasthan is ready if the second wave of corona comes. We have a lot of ICU beds, oxygen supported beds, and general beds in the state. At the time when cases were at a peak, the demand for oxygen cylinders was almost 13,000 per day but now has come down to 6,000-7,000 oxygen cylinders per day,” Dr Sharma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/second-covid-wave-may-come-prior-to-dec-15-says-rajasthan-health-minister/story-abg7H4rCJnQNDQ4OVuc8IN.html
07-11-2020||Chandigarh||First district development council elections in J&K on Dec 1||The first district development council elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir on December 1 and the poll process will be completed by December 24. In a notification, the state election commission said that November 16 is the last date for filing nominations; November 17 for scrutiny of nominations; and November 19 for the withdrawal of candidature, an official spokesman said. Polling will be held from 7am to 2pm on December 1. Voting for panchayats to fill vacancies for sarpanch and panch will be held simultaneously for which votes will be counted by December 22. It’s not clear yet whether the two mainstream political parties of Kashmir will be participating in the elections or not. The National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party had boycotted the panchayat and block development council elections. However, leaders of these parties say that the leadership of the newly formed alliance will be consulted before taking a call whether the Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) will contest or boycott the elections. The J&K government on Wednesday announced the DDC polls and panchayat byelections will be held simultaneously. Polls for 234 vacant seats of urban local bodies will also be held. Besides the National Conference and the PDP, the Peoples Conference, the CPI (M), and the Awami National Conference are part of the PAGD. The Peoples Conference had participated in the panchayat elections, however, this time the party will go with the decision of the PAGD. VACANCIES AFTER 2018 ELECTIONS TO BE FILLED Elections to the posts of 39,521 sarpanch/panch were conducted in 2018 of which 13,257 positions are vacant due to resignation, removal, election of sarpanch as BDC chairpersons, death, and non-availability of candidates at the time of election. Among them, 1,089 vacancies pertain to the office of sarpanch, while 12,168 are posts of panch. Since the 2018 elections, more than 504 panches have resigned different reasons. The highest number of 129 resignations came from south Kashmir’s Anantnag, followed by central Kashmir’s Budgam district with 81, while in Baramulla and Kupwara districts 67 and 61 panches submitted their resignations. After getting elected, 12 sarpanches also quit with one each resigning in Anantnag and Baramulla districts. Five sarpanches resigned in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district, while one each quit in Baramulla, Budgam and Bandipore districts. Five panchayat members were killed by militants in the past one year and many panchayat members have been taken to the high-security zone after security forces got inputs that these members are on the radar of militants. By holding these elections, the J&K government wants to complete the three-tier system of panchayati raj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/first-district-development-council-elections-in-j-k-on-dec-1/story-23VpIqAW0ZiHWSne1gLPcM.html
07-11-2020||Election:||NDA, Grand Alliance confident of win as smaller factions eye inroads||As campaigning for the third and final phase of the Bihar assembly election ended on Thursday, both the major camps, National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Opposition Grand Alliance (GA), exuded confidence about their prospects even as smaller parties and formations cautioned that they were capable of emerging kingmaker in a close election.The NDA comprises the Janata Dal (United), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) of former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi and the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) of Mukesh Sahani, popularly known as ‘Son of Mallah’. Apart from Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress, the constituents of the ‘grand alliance’ are Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) or CPI(ML). Other formations in the fray are Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA), headed by Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) chief Rajesh Ranjan popularly known as Pappu Yadav and Azad Samaj Party of Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad. Grand Democratic Secular Front (GDSF)consists of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RSLP), All Indian Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Jantantrik Party and Samajwadi Janata Dal Democratic. A big factor this time is the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which walked out of the NDA in the state and has put up candidates in 137 of the 243 seats. Party chief Chirag Paswan has bitterly criticised chief minister Nitish Kumar, put up NDA rebels as candidates against Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) in many seats, and is banking on a wave in favour of his late father and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan. In past state elections in 2010 and 2015, the LJP captured 6.7% and 4.8% of the votes, respectively. Traditionally, the two major formations in Bihar have netted between two-thirds and three-fourths of the vote, according to data from Trivedi Centre for Political Data. In 2005, the NDA won 36% of the vote, while the RJD+ won 31%; in 2010, the NDA won 391% while the RJD+ won 25.6% while in 2015, the NDA won 34% of the vote while the GA won 41.8%. In the past three assembly elections, the so-called third front managed to hold on to at least a quarter of the vote. There are two key questions for the big alliances: Will LJP eat into the JD(U) votes, and will AIMIM-BSP hurt the GA, especially in the Muslim, Dalit dominated Seemanchal region?The NDA is confident of its victory.“The election is between NDA and Mahagathbandhan. Presence of newer alliances are not new to Bihar, but BJP and JD(U) have a vote share of 30-40% which is higher than the 10-20% share that these smaller parties with limited clout have,” said a senior BJP functionary. The JD(U) is dismissive of small factions upsetting its vote bank. “Apart from the fact that Nitish Kumar has changed the face of Bihar and brought in development, there is no denying that he holds considerable clout among Mahadalits (a sub-category of scheduled castes and together with Dalits make up for about 18% of the state’s population), Kushwaha-Koeri-Kurmi combination that is about 12-14%, apart from women,” said a JD(U) leader. A second BJP functionary in Delhi claimed the NDA will cross the majority mark of 122. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s rallies infused fresh energy and gave the election campaign fresh impetus. The rallies galvanised and charged up the atmosphere,” said the leader on condition of anonymity. A third functionary pointed to the high turnouts – 55.69 % in phase 1 and 55.7 % in phase – to indicate that the NDA will return to power. The BJP is confident that its ticket distribution formula, which gave representation to all castes, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development agenda will swing the outcome in the NDA’s favour. “There are some seats where the contest is close, there are some constituencies where the caste matrix is slightly tricky but people are now voting on larger issues such as development and jobs that only the NDA can provide,” the functionary said.The Grand Alliance said it is certain it will get two-thirds majority. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav even listed his priorities as chief minister - providing one million jobs and and bringing a law to nullify the recent farm laws passed by the Centre. “Come November 10, Bihar will witness a new dawn,” the RJD leader said. Yadav also dismissed speculation that LJP, BSP, AIMIM and RLSP will dent his prospects. “Biharis have the highest political awareness in the country and these A, B, C parachute alliances of the BJP will have no impact,” he claimed. Congress leaders echoed Yadav’s views and claimed the GA will win around 140 seats. “Muslims see AIMIM as a vote-katwa (vote-divider) party and have immense faith in the leadership Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav,” said senior Congress leader Mohammad Shamim Akhtar. AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi contested that.“We fought against Shiv Sena in Aurangabad (Maharashtra) and won. Now, Congress shares power with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and that is fine with these so-called secular parties. This is sheer hypocrisy. If you support them, then you are secular and if you don’t then you are communal” he said. Mukesh Sahni of VIP and Upendra Kushwaha of RLSP also contended that the third and fourth fronts shouldn’t be underestimated. “Tejashwi got the party (RJD) in virasat (inheritance). His father Lalu Prasad was a big leader, but he lacks experience and he lacks discipline,” Sahni said. “People of Bihar want an end of Nitish Kumar’s 15 years of misrule and on the other hand the GA does not have a credible face,” Kushwaha added. Political analysts agreed that the fight was largely between the NDA and the GA. “Smaller alliances do not have pan-Bihar presence are not strong enough to dent the support base of either the NDA or Mahagathbandhan,” said Patna-based analyst Ajay Kumar Jha. Analyst Manisha Priyam said these factions are representatives of the state-specified politics. “It is the poor and smaller sections who are reflecting themselves through smaller formations,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/nda-grand-alliance-confident-of-win-as-smaller-factions-eye-inroads/story-YmyDmDMtLNcPaZqCje1s8J.html
07-11-2020||Election:||‘Nobody retires from politics’: JD(U) after Nitish’s statement||The Janata Dal (United) rushed to clarify on Friday that its president and chief minister Nitish Kumar was not retiring from Bihar politics, a day after Kumar said at a rally in Purnia that the ongoing election would be his last — a statement that set the political scene aflutter.The JD(U), NDA insiders said, went for a damage-control exercise after the coalition think tank realised that the statement could harm the alliance’s prospects in the third phase of polls scheduled for Saturday. Leading the denial, JD(U) state president and MP Bashistha Narain Singh said Kumar could not retire. “Nobody retires from politics. He has said that this was the last day of his campaigning. Nitish Kumar will continue to work as long as the people of Bihar want,” Singh said while Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh had on Thursday appreciated Kumar for his remark that the present assembly polls would be his last and said the JD(U) leader had changed Bihar for good. “Nitish Kumar changed Bihar after he took over as chief minister and there is no alternative to him. As CM, he has done such good work that many of his schemes in the state are known as models in the country,” Harivansh told news agency ANI. As Kumar took a break on Friday after addressing 113 rallies during the three-phase elections, speculation arose in political circles with each party interpreting the announcement its own way. Kumar, 69, while speaking at Damdaha in Purnia on Thurdsay, said, “All is well that ends well. The day after, there is polling. This is my last election. Will you vote for the JD(U) or not?”Kumar’s statement, which came a day before the final phase of polls for 78 seats of the 243-member Bihar assembly, was lapped up by the opposition alliance. Grand Alliance chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav said his stand was vindicated. “We have been saying this for long that Nitish Kumar ji has been worn out and he is not able to manage Bihar. Now on the last day of the election campaign, he has announced that he is taking retirement from politics. Maybe he has understood the ground realities,” said Tejashwi. Addressing an election event, Tejashwi said, “I want to tell people of the state that it would be meaningless to vote for a person who is facing his last election...There will be no accountability for next five years as the person is already trying to escape from responsibility.” The Congress and LJP’s Chirag Paswan also attacked Kumar. However, Jan Adhikar Party leader Rajesh Ranjan aka Pappu Yadav called it emotional blackmail. “Why does such a coward, weak and helpless person want to become CM again? He should retire from Bihar politics and join the Centre’s politics. The BJP has scripted this all,” he said.NDA insiders admitted the statement was an emotional appeal but it had the potential to backfire. “The NDA assessment is that the alliance was well and truly on course to forming the government and any confusion created by the opposition over this statement could affect the smooth march to power,” said a senior NDA leader. The BJP came out in defence of Kumar. “The Congress and the RJD are out to create confusion. Where there is PM Modi and Nitish, there is faith, development,” said Union minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai. Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi said no one can take Kumar’s place if he retires. Political experts in Bihar said Kumar always spoke in a calculated language. “He must have felt the pulse of the people and realised that there is a strong anti-incumbency wave against him. This cannot be a slip of the tongue,” said DM Diwakar, former director of the AN Sinha Institute for Social Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/nobody-retires-from-politics-jd-u-after-nitish-s-statement/story-6lB4o3Bz4YSwv9OIZ9zUuJ.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police books YouTuber accused of cheating ‘Baba Ka Dhaba’ owner||The Delhi Police on Friday registered a case against YouTuber Gaurav Wasan for allegedly misappropriating funds received as donation for the owner of ‘Baba Ka Dhaba’, an eatery in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar.Kanta Prasad (80), the owner of the eatery, had shot to fame after a video of him tearfully recounting the desperation of the months since the lockdown was shot by Wasan and shared widely across social media platforms recently.The case was registered against the YouTuber following a complaint lodged by Prasad on October 31, nearly a month after the video went viral.In his complaint to police, Prasad alleged that Wasan “intentionally and deliberately shared only his and his family/friends bank details and mobile numbers with the donors and collected huge amount of donation... without providing any information to the complainant”.Wasan, however, denied the allegations.Also Read | R Madhavan weighs in on Baba Ka Dhaba controversy, says ‘no social media trial here please’Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said, “After we received a complaint, preliminary enquiry was done and an FIR was registered under section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of Indian Penal Code and an investigation has been initiated.” Earlier in the day, Prasad said he was hurt over being called “greedy” by some people on the social media after he lodged a complaint against Wasan and challenged the YouTuber to disclose his bank details to prove his innocence.Talking to reporters at a press conference, Prasad, accompanied by his lawyer Prem Joshi and blogger Tushant, claimed that Wasan gave him a cheque of 2.33 lakh on October 26 after the YouTuber was trolled for not handing over the donation amount to Prasad.Tushant alleged that Wasan has only disclosed his bank account statements from October 7 to 10 whereas he received more money after that. He demanded that Wasan must reveal his bank account statements till October 26.Joshi highlighted that in the initial videos shared by Wasan, he had claimed that Prasad did not have a bank account or a mobile phone but that was a “lie”.Joshi also claimed that on October 26, when Wasan gave the cheque to Prasad, he made him sign a paper claiming that all dues had been settled. However, later he again gave Rs 1.45 lakh to Prasad. Wasan, however, said that he has submitted to the police his bank account statements till November 2 and maintained that he gave all the amount received as donation for Prasad to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-books-youtuber-accused-of-cheating-baba-ka-dhaba-owner/story-aRnJ1rU8TM22PUBuUP5mJN.html

07-11-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus surge continues in city, fresh cases breach 7k mark||The Capital crossed another grim landmark in its fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday, with the city adding over 7,000 new cases in a single day for the first time. Apart from the 7,178 new cases, as per Friday’s health bulletin, with a positivity rate of 12.19%, the Capital added 64 deaths due to the infection.The number of cases in the capital have shot up over the last fortnight, with over 6,500 cases being recorded for four days in a row now. The Delhi high court had on Thursday reprimanded the government ,remarking that the city was on its way to become the “corona capital of the country.” Delhi is among 10 states that have reported 79% of the cases in the last 24-hours, as per data from the Union health ministry. On average, almost 52 persons died of the infection each day over the previous week. In comparison, 40 people had died each day of Covid-19 the week before. The number of hospitalisations is also on the rise. On Friday, 7,528 people with the infection were admitted to hospitals, the highest the city has seen so far. This has led to hospitals filling up fast. Almost 75% of all intensive care unit (ICU) beds — with or without ventilators — were occupied as on Friday evening. And, over 48% of the total beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 were occupied, according to data on the ‘Delhi Corona’ app. The Delhi government on Friday ordered 22 hospitals – run by it and the private sector – to earmark an additional 1,100 beds for the treatment of Covid-19. “The number of Covid-19 patients coming to the hospital has shot up, we are running almost at capacity. And, with most patients with mild symptoms choosing to remain in home isolation, hospitals are receiving the moderate to severe patients many of whom need critical care. The hospitals are stretched thin because in addition to Covid-19 cases, we will start seeing other respiratory ailments, heart attacks and strokes that go up during the winters,” said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max hospitals. Agreeing, Dr Neeraj Gupta professor of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjung hospital said, “Most of the patients needs either oxygen support or ICU care, which is fast filling up. We are also getting many patients referred from private hospitals to us. And, the cases are likely to continue to rise till after chatt. An expert committee headed by NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul had said that Delhi will see up to 15,000 cases a day during the winters. Even with more than 50,000 tests being conducted each day on average over the last seven days, the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among those tested — has gone up to an average of 11.8%. In comparison, it was 8.83% the week before. This is mainly owing to cases being reported from six districts — north, central, north-east, east, north-west and south-east — where the positivity rate is between 12% and 14%, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had said on Thursday after a review meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/coronavirus-surge-continues-in-city-fresh-cases-breach-7k-mark/story-ynrLDRPqzRD4642x9CeY5J.html

Some passersby rushed to the trader’s rescue but the miscreants had already fled with the bag by then. They then rushed him to the hospital and informed the police.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, Central) Waryam Singh said the incident occurred early in the morning. “Closed circuit television cameras, under the smart city project, are installed near the spot so it is expected that the incident may have been caught on camera,” he said.

07-11-2020||City||Covid shadow: Kurali’s fireworks business dips by 50%||Famous for its wholesale rates, the firecracker market in Mohali district’s Kurali, the biggest in the region, has suffered due to the pandemic with some wholesalers claiming that the sales have gone down by almost 50%.The wholesalers in Kurali supply firecrackers to Chandigarh, Mohali, Panchkula, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and various parts of Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir, and normally witness business of nearly ₹7 crore every year.Manik Bathla, a fireworks wholesaler, who has been in the business for the last two decades, said due to the pandemic, people of other districts were not coming to the market. “Unlike this year, people used to come one month before Diwali to buy firecrackers, but now the festival is just a week away and the market wears a deserted look.”Another wholesaler, Pankaj Garg, said that this was the first time that the business had gone down by 50%: “Now the Chandigarh administration has banned bursting of firecrackers, which is a major loss to our business.”Even in Mohali, in line with the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court, temporary licences were to be restricted to 20% of those issued in 2016. As such, against the 771 applications received for permits, the administration issued only 44 licences for Mohali, Sohana and Balongi. Besides, sale of firecrackers is allowed at just 12 designated places in the district.Sundar Lal Manju, president of Kurali Firecracker Dealers’ Association, said there was a slump in the market as retailers had yet to place their orders. He said they hoped to get the orders after the traders in the region received temporary licences. “This year small-time businessmen were scared of investing money in this business,” he added.No green firecrackers this year eitherLike previous years, wholesale dealers said they had not procured any stock of green firecrackers as there was no demand even as Diwali is just a week away. Green firecrackers are environment-friendly as they have low noise, no flame, no harmful pollution-causing chemicals, but emit a lot of light.“When there is no demand for green firecrackers, why would anyone procure them?” said Manik Bathla.“There is still no clear definition of green firecrackers, and there are not many suppliers in the market. Traders order as per demand. We have yet to get any order,” he said.3 illegal shops sealed in MohaliActing tough on illegal sale of firecrackers, sub-divisional magistrate of Kharar, Himanshu Jain, sealed three shops that were operating without licence. Jain said warnings against the illegal sale of firecrackers had been issued. “We have already sealed three shops,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-shadow-kurali-s-fireworks-business-dips-by-50/story-GLIt4FMnVPqcGL6htReANN.html

07-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Police get three-day custody of gangster Dilpreet||Finally, the police have gotten three-day custody of gangster Dilpreet Singh Dhahan, alias Baba, who had allegedly arranged weapons for shooters who had shot dead his rival and Lawrence Bishnoi’s close aide Gurlal Brar outside a mall in Chandigarh’s Industrial Area on October 11.The police are pinning investigations to get leads on the whereabouts of the shooters from Dilpreet, who was brought on production warrants from Sangrur jail.The police have already arrested Gurvinder Singh, alias Dhadi, and his friend Gurmeet Singh, alias Geeta, of Rurki Pukhta village in Gharuan, Mohali, who had provided a motorcycle to the shooters. Gurvinder had identified the shooters as Neeraj Chaska and Mani, who are yet to be arrested.Gurvinder had told the police that he and his friend were asked by Gaurav Patial, alias Lucky, who runs the Bambiha gang, to provide a motorcycle with a fake number plate to the shooters at Sunny Enclave in Kharar on October 8, and they were constantly in touch with them through WhatsApp audio and video calls.While Patial had planned the murder, the shooters, arms and ammunition were arranged by Dilpreet. Gaurav had taken over the operations after Dilpreet moved to drug trade.While Dilpreet was arrested in a police encounter in Chandigarh in 2018 and lodged in Ropar Central Jail, Gaurav calls the shots from Armenia. Sukhpreet had also escaped to Armenia, but was extradited and is in jail at present.Soon after Brar was gunned down, slain gangster Davinder Bambiha’s group had taken responsibility on social media. Brar, 26, a former student leader, had allegedly played a key role in killing Bambiha gang’s Lavi Deora at a fair in Kotkapura, Punjab, in 2017. In the post, the Bambiha gang had claimed that Lucky, who is overseas, had got Brar killed to avenge Deora’s murder.Patial’s name had also cropped up when Dilpreet along with Sukhpreet Singh Buddha and two other associates had left Punjabi singer Parmish Verma injured in April 2018 in Mohali.Sukhpreet Singh Buddha to be brought in tooThe police have secured production warrants of Sukhpreet Singh Buddha who is likely to be produced before the court on November 11. Buddha would be interrogated for his involvement in the murder of Surjit Singh, 39, a bouncer-cum-financier, in March this year.The Bambiha gang had bragged about Surjit’s murder on social media, saying it was to avenge the killing of bouncer Amit Sharma at Saketri. Surjit was shot dead by two unknown persons on a bike when he was returning home from Sector 22 on March 16, 2020, in his Maruti Ciaz car in Sector 38 (West) around 11pm. As per police, Surjit was considered a sympathiser of Bishnoi. He was into the business of supplying bouncers in the tricity area. However, in this case too, as in Brar’s murder, no arrests were made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-police-get-three-day-custody-of-gangster-dilpreet/story-ub000LcKgm7Ltq6r7dOTCL.html
07-11-2020||Chandigarh||In Chandigarh, mismanaged tree pruning leaves residents troubled||Many residents have been complaining that pruning of trees is not being done properly. While many overgrown trees cover streetlights and traffic lights as they await pruning, branches of trees that have been pruned litter roads for days afterwards, residents allege.Trees on the road between Sectors 32 and 33 were pruned over a week ago, but the branches have been carelessly tossed along the roadside, encroaching on cycle tracks in some places. General secretary of the Sector 33B resident welfare association (RWA) Kuljinder Sra said, “Some trees near my house had to be pruned a month ago but the branches have not been gathered yet. Officials of the municipal corporation (MC) and the UT administration keep passing the buck.”President of Sector 38A and B RWA Joginder Singh said, “There is no uniformity in how trees are pruned. The authorities do it as per their whims and fancies. In many areas, trees have covered streetlights to the extent that they don’t work properly at night, thus endangering citizens’ safety.”Traffic police officials confirmed that they had received complaints about overhanging branches covering traffic lights. They said the complaints are forwarded to the MC or the UT administration, depending on who maintains the road in question.The Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) had also highlighted the issue in their meeting recently. Chairman Hitesh Puri said that all their member RWAs had raised the issue. “We will hold a meeting with the MC commissioner on Tuesday. Improper pruning of trees will be one of the few problems that will be highlighted,” he said.The trees inside the residential lanes in most sectors and along all Paths of the city are pruned by the civic body, while the trees on the Margs are pruned by the UT administration. Speaking about the problem, MC chief engineer Shailender Singh said, “We have not received any complaints. However, we will get them checked. Instructions have been given to MC workers to clear the pruned branches by the next day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-chandigarh-mismanaged-tree-pruning-comes-under-scanner/story-G3uRUChMIwylvxD28mPKsM.html

The high court while staying the tribunal order has sought response from Chautala by November 11. The high court bench of justice AG Masih acted on the plea of ED, which had challenged the October 20 order of Appellate Tribunal Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The tribunal order had come on the plea of Abhay Singh Chautala, his son, who had sought permission to use the farmhouse located in Tejakhera village for the wedding ceremony of his two sons on November 27 and November 30. The tribunal had ordered that the farmhouse be de-sealed on November 6 and sealed again on December 7. The farm house has been sealed by ED in the ongoing money laundering probe against Chautala. ED’s counsel, Arvind Moudgil had told the high court that there is no provision in the PMLA to de- seal the attached property connected with the proceeds of crime temporarily. In case it is allowed, it will lead to a bad precedent which will be exploited by the accused to enjoy the proceeds of crime till the decision is rendered by the appellate tribunal, Moudgil had argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-stays-tribunal-order-on-de-sealing-op-chautala-s-farmhouse/story-AcJ9nTRzFzNv6SVfGcCUDO.html
07-11-2020||Chandigarh||MC’s surprise inspections trigger protests in Ludhiana||Members of Valmiki Samaj and sanitation staff have alleged that the municipal corporation was harassing them by conducting surprise inspections to verify the presence of sweepers and sewer cleaners in the field. The civic body had taken up the practice to check absenteeism. Members of the Samooh Valmiki Samaj staged a protest against zonal commissioner Swati Tiwana at the Zone B office of the MC on Friday. Accusing officials of harassing Class 4 employees, protesters handed hunters and sticks to Tiwana saying that the MC’s harassment harkened the olden system where employees were beaten up by their masters. However, officials said the protest was organised to pressure officials involved in the cross-checking process. Recently, show-cause notices were issued to around a dozen employees, including the sanitary inspectors and a chief sanitary inspector.A heated argument ensued between Tiwana and the protesters. One of the officials, requesting anonymity, said a few of protesters told Tiwana that the supervisors take money from the sanitation staff to allowing them to remain absent from duty. Vipan Kalyan, who was leading the protesters, said, “MC officials are harassing sweepers and sewer cleaners by taking untimely attendance. Cross-checking is being carried out by officials from different branches of the MC who do not understand the working of the health branch. Further, contractual employees are also forced to work at the homes of councillors. Despite that show-cause notices have been issued to employees.” Tiwana, however, said,”Councillors and MLAs have been complaining that MC employees are absent from duty . Officials working in other branches of the MC are also a part of the civic body and can be deputed to keep a check on employees. No one is being harassed. Employees are only being asked to perform their duty.” The issue of absenteeism has been raised in the MC time and again. Authorities have been unable to find a solution for the same due to the mafia in the unorganised sector. Last year, the MC had proposed GPS watches for sanitation staff to check their movement, but the proposal could not be implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-s-surprise-inspections-trigger-protests-in-ludhiana/story-WJ030fFNcyvDubCy0dywOK.html
07-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana assembly: Din in House over resolution to vote before debate on farm laws||The Haryana assembly on Friday witnessed an unusual and heated verbal skirmish over whether an official resolution should be put to vote before discussion in the House. Ruckus prevailed in the House and the proceedings were stalled for about 140 minutes that included two adjournments of 75 minutes. The trouble began soon after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar moved an official resolution backing the Centre’s three contentious farm laws. At the core of the BJP-JJP coalition government’s official resolution was an attempt to checkmate the Congress chorus that these laws are anti-farmer. Earlier, when speaker Gian Chand Gupta rejected the Congress resolution against the Centre’s farm laws, the opposition party had staged a walkout. The state government wanted to convey to the Centre that “this House resolves to express its thanks to the government of India for these landmark reforms in the agriculture sector through these legislations.” The Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the party will support the resolution if the government brings in another law, promising Minimum Support Price (MSP). “Otherwise, we don’t support this resolution. And let there be a voting first (on government’s resolution),” Hooda said. “These three laws are against farmers,” he said, adding “and they don’t protect interests of the farmers. How can we call them pro-farmer?” Hooda’s offensive kicked-off heated arguments between the treasury benches and the Congress. It began at 1.30pm and continued till 3.20 pm when speaker Gian Chand Gupta named all the Congress MLAs present in the House and adjourned proceedings for the second time. The order prevailed when the House re-assembled at 3.50pm as the Congress MLAs who had been named by the speaker could not join the proceedings and held a protest outside the Vidhan Sabha. Finally, the debate began and the official resolution after an hour-long discussion was passed in Khattar’s absence who along with the speaker had gone to the Punjab Raj Bhawan. Both sides digs in heels Taken aback by Hooda’s demand for “voting first and debate later” on Khattar’s resolution, the speaker sought to know under what rule the Congress was pressing for voting before discussion. Holding Vidhan Sabha rule book in their hands, Congress leaders such as Hooda, Dr Raghuvir Singh Kadian, Kiron Choudhry and Bharat Bhushan Batra quoted rules in support of their contention. The speaker too referred to the rule book and rejected the Congress’ demand. “I thought the sitting will continue till midnight. Now you are running away from the debate. Hold the debate,” he asked the Congress MLAs, who had trooped to the well of the House and were resorting to sloganeering. Khattar attempted to end the stalemate and parliamentary affairs minister Kanwar Pal, who was speaker during the previous term of the BJP, launched the counter offensive and backed speaker Gupta’s stand that voting, if needed, will take place after the debate. Disorder continued in the House as Congress MLAs refused to relent. The Congress stalwart Dr Kadian was seen tearing some papers in the well of the House, while other MLAs were shouting slogans.The speaker adjourned the House at 1.55pm till 2.40pm. Sources say the speaker held meeting with Congress leaders to break the logjam. During the next 40 minutes after the House re-assembled again, the same chorus “voting first or the debate first” continued. Both the sides refused to yield. At this, Khattar said the government was ready to hold discussion all through the night on farm laws, but the Congress kept insisting for voting. The speaker said: “No voting without discussion.” He said Congress was “bulldozing democratic rights of other members of the House.” The speaker again adjourned the proceedings for 30 minutes at 3.20pm. Ultimately, the debate was held and the resolution was passed but in absence of the Congress lawmakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-assembly-din-in-house-over-resolution-to-vote-before-debate-on-farm-laws/story-gaCq3akRJZNoivDgftRiKL.html

07-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana assembly session: Bill to control organised crime passed sans wiretap clause||The state assembly on Friday passed six more Bills including Haryana Control of Organized Crime (HCOC) Bill after striking off the wiretap provisions in it. An earlier HCOC Bill passed by the assembly in 2019 and reserved for consideration of the President was withdrawn following objections by the Centre. The modified Bill tabled in the assembly on Friday is sans provisions pertaining to phone interception. The Centre had raised objections regarding provisions pertaining to phone interception and its authorisation in the HCOC Bill on the grounds that such provisions already exist under the Indian Telegraph Act and IT Act. The assembly also passed the Punjab Land Revenue (Haryana Amendment) Bill, 2020 to provide for speedy disposal of partition proceedings pending before the revenue courts. An official spokesperson said it was observed that partition proceedings pending before the revenue courts took a long time as there was a no statutory limit to decide the same. As a consequence, the landowners, especially the rural masses, had to face prolonged litigation. Besides, there is a general tendency to purchase land in share and thereafter get the Girdawari done in specific Khasra numbers on basis of mention of the same in the sale deeds. As a result, there is multifarious litigation both in civil as well as revenue courts. In order to cut short the delay in partition as well as to reduce litigation, it was felt that necessary amendments be carried out in the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1887. This will provide relief to all the landowners, especially the peasants, and boost agricultural efficiency by lessening the burden of litigation and ensuring time-bound partition. Keeping in view the said position as well as public interest, it is necessary to insert sections 111-A and 118-A after sections 111 and 118 respectively in the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1887. The Vidhan Sabha also passed the Haryana Accountability of Public Finances (Amendment) Bill to provide for accountability in financial administration of the state. This will be done by way of an efficient and effective system to facilitate accountability through appropriate accounting and internal auditing system in all the departments, boards, corporations, co-operative societies, universities, local authorities, statutory bodies, public institutions, and other authorities established, controlled or financed by the state government, non-government organisations, which receive grant-in-aid contribution from state government and all those entities that receive public monies in any form including organisations that get funds from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-assembly-session-bill-to-control-organised-crime-passed-sans-wiretap-clause/story-86trjSPPbKIxPSKf02tSgJ.html
07-11-2020||Chandigarh||Resume passenger trains: Army personnels’ kin requests govt||With Diwali round the corner, the families of army personnel posted in distant places across the country have requested the Union government to start plying passenger trains in the state. Atma Raksha Sangh convener colonel HS Kahlon (retd) said that a number of army personnel visit their families during Diwali but if passenger trains do not operate, they will face difficulty in reaching home. “Army personnel get leave only for a limited period of time and if it too is wasted in travelling via buses, their family will also suffer,” he said. A Ludhiana resident, whose son is posted in Maharashtra, says this would be his son’s first visit in nine months. “He will be staying with us for 15 days.However, this time he will only be able to travel till Ambala. From there he will take a bus to our village. His trip will be cut short due to a longer travel.” Another army personnel’s kin, also requesting anonymity, said, “Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is also an army veteran. He should ensure that the issue is resolved at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/resume-passenger-trains-army-personnels-kin-requests-govt/story-qZrFMYWJf85sAcFlZDePEP.html

Before evening, the family of the deceased had reached the hospital to claim it.The kin told the authorities that a missing complaint was already lodged on Tuesday by the victim’s brother. The man had gone missing while returning home from a hotel, where he was working in the kitchen.“The family had told us that he had left the hotel in the evening and after an hour his phone went unreachable. They have told us that he used to drink, so he might have slipped into the drain and went untraced,” said Shambhu Lal, the in-charge of the police post where the complaint was lodged.“Doctors have also hinted that he was drunk so we are ruling out foul play for now. The final autopsy report is still pending though,” Lal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/body-of-24-year-old-man-found-floating-in-drain-in-ambala/story-ck5ysPnuv36BcnIAIziI3K.html
07-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana assembly session: 50% quota for women in panchayati raj institutions||The state assembly on Friday passed the Haryana Panchayati Raj (second amendment) Bill to provide 50% reservation to women in panchayati raj institutions. It also provides 8% reservation to persons from backward class (A) for the post of sarpanches. The amendment Bill also introduced a provision for recall of an elected sarpanch reflecting his accountability to the gram sabha. The intent of the provision is to enhance democratic accountability of those governing in panchayati raj institutions, the statement of objects and reasons said. Deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who introduced the amendment Bill, said seats will be reserved for women and men on the basis of even-odd numbers. Dushyant said these provisions will be applicable in future panchayati raj elections—zila parishad, block panchayat samiti and gram panchayats. He said each village will be given codes based on even-odd numbers. Regarding the right to recall provision, Dushyant said villagers will now have the right to remove a non performing sarpanch before his or her tenure gets over. He said to remove a sarpanch, 33% of the voters of the village will have to submit a complaint of no confidence in writing to the concerned officer. This proposal will go to the block development and panchayat officer and CEO. After this, a meeting of gram sabha will be called for discussion. A secret ballot will be held immediately after this meeting and if 67% villagers vote against the sarpanch, he/she will be relieved of duties. A motion of no confidence can be evoked under this rule only after the sarpanch has completed one year in office. Dushyant said if the two-third votes were not cast against the sarpanch, then the no confidence motion can only be evoked again after next one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-assembly-session-50-quota-for-women-in-panchayati-raj-institutions/story-qjWfBgvMetwukFa7xc0aRO.html

07-11-2020||Mumbai||Two arrested for abducting Mumbai resident, throwing him in Kalwa creek||Mumbai Police’s crime branch arrested two people for abducting a Gorai resident from his building premises in an autorickshaw and then throwing him in Kalwa creek on October 3. The accused kidnapped the victim over an assault that occurred five years ago. The search for the victim, a political party worker, is underway.The arrested accused have been identified as Mahesh Kute, 29, and Dinesh Mehra, 46, both residents of Gorai. The accused and the victim, Manish Harshe, 49, live in the same area and knew each other, and there was incident five years ago wherein they had assaulted each other. It seems the accused wanted to take revenge and abducted him, said a police officer. According to police, Harshe’s wife in her complaint alleged that Harshe left home around 11am. As he did not return for a long time, she enquired with their neighbours and security guards and learnt that two people came in an autorickshaw and had an argument with Harshe outside the society. She further learnt that the duo forcefully made Harshe sit in the auto, said a police officer.Harshe’s wife then informed the Borivli police. After checking the building’s CCTV footage, the crime branch’s unit 11 started a parallel inquiry. Following technical evidence, the accused were found heading on Nashik highway on the day of the incident, said inspector Sunil Mane of unit 11.Several police teams were formed and both the accused were arrested from Ahmednagar district.

07-11-2020||Mumbai||Eknath Khadse, Urmila Matondkar among Maharashtra’s MLC nominees||The Maharashtra government on Friday sent its 12 recommendations for members of the state legislative Council (MLC) to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. “The Congress has recommended the names of Sachin Sawant, Muzaffar Hussain, Rajni Patil and Aniruddha Wankar; Nationalist Congress Party’s nominees are Eknath Khadse, Raju Shetti, Anand Shinde and Yashpal Bhinge; while the Sena has sent the names of Urmila Matondkar, Chandrakant Raghuvanshi, Vijay Karanjkar and Nitin Bangude Patil,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity. Each of the three ruling parties — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — have taken four seats each. Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government leaders, however, are not sure whether Koshyari, who has been locked in a fight with the government on several instances, will clear the list and nominate the 12 candidates to the Council Twelve members to the upper house of the state legislature are nominated by the governor on the recommendation of the state government. These nominees are expected to be from different walks of life, although often ruling parties recommend their members or people associated with them. Most of the 12 legislators, who retired in June from the Upper house, were also politicians. The positions have been vacant since then as the state had not made any recommendations to the governor. Barring a few, most of the candidates recommended by the government are politicians. Khadse, who recently joined NCP from BJP, Muzaffar Hussain, Sachin Sawant, Rajni Patil, Yashpal Bhinge, Chandrakant Raghuvanshi, Vijay Karanjkar and Nitin Patil are politicians. Raju Shetti is a politician, but is also a popular farmers’ leader. Urmila Matondkar is a Bollywood actor, Anand Shinde and Aniruddha Wankar are Marathi singers. Three ministers from the MVA government — state transport minister Anil Parab from Shiv Sena, minority affairs minister Nawab Malik from NCP and medical education minister Amit Deshmukh from Congress — met the governor and submitted nominations in a sealed envelope to Koshyari on Friday evening. “We have submitted 12 names in a sealed envelope along with an official request from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and proposal cleared by the state cabinet. We have followed the process before nominating names to the governor,” said Parab, after meeting the governor at Raj Bhavan. “The appointment has already been delayed due to the pandemic. As names have been submitted now, we are hoping the governor will fulfill his responsibility by clearing the recommendations after scrutiny,” Malik said. Bhinge and Wankar had contested the elections last year as candidates of Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) led by Prakash Ambedkar. Bhinge had contested the general elections from Nanded against Ashok Chavan, currently PWD minister in the MVA government. Chavan lost the polls by 40,148 votes against Pratap Chikhlikar of the BJP and Bhinge got 26,020 votes. Wankar contested the Assembly polls from Chandrapur and got 15,403 votes. Independent candidate Kishor Jorgewar won the polls against sitting BJP MLA Nanaji Shamkule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/eknath-khadse-urmila-matondkar-among-maharashtra-s-mlc-nominees/story-MIJ7k6CulCuPgIooJdlBhO.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||Crackers banned: Now over to enforcement||Bursting and selling crackers this season could attract a fine of up to R1 lakh, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said on Friday, a day after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, in a bid to check the rising pollution levels, announced a complete ban on the sale and use of fireworks, including “green varieties”, in the capital till November 30.The ban comes into force Friday midnight.Rai said people caught selling or bursting crackers could be slapped with a fine up to R1 lakh under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981). “Prosecutions will be made under the Air Act, which has a provision to fines going as high as R1 lakh. The amount of fine will depend on the scale of the violation,” Rai said. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Friday issued a detailed set of directions all the district magistrates and Delhi police, asking them to enforce the ban strictly. “The ban would be implemented from Friday midnight. We have asked the enforcement agencies to submit a daily action taken report. We will be monitoring the situation closely,” said a senior DPCC official. Pollution caused by firecrackers is a huge problem every winter, aggravating the quality of air already affected by other factors such as stubble burning, local emission, falling wind speed, weather conditions, etc.The environment minister will convene a meeting with representatives from the environment department, DPCC, divisional commissioners and Delhi Police on Monday to chalk out a detailed action plan. The enforcement teams said they were prepared to enforce the government order. Devesh Srivastava, joint commissioner of police (southern range), said special teams had already been constituted at police station and district levels to implement the earlier rule of allowing only green firecrackers (less-polluting varieties). “We had special teams of special staff and district vigilance to deal with the problem, but now that we have heard of a complete ban, we’ll have to go even further,” Srivastava said. A meeting of top police officers is likely soon to chart out the course of action. The officer said since it will be a challenge to enforce the ban in the city’s bylanes, meetings will be arranged with resident welfare associations and market bodies in each area to ensure individuals do not burst firecrackers. “We are activating our eyes and ears scheme particularly for this purpose so that a check can be kept on individuals as well, not just the sellers,” Srivastava said. Police said they will focus on the 167 shops that were granted temporary licences to sell green firecrackers before the ban was announced, to ensure the stock procured by them is not sold illegally. “While we were already out in the field to prevent the sale and purchase of illegal firecrackers, now we’ll push out our special teams a week prior to Diwali when people are actually seen lighting firecrackers,” said Srivastava. The police are relying on neighbours to tip off about individuals flouting the rules. Experts agreed that implementation of a ban of such a large scale would require public participation and awareness campaigns. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said the Supreme Court had banned the sale of traditional firecrackers in 2017, but the stock is still being sold illegally and its proof can be heard around neighbourhoods. “Enforcement is not easy when you have to track every bylane and neighbourhood. Getting crackers across the borders is easy. Effective implementation of the ban will only happen if people participate,” Roychowdhury said. The police said that to prevent people buying crackers from neighbouring cities such as Ghaziabad and Noida, they will intensify random checks at border points. Haryana has also announced a complete ban on the sale of firecrackers.“We are waiting for any directions from courts or from the state government with regard to sales of firecrackers. Once we receive directions, they will be implemented. At local level, we have not issued any temporary firecracker licences so far in the wake of high pollution levels. Any issuance of licences will be considered only after we get a nod from pollution department officials,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad.The Delhi Police had last year arrested 261 people for selling or bursting illegal firecrackers on or ahead of Dilwali and registered a total of 433 first information reports against them. They had seized 9,758 kilos of illegal firecrackers. Most of these FIRs and arrests had happened on Diwali night. That night alone, the police had registered 371 FIRs, arrested 210 persons and seized 3,764 kilos of firecrackers. That night, 315 cases were registered against firecrackers users under IPC section of violating an order passed by a government servant and 56 under the Explosives Act against the sellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/crackers-banned-now-over-to-enforcement/story-eLRQTUBWp3nkNNrdDdEicP.html
07-11-2020||Mumbai||Chemical test of firecrackers shows presence of toxic metals; unsafe for health says Mumbai-based NGO||A chemical analysis and heavy metal test for firecrackers on sale this Diwali, revealed the presence of hazardous metals or metal oxides, indicating they are unsafe for human health.City-based environment group Awaaz Foundation tested samples of 38 types of firecrackers in a private laboratory and compared their chemical composition. Results for 28 firecrackers were released on Friday, while results for the remaining 10 will be released later. The report was shared with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Friday highlighting the health impacts. Chemicals and metals are added to firecrackers for their light-producing qualities and emit pollutants when burst. All crackers were found to have chemicals listed in Schedule I ‘List of Hazardous and Toxic Chemicals’ of the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989, under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.Twelve of the 28 firecrackers had barium, a metal banned by the Supreme Court (SC) in 2018 when SC had also directed National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to develop green crackers, which do not use barium.The test results also showed the presence of lead, phosphorus and chromium in some crackers, which have been identified as dangerous metals by the World Health Organisation.“Significant proportion of chemical content was found present in all tested cracker results. These chemicals also form oxides, some of which are extremely toxic to human health including sulphur trioxide, vanadium pentoxide, potassium oxides and copper oxides,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation. She added that while procuring these crackers this year, no green crackers were available in the market. “On requesting green crackers, I got a few that burst with the colour green on combustion. On analysis, these crackers were also found to contain several hazardous chemicals including barium,” said Abdulali. “Firecrackers independently present health risks including an elevated risk of respiratory disease and they can compromise recovery of patients of other respiratory illnesses such as Covid-19,” she said.Scientists said crackers would increase air pollution, which had already shown a spike from the last week of October. “Metals take the form of suspended particulate matter after combustion and emissions from metal oxides are toxic making them extremely dangerous for groups sensitive to poor air quality,” said Dipankar Saha, former additional director, Central Pollution Control Board.The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) said they have been conducting chemical analysis of crackers annually but have not made any of its finding’s public since 2015. “The authenticity of such independent lab assessments need to be checked as the quantity of chemicals in each cracker needs to be specifically assessed,” said VM Motghare, joint director (air quality), MPCB adding, “This year we have not carried out our annual firecracker noise or chemical testing exercise as we are awaiting directions from the National Green Tribunal on an application related to this matter.”SD Mishra, controller of explosives, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation said he wouldn’t be able to comment on the issue until he saw the report. Firecrackers tested and their chemical constituentsThe test results found metals such as lead, chromium, copper, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine, aluminium, and metal oxides such as sulphur trioxide, phosphorus pentoxide, and vanadium pentoxide, all listed under schedule I Part II of a list of hazardous and toxic chemicals under the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules 1989, a notification passed by the union environment ministry under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.Types of firecrackers tested: Series crackers, skyrockets, bombs, chain crackers, flower pots, Catherine wheel from different firecracker brands on sale across Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/chemical-test-of-firecrackers-shows-presence-of-toxic-metals-unsafe-for-health-says-mumbai-based-ngo/story-wUyl8TvC8iHFE7Yl7YRi9L.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt forms panel to assess impact of bio-decomposer||The Delhi government on Friday set up a 15-member impact assessment committee to assess the effectiveness of ‘Pusa bio-decomposer’, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) to turn stubble into manure without having to burn it. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday said the panel will have five MLAs, and officials from IARI and agriculture department, who will assess the effectiveness of this solution in the rural pockets of the city. “The government has decided to set up an impact assessment committee to ascertain the effectiveness of the Pusa bio-decomposer in reducing stubble burning in Delhi,” Rai said a media briefing. The committee has been asked to submit an assessment report to the government within a week. The report will be presented before the Supreme Court after Diwali and urge it to direct other agrarian states to use this cost-effective solution so that Delhi can be saved from the annual problem of pollution on account of farm fires, Rai said. Citing data from central government’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) data, Rai said the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution rose to 42% on Thursday, the maximum so far this season. “There is pollution due to local sources as well, but emissions from stubble burning and firecrackers make the situation worse in Delhi,” he said. The minister said that the government has received 2,300 complaints on the “Green Delhi” mobile app so far, of which 1,346 have been resolved. Most of the complaints are related to garbage dumping from north Delhi municipal corporation areas, and burning of biomass and plastic waste, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-forms-panel-to-assess-impact-of-bio-decomposer/story-AOEhvdrEbEFjaKBLTQBXxM.html
07-11-2020||Gurugram||DTCP asks Ambience Group to build retaining wall adjacent to Shri Ram School||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) in Gurugram issued a second notice to the Ambience Group on Friday to take corrective action by building a retaining wall adjacent to The Shri Ram School, whose structure has developed cracks over the last two years due to deep digging carried out by the developer for a commercial complex next door.The department gave 10 days to the Ambience Group to comply with the directions, or face action, DTCP officials aware of the matter said. The district town planner (DTP) had issued the first notice to the developer on September 9, directing it to construct retaining walls along the boundary of the school. Retaining walls are used to support soil laterally, so that it can be retained at different levels. They are often used in the construction of large basements.The problem dates back to 2018, when Ambience Group started deep digging in areas adjoining the northern boundary wall of the school, after which cracks started appearing on the walls of the school’s chemistry lab. Apprehending further damage and soil erosion, the school approached the developer, who carried out repair work and promised to take preventive measures as construction continued, the officials cited above said.The matter flared up the following year, when portions of the compound north of the school building started to cave in, leading to the institution being shut for a week. On July 22, 2019, The Shri Ram School wrote to the Gurugram deputy commissioner, who directed the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to prepare a fact-finding report. In its report, submitted on July 23 last year, MCG noted that the basement construction work had caused soil erosion and cracks in the school building. MCG’s memo directed the DTP to issue stern directions to the developer, and ensure remedial measures were taken.This August, however, the school reported a cave-in due to soil erosion near a manhole in the sports field, and the reappearance of cracks on the walls of the building. On August 26, the school wrote to the deputy commissioner for the second time, and the DTCP was asked to intervene to take appropriate steps.“The safety of the students and the school is top priority for the department. We have issued a second notice to the developer on Friday and directed it to take corrective measures within 10 days. Action will be initiated as per the rules if corrective steps are not taken,” said RS Bhath, district down planner. Since 2018, the school has submitted two representations to the deputy commissioner, two to the DTP, and approached the environment and disaster management authorities. The school’s chairman, Arun Bharat Ram, has written to chief minister ML Khattar.While the school awaits remedial measures, it has cordoned off parts of the campus due to safety concerns. When HT visited the site on Thursday, cracks could be seen in some areas, including the chemistry lab.Besides the school authorities, parents of several students have also raised the alarm about the situation. While the school has not been holding physical classroom sessions due to the coronavirus disease pandemic, students in Classes 10 and 12 have been going for practical lessons.A delegation of parents that visited the school on Thursday said the lack of action by the developer was a cause for worry. “Due to the construction on the adjacent site, cracks have appeared in the school building. It’s a major safety issue that deserves urgent attention. The developer has not responded to the school’s requests with any remedy,” said Avantika Madan, executive member of the school’s Parent-Teacher Association (PTA).“Our children are losing out by not going into areas such as labs that are crucial for their education. We need this issue to be rectified since it concerns the safety of our children and has been pending resolution since a long time,” she added.Rachna Vohra, another parent, said that the playground and some buildings were not safe due to the damage. “Due to the massive digging, there has been excessive soil erosion. Severe damage could take place if there’s any natural calamity,” said Vohra, who is an urban planner. Another parent, Kaushal Sheth, who is an architect, said a retaining wall needed to be constructed.The chairman of the Ambience Group, Raj Singh Gehlot, contended that the safety and security of the school structure was not compromised by the construction. “The generator of the school suffered damage two years back, and I got it repaired. I assure the school and authorities that the safety of the school structure is not compromised by our work. If at all there are any issues, we will get it repaired on our own cost,” Gehlot said. When asked to comment on the construction of the retaining walls, Gehlot said that the school was free to build the wall on their land. “The school can build the wall on their own land. I will not give up on my ownership of the land,” said Gehlot.Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri, however, said that the administration had taken cognisance of the matter and the DTP would take appropriate action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-asks-ambience-group-to-build-retaining-wall-adjacent-to-shri-ram-school/story-SXtQ7oxYSiYtPrhaRBxXKP.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||Cracker ban in Delhi: Traders ask for relief, say they stand to lose crores||Firecracker traders in Delhi say the complete ban on fire crackers, including the “less polluting green varieties”, will break the backbone of the industry and requested the government to reconsider the decision. A day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a complete ban on cracker sale and use from November 7 to November 30, the traders association said they may end up losing to tune of Rs 300 crore in Delhi alone and demanded some alternative to clear out the green cracker stock that has been procured. Rajeev Jain, president of Delhi Firecrackers Dealers’ Association, said Delhi Police had started the process of granting temporary licences for selling firecrackers in Delhi around two months ago and based on the these licences, traders started booking stock from manufacturers in NCR towns. These temporary licences are valid from two days before Diwali till two days after the festival, after which these traders cannot sell their stock. “Traders get stock according to the conditions of the licence. The entire sale happens in the Diwali season. The government has put a ban till November 30, but who will buy crackers after that? Moreover, temporary licences expire two days after Diwali. A trader who has put his life’s savings into the business has nowhere to go,” Jain said. “The government did not give us any warning before stealing the livelihoods of so many businessmen,” he said.Udit Ranjan, a cracker dealer from west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar, said the industry was finally recovering after over three years. After a Supreme Court ban on the sale of traditional varieties of fireworks, the green ones had started coming into markets last year but with very limited quantities and varieties. This year, despite the Covid-19 lockdown, availability of green crackers had started increasing. “Right when we thought that we could recover some of our losses, this ban was announced. Crackers are properly used only once a year, and throughout the year you have construction activities and vehicular pollution. During winters, you have smoke from stubble burning, but does the government have the courage to stop a farmer? Then why ruin the lives of cracker traders,” Ranjan said. Environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday said while the government understands that traders had procured licences and cracker stock, the decision to implement the ban was taken after the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases over the last one week, which was only being made worse by the rising pollution levels. “Between saving people’s lives and saving the economy, we decided that at this time, under the present conditions, it was more important to save lives. Covid-19 cases are on a rise and this step had to be taken,” he said.Traders explained since storing large quantities of firecrackers in Delhi is not allowed, after obtaining licences they make advance bookings with manufacturers in NCR towns and store crackers in warehouses across the borders. This is transferred to their shops according to requirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cracker-ban-traders-ask-for-relief-say-they-stand-to-lose-crores/story-OHl97l0yDqjVckacBdkfQL.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt orders 22 hospitals to add over 1,100 Covid beds||With a greater number of Covid-19 patients getting admitted in hospitals by the day, the government has ordered eight of its hospitals and 14 private hospitals to increase the number of beds earmarked for treatment of the infection. This will add over 1,100 beds to the existing 15,800 reserved for Covid-19 treatment across hospitals in Delhi. Almost 75% of all intensive care unit beds — with or without ventilators — were occupied as on Friday evening, according to the Delhi government’s Delhi Corona App, while over 48% of Covid-19 beds were occupied. The move will add 500 beds in six Delhi government hospitals, of which 110 will be intensive care beds with machines for non-invasive ventilation, as per the order issued by special secretary (health) SM Ali. “Delhi government has decided to augment the availability of beds for Covid patients in these Delhi government hospitals in addition to the already existing ones, this will be paramount in order to successfully combat the third wave,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain tweeted on Friday. In a review meeting with the union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Thursday, Jain had requested that centre increase the number of ICU beds in AIIMS and other central government-run hospitals in the city. Rajiv Gandhi Super speciality hospital, which is already a 500-bed dedicated Covid treatment facility, will add 150 beds. Deen Dayal Upadhaya Hospital and Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, which were treating both Covid and non-Covid patients, will add 200 of the 500 beds. The rest will be in three hospitals — Bhagwan Mahavir, Acharya Bhikshu, and Sanjay Gandhi — which were non Covid-19 hospitals will add another 150 of the 500 beds, according to the order. These hospitals might have to stop or restrict some of the non-Covid-19 services in order to increase Covid-19 beds. “We already had 100 Covid-19 beds and will add another 100 now. However, to do so we will have to restrict our medicine clinics and cancel some elective surgeries. We usually run at 100% capacity and now we will have to empty out two to three wards for the additional beds,” said a senior doctor from Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital, on condition of anonymity. Two of the existing Covid-19 hospitals --- Burari and Deep Chand Bandhu – have been directed to increase 20 ICU beds each. Apart from the Delhi government-run hospitals, an order has been issued to 14 private hospitals to earmark 50% of their total bed strength for Covid-19 care. This will add 685 beds to the total. “It has been decided to allocate 50% of total bed capacity in 14 hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19. The MSs (medical superintendents) of these hospitals are directed to admit Covid-19 patients as per the revised allocation of beds and update the data on Delhi Corona app with immediate effect,” read the order by Dr RN Das, medical superintendent of nursing homes in Delhi. The government had in September directed 33 big private hospitals in the city to reserve 80% of their ICU beds for the treatment of Covid-19. The order was scrapped by the high court and the Delhi government has now approached the Supreme Court on the matter. “We are reviewing the order, but on the face of it, there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong. As long as they do not reserve a high proportion of the ICU beds it should be okay. In its previous order, the government had asked 33 hospitals to reserve 80% of their ICU beds, essentially stopping these hospitals from providing critical and complex care for trauma, heart attack stroke, cancer, transplants etc. So we had to go to court. My only wish is that the government discuss with the private sector before issuing such orders,” said Girdhar Gyani, director general of Association of Healthcare Providers of India (APHI), which had filed the previous case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-orders-22-hospitals-to-add-over-1-100-covid-beds/story-uDRsNzr7ILPtVtWYYfPgKJ.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi air quality remains ‘severe’, stubble burning is main culprit||A day after entering the red zone for the first time this season, Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the ‘severe’ category on Friday for the second consecutive day, despite a marginal improvement in the measurement index because of a slight increase in wind speed. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the rising number of stubble burning cases in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana has been the primary factor behind the Capital’s foul air -- contributing to 21% of Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels on Friday.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data recorded the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Friday at 406, in the ‘severe’ category. Even though the wind speed over Delhi improved to around 8-10kmph through the day, it was not enough to bring about much improvement from Thursday’s AQI recording of 450. This is the second consecutive day when the AQI in the national capital crossed the severe mark. According to CPCB data, last year, the air quality plunged into the ‘severe’ category on 24 occasions. In 2018, there were 20 such days and in 2017, there were nine days when the AQI levels remained in the red zone. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said there was a marginal improvement in the air quality because of higher wind speed in the day. However, the levels started dipping again after 4pm. He said stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana is negatively impacting Delhi’s air. “Yesterday fire counts only over Punjab was over 5,000, and even today the number has been around 4,000-5,000. Even though the wind speed picked up during the day, the improvement in air quality was not very significant only because of a high share of farm fires,” Soni said. The average wind speed on Friday was 8-12kmph, but blowing from the north-westerly direction, carrying plumes of smoke from the agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana, where the stubble burning activities is at its peak now. Scientists explained that a similar situation was seen in Delhi last week, on October 30, when an improvement in wind speed was supposed to have resulted in a reduction in pollution levels. But despite wind speed remaining above 12kmph through the weekend, its impact on the AQI was marginal because of a high stubble burning count. The Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), recordings show that 3,225 farm fires were reported from Punjab and Haryana, contributing to 21% of Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels. IMD monitoring data shows that late Thursday night, the PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) had started improving and had reached below the 300ug/m3 mark. This means that the risk of Delhi entering the ‘severe plus’ category on Saturday had reduced. According to the winter segment of the Supreme Court-approved Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), Delhi will enter the ‘severe plus’ or ‘emergency’ zone if the PM 2.5 levels constantly remains above the 300ug/m3 mark and the PM 10 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) remains above the 500ug/m3 mark for at least 48 hours. According to Grap, under the ‘severe plus’ category, the CPCB task force can direct state governments in Delhi and NCR to stop the entry of trucks, except those carrying essential commodities, into Delhi, halt construction activities and implement the odd-even road rationing policy. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said no significant improvement in the pollution level is likely during the weekend. “The wind will slow down through Friday night, which might lead to deterioration in the air quality early Saturday. The wind direction will also continue to be north-westerly, which will transport smoke from farm fires,” he said. IMD said that on Sunday, the wind might slow down, spelling trouble for Delhi. “We expect that from Monday, the wind direction will become easterly, but before that, the wind speed will slow down. However, everything will depend on the state of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana now,” said Soni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-air-quality-remains-severe-stubble-burning-is-main-culprit/story-kgeAGoLYIi12178alJ8RuM.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||In one year, this Delhi gang cheated 2,200 Americans of ₹8 crore||A group of men operating out of a fake call centre in West Delhi’s Rajouri Garden cheated hundreds of Americans by making them believe their computers needed urgent technical intervention for which they needed to cough up hundreds of dollars, Delhi Police said on Friday after arresting 17 members of the alleged gang. Between October 2019 and Thursday, this gang had targeted 2,268 Americans of a total of $10.81 Lakh (over R8 crore), Anyesh Roy, deputy commissioner of police (cyber crime unit), said. The unit was tipped off about the alleged crime a few days ago after which they did a technical analysis of the phone numbers used in the crime, the money trail and the location of the gang. When they raided the fake call centre on Thursday, one of the gang members was in the mid of fooling a US doctor, said Roy. “We briefed her about the scam and saved her money, but hundreds had been cheated,” Roy added. The officer said the alleged mastermind of the gang was 27-year-old Sahil Dilavari, who had been running the fake call centre for the last three years. Some of the others arrested were his associates while the rest were callers, but all of them were aware they were doing a fraud, said the officer. The modus operandi was to send a pop-up on the computers of Americans that showed their systems were compromised. The pop-up message was accompanied by helpline numbers that were falsely showed to be belonging to a software company which they could call to seek remedies, police said. “Whenever any of those potential victims called back to seek help, this gang would seek remote access to their computers. They would then tell the Americans that their computers were infested with malware and spywares that could compromise their banking credentials,” said Roy. The gang would allegedly seek hundreds of dollars as payment for rectifying problems that did not exist . “Sometimes, they even managed to sell them long-term subscriptions for keeping their computers safe, but in reality they didn’t offer any service in return,” said the DCP. Another alleged modus operandi of this gang was to put up online advertisements, pretending to be the technical team for a popular printer manufacturing company. “The advertisement would carry a fake toll-free number of the firm, a number that would eventually lead printer owners to this gang. Thereafter, the process of cheating them was the same,” the DCP said. The payments would be received in the accounts of shell companies based in America and Canada, the DCP said, adding the money would then be wired to the Indian accounts of the suspects. The police are probing how the gang managed to set up such an elaborate system to send those pop-ups on the computers of Americans and then set up shell companies there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-one-year-this-delhi-gang-cheated-2-200-americans-of-8-crore/story-4qqsXZS2jRxVRDQw3sC8gO.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||Sisodia writes to MCDs, asks them to clear teacher salaries at earliest||Following months of protests by teachers of municipal corporation-run schools, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday wrote to mayors of all three civic bodies of Delhi, asking them to immediately release the salaries keeping the Covid-19 situation and the festive season in mind.“The salaries to all MCD school teachers be paid immediately, and in any case before Diwali to enable their families have some meaningful festivities,” wrote the education minister.Sisodia’s letter comes a day after Delhi high court criticised the Centre, the Delhi government, and the MCDs for their failure to resolve dispute over disbursal of funds leading to pending salaries of current and former employees of the three civic bodies, particularly the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. The court had on Thursday said that unpaid workers had faced the “real pinch” and asked the civic bodies to make an attempt to release arrears as the festival of Diwali is round the corner.In his Friday letter, Sisodia said that in addition to paying MCD their due share of taxes, the Delhi government has also paid a large sum as loans and arrears to the Delhi Jal Board.“As for the amount owed by Delhi government to MCDs for the current financial year 2020-21, as per the Fifth Delhi Finance Commission calculations, the entire due amount of Rs 960 crore until December 31, 2020, under the salary component of education sector has been paid t in full — including Rs 442.50 crore North Delhi Municipal Corporation. So it is clear that no amount is due from Delhi government and any other figures that the mayors of MCD are demanding is fictional and an attempt to divert the attention of public from the deep financial mismanagement and corruption inside MCDs,” Sisodia wrote in his letter.He wrote that the Centre had “not paid its due amount to MCDs to the tune of Rs 12,000 crore.” The deputy CM said he was referring to the funds released by the Central government to all municipal corporations of the country. Sisodia asked the mayors to rise above “petty politics” and focus on the “corruption and financial mismanagement” in MCDs and demand “the unpaid amount of Rs 12,000 crore from the Central government.”Responding to the allegations of financial mismanagement, Nirmal Jain, mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation said, “The letter by the deputy CM seems to be an effort to mislead the public from the fact that the Delhi government has to pay dues to the east corporation. We have stated a number of times that the AAP government has to pay EDMC Rs 1200 crore in first two quarters of the financial year, but so far it had given only Rs 301 crore. With respect to allegations pertaining to non-payment of salaries of teachers, I want to clarify that teacher salaries till September 2020 has already been cleared and October salary will be disbursed in next two-three days.As far as allegations of not paying DJB dues are concerned, I want to say that figures are by DJB based on highest rate of slabs and this requires reconciliation.”Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, too said the letter by Sisodia shows the frustration of the deputy chief minister. “They owe Rs 13,500 crore to the corporations, out of which Rs 6,550 crore has to be paid to North Delhi Municipal Corporation as per the 3rd,4th and 5th DFC recommendations . He must explain when they are releasing our due amount ,” he said.South corporation Anamika Mithilesh said that Delhi government was doing politics based on lies and false figures.“On one hand they are not giving dues of Rs 13000 to civic bodies on the other they are making false allegations. The government deliberately wants to cripple us by starving us of funds,” she said. Ramniwas Solanki, general secretary of Municipal Corporation Teachers Association (MCTA), said, “Around 9,000 teachers of north MCD have been paid only till July, that too the salary came in today. The remaining teachers have only been paid till June. We need our salaries till October to celebrate Diwali with our families during such a difficult period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sisodia-writes-to-mcds-asks-them-to-clear-teacher-salaries-at-earliest/story-0OLnjmaab5EZLEXmlP2aqO.html
07-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Govt grants sanction to prosecute Umar Khalid, others||The Delhi police special cell probing the alleged conspiracy behind the Delhi riots is likely to file a charge sheet against former JNU student leader Umar Khalid and other arrested persons within the next ten days, according to officials in the know.Delhi police officers, privy to the probe-related developments, confirmed they received the prosecution sanction from the state government last week, which grants permission to charge Khalid, JNU student Sharjeel Imam and an accused person named Faizan Khan under stringent sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). It is on the basis of this prosecution sanction that the court takes cognizance of the police’s charges, frames charges, and then starts trial. In some cases, such as those related to sedition and under sections of the UAPA, it is mandatory for police to get this sanction.On March 6, 2020 — a week after the riots — police filed a case to probe the alleged conspiracy behind the riots. Delhi police have claimed that the rioting was not spontaneous but was carefully planned. The case was filed under sections 13, 16, 17 and 18 of the UAPA. The ministry of home affairs gives sanction for the police to prosecute an accused under section 13, while for the other three sections, the sanction is given by the state government. “We had already got sanction from the Centre and were awaiting a similar sanction for the other three sections from the Delhi government. On October 28, we got the sanction. We will now file a supplementary charge sheet against the other accused persons,” said a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named. At least 53 persons died while 400 others were injured in the 2020 Delhi riots. The violence started when groups of people — one supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act and another opposing it — clashed near the Jafrabad metro station on the evening of February 23. It snowballed into large-scale Hindu-Muslim clashes in parts of north-east Delhi between February 23 and 27. Police had in September filed the first charge sheet in the case, in which they charged 15 persons under the aforementioned sections. Khalid had not been charged then because he was arrested on September 13, about a week before the charge sheet was filed. The supplementary charge sheet is significant because though police have arrested 21 persons for conspiracy, they have alleged that Khalid was the main person who orchestrated the riots and brought the different groups together. Khalid has in his court appearances, since his arrest, denied the charges and said that he was against the Citizenship Amendment Act and that he was not ashamed of that.HT contacted spokespersons of the Delhi police and the Delhi government but despite repeated calls and text messages, they did not respond till the time of going to press. Police have said that the riots were planned at the site of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest, where different student groups, local leaders, activists and other persons came together. The arrested persons have denied the police’s allegations and termed their arrest a witch-hunt against anti-government voices. In their earlier charge sheet, police had charged former councillors Ishrat Jahan and Tahir Hussain, activist Khalid Saifi, Safoora Zargar and Gufisha Fatima, students of Jamia Millia Islamia, Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, both JNU students and members of the women’s collective Pinjra Tod. Except Zargar, who was released because police did not oppose her bail on humanitarian grounds (Zargar was pregnant at the time of her arrest), all the other arrested persons are in jail.The Delhi government said: ”This is a purely procedural matter. The law department has given its legal opinion after due diligence to the home department of Delhi government. The elected government has no role to play in this. Delhi government has not stopped prosecution in any case in the last five years, including those pertaining to AAP MLAs and party leaders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-govt-grants-sanction-to-prosecute-umar-khalid-others/story-gOcXM8QU12dN5sTE65N5PN.html

Both the local police and crime branch officials are on a lookout for Pashankar. Pashankar who is the chairman of the prominent Pashankar auto private ltd company and runs a string of businesses came to his office on Jangli Maharaj Road at 4pm on October 21. He handed over an envelope to his driver and directed him to hand it over to his family. Later, when the driver tried to call him on his mobile Pashankar was not reachable. His family members carried out a frantic search for him and when they failed to trace him, they lodged a missing report at Shivajinagar police station. Pashankar left a note saying some of his decisions related to the business have “caused trouble for his family members…. nobody should be held responsible…” The missing businessman was last spotted on Ganeshkhind road before he went missing. An analysis of the footage captured by CCTV cameras in the area is being carried out by police who are also investigating other leads in the case. His last known location is from inside the city. There was an ATM transaction where he wiped his phone clean by formatting it and withdrew Rs 5,000. DCP ( crime ) Bachchan Singh said, “Unit I of the Pune police is on the job.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-leads-in-pashankar-missing-case/story-ISz7xN4sXoIl2fcJKzULSN.html

07-11-2020||Pune||Pune administration flags ‘superspreaders’ to contain effect of possible second wave||To tackle the possible second wave of Covid expected in January or February as seen in western countries, the administration has taken measures to minimise the effect of infection. The administration has identified “superspreaders”, residents who daily come in contact with a large number of people for commercial activities or government services and could spread the infection in case they turn positive. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “We have started our preparations to fight the possible second wave and have prepared a ‘strategy paper’ that covers multiple aspects. There are studies that prove that people who come in contact with multiple people will play an important role during the ‘second wave’.” The “superspreaders” include small shopkeepers like grocery, vegetable vendors, hawkers and hotel workers; service providers namely newspaper vendors, milkmen, maids, gas cylinder suppliers, electricians, plumbers, laundry staff and cooks; truck, tempo and rickshaw drivers; labourers, painters, masons, head loaders, drivers and conductors in public transport, security guards in housing societies and essential service providers in government and semi-government establishments, including police personnel and guards. The paper states that these people must be surveyed and tested as a “community” which will be crucial in controlling the spread of the infection for which the administration must chalk a thorough plan. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that only if the positivity rate of an infection is below 5% then it could be said that the infection is under control. Currently, the positivity rate is around 9.94% which was around 24.60% in September which indicates that the spread is still not under control, says the study. The paper has been prepared after a detailed meeting by the doctors from BJ Medical College, City Covid-19 task force, representatives from National Institute of Virology (NIV) and state government and city administration officials. The paper states that after observing the number of Covid cases in western countries like Spain, England and Italy, once the number of cases reach about 500-1,000 per million population the situation remains the same for around 60-90 days and then the number of cases start rising. The same trend has been observed in case of swine flu too. In addition, the meteorological department has predicted a cold wave in northern India and also with the festive season, the second wave in the country is expected to be around January or February.Covid-19 appropriate behaviours No cracker Diwali: As heavy air pollution caused by firecrackers could lead to breathing troubles among people with respiratory ailments, it would be advisable if the government issues an order banning firecrackers this year.Compulsory use of mask, regularly washing hands, feet and face; social distancing, greetings as per Indian culture (Namaste) instead of a handshake, no spitting or smoking in public places, avoid unnecessary travel, no social boycott of Covid patients or their family members, do not spread rumours or wrong messages using social media platforms, get information only from credible sources, to avoid mental stress, continue talking to friends and relatives while following the above mentioned norms and seek expert advice if need be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/admn-flags-superspreaders-to-contain-effect-of-possible-second-wave/story-0Efgu4zh08AsP6ufKLqykL.html
07-11-2020||Pune||First frog species from Maharashtra gets genetic identity after one century||City-based researchers have identified and re-described Minervarya syhadrensis, the first cricket frog described from Maharashtra in 1919 by Scottish zoologist Thomas Nelson Annandale in the pre-independent India. Over a period of one century, researchers were facing problem in the identification of this frog due to variations in its colour pattern and morphology matching with other frogs making its identification very difficult. The frog was confused with the other species Fejervarya limnocharis found in Indonesia. A team led by Dr Samadhan Phuge from Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and Dr KP Dinesh from Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) Pune studied most of the cricket frogs found in northern Maharashtra and concluded that Minervarya syhadrensis is morphologically cryptic in nature. They studied morphology, gene sequences and acoustic characters to fix the identity of the cricket frog species Minervarya syhadrensis described from Pune one century ago and provided genetic proof for its wide distribution in India with different colour morphs. The authors have published the study in Zootaxa, an international premier journal for zoological systematics and taxonomy published from New Zealand. “In this study, the authors have considered wide range of samples across the Western Ghats and India to understand the phylogenetic relationships. The frog exhibits with different colour patterns and variable morphology in different parts of the Western Ghats and Indian peninsular. Earlier, since there was no genetic data for the species from its type locality Khandala, Pune, there were confusion with the identity and phylogenetic relationship of the species itself. The study highlights the importance of DNA barcode data for the historical species described from the country.” said Dr Dinesh, scientist at ZSI, Pune. Due to unavailability of genetic data, the same species was described with new name in 2005 from the central Western Ghats as the morphological characters were variable and inconsistent while comparing with the new species. But genetic studies suggested the species described in 2005 from the central Western Ghats is nothing but Minervarya syhadrensis described in 1919 from Pune. Researchers predict that this frog could be distributed throughout India and possibly have their range of distribution in the neighbouring countries too. “The other interesting finding of the study is that due to morphological similarities the males of Minervarya syhadrensis attempt to breed with the females of the other species (Minervarya agricola) available in the field during breeding season ending up in unviable inter-species hybrids,” said Dr Samadhan Phuge, researcher at Pune University. “The males of Minervarya syhadrensis generally amplect with the females of the other species (Minervarya agricola). Both the species of frogs call in chorus in the field during breeding season (with enormous noise), which creates difficulties in mate selection for both the species.” he said. This is one of the classical studies where researchers have addressed a century-old problem with DNA barcode data and have made a first report of possible inter-species hybrids between two genetically and distantly related species using acoustic data. The authors believe that the study will stimulate the researchers to investigate the identity and distribution of other classical species of the genus described from India, which lost their identity over the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/first-frog-species-from-maharashtra-gets-genetic-identity-after-one-century/story-ilxl6owl0ZT4XKMZEVEFRO.html

The car driver Yuvaraj Kisan Hanuvale (45) was arrested under IPC 307 (attempt to murder) for endangering the life of constable Abasaheb Vijay Kumar Sawant attached to Chinchwad traffic branch. Investigating officer assistant inspector Raju Thubal said, “The accused has committed the offence as he was enraged. His family members told us that he was unstable due to job loss in 2015. His son serves in the army and they stay in a posh residential area.” The on-duty Sawant was dragged by Hanuvale on the bonnet of his car after the latter did not stop despite being signalled for not wearing mask. Some bikers and a vehicle later blocked the road, thus forcing the car driver to stop. Hanuvale was taken in for police interrogation. He was later arrested in the evening, according to the police.Hanuvale was produced at the PCMC court which remanded him into three days police custody. Investigators said that the accused showed signs of stress and tension during their preliminary course of investigation.Additional police commissioner Ramnath Pokale said, “The accused has been arrested under relevant sections. He committed the crime in a fit of anger and sped ahead with his vehicle endangering the life of the constable,” he said.Besides IPC 307, the police have invoked IPC 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), IPC 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and Motor Vehicle Act 24(2) 177.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-who-drags-cop-on-car-bonnet-to-evade-fine-is-mtech-and-unemployed-pcmc-police/story-g2xkXCvohkHKhdsZA1lCKL.html

The SPPU is conducting re-exams from November 5 to 7 for students who couldn’t appear for the regular exams due to various reasons. However, students continue to report issues even now in the online exams. “I am a student of the third year Bachelor of Science (Mathematics) from SP College, Pune. We gave an exam yesterday of Optimization Technique subject in which around 10 to 15 questions were incomplete or wrong. Due to this, many of us are in confusion about whether we will get full marks on it or we have to give re-exam for that subject so that we can score. I tried to contact the university’s helpline number many times regarding this issue but they didn’t pick my call.” said Aniket Nagarkar, a final year student. Another student, Kamlakar Shete said, “Yesterday on November 5 I had appeared for the paper of Numerical Method and Optimization subject but due to a family medical emergency, I gave the paper late at night around 9:30pm - 10:30pm slot. But when I completed the paper it did not get submitted and showed the ‘504 ERROR’. I don’t want to lose this academic year as the paper is not submitted, maybe I fail the subject.” From October 12, the SPPU started its final year exams for 3,300 subjects for which 2.5 lakh students were enrolled. Right from the first day, both online and offline students were facing a lot of issues while appearing for the exam. For the offline exams, 113 centres have been identified where physical exams were conducted in Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar districts. These exams are of 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) for the duration of one hour. While for all those students who couldn’t attend the exams in the first regular schedule due to any reasons, are now allowed to reappear for the exam from November 5 to 7. But this time the exams are conducted only in online mode. “We are working tirelessly to resolve the issues which students are facing while appearing for the ongoing re-exam.

Prakash Javadekar, minister of Environment, forest and climate change, on Friday, inaugurated a plant erected by Praj technology, which produces compressed biogas from biomass. Javadekar inaugurated the plant virtually.Javadekar said, “Stubble burning is another cause of concern and I hope that technologies like these will help alleviate the problem. The Central government’s PUSA institute has demonstrated a decomposer technology which converts stubble into manure and is being experimented on, on a pilot basis in five states, including Delhi. It will help in dealing with crop residue and is cheap as well. There will be several ways, both in-situ and ex-situ, to fight against the problem of pollution emerging out of stubble burning.”Expressing concern over the pollution levels in the northern parts of the country, especially Delhi, the minister said that the government is working towards abatement of air pollution at the source level, be it industries or thermal power stations, vehicular pollution, construction and demolition waste or stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/javadekar-says-govt-working-to-end-stubble-burning-menace/story-qNe80dj77UDYiEDFl5verL.html

One such hospital is PMC’s Dalvi hospital in Shivajinagar.Dr Rekha Kokarde, in charge at Dalvi hospital, said, “We have only one patient undergoing treatment for the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection, a female aged 65, who is currently stable. She needs intermittent oxygen sometimes so we have not discharged her yet. She tested positive once during her last test and so we will do a re-test after eight days and then take a call on her discharge.”“The hospital was a maternity hospital earlier and so after the patient is discharged we will convert it back to the non-Covid-19 maternity hospital,” she said.Pune district reported 552 fresh Covid-19 cases and 12 Covid-related deaths on Thursday, as per data released by the state health department.As of Thursday the total case count in the district is 3,36,982 and the death to stands at 6,990.MLA Siddharth Shirole had visited the Dalvi hospital facility on Thursday and said, “The hospital will discharge its last Covid-19 patient in the coming few days and revert to a fully functional general hospital.

The decision was taken in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.With this, no permits will be issued for the sale of firecrackers, though a draw of lots was held on Tuesday.UT adviser Manoj Parida, in his capacity as chairman, disaster executive committee, State Disaster Management Authority, issued orders to the effect, stating, “These directions are issued as a containment measure to prevent the risk of spread of Covid-19 due to polluted atmosphere created by bursting of firecrackers.”Any violation of the order will invite penal action under Sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, besides legal action under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and other provisions as applicable.Meanwhile, the decision invited criticism from the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM). “We oppose the decision to ban firecrackers days before Diwali. Traders have already purchased their stock and will suffer huge losses. If the decision was needed to contain the spread of Covid-19, it should have come at least a month ago,” said Charanjiv Singh, chairman, CBM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-bans-sale-use-of-firecrackers/story-mVqwhBie1VSHib25r7YWJL.html
07-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: ‘Time to unite America’||As news channels called the United States presidential election in favour of 78-year-old Joe Biden, after he took the lead in his birth state of Pennsylvania, the president-elect tweeted: “America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country. The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans—whether you voted for me or not. I will keep the faith that you have placed in me.”The President-elect is expected to address the nation from his campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware on Saturday evening. The longest-serving senator of Delaware, former vice president of the United States in the Obama administration, and three-time President hopeful has been elected as the 46th President of the United States of America. His running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris, will make history as the first woman, the first Black American and the first American of Asian descent (Harris’ mother hails from Tamil Nadu, her father from Jamaica), to serve as vice president. News channels and election trackers did not make a definitive call on the results even on Saturday morning, stating that Biden was “on the verge of presidency” with Biden projected to receive between 253 to 264 electoral college votes (different news channels have varying views on Arizona’s 11 votes) at the time of going to print. However, as Biden took a lead in Pennsylvania, which has 20 electoral votes, his tally crossed the mid-way mark of 270.Shortly after his election was made certain, Biden released a statement along the lines of what he has been saying in the past week that has seen President Donald Trump make unsubstantiated claims against postal ballots and Biden’ s lead. “I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris. In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America. With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation. It’s time for America to unite. And to heal. We are the United States of America. And there’s nothing we can’t do, if we do it together,” Biden said.On Thursday, Biden and Harris met a group of experts on the public health and economic crises the country is facing.Biden has promised to use his transition period to meet with the governors of every state and ask them to impose a nationwide mask-wearing mandate. Another key decision will be how Biden decides to deploy his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris. His campaign has indicated that Biden will establish a White House-level coronavirus task force like Trump did, but it’s not clear if he will tap Harris to run it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-time-to-unite-america/story-qFXYWLknxcW6CmoXFpuAPN.html
07-11-2020||World||‘We will overcome Covid-19’: UK PM hails ‘victory of good over evil’ Diwali spirit||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the Diwali spirit of the victory of light over darkness and good over evil as he delivered a message of optimism about overcoming the coronavirus pandemic for a first-of-its-kind virtual Diwali festival this weekend.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 Johnson appealed for a “huge collective effort” as England entered its second stay-at-home lockdown earlier this week, to last at least until December 2, in order to curb a surge in coronavirus infections across the country. “While undoubtedly there are huge challenges ahead, I have every confidence in the resilience and resolve and good sense of people across the country and that together we will overcome this virus, just as Diwali teaches us that light triumphs over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance,” said Johnson from 10 Downing Street in London on Friday. “Just as Lord Rama and his wife Sita found their way home after the defeat of the demon king Ravana, their way lit by many millions of lamps, so too we shall find our way through this, and we shall do so triumphantly,” he said. Acknowledging that people would find it particularly difficult this year with all the lockdown restrictions, Johnson praised the Indian diaspora in the UK for all their sacrifices and efforts at working towards a safe and secure Diwali. He praised the “fantastic virtual Diwali festival” for bringing the spirit of Diwali into people’s homes while helping people stay safe.“I know that celebrating at a distance isn’t easy when you want to get together with all your family or visit your friends or share with them the Diwali fun, as well of course the odd samosa or gulab jamun,” said Johnson, in his inaugural address to the ‘iGlobal Diwali Fest 2020’. “So I want you to know that your sacrifices, and your determination to do the right thing really are helping to save lives, and tough though I know many aspects of this year have been, I have been blown away by the inspirational way in which Hindus, Sikhs and Jains have responded to this crisis with compassion, community spirit and a can-do attitude,” he said. The three-day virtual Diwali Fest kick-started on Friday with the UK PM’s message and will include sessions with UK Home Secretary Priti Patel, Opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer and Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey. The agenda also includes yoga, music and dance performances as well as an awards ceremony to honour British Indian community champions across different fields. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and West Midlands Mayor Andy Street will be among those delivering Diwali messages from different parts of England.Also Read | Liverpool begins UK’s first city-wide coronavirus testing“The Prime Minister, leaders of the main UK political parties and the Mayors of the country’s major metros lining up for Diwali in this way is quite unprecedented and reflects not only the real depth of UK-India ties but also the pivotal role of the UK’s 1.5-million strong Indian diaspora,” said Manoj Ladwa, CEO of the India Inc Group, the UK-based organiser of the event. Among some of the other virtual events scheduled over the weekend include a spiritual session with Art of Living Founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, bhajans from different parts of India and a Bollywood concert headlined by British Indian musician Navin Kundra. Diwali -- the festival of lights -- will be celebrated in India on November 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-will-overcome-covid-19-uk-pm-hails-victory-of-good-over-evil-diwali-spirit/story-aDLhPJ2PiVff1HSlPiEN7L.html
07-11-2020||World||Joe Biden beats Trump in race to the White House after winning tipping-point Pennsylvania||Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, has been elected the 46th president of the United States of America. And Kamala Harris will be the country’s first black and Indian-descent vice-president.Biden, 78, was projected winner of the 2020 White House race by multiple US media organizations at the same time on Saturday, the fifth day of counting, after he took a lead post winning Pennsylvania, the tipping-point state whose 20 Electoral College votes carried the Democrat well past the 270-vote threshold from 264, where he had been for the past two days, to 284. President Donald Trump, whose tally stood at 214 but may change, will be the first one-term president in 30 years. He was on his golf course when Biden was declared winner.“I am honoured and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris. In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America,” President-elect Biden said in a statement, adding, “With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation. It’s time for America to unite. And to heal. We are the United States of America. And there’s nothing we can’t do, if we do it together.”But President Trump indicated it was not over. In a statement issued just before Biden’s statement, he said, “We all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don’t want the truth to be exposed. The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. In Pennsylvania, for example, our legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process. Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media.”“Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots. This is the only way to ensure the public has full confidence in our election. It remains shocking that the Biden campaign refuses to agree with this basic principle and wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters. Only a party engaged in wrongdoing would unlawfully keep observers out of the count room – and then fight in court to block their access.” “So what is Biden hiding? I will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands.”The President has put together a legal team to shepherd the challenges hoping, perhaps, for a repeat of the 2000 recount which gave George W Bush his first term as president. He beat Democrat Al Gore, then the vice-president, in a recount of votes in Florida.The Trump campaign has called for donations to fund the legal fight. “This Election Isn’t Over,” it has said in texts and mail to supporters. “The President needs YOUR HELP! We can’t allow the Left-wing MOB to undermine our Election. President Trump needs his fiercest and most loyal defenders, like YOU, to step up and FIGHT BACK!”But the President’s aides and allies in the Republican party are also reportedly trying to prepare him for conceding, while arguing for his right to seek a recount of votes and sue to correct irregularities. “Mr. Trump’s legacy will be diminished greatly if his final act is a bitter refusal to accept a legitimate defeat,” The Wall Street Journal, a conservative media giant wrote in an editorial on Saturday. “Republican officials will turn away, and eventually so will the American public that wants to see the election resolved.”Biden, who was at home in Wilmington when news broke of his victory , is expected to make a victory speech later in the day. It was not known if President Trump planned to call him, as has been the practice, but he has demanded recounts in two states and has filed several lawsuits challenging the counting process and has alleged fraud and irregularities.Biden has indicated he is ready to move on and said in a speech on Friday that he had gone to work already getting updates and briefings on the Covid-19 epidemic. Biden had continued to increase his lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, when counting resumed on Saturday morning. He was also building on his lead in Georgia (16 electoral college votes), which is headed for a recount as requested by Trump, and in Nevada (6). He is also ahead in Arizona, whose 11 electoral college votes have already been given to him by some news organization, but the President has been chipping away at his lead. Trump leads in North Carolina (15) and Alaska (3).“My fellow Americans, we don’t have a final declaration of victory yet, but the numbers tell a clear and convincing story: We are going to win this race,” the former vice-president had said in a speech from his hometown Wilmington, Delaware, late on Friday, with Kamala Harris, his vice-presidential nominee by his side.“But while we’re waiting for the final results, I want people to know we are not waiting to get to work,” he added.Biden, who ran on the promise of tackling the Covid-19 epidemic as his top priority, said he and Harris on Thursday met a group of experts on the public health crisis and its impact on the economy. The deadly virus has killed more than 236,000 and infected nearly 9.8 million in the United States, shut down millions of businesses and left millions more jobless. The Democratic nominee went on to reiterate his promise to begin tackling the public health crisis from Day One in office.Biden acknowledged, however, “Tensions can be high after a tough election like we just had” referring to the acrimony surrounding the counting of votes, as the Trump campaign has launched an aggressive effort to stop counting in states where the President is trailing and allowing it to continue where he is increasing his numbers, such as in Arizona.He said: “But we need to remain calm. Patient. And let the process work out as we count all the votes. We are proving again what we have proved for 244 years in this country. Democracy works. Your vote will be counted. I don’t care how hard people try to stop it. I will not let it happen.”The former vice-president, who ran also on the promise of unifying the country, sought to dial down tensions. “Strong disagreements are inevitable in a democracy, and strong disagreements are healthy. They’re a sign of vigorous debate, of deeply held views. But we have to remember: The purpose of our politics isn’t total, unrelenting, unending warfare.”He added: “We may be opponents — but we are not enemies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-nominee-joe-biden-beats-trump-in-race-to-the-white-house/story-GjJ8Jse9n6FZJQQwWfc2TL.html

It didn’t specify when the amended laws will take effect.The legal overhaul means that consuming alcohol, living together before marriage and attempting suicide will no longer be considered crimes, The National newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.While punishments for such actions haven’t been commonly applied, some criminal cases involving drunkenness or sex out of wedlock had risen to prominence over the years, marring the Persian Gulf country’s reputation as a magnet for skilled foreign workers. Like other Gulf Arab nations, the oil-dependent UAE relies on expatriates to operate much of the economy.The amendments mean that foreign couples who separate could apply the divorce laws of the country where they married, rather than those of the UAE, The National reported. The paper, based in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi, said the legal changes are effective immediately.WAM said that foreigners in the Islamic country will also be able to choose the inheritance laws that apply to them.In addition to decriminalizing unspecified “actions that don’t harm others,” the government cancelled a mitigating excuse applied to “honor crimes,” WAM reported. Such crimes are commonly understood to include the assault or murder of relatives, usually female, for “dishonoring” their family. Regular criminal penalties would apply in such cases, WAM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-legal-overhaul-could-decriminalize-alcohol-cohabitation/story-WbEzVtSLvts6t4d36mbpCO.html

Prime Minister Khan also denies that the Army helped him win the election in 2018.Also Read | Pak soldiers did not even have weapons during Kargil war, claims Nawaz SharifKhan said that Sharif had run away from the country under the pretext of illness, adding that he was a “money worshipper” and had amassed his wealth by looting the country, the Dawn newspaper reported.The PML-N chief, currently out on bail, is facing multiple corruption charges. The Islamabad High Court had allowed him to go to London for medical treatment in November last year for a period of eight weeks for medical treatment. But he did not come back, while his lawyers told the court that he was still recovering.Khan also slammed Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz for openly accusing the Army of interfering in politics.She is taking advantage of being a woman because women are given respect in Pakistan, he said.“Nawaz Sharif and his sons cannot dare attack the Pakistan Army in the country and this is why they have fled abroad. Since Maryam Nawaz knows that we will not send her behind bars because she is a woman, she has started spewing venom against the Army,” he said.Khan said Pakistanis would never allow corrupt politicians to hurl allegations against the Army.Rebuking the “corrupt political leaders who have gathered under the Pakistan Democratic Movement”, Khan said a group of thieves and looters have gathered who were asking for special concessions after looting the country.“Two major political parties looted the country during the past 30 years but now it is a decisive time to take action against the corrupt and looters,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nawaz-sharif-a-jackal-trying-to-create-rebellion-in-army-says-pak-pm-khan/story-W7iu3ZihEA8vdDu7muAbKK.html

In an opinion piece in Asialyst, a French online newspaper specialising in news from Asia, Guillard said Islamist anger against France has hit predominantly Muslim Asian countries, in particular, Pakistan and Bangladesh.“Openly threatening against the French president, the demonstrators preach the boycott of French products and call on the local authorities to condemn their counterparts in Paris without further ado. Some leaders like Prime Minister Imran Khan are riding the wave, not without demagoguery,” he writes. Macron has been facing criticism from various Muslim-majority countries after he took a tough stand on radical Islam and defended cartoons of Prophet Muhammad. The French president said Islam was a religion in crisis.Macron pledged to fight “Islamist separatism”, which he said was threatening to take control in some Muslim communities around France. The main opposition comes from Pakistan and other Muslim countries where people hit the streets. On October 30, Islamabad had seen a procession of several thousand radical activists converging on the French embassy.In Lahore, two cities in Pakistan, 10,000 supporters of the radical Islamic party Tehreek-e-Labbaik took to the streets chanting slogans and carrying banners with once again unambiguous content. In Multan, a portrait of the French president was burned in the public square by a fevered Zealot crowd.At each of these demonstrations of anger against France, the local security forces were deployed in large numbers to prevent material destruction and assaults on diplomatic or consular buildings, and ensure the safety of personnel.Macron’s remarks did not go well with Pakistan Prime Minister Khan who slammed the French President, saying that he has “chosen to deliberately provoke Muslims”.Also Read | Thousands stage anti-France protests in Bangladesh, PakistanTaking to Twitter, Khan said, “Hallmark of a leader is he unites human beings, as Mandela did, rather than dividing them. This is a time when President Macron could have put healing touch and denied space to extremists rather than creating further polarisation and marginalisation that inevitably leads to radicalisation.”“By attacking Islam, clearly without having any understanding of it, President Macron has attacked and hurt the sentiments of millions of Muslims in Europe and across the world.”The Pakistan leader had in a bizarre letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought a ban on Islamophobic content similar to the prohibition put for the Holocaust on the social networking site.In the letter that he shared on Twitter, Khan said “growing Islamophobia” is encouraging extremism and violence “across the world” - especially through social media platforms such as Facebook.Pakistan also summoned the French ambassador for lodging a “strong protest” against the publication of “blasphemous” sketches and recent comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron, Dawn reported.In a statement, Pakistan Foreign Office Spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry said ambassador Marc Barety was handed over a dossier by the special secretary (Europe), Dawn had reported.The ambassador was told about Pakistan’s condemnation of the publication of blasphemous sketches and the comments later made by Macron, the spokesperson said.Meanwhile, the Pakistan National Assembly unanimously had passed a resolution condemning the publication of blasphemous caricatures in France and the “resurgence of Islamophobic acts” in some countries after a noisy session that witnessed the government and opposition delivering fiery speeches against each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-involves-in-demagoguery-over-macron-s-remark/story-seMZ3mXz3XvkbnETV4HCdL.html
07-11-2020||World||Former Afghan TV presenter killed in explosion in Kabul||A bomb attached to the vehicle of a former presenter on Afghanistan’s TOLO TV exploded early on Saturday, killing the journalist and two other civilians, Kabul police said.The death of Yama Siawash is being investigated and the identity of the other victims was not immediately known, said police spokesman Ferdaws Faramarz. No one has immediately claimed responsibility.Violence and chaos have increased in Afghanistan in recent months with an attack last week on Kabul University that killed 22 people, many of them students. The Islamic State affiliate claimed that attack as well as another assault on an educational institution on October 24, also in the capital, that killed 24 people.The surge in violent attacks comes even as government negotiators and the Taliban are meeting in Qatar to find an end to decades of relentless war in Afghanistan. The two sides have made little progress.The talks were part of a negotiated agreement between the United States and the Taliban to allow US and NATO troops withdraw from Afghanistan, ending 19 years of military engagement.According to initial reports, Siawash was near his home when the bomb attached to his car exploded. An eyewitness, Mohammad Rafi, said Siawash’s father and brother were the first to reach the vehicle that was engulfed in flames.Rafi said all three of those killed were inside the car.Siawash was a former TV presenter who anchored political programmes on TOLO TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-afghan-tv-presenter-killed-in-explosion-in-kabul/story-4e99ixjvmfhtctSPkAnFcJ.html
07-11-2020||World||UK court rejects petition for separate Sikh tick box in Census 2021||The high court of England and Wales on Friday rejected a judicial review claim brought by campaigners seeking quashing the legislation for the 2021 census because it did not include a separate tick box for Sikh ethnicity, stating that there was no error in law.The long-running campaign backed by several MPs was based on claims of alleged significant undercounting of the Sikh population in official statistics without a separate tick box. Census ethnicity figures are used for a range of purposes, including allocation of funds.Campaign group Sikh Federation (UK), which brought the claim, said it would continue to fight for separate recognition for the community. It had argued that the decision to exclude the tick box was based on legally unsustainable reasoning and therefore unlawful.A spokesperson for the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which is preparing for the 2021 census, said: “The census questionnaire has been designed to allow everyone to identify as they wish”.“As in 2011, there will be a Sikh religion tick box and everyone who wishes to identify as Sikh in response to the ethnicity question will be able to do so using search-as-you-type online and through a write-in option on paper”.“We are working across the country, with local groups and organisations, to raise awareness of the census and promote the different response options available.”According to ONS recommendations based on research and consultation, the religion question in the census will have a specific Sikh tick-box option, and those who wish to identify as Sikh in response to the ethnicity question will be able to do so using search-as-you-type online and a write-in option on paper.Justice Akhlaq Choudhury said: “It is important for the reader to note that this judgment is not concerned with whether or not there should be a Sikh tick-box in the census form or with the respective merits of the arguments for and against such a tick-box”.“Such matters are not for the Court to determine. This judgment is concerned solely with the question whether, as alleged by the Claimant, the Cabinet Office, which has responsibility for laying the necessary legislation for the 2021 Census, has acted unlawfully in the process leading to the making of the Census Order. This is solely a question of law”.The court ruled that it could not be successfully argued that ONS had failed to apply a stated policy to its assessment of whether to include an ethnic tick-box for the Sikh religion, adding that there was no unlawful failure to apply a published policy or unlawful application of an unpublished policy.Rosa Curling, of legal firm Leigh Day that represented the claimants, said: “Our clients are obviously disappointed the court did not agree with their concerns about the decision-making process leading to the exclusion of a Sikh ethnic tick-box in the next census”.“Our clients will continue their campaign through political channels and fight to rectify any disadvantages that might arise from a lack of data collected about their community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-court-rejects-petition-for-separate-sikh-tick-box-in-census-2021/story-aNrZD8EGbaR2vzOY2dCAVL.html
07-11-2020||World||China opposes US’ move to remove ETIM from terrorist outfit list||China accused the United States of applying ‘double standards’ following the state department’s move to remove the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) from its list of terrorist organisations.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin expressed Beijing’s “strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition” to the move during a regular press briefing on Friday, reported Liu Zhen for South China Morning Post.“ETIM is an internationally recognised terrorist organisation that seriously threatens the safety of China and the world....The US backtracking on its designation shows double standards - they are using the terrorist organisation to promote their own interests and holding back international cooperation on counterterrorism,” said Wang.A Chinese analyst said that the move could encourage attacks against China.Li Wei, a counterterrorism expert from China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a government-backed think tank in Beijing, termed the move ‘irresponsible’.“Against the current backdrop of increasing terrorist attacks in Europe, the US is applying double standards here....Not only is this decision irresponsible for international counterterrorism efforts, but it’s also irresponsible in terms of its own national security,” SCMP quoted Li.The counterterrorism expert also speculated that the US move would send a message to ETIM and encourage its activities against China.Beijing has accused ETIM of carrying out a number of deadly terror attacks across China and in other countries and claimed that it has ties with al-Qaeda and the Taliban.Liu writes that the group has been on the United Nations Security Council’s list of terrorist organisations since 2002, and it has been blacklisted by the European Union, Britain, and Turkey among others.Earlier, the US government had removed the ETIM from its list of terrorist organisations after nearly two decades that has led to the weakening of China’s anti-terror pretext for a draconian crackdown on Uyghurs in its Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the group had been removed from the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to an order issued on October 20 made public on Thursday.“I hereby revoke the designation of the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement, also known as ETIM, as a ‘terrorist organization,’“ the order reads, as quoted by Radio Free Asia.The US move comes amid worldwide condemnation of China’s policies in Xinjiang, where a large population of Muslim minorities is detained in re-education camps.About seven per cent of the Muslim population in Xinjiang has been incarcerated in an expanding network of “political re-education” camps, according to US officials and UN experts.However, China regularly denies such mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training. People in the internment camps have said they are subjected to forced political indoctrination, torture, beatings, and denial of food and medicine, besides being prohibited from practising their religion or speaking their language.

That included 4,331 people who required life support, a single day rise of 101.France went into a new lockdown to curb the “brutal” virus circulation a week ago, forcing closure of non-essential shops, including cafes, restaurants and shops not selling basic foods or medicines.People were ordered to stay home. They have to sign documents if they have to go out to work, buy essential products or for a health emergency.Earlier on Friday, French Health Minister Olivier Veran said it was premature to evaluate the effects of the second nationwide-lockdown as epidemic indicators show deteriorating sanitary situation.“It is too early to say whether the containment put in place is effective. It takes time between the moment when people reduce their contacts and the time when the virus circulates less rapidly,” Veran said.“We will have the answer within a few days...If things do not get better, it may be necessary to take additional measures,” he added.As the world is struggling to contain the pandemic, countries including France, China, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States are racing to find a vaccine.According to the website of the World Health Organization, as of Nov. 3, there were 202 Covid-19 candidate vaccines being developed worldwide, and 47 of them were in clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-s-covid-19-daily-infections-top-60-000-an-all-time-high/story-kEI4WrOBEPffppjnqTlqOL.html

07-11-2020||World||Kamala Harris on the verge of many, many firsts||Kamala Harris stands to write several chapters of history when she is formally declared US Vice-President-elect, a prospect that looks inevitable as the race for White House nears closure.Born of a mother from India and a father from Jamaica, Harris will become the first woman, first Indian American, first Black, first South Asian American and the first Asian ever elected as vice-president if Joe Biden wins the US presidential elections.Harris, who had accepted Biden’s announcement of her selection with a shout-out to her “Chithis” (Tamil for aunts) connected with several constituencies at the same time: African Americans, Asian Americans, South Asian Americans and, of course, the 4.5 million Indian Americans, 1.9 mn of whom are eligible to vote.Perhaps alarmed by her wide appeal, President Donald Trump, who had one said she would be a “fine choice” as a running mate for Biden began to target her right away. He called her “nasty” and a “monster”. He frequently mispronounced her first name as a tactic usually employed to make Americans of different ethnicities feel unwelcome — he had done the same with President Barak Obama by insisting on adding his middle name whenever he referred to him — and led his supporters to boo at her at his rallies.Trump ally and Republican Senator David Perdue took the President’s lead and mocked her name at a rally in Georgia. The Biden campaign turned that into a mobilisation opportunity with people jumping in to explain the meaning of their names, and offering suggestions on how to pronounce them right.The Indian American community was electrified by her selection. “Harris has mobilised Indian Americans, especially Democrats,” said a survey report by Carnegie. “Harris’ vice-presidential candidacy has galvanised a large section of the Indian American community to turn out to vote. On balance, while the Harris pick might not change a large numbers of votes (given the community’s historic Democratic tilt), her candidacy is linked to greater enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket.”Harris spoke of mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the United States from Chennai and was a breast cancer researcher, frequently while campaigning. “How I wish she were here tonight but I know she’s looking down on me from above,” Harris said the Democratic party convention while accepting her nomination as the vice-presidential nominee.“I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman—all of five feet tall—who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California... On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States of America,” Harris said.Harris started her career in public office as a public attorney in Oakland, California.She was elected to the US senate in 2016 from the state of California and is now on track to be vice-president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-kamala-harris-on-the-verge-of-many-many-firsts/story-O7PwGrfaD7wwFP7TM4w1cL.html

07-11-2020||World||President’s last stand: Donald Trump not yet done, repeats ‘fraud’ claims||The walls are closing in, but don’t expect President Donald J Trump to go gently into the night.At around 9:30pm on Thursday, the US president stood before reporters at the White House briefing room, and began to speak in his usual combative style. “I’d like to provide the American people an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of our very important 2020 election. If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the elections from us. I’ve already decisively won many critical states including massive victories in Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio despite historic interference of Big Media, Big Money, Big Tech…” As he spoke, Trump’s lead in two key states — Pennsylvania and Georgia — was down to 73,633 and 9,426 from 164,414 and 23,009 respectively. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had already eclipsed him in Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial “Blue Wall” battlegrounds on Thursday, and eventually overtook the President in Georgia early Friday. By Friday evening India time, Biden flipped the state of Pennsylvania, gaining a lead of 9,027 votes at the time of going to print, and looking on the road to becoming the 46th US president. Trump left the podium without taking questions, and held no other public events on Thursday. He also did not make any reference to the record surge of positive Covid-19 cases in the country His speech was fact-checked or cut midway by some TV networks on the grounds that they did not want to spread misinformation. Shepard Smith of CNBC, for example, interrupted the broadcast when Trump referred to the “tens of millions of unsolicited ballots (mailed out by election officers) without any verification measures” and stated, “we’re interrupting this because what the President of the United States is saying, in large part, is absolutely untrue.” Trump has been trying to create a distinction between votes polled on Election Day and the postal ballots that were mailed to voting centres — a legitimate form of the voting process used in unprecedented numbers this year on account of the coronavirus pandemic — and on Twitter soon after polling closed, called the votes “illegal”. His team launched a campaign asking voters to “help stop voter suppression, irregularities and fraud”, accusing the Democrats of trying to “steal” the elections,though the process has run smoothly across the country with no evidence of fraud.Trump’s legal team filed a flurry of complaints over vote monitoring in Pennsylvania and ineligible voting in Nevada. A case in Georgia related to 53 ballots was tossed out. His team won a court order requiring Pennsylvania to segregate mail-in ballots from voters who were asked to provide missing proof of identification during an extended period for allowing such fixes, as well as an order to allow observers to get closer to watch the counting of mail-in ballots in Philadelphia. The lawsuits filed on Wednesday in Georgia and Michigan were both dismissed.Trump’s campaign also said it planned to sue in Nevada, alleging some people voted despite not meeting residency requirements. It held a combative press conference in Las Vegas where Trump allies, Richard Grenell and Matt Schlapp, clashed with media, declined to identify themselves and didn’t take questions after claiming without proof the poll was fraudulent. Donald Trump Jr tweeted that his father’s best option was “to go to total war over this election to expose all of the fraud.” He demanded Republicans who would be on the ballot in 2024 to rally around the president. “Don’t worry @realDonaldTrump will fight & they can watch as usual!” he tweeted.With inputs from Agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-s-last-stand-donald-trump-not-yet-done-repeats-fraud-claims/story-2dTu9R2t2Hxn9PlLAPyAgM.html

We don’t have any evidence at the moment that it would,” Swaminathan told a virtual press briefing.The coronavirus mutations in minks need to be studied properly before experts can say if there can be any complications and what kind, Maria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 Technical Lead at WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said.“What we understand is the minks have been infected with contact from humans, it circulates in the mink and then it could pass back to humans. So there’s always a concern when you have circulation and transmission from humans to animals and then from animals to humans. So there is a number of activities that are ongoing to understand the situation in Denmark,” Van Kerkhove said.According to the expert, mutations are normal and experts have been monitoring all changes in the virus since the beginning.“In this situation, there is a suggestion that some of these mutations may have some implications, but we need to do the proper studies to evaluate this. and that is ongoing right now with colleagues at the SSI in Denmark as well as our international working group,” Van Kerkhove said.What the study needs is more sequences to examine, the expert said.“As this virus continues to circulate the globe, as we see it in mink, in different populations, those sequences need to be shared because they need to be evaluated, they need to be studied, they need to be discussed,” Van Kerkhove said.There is no evidence yet that this particular mutation behaves differently from others, Michael J. Ryan, the executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said.“It may have a slightly different signature, but it is still the same virus. What we have to evaluate over time is whether this virus has any difference in transmission or clinical severity or whether there are any implications for diagnostics or vaccines. But we’re a long, long way away from making any determination of that kind,” Ryan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/too-early-to-judge-if-covid-19-mutation-in-minks-can-impact-vaccine-who-chief-scientist/story-wstMLvUvGkgRAFADRTjqAL.html

Cases of the coronavirus disease have also been identified at mink farms in other countries, including the Netherlands and Spain, since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mutated-variant-of-coronavirus-linked-to-minks-found-in-214-people-in-denmark/story-Eaa6qCOSoaNMl9embnzmPP.html
07-11-2020||World||Liverpool begins UK’s first city-wide coronavirus testing||Liverpool on Friday began England’s first city-wide trial of coronavirus testing in an attempt to prevent hospitals becoming overwhelmed during the country’s second wave of the pandemic.All of the northwestern city’s 500,000 residents as well as people working there will be offered repeat tests, even if asymptomatic, under the pilot, which will initially run for two weeks.Hundreds of soldiers took over a local holiday park, some of the 2,000 armed forces personnel called in to support the testing drive.Jurgen Klopp, manager of Liverpool football club, urged people to get tested.“Do it for yourself, your family, your colleagues and your city. Let’s do it together, let’s do it for Liverpool,” he said in a video message posted on the club’s Twitter account. Liverpool last month became the first English city to enter the most severe tier of regional lockdown as it battled a spike in cases, followed by nearby Manchester.A month-long nationwide lockdown then came into force on Thursday after cases began to spiral in all parts of England.Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson, whose brother died of Covid-19 last month, said the pilot could save lives and “get the city out of tier three restrictions”.Britain is already grappling with the worst toll in Europe with over 48,000 dead after testing positive for the disease.Matthew Ashton, Liverpool’s director of public health, told the BBC the pilot could last longer than two weeks, saying they “want to make sure it is long enough for us to be able to see the impact”.“The point of this is to get the city tested,” he said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday the kind of cheap new tests being used in Liverpool “can be a massive and possibly decisive use to us in this country in defeating the virus”.The tests involve swabs and new “lateral flow” tests, akin to pregnancy tests, which can provide a result within 20 minutes. New testing sites have been set up across the city, in schools, universities, offices and care homes. The government has already spent £12 billion ($16 billion) on testing programmes across Britain. But researchers say most members of the public have been failing to isolate after testing positive, and support staff have struggled to reach all of their contacts to limit the spread of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/liverpool-begins-uk-s-first-city-wide-coronavirus-testing/story-Kv4eWSkkDjHYYEIbMLTg4M.html
07-11-2020||World||UN says needs $665 million to avert measles and polio epidemics||Severe disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic to immunisation campaigns against measles and polio are putting millions of vulnerable children at risk from deadly and debilitating diseases, United Nations agencies said on Friday.Issuing an urgent call for funding to avert epidemics of the contagious diseases, the UN children’s fund UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) said $655 million was needed to address “dangerous immunity gaps” in poor and middle-income countries.“We cannot allow the fight against one deadly disease to cause us to lose ground in the fight against other diseases,” UNICEF’s executive director Henrietta Fore said in a statement.Fore said the $655 million needed included $400 million for polio and $255 million for measles.Measles - one of the world most contagious known diseases - has staged a global resurgence in recent years, with ongoing outbreaks in all parts of the world.Vaccination coverage gaps have been further exacerbated in 2020 by Covid-19, and the WHO said data on measles death rates for 2019, due to be released next week, “will show the continued negative toll that sustained outbreaks are having”.With polio, case numbers worldwide had been reduced to extremely low levels before the Covid-19 pandemic, but transmission of the crippling virus is now expected to increase in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and in areas of Africa where polio vaccination coverage rates have dipped.“We now have huge numbers of un- or under-immunised children,” the WHO’s director of immunisation, vaccines and biologicals Catherine O’Brien told a briefing in Geneva.She said disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic to health services had led to 91 routine vaccination campaigns being stopped in 53 countries.“They’re coming back, but they haven’t come back fully or as quickly as we were hoping they will,” she said, adding that this was creating “immunity gaps” for measles, polio and several other infectious diseases.“If we don’t act quickly soon for both polio, measles, yellow fever, cholera, typhoid, we will see significant outbreaks in 2021 or 2022,” O’Brien said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-needs-665-million-to-avert-measles-and-polio-epidemics/story-waujkXWP0VypbHTkjTYj1H.html
07-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Mr. President-elect?||Joe Biden, the scrappy kid from Scranton who overcame a stutter, was on the verge on Friday of winning the White House after overtaking President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, and the “tipping-point” state where he trailed by 700,000 votes at one stage. He led also in all but one of the remaining states that had not been called yet.Pennsylvania’s 20 Electoral College votes alone will suffice, however. Biden has been at 264 votes, according to the Associated Press tracker (other news outlets have him at 253 with Arizona still up for grabs according to them), to President Trump’s 214. That tally has remained unchanged for more than a day now. But as time passed and leads changed, he was fast emerging as the clear winner.The former vice-president was expanding his lead over the President in Pennsylvania, was narrowly ahead in Georgia (16 electoral college votes), a Republican stronghold that had last voted Democratic in 1992, and in Nevada (6). President Trump was ahead in North Carolina (15), but that alone was not sufficient to get him anywhere near a credible path to victory.There was been no word from Biden or his campaign on the outcome till the time of going to print on Friday. But a sense of anticipation was setting in. His Secret Service security was being beefed up, according to reports, and a “no-fly zone” order by the US Federal Aviation Administration went into effect for over his home in Wilmington, Delaware.But the Trump campaign reacted by, not surprisingly, rejecting increasing signs of the inevitability of Biden’s victory. “This election is not over. The false projection of Joe Biden as the winner is based on results in four states that are far from final,” Matt Morgan, Trump campaign’s general counsel, said in a statement. He indicated the campaign would seek a recount of votes in Georgia, and repeated the campaign’s grievances and allegations of election irregularities in Pennsylvania. Morgan also claimed the President was “on course” to win Arizona (11), where Trump has indeed narrowed the gap between him and Biden. Associated Press and Fox News have projected Biden will win the state, but the Trump campaign has contested that decision. “Biden is relying on these states for his phony claim on the White House, but once the election is final, President Trump will be re-elected,” he added. The Trump campaign has already said he would seek a recount in Wisconsin (10) and filed lawsuits in Michigan (16) and Pennsylvania seeking more access to the counting centres. The President was not conceding, not yet, at least. Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesperson, said in a statement reacting to those reports, “As we said on July 19th, the American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”“Keep the faith, folks,” Biden tweeted shortly after the President’s angry White House speech on Thursday evening. He has repeatedly urged patience.Biden, who will be the oldest person to be sworn in as president when the time comes, at 78, has waited patiently for 32 years for this moment, having first run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1987. He dropped out then even before the primaries over plagiarism allegations. He tried again in 2008, but pulled out after a poor showing in the first of the nominating contests, the Iowa caucus, bowing out to Barack Obama and later joining the ticket as his running mate.The 2020 race did not start too well for Biden either. He fared poorly in the first two nominating contests, Iowa and New Hampshire; did somewhat better in the third in Nevada; and went to the fourth in South Carolina with the fate of his campaign hanging in balance. He crushed it, with the overwhelming support of the state’s Black Democrats.

07-11-2020||World||Australia condemns Chinese trade restrictions as diplomatic ties worsen||Australia said on Friday it was closely monitoring exports to China amid “deeply troubling” reports that Chinese buyers have been told not to purchase seven categories of Australian goods ranging from coal to wine, further souring diplomatic tensions.Australian media have reported that Chinese importers had been informally warned by customs officials that commodities including copper ore, barley, sugar, timber and lobster will face increased inspections from Friday.Trade minister Simon Birmingham said Chinese officials had publicly and privately denied any coordinated effort was being taken against Australia, and said he hoped Beijing “is true to its word”.“They deny any discriminatory actions that are being taken. But that doesn’t seem to be what industry is seeing and hearing at present,” he said on radio station 5AA.A Chinese source briefed on the matter said that trade in the goods was effectively halted for now, and other products such as beef could be affected in future. “It was not an absolute order, but a suggestion,” the person said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. China buys nearly a third of Australia’s exports.A Beijing-based wine importer and distributor told Reuters his customs agent in Shanghai was called to a meeting last week and warned that Australian wine would no longer be processed by customs after November 6. An employee at the company was also called to a meeting in Beijing on Monday and told that Australian wine would not be processed “until other issues were addressed,” he said. The other issues weren’t specified, he added.Relations between Australia and its largest trading partner have become strained after Beijing was angered by Australia’s call for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus, and Australian police raids connected to foreign interference investigations.Asked to confirm if China imposed restrictions on Australian imports, foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing on Friday that measures taken by China, which he did not specify, are “legitimate, reasonable and beyond reproach.”Some Chinese importers had already shunned Australian products, even without explicit government orders. Two beef importers told Reuters they had recently bought products from South America instead.“You don’t know what’s going to happen, and whether the cargoes will be able to come in when they arrive,” said a manager with a Beijing-based meat importer.“There is no explicit order on beef yet, but you can try to understand the situation yourself,” said the manager.Australian companies stopped sending rock lobster to China this week after new customs inspections were imposed on the live seafood, resulting in lobsters dying before they could reach customers. China also halted some imports of timber and banned barley shipments from an Australian-based exporter.“Clearly it’s unacceptable for precious fragile cargo like live seafood to sit on a port for days on end waiting to clear,” Birmingham told reporters.China earlier this year launched an anti-dumping investigation into Australian wine, and imposed dumping tariffs on Australian barley.Birmingham said the “range and extent of concerns that industry are hearing is deeply troubling”. “The constant stream, it seems, of concerning, troubling administrative or other decisions being taken in China, heightens the risk for Australian businesses.”Australia’s agriculture department held a meeting on Thursday for 400 farmers and exporters to China, warning of the recent delays and commercial losses, it said in a statement to Reuters. Department officials told exporters to seek advice from importers in China on potential disruptions.An editorial in the state-run China Daily newspaper on Friday said China’s investigations covered only a small portion of imports from Australia, adding Canberra should “steer clear of Washington’s brinkmanship with China before it is too late”.“Choosing sides will be a decision Australia will come to regret as its economy will only suffer further pain,” it said, referring to Australia’s US alliance. Australia joined the United States, India and Japan for the three-way Malabar naval exercise on Thursday, the first time Australia has participated since 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-condemns-chinese-trade-restrictions-as-diplomatic-ties-worsen/story-aDGu0cJMXBoCn56afzjTaO.html
07-11-2020||India||UAE unveils major changes to personal and criminal laws||The United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Saturday unveiled a raft of changes to personal and criminal laws, including decriminalisation of alcohol consumption and divorce under the laws of country of origin, that will have implications for millions of Indian expatriates. UAE President, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, approved federal law decrees to amend personal status, civil transactions, penal code, and criminal procedural laws to enhance the legislative environment and “entrench the principles of tolerance in the society and strengthen the country’s position as a preferred hub that attracts people to reside and work”, state-run WAM news agency reported. The UAE is home to some 3.4 million Indians, one of the largest diaspora populations in West Asia, and the expatriates include professionals and blue collar workers. The changes were described by The National newspaper as “one of the biggest overhauls of the legal system in years” and the new laws “reflect progressive measures to improve living standards” and to ensure the UAE remains “a destination for foreign direct investment”. Several of the changes will have significant implications for expatriates, as the laws of the country of origin will now apply in matters such as divorces instead of Shariah or Islamic law. “Based on the UAE’s solid commitment to protecting women’s rights, amendments to the penal code and criminal procedural law have repealed the article giving reduced (lenient) sentence in what is called ‘honour crimes’,” WAM reported. In cases of divorce or separation of expatriates in the UAE, the laws of the country where the marriage took place will apply, and a court could mediate in the division of joint assets and joint accounts. Cases of wills or division of assets of a deceased expatriate who didn’t leave a will also will be handled under the laws of the country of nationality, instead of Shariah, as was the case in the past. Suicide and attempted suicide were decriminalised under the changes. Anyone who survived an attempt to take their life could have been prosecuted under the earlier laws. Alcohol consumption too was decriminalised and a person drinking or in possession of alcohol or selling alcohol in authorised areas without an alcohol licence won’t face penalties, according to media reports. However, a person must be 21 years old to drink legally and anyone found selling alcohol to an underage person will still be punished. The changes also allow the “legal cohabitation of unmarried couples”. So far, it was illegal for an unmarried couple or unrelated persons to share a home in the UAE. Consensual sex won’t be punished under the changes, but consensual sex involving a person under 14 years of age or a mentally challenged person will be punished. A person convicted of sexual intercourse with a minor or mentally challenged person by force will be given the death penalty. A key change to the penal code was the abolition of an article that allowed reduced punishment for so-called “honour crimes”. Under the changes, such crimes will be treated as assault or murder. Another important change that could benefit Indians is an amendment to the penal procedural law that states arresting officers must have an interpreter present if a suspect or witness doesn’t know Arabic. Courts must also ensure that legal translators are available for defendants and witnesses who don’t speak Arabic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-unveils-major-changes-to-personal-and-criminal-laws/story-OVg8fVLWMTbQzX1D9CEQbO.html
07-11-2020||India||New farm laws: Open to talks with farmers, says govt||Ahead of another farmer protest planned for month-end against the three farm laws, the Centre on Saturday asserted that these laws are in the interest of the farming community and it was still open to have dialogue with them and clear their doubts.       Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar as well as food minister Piyush Goyal said these laws are enacted by the central government in order to give more options to farmers to sell their produce at better rates, but states like Punjab are “misleading” them. Ever since the three laws were passed in Parliament in September, farmers have been protesting largely in the Congress-ruled states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Punjab which have brought their own farm laws to negate the central acts. Speaking to reporters, Tomar said: “If they (Opposition) wear farmers’ glasses and see the laws, they will be able to see the benefits for farmers. If they see from the political prism, they cannot see the benefits.”     He also reiterated that farmers will continue to get MSP for the notified crops and procurement centres will continue to function.       “Opposition is spreading misinformation and lies,” he alleged adding that the data on paddy procurement undertaken in Punjab so far in the ongoing kharif season itself shows the Centre’s commitment towards MSP buying.       Stating that such protests are confined to Punjab, Goyal said those will wither way. It was not successful in neighbouring Haryana.     “Procurement centres are fully operational even now. In fact, we have increased them substantially this year. So, there is no question of the Centre scrapping MSP procurement...,” he said, and urged the Opposition to stop misleading farmers. He said the total paddy procurement across the country has risen sharply to 745 lakh tonne till November 6 of the 2020-21 kharif marketing season from 318 lakh tonne in the same period of 2013-14.     Goyal also mentioned that unless the protesting farmers do not clear the rail tracks in Punjab and the state government does not ensure law and order, the services cannot be resumed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-farm-laws-open-to-talks-with-farmers-says-govt/story-UcifxWbSx6gjpO5PdohusM.html

But as per the current estimates the chances for this year are only Rs 33,704 crore as the income. With this, the state’s own income will be reduced by Rs 33,904 crore.The officials said the state government’s share in the Central taxes had also decreased considerably. In the Union Budget it was mentioned that for 2020-2021 financial year, the Centre would allocate Rs 16,727 crore to the State as its (State’s) share. According to this, the state should get Rs 8363 crore for the financial year 2020-2021 from April to October. But the state received only Rs 6,339 crore from the Centre. As on date there is a reduction of Rs 2025 crore in the taxes. By the end of financial year 2020-2021, it is estimated that the state would get Rs 11,898 Crore instead of Rs 16,727 crore, which was its actual due. With this, the state would lose Rs 4,829 crore, they said.Under several centrally sponsored and assisted schemes, the state has to get Rs 9,725 crore from the centre. By October, the state should have got Rs 5,673 crore, but it got only Rs 4,592 crore - a shortfall of Rs 1,081 crore from the Centre. By end of this financial year, the state may get only Rs 8,923 crore instead of Rs 9,725 crore. Thus, there will be Rs 802 crore cut in the centrally sponsored and assisted schemes’ funds.Since there will be a shortfall of Rs 52,750 crore in the state’s overall income, the chief minister instructed the officials concerned to fix priorities accordingly and prepare financial management plan.The officials from the finance department also told the chief minister that there had been no financial assistance from the Centre to rehabilitate the victims of the recent rains and floods. The matter was mentioned when the topic on the Centre’s assistance for the recent rains and floods came up for discussion on Saturday at the review meeting.Rao had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 15 stating that there was a loss of crops and properties to the extent of Rs 5,000 crore due to rains and floods and requested for release of Rs 1,350 crore as an immediate relief.“The President, Vice President and the PM have expressed their shock over the heavy rains and floods. They spoke with the CM and personally inquired about the situation. The Central team also visited the state and assessed the situation. After all this, we have expected some assistance from the Centre. But as on date, not even a single rupee is released,” the officials told KCR as Rao is also known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-to-cut-budget-allocations-after-rs-53k-cr-revenue-loss-due-to-covid-19/story-O9ds20qD76FMRZ6sqE5ndI.html
07-11-2020||India||Centre’s first drone pilot training programme announced at IGRUA||The Centre-run flight training institute Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA) here on Saturday announced its expansion plan to begin drone pilot training courses, a first of its kind initiative by a government body.The premier aircraft pilot training institute in Uttar Pradesh had recently entered into an agreement with Delhi-based private firm Drone Destination for the collaborative effort.Noting that drones are an “absolutely new and emerging area with immeasurable potential and opportunities”, Ministry of Civil Aviation (MOCA) Secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola said “making of drones is becoming a reality in India”.“We led the software revolution, and in the drone revolution also we have the potential of becoming number one. In that direction, we have taken a small step. The first thing is even drone operations require pilots and one of the first training centres for drones is being established in IGRUA,” Kharola said.“The entire regulatory framework for drones has been put in place and very soon drones would be regulated, monitored, observed and controlled just as is being done for aircraft,” he added.He also noted that in the coming years, the number of drones flying in the Indian skies may go into hundreds of thousands and their monitoring would be a challenge.Also Read | Country’s first batch of certified pilots ready to operate drones“The challenge is that we have to ensure that not only we become leaders in drone manufacturing but also in their management,” Kharola said.He also mooted the idea for IGRUA, a government-run autonomous institute, to eventually move into drone manufacturing, design and management besides imparting training for its pilots.Kharola, who was joined by MOCA Joint Secretary Amber Dubey, was speaking at the 36th foundation day of IGRUA.IGRUA Director Krishnendu Gupta said drone pilot training would begin shortly at the institute’s campus located at Fursatganj in Amethi.“Under the collaborative initiative, IGRUA will provide its resources while the Drone Destination will chip in with its expertise in drones to train the aspirants,” Gupta told PTI.He said the course duration would be around two-weeks and added that the institute will soon also begin a programme on English Language Proficiency (ELP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-s-first-drone-pilot-training-programme-announced-at-igrua/story-g8MEZehYb51WLbKrLxN3SO.html
07-11-2020||India||After a muted Durga Puja, Bengal prepares for winter’s fairs and festivals||After celebrating a muted Durga Puja and the Calcutta High Court imposing multiple restrictions on Kali Puja and other pujas, Bengal is now looking forward to its multiple fairs and festivals that are organized every year during the winter.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has directed various departments to explore if fairs could be held in various districts which would not only help the artisans to sell their handicrafts but would also help the government to showcase its projects ahead of the Bengal polls. “The chief minister, in a recent administrative meeting, has asked officials to explore whether in each of the blocks in the districts small fairs and exhibitions could be organised. Officials have been directed to plan from now so that the fairs could be held during the peak winter months of December and January,” a senior official. Starting from November, multiple fairs and festivals are organized in Kolkata and in the districts that attract lakhs of visitors. Artisans and traders from across the state participate in the fairs to sell their products resulting in a huge volume of trade. The list includes some of the biggest fairs and festivals such as the International Kolkata Book Fair, the Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF), the handicraft fair, trade fair and food festival. In January the Ganga Sagar Mela, the second largest congregation of pilgrims in India after the Kumbh Mela, is held. “While preparations have already begun for the Ganga Sagar Mela, the KIFF has been postponed till January. Talks are yet to be held to hold the book fair,” said a senior official. The chief minister has also asked the tourism department and the MSME department to explore whether small fairs could be organized in and around the tourist destinations in the coming months. “This would not just help to promote tourism but would also help to support the local artisans. Some of the fairs have been started by the TMC government after it came to power,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-a-muted-durga-puja-bengal-prepares-for-winter-s-fairs-and-festivals/story-I8uSj9kPNZ3oyUiwpHqaCJ.html

07-11-2020||India||Day after Amit Shah’s visit to Bengal, TMC, BJP taunt each other||The political temperature in Bengal shot up a few degrees on Saturday with the ruling Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party attacking each other a day after Union home minister Amit Shah returned from a two-day visit. While the TMC questioned the credentials of Jay Shah, son of the Union home minister, who holds the post of the secretary of Board of Control for Cricket in India, the BJP started a twitter campaign with the hashtag #BanglarPappuDiwas (Bengal’s Pappu Day) tagging Abhishek Banerjee, nephew of chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Shah had come on a two-day visit to Bengal to take stock of the party’s organisational preparedness ahead of the crucial 2021 Bengal assembly elections. During his many interactions with the media and BHP workers Shah hit out at the TMC over its alleged minority appeasement and deteriorating law and order, demanded a white paper on political killings and urged voters to give the BJP a chance to run West Bengal. “What credentials Jay Shah has to suddenly hold one of India’s top administrative cricket posts? Or what magic formula Jay Shah had to become BCCI secretary out of nowhere?” the TMC said in a statement, released after Shah’s visit. The statement also accused Shah of playing dirty politics. The BJP, however, hit out and launched a counter-offensive against Abhishek Banerjee with the party’s IT cell starting a Twitter campaign targeting the chief minister’s nephew. “India has seen how BJP’s development agenda and positivity scores over dynasty politics nationally. Bengal can’t afford to get mired in the same incompetence of family politics. Bengal will reject @abhishekAITC brand of siphoning public money and politics of fear. #BanglarPappuDiwas,” tweeted Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP’s national general secretary. After the BJP’s impressive performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which the party won 18 out of the 42 seats, the BJP is now eyeing the West Bengal assembly. On October 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the people of Bengal on the occasion of Durga Sasthi virtually sounding the poll bugle. Shah’s visit seemed to have also temporarily ended some of the infighting in the Bengal unit of the BJP.In the last week of October, West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh dissolved all the district committees of the BJPs Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the state youth front headed by Lok Sabha member Saumitra Khan. Later, an aggrieved Khan left the BJYM WhatsApp group, saying he would resign from the BJP. He, however, returned to the group after a few hours and uploaded a video message on his Twitter handle. The party’s central leaders had to intervene.On Saturday, however, a day after Shah’s visit, the BJP came up with a fresh list of BJYM district presidents. “There aren’t any differences. A new list of BJYM district presidents have been announced with the permission of central leadership. This is final,” said a senior BJP leader. While the BJP has already made some organisational changes in its Bengal unit and central leaders want the state unit to hit the road with full steam and subsequently intensify campaign for the assembly polls due in about five months, Shah during his visit is known to have laid out detailed plans and guidelines on how to reach the finish line. The entire movement will be monitored from Delhi, a senior BJP leader said. On Saturday both the BJP and the TMC announced new members who joined their parties. While the BJP said that two former local CPI (M) leaders joined the party, the TMC said that some members of the civil society including former police officers and professors signed up for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-amit-shah-s-visit-to-bengal-tmc-bjp-taunt-each-other/story-wAstfnrVMvn0zKPYWubHuJ.html

Nath is making calls to them. It was Nath who played the politics of horse trading and effected manipulations. Nath has muddied politics of Madhya Pradesh,” Chouhan told reporters.He was responding to a query on allegations raised by Nath on Friday that the BJP was again trying to lure away some legislators of the Congress.By-elections were held on November 3 for the 28 constituencies, 25 of which fell vacant due to resignations by Congress MLAs who joined the BJP earlier this year while the rest three seats have been unrepresented due to demise of the sitting legislators.“...Whenever Congress resorts to this (horse-trading), it’s termed as management but when someone comes to us (join the BJP) on his own, then it is called a horse-trading,” Chouhan said.Holding Nath responsible for “political corruption”, the senior BJP leader said MLAs of the BJP would not fall prey to the attempts being made by the Congress to lure them.“Our MLAs work for principles and ideology,” he said.Chouhan further said Congress and Nath were rattled as they have sensed imminent defeat in the bypolls.On Friday, Nath issued a statement accusing the BJP of luring its MLAs with “offers”.“The BJP is sensing a crushing defeat in the byelections. They are now resorting to horse trading (of MLAs). I have spoken with several MLAs of the Congress who informed me about the offers and allurements they were receiving from the BJP,” stated the former chief minister, who lost power in March this year after 22 MLAs of the Congress joined the BJP under former MP Jyotiraditya Scindia.In the 230-member Madhya Pradesh Assembly, the BJP currently has 107 members and required nine more MLAs to attain a simple majority, while the Congress’ tally stands at 87.Among other members, the BSP has two legislators, while the SP has one member besides four Independents.

07-11-2020||India||SIT advises action against IPS officer, 24 others for links with slain gangster Vikas Dubey||The Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted to probe various aspects of the Kanpur ambush by slain gangster Vikas Dubey recommended action against 25 police personnel of Kanpur and Lucknow, including a deputy inspector general (DIG) rank officer said a senior police official privy to the SIT report.The other offices against whom action has been recommended include an additional superintendent of police (ASP) and two deputy superintendents of police (DSPs).The SIT report pointed towards a nexus between Vikas Dubey and police as well as officials from other government departments, the official added. The SIT had submitted its findings to the state government on Wednesday.The official said the IPS officer allegedly had links with Dubey’s aides and facilitated their work during his posting in Kanpur around a year ago. The probe also showed that the officer was soft on taking action against Dubey and his aides even after getting several complaints and alerts from his subordinates.He said ASP had been posted in the rural area of Kanpur for a long time and was transferred from there only a week before Vikas Dubey and his aides killed eight police personnel, including deputy SP Devendra Mishra, in an ambush during a raid on his house at Bikru village in Kanpur district on the night of July 3. He said the ASP, too, allegedly had links with Dubey and his associates.The official said a deputy SP, who was posted in Kanpur as circle officer (Local Intelligence Unit) for a long time was also on the list of officers against whom action was recommended. Action against the DSP has been recommended for his failure to provide inputs about the fire power of Vikas Dubey’s gang, he added.He said action was also recommended against another DSP, who was posted as circle officer (CO) of the Sarojininagar area in Lucknow during 2017 and two inspectors who were posted at the Krishna Nagar police station at that time. He said the DSP and two inspectors were held responsible for negligence that led to the release of a .30 bore Springfield rifle that was later allegedly used by Dubey to open indiscriminate fire on the police team at Bikru.He said three police officers of Lucknow had reportedly not taken proper measures to keep the rifle seized or ensure cancellation of the licence after the weapon’s seizure from Dubey when he was arrested from his residence at Lucknow’s Krishna Nagar on October 30, 2017. He said the rifle was in the name of his brother Deepak Dubey and it was released from the local court in six months due to improper pursuance of the matter by the investigation officers as well as the supervising officer. He said the two former inspectors were investigation officers while the deputy SP was the supervising officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-advises-action-against-ips-officer-24-others-for-links-with-slain-gangster-vikas-dubey/story-2ZtUJZcG3wZ3HRHFDrSo7O.html
07-11-2020||India||Yashvardhan Kumar Sinha appointed new Chief Information Commissioner||Yashvardhan Kumar Sinha was appointed as the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) on Saturday, according to a Rashtrapati Bhavan statement. President Ram Nath Kovind administered the oath of office to Sinha as the Chief Information Commissioner in the Central Information Commission at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan, it said. The post of the chief of transparency watchdog was lying vacant for over two months after Bimal Julka completed his term on August 26. Sinha, a former diplomat, joined as the Information Commissioner on January 1, 2019. He has served as India’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka. Sinha, aged 62, will have a tenure of about three years as the CIC. A CIC and Information Commissioner are appointed for a tenure of five years or till they attain the age of 65 years. Later, Sinha administered the oath of office to journalist Uday Mahurkar, former Labour Secretary Heera Lal Samariya and former Deputy Comptroller and Auditor General Saroj Punhani as Information Commissioners. With the induction of Mahurkar, Samariya and Punhani, the strength of Information Commissioner has gone up to seven. Vanaja N Sarna, Neeraj Kumar Gupta, Suresh Chandra and Amita Pandove are the other Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission. Transparency watchdog Central Information Commission, mandated to decide complaints and appeals filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, can have a Chief Information Commissioner and ten Information Commissioners. There is still a vacancy of three Information Commissioners in the Commission. “Mahurkar, a veteran journalist, before joining as Information Commissioner in the Central Information Commission, was functioning as Senior Deputy Editor with a leading media house,” a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry said. He has graduated from Gujarat’s Maharaja Sayajirao University in Indian history, culture and archaeology. Samariya, a 1985-batch IAS officer of Telangana cadre, retired as Secretary, Ministry of Labour & Employment in September. “His area of expertise includes Administration and Governance,” it said. Punhani, an Indian Audit and Accounts Service (IAAS) officer of 1984 batch, served as the Deputy Comptroller & Auditor General (HR & Training) in government of India. “Her area of expertise includes Administration and Governance,” the statement added. All four -- CIC and three Information Commissioners -- were short-listed for the posts by a three-member committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in its meeting held late last month. Besides Modi, leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Home Minister Amit Shah are members of the panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yashvardhan-kumar-sinha-appointed-new-chief-information-commissioner/story-IKpsL1CZdVtLMYGAXmJgTM.html

07-11-2020||India||Bombay High Court reserves order on Arnab Goswami’s bail plea, no immediate relief||Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami, arrested in an abetment of suicide case on November 4, failed to get any immediate relief on Saturday as the Bombay High Court reserved its order on his interim bail plea.But the court said he can move the sessions court for regular bail in the meantime.Elsewhere, the Raigad sessions court said it will hear police’s appeal against a magistrate’s order denying them the custody of Goswami and two other accused on November 9.After hearing marathon arguments, a division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik said it would not be possible to pass the order on Saturday itself.Goswami’s lawyer Harish Salve sought his release as “ad-interim relief” but the HC expressed inability to do so.“We will pass the order at the earliest. The pendency of this matter does not preclude you (Goswami) or the other accused from approaching the concerned lower court seeking regular bail,” the court said.If a bail plea is filed, then the sessions court shall decide it within four days, it said.The high court was hearing petitions filed by Goswami, a high-profile TV journalist, and two other accused -- Feroze Shaikh and Nitish Sarda -- seeking interim bail and challenging their “illegal arrest”.The trio were arrested by Alibaug police in Maharashtra’s Raigad district on November 4 in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother in 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by the accused’s respective firms.The petitions also sought a stay to the investigation and quashing of the FIR.The court, which on Saturday only heard arguments on interim bail, said it would hear the petitioners on quashing of the FIR on December 10, after Diwali vacation.After his arrest from his Lower Parel residence here amid high drama on Wednesday, Goswami was taken to Alibaug, where the Chief Judicial Magistrate remanded him and two others in judicial custody till November 18.As the magistrate refused to remand them in police custody, the Alibaug police filed revision plea in the Raigad district court, which said earlier on Saturday that it will hear it on November 9.Goswami is presently lodged at a local school which has been designated as a COVID-19 centre for the Alibaug prison.The high court, hearing the arguments on Saturday, sought to know why the petitioners did not move the lower court first for bail. “The high court is already overburdened with regular bail appeals. We do not want to undermine the authority of the sessions court which is empowered to hear regular bail plea,” Justice Shinde said.In his bail plea, Goswami alleged that he and his family were assaulted by the police during the arrest, and he suffered a “six-inch deep gash on his left hand, a serious injury to his spinal cord”.But his lawyers did not raise these allegations during the arguments.Senior counsel Amit Desai, appearing for Maharashtra government, opposed bail, saying there was fresh material to reopen the case which had been closed earlier.The accused should have approached the sessions court first, and if they do so, the “police will not seek adjournments or prolong the hearing,” Desai said. Desai also argued that just because Alibaug police had filed an `A’ Summary report closing the case, it does not mean there can be no fresh probe. “`A’ summary does not mean the offence did not occur or that the case is false. It only means that the investigation could not be completed. This is a matter that is now again under investigation,” he said.He also contended that no permission was required to be taken from the magistrate to carry out further probe.“The state government ordered the (fresh) probe pursuant to which the police intimated the magistrate on October 15, 2020. The magistrate noted `Seen’ and kept the file on record.“After this, the statements of several witnesses including the victim’s family were recorded before the magistrate under section 164 of CrPC,” he said.Senior counsel Shirish Gupte, appearing for victim Anvay Naik’s wife Akshata Naik, also opposed the pleas, and said the magistrate had accepted the closure report in 2019 without giving the victim’s family an opportunity to object.Advocate Devadatt Kamat, appearing for Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, sought deletion of Singh’s name as respondent in Goswami’s plea, saying the case was filed by Alibaug police and he had nothing to do with it. The HC, meanwhile, also sought response from the state government on a petition filed by Anvay Naik’s daughter Adnya Naik seeking a fresh probe by an independent agency. It will be heard on December 8.Goswami’s lawyers, during the hearing earlier, had claimed that the allegations against him were baseless and Maharashtra government only wanted to harass him because of his outspokenness as a journalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-high-court-reserves-order-on-arnab-goswami-s-bail-plea-no-immediate-relief/story-M4ODWdO5JfC2GToC7yd0OP.html

07-11-2020||India||Centre says open for talks with farmers on farm laws ahead of another protest||Ahead of another farmer protest planned for month-end against the three farm laws, the Centre on Saturday asserted that these laws are in the interest of the farming community and it was still open to have dialogue with them and clear their doubts.       Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar as well as food minister Piyush Goyal said these laws are enacted by the central government in order to give more options to farmers to sell their produce at better rates, but states like Punjab are “misleading” them. Ever since the three laws were passed in Parliament in September, farmers have been protesting largely in the Congress-ruled states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Punjab which have brought their own farm laws to negate the central acts. Speaking to reporters, Tomar said: “If they (Opposition) wear farmers’ glasses and see the laws, they will be able to see the benefits for farmers. If they see from the political prism, they cannot see the benefits.”     He also reiterated that farmers will continue to get the minimum support price (MSP) for the notified crops and procurement centres will continue to function.       “Opposition is spreading misinformation and lies,” he alleged adding that the data on paddy procurement undertaken in Punjab so far in the ongoing kharif season itself shows the Centre’s commitment towards MSP buying.       About 169 lakh tonne of paddy has been procured in Punjab alone till November 6 of the 2020-21 kharif marketing season, as against 81 lakh tonne in the same period of 2013-14, he added.     Stating that such protests are confined to Punjab, Goyal said those will wither way. It was not successful in neighbouring Haryana.    “Procurement centres are fully operational even now. In fact, we have increased them substantially this year. So, there is no question of the Centre scrapping MSP procurement...,” he said, and urged the Opposition to stop misleading farmers.      He said the total paddy procurement across the country has risen sharply to 745 lakh tonne till November 6 of the 2020-21 kharif marketing season from 318 lakh tonne in the same period of 2013-14.     Goyal also mentioned that unless the protesting farmers do not clear the rail tracks in Punjab and the state government does not ensure law and order, the services cannot be resumed. Paddy procurement commenced from September 26 in Punjab and elsewhere from October 1. It may be noted that Bharti Kisan Union (Lakhowal) had organised road blockade on November 5, while another protest is being planned under the banner of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) in Delhi on November 26-27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-says-open-for-talks-with-farmers-on-farm-laws-ahead-of-another-protest/story-4k5nmKrMGkX5OOcs12ON3K.html
07-11-2020||India||Bihar exit poll: Times Now-CVoter says Tejashwi ahead of Nitish Kumar in race to power||The Times Now-C Voter exit poll has projected that the RJD-led Grand Alliance could be within striking distance of pipping the Nitish Kumar-led NDA to the winning post by a narrow margin. The exit poll doesn’t give the Tejashwi Yadav-led alliance a clear majority in the 243-member house, but if its projection of 120 seats for the GA against NDA’s 116 seats comes true, it would only need to win the support of two MLAs from outside the alliance to reach the half-way mark of 122 seats.The projections, if they match the poll outcome on November 10 when the votes are counted, would be a big setback for the Nitish Kumar-led ruling combine which had hoped to sail through the elections faced by a relatively inexperienced opposition leadership.The exit poll trends have been released on the last day of the three-phased assembly elections in Bihar.Exit polls have often proved to be way off the mark in the past including in the 2015 Bihar assembly elections when only one pollster got the outcome right. Exit polls are conducted by interviewing the voters after they have cast their votes and are limited by a narrow sample size and unreliability of responses received. The opposition alliance is led by the RJD, which is contesting on 144 seats; followed by the Congress on 70 seats and CPI(ML) on 19. In the NDA camp, the JD(U) is contesting on 115 seats and BJP on 110. The polling came to an end on Saturday evening with over 55% votes polled for the 78 seats of the 243 member assembly that voted in the third phase.In the first and the second phase on October 28 and November 3 respectively, 71 and 94 constituencies had gone to polls. On Saturday, people in the remaining 78 constituencies voted.JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar, who has already spent over 14 years as chief minister, was seeking another shot at the state’s chief minister. This is said to be one of his toughest electoral challenges given the relentless attacks not only from the opposition but also erstwhile ally and former NDA constituent, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP).He had rejected suggestions that he faced an anti-incumbency factor and addressed over 110 election meetings. At his last rally in Purnea, he had announced that this would be his last election. As the opposition latched on to this statement, claiming that Nitish Kumar had run out of steam, the JD (U) rushed to clarify that he did not mean that he would exit politics but that he was addressing his last election meeting for the 2020 Bihar elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-exit-poll-times-now-cvoter-says-tejashwi-ahead-of-nitish-kumar-in-race-to-power/story-aJC7bfk56hM61yuY66eiUL.html
07-11-2020||India||ISRO gearing up for launch of small satellite launch vehicles: K Sivan||Indian Space Research Organisation is gearing up for a series of missions, including launch of small satellite launch vehicles, chairman K Sivan said on Saturday. He made the comments after the successful launch of earth observation satellite - EOS-01- and nine customer satellites onboard its Polar rocket, PSLV-C49, from this spaceport, about 110 km from Chennai. Addressing the scientists at the Mission Control Centre, he said “..we have started this mission (PSLV-C49/EOS-01) after COVID pandemic.Now we have a series of missions on our hands.Immediately we are going to have the PSLV-C50. It is going to launch satellite CMS01 then we will be having the new vehicle SSLV, the first development flight.” According to ISRO, those satellites which weigh less and come with limited launch options, can be sent on Small Satellite Launch Vehicles (SSLVs). The earth observation satellite sent on PSLV-C49 was weighing around 630 kg. Currently, small satellites are sent along with other big satellites which are launched using ISRO’s trusted workhorse polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLVs) or Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle (GSLV). Sivan said ISRO was also planning to launch Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle GSLV-F10 carrying earth observation satellite -- EOS-03. “I am sure team ISRO will always rise to the occasion and meet the requirements as per the demand put on them,” he said. Meanwhile, in a press release, ISRO said following the successful launch of the PSLV-C49/EOS-01 on Saturday, the ISRO Telemetry Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru assumed control of the earth observation satellite which is the primary satellite. “In the coming days, the satellite will be brought to its final operational configuration,” the release said. EOS-01, an earth observation satellite, is intended for applications in agriculture, forestry and disaster management support. The nine customer satellites are from Lithuania, Luxembourg and USA were launched under a commercial agreement with NewSpace India Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-gearing-up-for-launch-of-small-satellite-launch-vehicles-k-sivan/story-0MsZhmGsIlx0984Y1GNR6I.html
07-11-2020||India||‘When you act you have to detach yourself from being a trainer’||Best remembered for his role of Suleiman Isa in ‘Sacred Games’ and Kakaji in ‘Manmarziyaan,’ celebrity acting coach Saurabh Sachdev feels teaching someone how to act and acting yourself are two very different streams. “It’s a different ball game to teach and act yourself. When you act you have to detach yourself from being a trainer. When I enact scenes with my students it actually becomes challenging as an actor to not to think as a coach and hold back from finding flaws in my protégé’s act,” said Saurabh who has been busy with his global online classes during the pandemic. Known to have trained the likes of Varun Dhawan, Arjun Kapoor, Richa Chadha, Freida Pinto to name a few, Saurabh says it has been a tough phase for all institutes and training centres. “Like others my training institute ‘The Actors Truth’ too is closed since March and I have been taking online classes. Though teaching online did bring in many more students from far and wide but at the same time it became very challenging to train in such a manner. Acting is such a profession which is not viable without human connect in real time so it does get complicated to teach virtually.” Suarabh is all happy as his recently released series and film has earned him praises around. Talking more about his OTT series-cum-film, he said, “When Bejoy Nambiar offered me this character in ‘Taish,’ I was totally thrilled as it had many interesting layers and a superb story. I remember how he gave me a full-hand in carving my character and the same time suggested not to go overboard. The way the series has shaped up it has been a very contented project. Next in line is another web series ‘Raat Baaki Hai,’ with an interesting cast.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/when-you-act-you-have-to-detach-yourself-from-being-a-trainer/story-yb6HN8bgiEseVSMK6lXLIP.html

She lately did a series ‘Ratri Ke Yatri’ with Iqbal Khan and is currently shooting for Sharon Anish Khan’s show ‘The Prayag Raj’ in Lucknow. “I’m making a steady shift from one medium to another as I have realised that web has a broader reach, more audience and I can well relate to its way of storytelling as an actor. I find it more natural and subtle. Now, the scenario has changed and a lot of actors are doing digital shows,” said the ‘Ishqbaaz’ actor. The actor candidly admits that she does not relate to all the roles on TV. “I did a few shows and I very well understand that in television we need ‘extra’ drama.” She started her journey with ‘Suvreen Guggal: Topper of the year.’ “Next I did a web show ‘By The Way’ (BTW) that had mini episodes but at that time digital was not so big. So I came back to TV as it was better doing something than just waiting for films. I tried and selecting good roles. Beyond that, it was not in my hand! Probably, that is why I’m satisfied with my TV career.” Mansi played lead in ‘Do Dil Bandhe ek Dori se’, did ‘Sasural Simar Ka’, a cop in ‘Ishqbaaz’, comedy in ‘Peterson Hill’, negative-supernatural in ‘Divya Drishti’ while her last show was ‘Vidya.’ Talking more about her current project, she said, “In this series, I am playing Riya Bajpai, a college student. She is the most descent character in the show without any ‘maar-dhar’ and abuses. It has a good growth graph during the course of the show. We have shot in three colleges in Lucknow.” Shooting in Covid conditions she feels a bit scared. “I keep taking steam inhalation on the set and also taking all precautions. In college scenes, we have 100s of junior artistes plus the vast crew so it’s a bit daunting.During unlock phase my father was tested Covid positive and recovered, so I know that how dangerous it is. I hope others understand,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/stories-on-ott-ar-more-relatable-says-mansi/story-wuE1qr0dM8XFdNgFEKLZOP.html

He was the chairman of Fashion Gold, a chain of jewellery shops started with the help of local funding. The jewellery chain closed four months back after accumulated loss leaving many investors in the lurch. More than 110 cases were filed against the promoters and investors blamed the mismanagement and misappropriation of funds for the loss. According to the police, investors have lost between Rs 30 to Rs 50 crore. When the case cropped up two months back, the Muslim League had asked the legislator to take up immediate steps to repay money to investors but he sought more time. The party is likely to action against him. Many opposition leaders said the arrest was a politically motivated to distract attention from the issues the government was facing. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s principal secretary M Sivasankar was arrested in connection with gold smuggling case and the CPI(M) state secretary’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri was detained in Bengaluru last week in a money laundering case related to a drug bust. Opposition leaders said Kamaruddin was arrested when he was trying to settle the issue. The Muslim League was in the forefront of attack against the CM and his cabinet colleague K T Jaleel in the gold smuggling case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-league-mla-arrested-in-alleged-gold-jewellery-cheating-case-in-kerala/story-AsUQFAsY8wvw3kqbcCJ3qJ.html

He alleged that he and his mother had to take the extreme step because they were under pressure due to the failure of the owners of three companies to clear payments (worth Rs5.40 crore) due to them. Feroz Shaikh of IcastX/Skimedia and Nitish Sarda of Smartworks were the other two people named in the suicide note. Anvay’s wife Akshata lodged a complaint with the Alibag police against Goswami, Shaikh and Sarda for allegedly abetting their suicide on the basis of the note.The police on April 26, 2019, closed the case saying they could not gather evidence against the three accused named in the complaint. On May 5, Akshata released a video seeking justice for her husband following which Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh ordered a reinvestigation into the case.A local court on October 16 allowed the Alibag police to reopen the case for further investigation and Arnab Goswami moved the Bombay high court seeking to quash the fresh case two days before he was arrested by Mumbai police on November 4.The hearing on his interim bail plea before the Bombay high court remained incomplete on Friday and the division bench of Justice SS Shinde and Justice MS Karnik is likely to decide on his bail plea Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/notice-to-maharashtra-govt-on-plea-against-cops-who-closed-2018-case-against-arnab-goswami/story-yR5QSg0GwrWpIHphs5PayI.html
07-11-2020||India||Screening of 200 people finds 4.5% are carriers of cystic fibrosis gene: Study||Genetic screening of 200 unrelated persons has found that 4.5% of them were carriers of cystic fibrosis gene, according to a study recently published in the journal BMC Medical Genetics. A carrier is a person that has the gene that causes the disease, but not the disease. If both carrier parents pass on the gene to their child, the child will then have the disease.Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening condition that causes the body’s mucus, sweat, and digestive juices to become thick and sticky, clogging up the tubes and ducts. There is no cure for the disease, but medication helps in easing the symptoms and prolonging life.A carrier frequency of 9 in 200 persons, as was found in the pilot study by doctors from Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, will mean a disease prevalence of 1 in 2,000 persons. This is much higher than the earlier estimated prevalence as the disease was considered to be rare in the Indian population.“Based on this study, cystic fibrosis should be added to beta-thalassemia and spinal muscular disorders that should be screened in all pregnant women to prevent these diseases. It should also be added to the list of disorders for which new-born screening is being done. Sir Ganga Ram Hospital is planning to add CF to the existing new-born screening programme,” said Dr I C Verma, senior consultant, Institute of Medical Genetics and Genomics at the hospital.The study found that 26% of the persons screened were carriers of one or more genetic disorders. The analysis of the genetic sequencing of the individuals was done between October 2016 and June 2018 in partnership with Medgenome Laboratories in Bengaluru.The carrier frequency was highest for congenital deafness as 12 persons were found to be carriers of one of the four genes the doctors tested for. With three persons carrying the gene for Pompe Disease – a condition that leads to an abnormal build-up of glycogen (sugar molecule) inside cells impairing the work of organs tissues – was the third common genetic disorder.None of the 88 partners screened were carriers of the same disorder, the study found.“Our study also found that the disease-causing pathogenic variants in the Indian population were different from those commonly observed in the West. It is because of our unique system of marriages within the same caste/community and presence of consanguineous marriages,” said Dr Sunita Bijarnia-Mahay, one of the authors and a senior consultant at the Institute of Medical Genetics and Genomics.Dr Ratna Puri, the chairperson of the Institute of Medical Genetics and Genomics, said: “This is a new finding and the high carrier frequency of Cystic Fibrosis shall be verified in a larger population sample soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/screening-of-200-people-finds-4-5-are-carriers-of-cystic-fibrosis-gene-study/story-ISKLcVcBgGFCiZZoivk6rK.html

It was to take place at 3:02pm but was delayed by 10 minutes due to bad weather conditions.Also Read | ISRO launches PSLV C-49 carrying EOS-01, 9 other satellitesHere’s all you need to know about Isro’s latest space mission:1. The EOS-01, as per Isro’s official website, is an earth observation satellite intended for purposes such as agriculture, forestry and disaster management support.2. The satellite was launched onboard Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)-C49. Saturday’s launch represents the 51st mission of the PSLV. This is also the 76th mission launch from SDSC.3. A total of 10 satellites, including EOS-01, have been launched in this mission. While EOS-01 is the only Indian and primary satellite of the mission, the other nine are foreign: Four each from the US and Luxembourg and one from Lithuania.4. The nine foreign satellites, called the ‘customer’ satellites, have been launched under a commercial agreement with the NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), which is the commercial arm of Isro and comes under the Department of Space.5. This is Isro’s first launch in almost a year, as well as the first of any kind since the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown came into effect in March. On December 11, 2019, the space agency had launched RISAT2-BR1, which is an earth observation satellite similar to EOS-01.6. Then, on January 17, 2020, GSAT-30, a telecommunication satellite was sent into space. This launch, however, took place from a base in French Guiana.7. In view of the ongoing pandemic, Isro had put in strict norms during the launch.

They were acquitted as per law, but the BJP did not say then that the actions (cases) were politically motivated or part of vendetta,” the editorial said.The Sena further alleged that the BJP was maligning the image of the family members of Anvay Naik, the interior designer who had committed suicide in 2018 allegedly over non-payment of dues by Republic TV.Referring to posters showing Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhhav Thackeray with Indira Gandhi, who had imposed Emergency in 1975, the Sena said the comparison with the late prime minister was a matter of pride.“The BJP has gone out of its mind by putting up posters of Uddhav Thackeray and Indira Gandhi reminding people of Emergency, in Delhi. This is not only childishness but also ignorance. Comparison with Indira Gandhi is a matter of pride.Also Read| ‘Forced to consume liquid’: Arnab Goswami in bail plea in 2018 caseThe iron lady had avenged partition of our country by breaking Pakistan in 1971,” the editorial said.The Congress is one of the constituents of the Sena- led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, apart from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The Sena also took a swipe at the BJP for announcing wearing of black badges by its leaders until Goswami is released.“Thankfully, they haven’t resorted to jail bharo and fasting as part of protests,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-like-trump-shiv-sena-s-latest-jibe-at-bjp-over-arnab-goswami-s-arrest/story-o2Swpe4SDQDgaSIjLjzKGM.html

Baduria MLA Qazi Abdur Rahim joined the ruling party in West Bengal at its headquarters in the presence of senior ministers Firhad Hakim and Partha Chatterjee.“I have realised that Didi (Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee) is the only hope in the fight against the BJP. So, I am joining the TMC to strengthen her hand,” Rahim said. Senior Congress leader Manoj Chakraborty said the induction of opposition Congress and CPI(M) MLAs into the TMC reflects the ruling party’s intention to “weaken secular forces” in the state.The Congress had won 44 seats in the 2016 assembly elections but 18 of its MLAs have switched over to the ruling TMC since then. However, barring former Sabang legislator Manas Bhunia, who later became a Rajya Sabha MP, none of the Congress turncoats have resigned from their MLA posts.Besides Rahim, former BJP Mahila Morcha vice president Moumita Basu Chakraborty and some retired bureaucrats also joined the TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-congress-mla-qazi-abdur-rahim-joins-tmc/story-ixQ9TMfgtU8oK9GCNRgzdP.html

07-11-2020||India||Estimated GST shortfall could shrink after green shoots on revenue front||The Rs 2.35 lakh crore estimated shortfall in Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections this financial year is expected to shrink significantly with the revenue mop-up seeing positive growth since September this year and the growth momentum is expected to continue in the remaining five months, two officials said.Besides positive GST collections since September, numbers of states having negative year-on-year revenue growth have also reduced from 15 in September to seven in October, Union finance ministry officials said requesting anonymity.A comparison of revenue data between September and October this year shows that numbers of territories having negative growth on annualised basis in October have reduced by over 50%.“The trend, if sustained in the next five months, would reduce the gap between the protected revenue and actual revenue for FY-21 by about Rs 35,000 crore,” one of the officials said.Overall GST collections that saw first positive annualised growth of 4% in September, after having plunged by 72% in March, posted over 10% YOY growth at Rs 1.05 lakh crore in October.According to official data, 15 territories that posted negative growth in September compared to the same month last year were Chandigarh (-10% drop in GST revenue), Delhi (-7%), Sikkim (-49%), Arunachal Pradesh (-20%), Manipur (-19%), Mizoram (-42%), Tripura (-3%), Meghalaya (-6%), Daman and Diu (-83%), Karnataka (-5%), Goa (-23%), Lakshadweep (-58%), Puducherry (-1%), Telangana (-2%) and other territory (-16%). Apart from that the annualised growth in revenue collections in three states – Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Ladakh (because the union territory was created this financial year) – in September this year was stagnant.In contract, the year-on-year revenue collections contracted only in seven territories in October this year – Chandigarh (-3%), Delhi (-8%), Sikkim (-5%), Daman and Diu (-91%), Lakshadweep (-55%), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (-42%) and other territory (-28%).“It is expected that the collections in November onwards would be even better, which would not only reduce the estimated shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore [in 2020-21] but also see improved collections of compensation cess, therefore, proportionately reduce the borrowing liabilities,” the second official said.At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime, the GST law assured state governments a 14% increase in their annual tax revenue for five years ending June 30, 2022, and the Centre committed to meet any shortfall in revenue through the cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal, and other tobacco commodities.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent 68-day hard lockdown since March 25, the GST collections fell sharply in April and remained in negative territory until August this year. On August 27, the Centre had given states the choice of borrowing Rs 97,000 crore (the shortfall resulting from GST implementation issues) without having to pay principal or interest, or the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore revenue deficit from the indirect tax (including that arising from the Covid-19 pandemic) projected for this fiscal year. The Rs. 97,000 crore was subsequently raised to Rs.1.1 lakh crore on October 5. Seven states are still opposing the Centre’s proposal and demand full compensation of Rs 2.35 lakh crore under the first option.MS Mani, a partner at consulting firm Deloitte India, said, “With the increase in GST collections for the past two months and an expectation of robust collections in the next few months, the collections deficit is expected to be lower - both in respect of GST and in respect of Compensation Cess. This could potentially reduce the borrowing plans of the states... The easing of revenue pressures may also enable a renewed focus on the policy agenda by the GST Council.”Archit Gupta, founder and chief executive officer of the financial technology platform ClearTax, said, “Judging from the overall growth rate of the past three months, it looks like the economy is on the road to recovery, and one can expect to see a marginal increase month-on-month over the next few months of the financial year.It is plausible that the government may revise the Rs. 2.35 lakh crore shortfall in the coming months, based on the actual figures of the GST collections,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/estimated-gst-shortfall-could-shrink-after-green-shoots-on-revenue-front/story-M6Pc4b5cIdWFSPvzNJ1m1J.html
07-11-2020||India||Tribal burnt alive for not returning Rs 5,000 taken during lockdown: Police||A 32-year-old tribal man was allegedly burnt alive for not returning Rs 5,000, which he borrowed from an accused during lockdown in Guna district, 214 km north of Bhopal, on Friday late night, said police. The victim, Vijay Sahariya, a resident of Ukawad Khurd village of the district, was rushed to a district hospital where he died while undergoing treatment. Police arrested the accused Radheshyam Lodha, a resident of Ukawad Khurd village, under section 302 (murder) of the IPC and under relevant sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act on Friday late night, said Rajesh Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (SP), Guna. The SP said, “The farm labourer Vijay Sahariya had borrowed Rs 5,000 from a farmer Radheshyam Lodha, who used to give money to people on interest, in May this year as the former was facing a tough time due to lockdown. Sahariya started working at Lodha’s agricultural land and when he asked for his payment Lodha refused to give and demanded his money back. Sahariya was requesting him to give his payment after deducting Rs 5,000 but Lodha was unmoved.” “On Friday night, they again had a discussion over this matter and after a heated argument, Lodha beat Sahariya up. Lodha brought a can of kerosene oil from his house and poured the oil on Sahariya’s body. Lodha set Sahariya on fire. When Sahariya cried for help, the villagers rushed to the spot and tried to douse the fire,” said the officer. He was rushed to the district hospital where he died while undergoing treatment, he added. In his statement to the police at the hospital, Sahariya accused Lodha. When police arrested Lodha, he confessed his crime, said TS Baghel, additional superintendent of police, Guna. Guna collector Kumar Purshottam provided a financial aid of Rs 20,000 to perform last rites to the family. “The victim’s family will also be provided a financial aid of Rs 8.50 lakh under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, said the collector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribal-burnt-alive-for-not-returning-rs-5-000-taken-during-lockdown-police/story-YSNcsqkhxCOzPXuWdpaSCP.html

07-11-2020||India||‘Unacceptable’: Tamil Nadu Congress slams parties demanding release of Rajiv Gandhi assassination convicts||Opposing the release of seven Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convicts, Congress in Tamil Nadu said on Saturday that political parties making this demand was unacceptable.Against the backdrop of parties, including its key ally in Tamil Nadu the DMK pressing for release of the convicts, including A G Perarivalan, whose plea for pardon is pending with the Governor, TNCC chief K S Alagiri said only the judiciary should decide on remission of their sentences.If the Rajiv case case convicts were to be set free, a demand would arise for the release of all “murder convicts” who have spent over 25 years in prison, he said.“If the court announces the release of seven Rajiv case convicts, we will accept it.However, political parties rooting for their release is unacceptable,” Tamil Nadu Congress Committee chief Alagiri said in a statement.“It is not Tamil culture to lend support for convicts who assassinated a former Prime Minister and brought harm to India.” Propping up a movement for the release of murder convicts meant that there was no need for police stations, courts and also necessity to talk about law and order maintenance, he said.Those convicted for murder should be considered only as convicts and addressing such persons as “Tamils” is inappropriate, he said.“Release seven Tamils” is a phrase usually used by several pro-Tamil, Dravidian groups and parties to strengthen their demand for remission to Rajiv case convicts and its use is perceived to have undertones to the decades old conflict in Sri Lanka.It is a thing of pride to address leaders like Abdul Kalam, Kamarajar, Perarignar Anna, Kalaignar Karunanidhi, Jeevanandam and math genius Ramanujam as Tamils, and not the convicts, the TNCC leader said.P Jeevanandam (1907-63), popularly known as ‘Thozhar’ (comrade) Jeeva was a pioneer of the Left movement in Tamil Nadu.The over a decade old demand for the release of all seven Rajiv case convicts recently gained momentum with the DMK demanding Governor Banwarilal Purohit accept the 2018 Tamil Nadu government’s recommendation, remit their life sentences and set them free.Most parties in Tamil Nadu, including the ruling AIADMK support the release of the convicts.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court had expressed unhappiness over the pendency of Perarivalan’s plea (seeking pardon in the Rajiv case) for over two years with Governor Banwarilal Purohit.Nalini, V Sriharan alias Murugan, Santhan, A G Perarivalan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and P Ravichandran are the seven convicts in prison for nearly three decades.Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated on May 21, 1991 at Sriperumbudur near here by a woman suicide bomber, Dhanu, at an election rally.

07-11-2020||India||Alcohol, superstition take a toll on tribals in Odisha villages||Two months ago, Muka Talam, a tribal in Odisha’s Benchnpalli village, complained of swelling of hands and belly. He died a few days later unable to eat anything. Like him, Bata Ganga and Jogendra Bata of the same village, too, showed similar symptoms before they died. After them, Ganga Bata and Beti Lachha, all in the age group of 35-50 died, while about 8-10 other villagers showed symptoms of swollen feet and stomach, loss of appetite, and acute weakness.As locals complained of a mysterious disease killing the villagers, health officials from the district headquarters of Malkangiri, who visited Benchanpalli to probe the deaths, on Friday said there was no mystery. “It is mostly... alcoholism leading to kidney and liver problems. In two cases of deaths, the deceased had cancer and stroke,” said Dr PK Nanda, chief district medical officer, Malkangiri.Nanda said the deaths happened because villagers consulted a Dishari, or a local witchdoctor, first and then went to the local primary health centre. “Most of them consume local brew laced with urea for a better kick. Over a period, this proves lethal for them,” he said. “We have sent the sample of the alcohol that the villagers consumed to the State Forensic Science Laboratory in Bhubaneswar to ascertain the composition. We are waiting for the report.”Two months ago, around 10 Koya tribals died after showing similar symptoms in Sodiguda village. Between February and June, about a dozen deaths were reported from Kenduguda village under Malkangiri block. Many of those who died complained of swollen legs and stomach. Villagers said that most of those who died did not even have the strength to walk or stand properly and suffered acute respiratory problems.Doctors in Malkangiri said the deaths in Sodiguda and Bapanpalli were mostly due to alcoholism and the unwillingness of the tribals to go to local health centres fearing Covid-19. “As it is most of the villages are situated at least 10 km away from the nearest health centres and travelling is not easy. Now because of Covid, many tribals are avoiding going there,” said a doctor.Experts said apart from alcoholism, anaemia is also a reason for the deaths. As per the 2015-16 National Family Health Survey, at least 47.2% of men in the age group of 15 and 49 years in Malkangiri were anaemic. For women in the same age group, the percentage was 71.3.“With such a high anaemic population, do you expect the villagers to have any immunity. The deaths have happened in the tribal villages where malnutrition and undernourishment are acute,” said Durga Tripathy of Harmony, a Malkangiri based NGO.Officials called vacancies of doctors in primary and community health centres a major stumbling block in providing health services. Of the 197 posts of doctors, only 91 have been filled up so far. The entire district has only one eye specialist while there are just five gynaecologists.“We would also start a drive to make the tribals aware of the ill-effects of using adulterants in the country liquor,” said Malkangiri district collector Manish Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alcohol-superstition-take-a-toll-on-tribals-in-odisha-villages/story-eHDbHLLa9iNdCMlooJjQkJ.html
07-11-2020||India||US poll fever grips India; internet search, interest soar||Polls are underway in India’s fourth-largest electoral state, Bihar, but Indians seem to be more interested in the US presidential elections. The largest democracy’s deep interest in that of the oldest one, the US, is reflected in Google Trends. It is in sync with the global focus on the presidential election given the American influence over world affairs. As counting started in the US on November 3 ET (early morning of November 4 in India), Google Trends showed “US Election Results” topped the search charts with more than 5 million hits. It overtook “Arnab Goswami” on the day police arrested India’s most talked-about TV personality after reopening an abetment of suicide case against him. Goswami’s arrest hit the headlines and generated over 3 million search hits on the internet. Throughout November 4, “US Election” and “American Election 2020 result” accounted for over a million searches individually on the internet. They secured the third and fourth spots among the chartthrobs in India. The US, home to 3.8 million Indian Americans, has come a long way from the Cold War era to become one of India’s strongest allies, especially over the past two decades. In a WhatsApp group of a Ghaziabad housing society, residents took a break from the usual chatter over pollution, and Diwali advisories to discuss the Donald Trump versus Joe Biden battle. As the complex counting process has continued, the hype, too, has subsided considerably. But still more people continue to search for US polls than for Bihar. Internet search related to Joe Biden, now on the verge of becoming the next US president, increased from 7.30 am on November 4 to peak the next day. The data shows that as results started trickling in on November 5 morning, among every 100 searches in India on Google, 34 were about Biden and 14 about Bihar. But as the exhaustive counting dragged on, Bihar got 16 searches against every 21 hits for the US election. Analysts believe, search for Biden, Trump, and US polls will again soar once the results are finally declared and Americans get their 46th president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-onto-internet-to-check-us-poll-results-as-interest-soars/story-4gjCUVlbF3rcbF8aibJoPO.html

07-11-2020||India||Train services between Bihar-Jharkhand to resume from November 11||Passenger train services between Bihar and Jharkhand are set to resume from November 11, after the break of four months since it was discontinued to check the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).To start with, the east central railway (ECR) zone has decided to run six pairs of Puja special trains on timing and schedules of the most popular trains to connect various different cities of Jharkhand like Ranchi, Dhanbad, Barkakana, Tata Nagar, Garhwa on their routes. Two pairs of trains will go to Bilaspur and Durg in Chhattisgarh and Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh.ECR chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar said that the festival special trains would continue to run till December 2 to cater to rush during Diwali and Chhath, after the railway board gave its consent to operate them in adherence to the stipulated Covid protocols.While the railways resumed the passenger trains services on different routes across the country in a calibrated manner from May 25 after the waiver in lockdown norms, which was enforced on March 24 to contain spread of Covid-19, special trains to cities like Ranchi, Dhanbad, Tata Nagar and Bokaro were suspended again since July 11, leaving the people to fend for themselves.Bus service on the Patna-Ranchi route was resumed in early September, but the cost of travel has jumped almost four times the normal fare in the absence of alternatives. “Passengers are being made to pay Rs 900-1200 for a seat to travel to Ranchi from Patna and vice versa against usual fare of Rs 300-400,” said Md Khalid, a resident of Ranchi’s Hindpirhi area.Bus operators have their own plea to justify the hefty rise in fare, saying that they had to procure permissions to run the busses stealthily in Jharkhand, which had banned the bus operations from Bihar. “One of the luxury buses has been caught by the Ranchi police on charges of violation of the government orders,” said the manager of Royal Arzoo bus. Direct flight services between Patna and Ranchi are still in suspension. Those aspiring to travel to Ranchi from Patna and vice versa are compelled to take connecting flights via Delhi or Kolkata, and thus making it a costly affair. “These days it costs around Rs 9000-10000 for one way journey from Patna to Ranchi against the normal airfare of Rs 3,500 to 4,500,” said Munna Jha, a frequent flier.With limited facilities for public transport, private cabs have also increased their tariff between Patna and Ranchi. “I had to pay Rs 9,500 as rent for a cab travel from Ranchi to Patna last week due to an emergency. Earlier, it used to cost around Rs 6000-7000 for a one-way journey,” said Mahendra Sahni, a grocery shop owner of Kankerbagh.The railways announcement to run special trains came as a sigh of relief to those aspiring to travel to Jharkhand cities from Bihar or wanted to return. The nine pairs of trains will run as per the schedules of Patna-Ranchi Jan Shatabdi, Patna-Dhanbad Ganga Damodar express, Patna-Barkakand Palamu express, Singrauli-Patna express, Rajendra Nagar-Durg Express via Tata Nagar and Jainagar Manihari express.The ECR is also contemplating running special trains in places of Hatia-Patna-Islampur express and Hatia-Purnia Court Kosi Express soon. The CPRO said that train service between Bihar and Jharkhand destinations was suspended on the Jharkhand government’s request to counter the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/train-services-between-bihar-jharkhand-to-resume-from-november-11/story-k8z0vQ8MV2B08Unc0fJZaP.html

Covid-19 has changed the way things are being conducted today. Virtual reality and augmented reality are becoming the working reality now...it has taught us while globalisation is important, self-reliance is equally important. The country is now committed to giving you the ease of doing business so that you can work on providing ease of living to your countrymen through your ideas and innovations,” he said in his address as the chief guest at IIT Delhi’s 51 convocation ceremony via video conferencing.Modi urged the students to work for finding solutions to the country’s existing problems. “Indians have immense faith in the need for technology… There are immense possibilities for you in the country and also there are immense challenges confronting the country for which you can give solutions. A lot of work can be done in areas such as disaster management, maintaining the ground-water level, solar power generation, telemedicine, and big data analysis. I can place before you several other examples of the country’s needs,” he said. Modi added the challenges can be addressed with innovations, new ideas, and efforts...”That is why it is my request to identify the needs of the country and associate yourself with Atmanirbhar Bharat.”Modi asked the students to try to turn the adversity into opportunity amid the pandemic. “You may be feeling your batch is not lucky. I am sure you are asking why did this happen with our graduating batch. But think of it differently. You have a first-mover advantage. You have more time to learn and adapt to the new norms emerging in the workplace and beyond. So, make the most use of it and think of the brighter side too.”Modi asked the students to continue challenging themselves. “It is important that one keeps challenging oneself and continues to learn every day. It is also important that you treat yourself as a student for life. Never think that what you know is enough.”Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, who was the guest of honour at the event, congratulated IIT Delhi for completing 60 years. He lauded the institute for its achievements including developing a low-cost Covid-19 testing kit. He asked the graduating students to contribute to the country’s development.Nishank also launched an online certificate programme called eVIDYA under which the institute will offer online certificate courses in areas like cyber-physical system, security, renewable energy storage, and conversion, embedded systems, machine learning, and construction project management, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tech-innovation-will-be-key-in-post-covid-world-modi-at-iit-delhi-event/story-WndBkJRD5qYslVx6tXBLHL.html
07-11-2020||India||India’s candidate elected to key UN committee in closely contested race||India’s candidate has been elected in a closely contested race to a key UN committee that controls the financial and budgetary purse of the world body. Vidisha Maitra, a career diplomat currently posted as first secretary in the permanent mission of India to the UN in New York, was elected to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) by 126 votes to 64 votes. Maitra was India’s candidate for the only post in the committee from the Asia Pacific Group, and the other candidate was from Iraq. India has served as a member of the committee since its inception in 1946. A place on the committee is seen as one of the most coveted positions in the United Nations system. New Delhi’s win in this election is also crucial as India is set to start a two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council next year. ACABQ performs several key functions, including the examination of the budget submitted by the UN Secretary General to the General Assembly, and advising the General Assembly on administrative and budgetary matters. The committee also plays a crucial role in ensuring that resources of member states are used effectively and that the UN’s mandates are properly funded. Members of ACABQ are elected by the 193 member states in the General Assembly on the basis of broad geographical representation, personal qualifications and experience, and they serve for a period of three years. ACABQ’s members also serve in a personal capacity and not as representatives of member states. Before being posted to New York, Maitra served in different capacities in the external affairs ministry in New Delhi, and in India’s missions in Paris, Port Louis and New York over the past 11 years. She has extensive experience in strategic policy planning and research, defence acquisition matters, formulation and implementation of development assistance and infrastructure projects, international taxation issues, and investment and trade promotion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-candidate-elected-to-key-un-committee-in-closely-contested-race/story-wgzzzgw7INDiYriUtkkaFM.html

Phuldungsei village, located at Kanchanpur sub division of North district of Tripura, has been accepted as part of Tripura state though its eastern side falls in Mizoram.Mizoram’s Mamit district magistrate Lalrozama stated that a Tripura-based organisation SONGRONGMA planned to construct a Shiv temple at Thaidawr Ylang in the district without seeking permission from the state government.In October, the Mizoram government imposed prohibitory orders in and around the village in Mamit district. The order was withdrawn after the Tripura government termed the move “highly objectionable”.“The borders can be identified through maps. If Mizoram has any kind of objection and feels the need of demarcation of border, they can take up the matter with the Centre. Though we are separate states, we are part of India. It doesn’t look good if two states fight with each other,” Deb told the mediapersons at the Civil Secretariat on the sidelines of a programme on Friday evening.He also said that Tripura provided permanent settlement to over 32,000 Bru migrants despite having the second largest population after Assam in the northeast, as per quadripartite pact of the MHA with the state governments of Tripura and Mizoram and leaders of Bru community in January.In reference to Jammu and Kashmir, Deb said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah resolved the prolonged restriction imposed in Jammu and Kashmir due to Article 370 and Article 35 (A). “ This is our country. We can go any place and anyone can visit here,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/borders-can-be-identified-using-maps-tripura-cm-to-mizoram-amid-standoff/story-enS4lTL4LRJ6wZbuGUItcN.html
07-11-2020||India||Recovery in domestic air passenger traffic continues in October: Report||Domestic air travel demand continued on an upward trajectory month-on-month, with the October volume witnessing a 33 per cent growth to 52 lakh passengers over September, ICRA said. On a year-on-year basis, however, the domestic travel demand declined 58 per cent and internationally the fall was 87 per cent, it said. The Indian aviation industry has witnessed continued recovery in domestic passenger traffic in October with a sequential growth (over September) of around 33 per cent to around 52 lakh passengers, ICRA said in a release on Friday. ICRA further noted that the capacity deployment in October 2020 at around 52 per cent over the same month last year, is a significant increase over the around 33 per cent capacity deployed in August and around 46 per cent capacity in September this year. The civil aviation ministry in June had permitted increasing the capacity to 45 per cent with effect from June 27 from a maximum of one-third at the time of resumption of domestic flights from May 25, which was further scaled up to 60 per cent from September 2. The capacity is expected to go up to 70-75 per cent in the coming days in view of the festive season, the government had said. According to ICRA, the cumulative domestic passenger volumes since the resumption of domestic flight services in a graded manner from May 25, till October 31, was around 16 million. “The number of flights departing has also gradually increased from 416 on Day 1 to 1,749 on Day 156 (October 26, 2020). For October, the average daily departures were around 1,574, significantly lower than the average daily departures of 3,031 in October 2019, though better than around 1,311 in September 2020,” said Kinjal Shah, Vice President, ICRA. Also, the average number of passengers per flight during October 2020, was 106, as against an average of 131 passengers per flight in October 2019, she said. Therefore, it is expected that the domestic aviation industry operated at a passenger load factor (PLF) of around 68 per cent in October 2020, as against 83.6 per cent in October 2019, that too on a low capacity, she added. PLF or seat factor is a measure of how much of an airline’s passenger carrying capacity is used or average percentage of seats filled in an aircraft. According to Shah, the PLF for October was higher than 63.2 per cent in September, despite the increase in capacity deployment by around 24 per cent. Under the Vande Bharat Mission, the international passenger traffic, both (inbound and outbound, was 10,96,709 between May 7 (when the services commenced) to October 31, as per ICRA. The international passenger traffic declined 87 per cent to 255,075 year-on-year, though sequentially it improved by about 22 per cent, ICRA said in the release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recovery-in-domestic-air-passenger-traffic-continues-in-october-report/story-WpeDVZhScZTbyAIRODDMYP.html

But lately, singer Shaan has been experimenting quite a bit with his sound and music. He says that he is enjoying this phase of creating new music and trying out newer things. But one thing that has become a bone of contention in every musician’s life nowadays is the number game of digital streaming platforms. And Shaan feels that it is a trap.“At the end of the day, all the streaming platforms are being handled by algorithms by certain artificial intelligence situation, so there are a lot of loopholes that people can exploit. And I can’t tell what are paid views and what are real views. There are songs that you have absolutely not heard of, and the artiste is not exactly massy, and yet the song has a 100 or 200 million views, so it beats logic” says Shaan, adding that when music companies are asked about it, they maintain that the audience has loved them. “I am not denying that it can happen but what it actually does is then create a win-win situation for the guys who deal with these views and likes and the digital marketers.”  JUST 1 WEEK TO GO ! We're eager to share the song with you and we hope that you have subscribed to my channel (Link in Bio) on YouTube so that you don't miss out the premiere on 11th November at 11am! #Sniper #BreakTheBox #DareToBeDifferent #Shaan #SingerShaan #ShaanMusic #ShaanSingle #SonaliRaut #KunwarJuneja #NewMusic #IndiePop #HipHop #ComingSoon @isonaliraut @adityadevmusic @junejakunwar @mgmehulgadani @riyazzamlaniA post shared by  Shaan (@singer_shaan) on Nov 4, 2020 at 2:03am PSTShaan believes that this is an easy way for newer artistes, who have access to money, to do things their way. “Artistes now say that if not 200 million, make my song reach at least 10 or 20 million. That is a trap and if I have to get into this trap, I will have spend all my hard earned money. A lot of youngsters who have access to money and feel that this is a way to get instant gratification, are doing it. There are funders putting in money, so this has become a kind of strange business where there is no return,” he explains.  "Haath mein pistol, lekin naam ‘Sniper’ ?? 🧐 " Yeh raaz khulega jald, don't be hyper !! 😎😂 Till then, can you guess what's going to happen in my #NewSong with @isonaliraut?

So, when this idea came about, I said we should get an actor to do it because where will I play such a suave character, but the director convinced me to play it. Sometimes, you do things that you are not very sure of, but the point is to do it convincingly and properly, so it was a good experience shooting a video like this. I am glad that whoever has seen the teaser and the shots are really liking it.

07-11-2020||India||Drugs case: Showik Chakraborty moves fresh bail application in special NDPS court||Showik Chakraborty, the brother of actor Rhea Chakraborty, has moved a fresh bail application before a special court in Mumbai in connection with a drugs case related to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Chakraborty, in his bail application filed on November 3, claimed innocence submitting that he has been falsely implicated in the case even though no drugs or psychotropic substances were seized from his possession.The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had arrested Showik, his sister, and others under several relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in connection with a case emerging out of the investigation into the death of Sushant Singh Rajput.“In the facts and circumstances of the present case, given that no commercial quantity has been alleged in respect of the applicant, there has been no recovery from the applicant and that all allegations pertain only to small quantities, the embargo imposed by Section 37 of the NDPS Act, 1985 would not be applicable,” the bail application said.It said that a perusal of the remand applications of all the accused arrested in the case makes it evident that there is nothing on record to suggest that the present applicant is in any way involved with the financing, illicit trafficking and/or harboring of offenders in relation to any narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.“Apart from allegedly procuring the drugs for the late actor, there are no allegations against the applicant of being involved in any other form of illicit traffic or even of purchasing drugs for any other person. Hence, terming the applicant as being part of a “drug syndicate” or having financed the “illicit traffic” of drugs is wholly farfetched and without application of mind,” it said.“There is not a shred of evidence to connect the applicant with financing any illicit traffic or harbouring any offenders and hence the ingredients of Section 27A of the NDPS Act, 1985 are not made out in the present facts and circumstances,” it added.Showik claimed that Sushant utilised him, his sister and members of his household staff to facilitate his drug habit while ensuring that he did not leave a paper trail of his own in the form of any electronic evidence whatsoever.“There is electronic evidence to show that the applicant’s sister was in fact trying her level best to rid the late actor of his drug habit by consistently restricting the quantity of drugs he had access to. The applicant’s sister also discussed her concerns regarding the late actor combining his drug habit with prescription medication with his doctor namely Kersi Chavda. However, the late actor being an adult and having his own mind was the ultimate decision,” it added.Earlier, a special NDPS court had rejected Showik’s bail application in the matter, after which the same was challenged in the Bombay High Court, which was also rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drugs-case-showik-chakraborty-moves-fresh-bail-application-in-special-ndps-court/story-q9R4ElnIP8ZLIBFphYhTdL.html

In the battle-space, operational response and demand will be an integrated synergistic approach to all operations,” he added.“Therefore, bonds of friendship that you have forged here, with your course-mates, with your squadron-mates, need to continue throughout your life, as you go into your service career and should translate always into better synergy at every stage of your career,” Bhadauria advised the cadets.“The appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and formation of the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) marks the beginning of the most historic phase of higher defence reforms in our country,” he said.“As budding military professionals, you should begin to understand that geopolitical churnings around the world have a direct bearing on the security environment in our neighbourhood,” the IAF chief said.“Our armed forces have to be prepared for hybrid threats emanating from multiple fronts. This mandates very high levels of knowledge, dedication, commitment and sacrifice and leadership at all levels at all times. This is what each service and the nation would expect from you,” he added.The convocation ceremony of 139th NDA course was held the academy on Friday.

School and mass education minister Samir Ranjan Dash said the decision was taken after extensive consultations.The state government earlier this week announced the resumption of classes for students of class 9 to 12 from the third week of November.

Presiding over a meeting on Friday evening, the chief minister issued instructions for elaborate celebrations in Ayodhya on the occasion. Outsiders, however, will not be allowed for Deepotsav and people would be encouraged to light a diya virtually at Ram Ki Paidi from their homes. It will be the fourth consecutive Deepotsav in Ayodhya. Last year, the Ayodhya administration created a world record by lighting 410,000 earthen lamps. Not just Deepotsav, outsiders would not be allowed to participate in other attractions of the town, like Kartik Purnima Mela, Panch Koshi and 14 Koshi Parikramas, an official said. The borders of Ayodhya will be sealed from November 11 and only locals will be allowed to take part in the ceremonies. “No outsider will be allowed in Ayodhya this year on Deepotsav, Kartik Purnima and other festive occasions. All these events will be restricted to locals only,” said MP Agarwal, the divisional commissioner of Ayodhya. The five-day Deepotsav celebrations will begin in Ayodhya on November 12, followed by formal inauguration of the main event on November 13, the day before Diwali. Other festive events will continue till Kartik Purnima on November 30. The Ayodhya administration was anticipating the presence of a large crowd this year on Deepotsav and Kartik Purnima as construction work of the Ram temple has begun. Every year, a large number of people visit Ayodhya from the nearby districts, including Barabanki, Basti, Amethi, Gonda and Ambedkar Nagar for the Deepotsav celebrations. For Kartik Purnima, people assemble on the banks of the Saryu for ritual bathing in the river. Ayodhya’s deputy inspector general of police Deepak Kumar will coordinate with police chiefs of the adjoining districts. The Ayodhya police will create a WhatsApp group, which will have police personnel from the adjoining districts too. The step is being taken for the quick sharing of information. The Ayodhya police will start checking the entry of vehicles from November 11 onwards. This year, the Ayodhya administration will strive to break last year’s record and around 8,000 students from Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University and the degree colleges of Ayodhya will be trained for the purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-to-be-in-ayodhya-for-deepotsav-curbs-introduced-for-festive-days/story-kaP9nTwe5p4JvRvdehFZeJ.html

TMC leaders alleged that home minister Amit Amit Shah was so ignorant of Bengal’s culture that he garlanded the wrong statue. Calling Shah a “bohiragato (outsider)” the TMC tweeted, “’Bohiragato’ are at it again! Union Home Minister Amit Shah is so ignorant of Bengal’s culture that he insulted Bhagwan Birsa Munda by garlanding a wrong idol and placed his photo at someone else’s foot. Will he ever respect Bengal?” Retweeting this, TMC Rajya Sabha member and party spokesperson Derek O’Brien wrote, “You may be an expert on the Gujarat Gymkhana. But not Bengal.” The TMC also carried out a symbolic purification programme at the site of the statue on Friday afternoon by washing the ground with river water. Born in 1875, Birsa Munda led a rebellion against the Bengal Presidency, a British administration zone which is now part of Jharkhand and Bengal. Shah, who was in the state for two days, flew to Bankura from Kolkata in a chopper on Thursday morning and began his tour by paying homage to Birsa Munda. He was driven to a huge statue of a tribal man at Puwabagan, about 10 km away from Bankura town, but he garlanded a framed image of the tribal leader kept at the base of the statue. “The statue is that of a tribal hunter. It was installed a few years ago as part of a road beautification programme. It is not a statue of Birsa Munda. We brought this to the notice of Bankura district leaders a day before the event. But instead of taking Shah to one of the statues of Birsa Munda, the party went ahead with the ceremony,” said Sangiri Hembram, a leader of the local tribal organization Bharat Jakat Majhi Pargana Mahal. Vivekananda Patra, president of the BJP’s Bankura district unit, admitted that an error was made while attempting to spot a statue of Birsa Munda not far from Bankura town where Shah held a closed-door meeting with leaders from 13 districts. “The moment we came to know of the mistake we bought a printed image of the tribal leader. Shah did not garland the statue. He placed flowers before the framed image,” said Patra. BJP state leader Debjit Sarkar said in Kolkata that being the Union home minister, whose travel routes have to be checked in advance by security personnel, Shah’s convoy could not be taken to another statue of Birsa Shah at the last minute. Hours after Thursday’s ceremony, Shah went to Chaturdihi village with BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, national secretary Arvind Menon, national vice-president Mukul Roy and other leaders to have lunch at the home of Bibhishan Hansda, a member of the local tribal community. Shah sat on the floor with the others and had rice, chapati, dal and curry cooked in earthenware. The TMC took a jibe at Shah for this as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-on-gujarat-gymkhana-not-bengal-tmc-on-amit-shah-s-statue-flub/story-i7XCrLdZ2fQ2JA6180xiXO.html

However, there was a wide gap between the minimum temperature in the suburbs and in south Mumbai. The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 24 degrees Celsius, which was at the normal mark. The weather bureau said minimum temperature was expected to hover in the range of 19-21 degrees Celsius over the next week due to the current wind pattern. “For the first time this season, Mumbai has recorded the minimum temperature below 20 degrees Celsius.

The maximum temperature has remained at the normal mark in the suburbs and a degree Celsius below normal in south Mumbai. Owing to a rise in wind speed over the past 48 hours, the air quality index (AQI) has remained in the moderate category, as per the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The AQI, which was at 221 (in poor category) earlier in the week, stood at 149 (moderate) on Saturday. Pollution levels are likely to decline further as an AQI of 132 (moderate) has been predicted for Sunday. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.Location-wise minimum temperatures, as recorded by IMD’s automatic weather stations, showed Kandivali was the coolest at 18.9 degrees Celsius, followed by Malad at 19.6, while Panvel was the coolest in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region at 14.8 degrees Celsius.

The officer said the raid which started on Thursday was continuing at many places and serious violations of Foreign Contributions Regulation Act and (FCRA) Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) were detected. The Believers’ Church runs a medical college and many other educational institutions in Kerala and other states. It also owns Cheruvally estate in Pathanamthitta district which has been identified as the location for the proposed Sabarimala airport. In 2017, the Union home ministry had barred three NGOs associated with the church from accepting funds but the latest raids show fund flow continued from foreign countries in other names. It is alleged that more than Rs 100 crore came in the last three years. A senior I-T official said the department will release details once raids are over. He said raids were based on specific information on tax evasion and misuse of foreign funds. The church said it will give a statement after the conclusion of raids. An independent denomination, the indigenous church has witnessed massive growth in the last one and a half decade and its head KP Yohanan is known for his religious discourses. The 70-year-old priest is the founder and president of Gospel of Asia, a large non-profit evangelist organisation with main focus on India and Asia. He has also authored more than 100 books on Christian living and mission. A controversial religious head, he was in news when the church brought Chreuvally Estate, a rubber and tea plantation spread over 10 kms radius, from plantation group Harisons Malayalam Limited. In July, the Kerala High Court had directed the state government not to acquire the land for the airport by force after KP Yohanan moved the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-t-raids-at-kerala-church-foreign-funding-rules-violation-detected/story-IgTzC1UnpEYBRkWOGuo2uO.html

07-11-2020||India||Arnab Goswami’s arrest: Special sitting of Bombay high court to hear bail plea at 12pm||A division bench of Justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik will hold a special sitting on Saturday 12pm to hear the interim bail plea of Republic Television editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in the 2018 case of abetment to suicide of architecht-interior designer Anvy Naik and his mother. The hearing remained incomplete on Friday as there was scarcity of time. The high court does not assemble on Saturdays. So, the case can be heard at length, the bench observed on Friday. The 47-year-old journalist was arrested by Alibag police on Wednesday from his Lower Parel residence and produced him to a magistrate’s court which remanded him in judicial custody till November 18. Goswami is being represented by two lawyers — Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda. Here is what happened during Friday’s hearing:> The bench said that the normal practice to seek bail is to first approach the lower court magistrate or sessions court concerned. If bail is refused, then one can move the high court.> Harish Salve said Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) gives the high court special powers to hear bail pleas. “His (Goswami’s) liberty is at stake,” Salve said.> A bail plea was moved before the magistrate’s court in Alibag but it was later withdrawn as the case lies in the jurisdiction of the sessions court. The local police moved the sessions court seeking Goswami’s police custody. > “What is the harm if this gentleman is released om bail? What is going to happen between now and after Diwali?” Salve submitted before the bench, as reported by Livelaw.> “The problem cannot be that he will go back to the TV channel and scream and will make allegations against Parambir Singh(Mumbai Police Commissioner). He will certainly. But that it is no ground to keep him in custody”, Salve said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arnab-goswami-s-arrest-special-sitting-of-bombay-high-court-to-hear-bail-plea-at-12pm/story-YSUGEq5sVXSKOWA28ekUGK.html
07-11-2020||India||Amit Shah sets the agenda for 2021 Bengal election,slams TMC over appeasement politics||Union Home Minister Amit Shah hit out at the All India Trinamool Congress(TMC) government on Friday over alleged minority appeasement and deteriorating law and order, demanded a white paper on political killings and urged voters to give the The Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) a chance to run West Bengal. Alleging that there had been politicisation and criminalisation of government officers in the state, the BJP leader, who was on a two-day visit, said the TMC government had stopped sending crime statistics to the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) after 2018. During a visit to the Dakshineswar Kali Temple, Shah castigated the TMC government for adopting appeasement politics, which he said had hurt the state’s age-old tradition of upholding the nation’s spiritual consciousness.The home minister stood by West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar for working “within the constitutional limits”, saying the utterances against the latter by the elected representatives of the TMC were “unacceptable”.“After 2018, the West Bengal government has not sent the crime statistics to the NCRB. What is the state government trying to hide?” he asked. “I want to ask (Chief Minister) Mamata Banerjee to come out with a white paper on political killings in Bengal.”  “The state tops the chart in political killings. In regards to women safety and security, West Bengal has an abysmal record,” Shah said.The BJP leader launched a tirade against the chief minister’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee. “The aim is to build a strong Bengal in a new era of development. Mamata Banerjee aims to make her nephew the next chief minister,” he said at a press conference in Kolkata. “In West Bengal, there are three kinds of laws: one for the nephew, one for minority appeasement, and one for common people.” he added.Shah also touched upon the issue of infiltration through the porous borders, saying the boundaries of West Bengal were not secure.He urged the people to give the BJP, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a chance in the 2021 assembly election so that it could deliver ‘shonar Bangla’ (golden Bengal) to the masses.The 10 years of the TMC rule is marked with “tolabaji (extortion), violence, and political killings, Shah remarked. “The Mamata Banerjee government has failed to keep its promises. Their promises have been proved to be hollow over the past 10 years and hopes of people have turned into despair,” he said. “I urge the people of the state to give the BJP a chance as they have given Congress, the communists and the TMC a chance in the past.” Shah acknowledged that West Bengal was the prime focus of the BJP, adding that the party would fight and win it with a “massive mandate”. Asked about the possibility of President’s rule in the state, Shah said: “As far as Article 356 issue is concerned, it can’t be discussed in a press conference. It’s a constitutional matter and the Centre takes a decision based on the report from the governor.”  “And there’s also no need to impose Article 356 as the government will change next April (assembly polls),” he added. On Gorkha Janamukti Morcha(GJM) leader Bimal Gurung walking out of the National Democratic Alliance(NDA) and joining hands with the TMC, Shah feels that the former had been working for the Gorkhas and would continue to do so in future “But this instance is a classic example of vendetta politics of the TMC. Why is the TMC not arresting him (Gurung) now when he has so many cases against him?” Shah asked. Reacting to it, TMC leader Sukhendu Sekhar Roy accused Shah of peddling a “bunch of lies”. “He was quoting an NCRB report of 2018 to prove women are not safe in Bengal. He is peddling falsehood,” Roy said. “The same NCRB report shows atrocities on women are far higher in Uttar Pradesh in the same year.” “Why didn’t he go to Hathras? For 40-long hours, no reporter, including women journalists, were allowed to go to Hathras,” the TMC MP said. TMC leader Derek O’Brien echoed Roy and said: “Shah’s mission to defame and insult Bengal continues.”  “As far his predictions of 200-plus seats, people have seen how his predictions had gone wrong in Bihar in 2015, Delhi in 2015 and 2020, in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in 2018,” O’Brien said. “Be rest assured, Bengal has and will always stand up to protect the soul of the country.” Earlier, Shah also had lunch at the house of a party worker, who belonged to the Matua community, in Baguihati area of North 24 Parganas district.The Matuas, a refugee community from erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), is a deciding factor in around 40-50 assembly seats in the state.During an internal party meeting, Shah assured that the Centre would ensure a free-and-fair election without any violence and urged the party workers to strengthen the booth committees ahead of the April-May polls.The saffron party, after having a limited presence in the state for decades, has emerged as the main rival of the TMC by winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the 2019 general election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-sets-the-agenda-for-2021-bengal-election-slams-tmc-over-appeasement-politics/story-qlHUO8MHw1KqKA975xZnRK.html
07-11-2020||India||Milind Soman faces FIR, charged with obscenity for naked run on Goa beach||Actor and model Milind Soman has been booked for obscenity after he uploaded a photograph of himself running in the buff on a beach in south Goa. The south Goa Superintendent of Police Pankaj Kumar Singh confirmed that the actor was booked under section 294 (obscenity) of the Indian Penal Code, along with other relevant sections of the Information Technology Act. On November 4, Soman had uploaded a photo on Twitter which showed him running naked on a Goa beach on his 55th birthday. The actor captioned the picture, clicked against the wide expanse of the ocean, as “Happy Birthday to me...55 and running”. There has been no comment from the actor on the FIR against him. The FIR comes even as the Canacona judicial magistrate granted model and actress Poonam Pandey bail, observing that all nudity didn’t amount to obscenity. The model was arrested on Thursday for shooting an “objectionable” video in Goa.“It is important to note that when such representation is in pursuance of art, it is an exception. Making of films obviously is an artistic endeavour and even if it was otherwise, determination of the same would be a matter of trial. One cannot, given the facts and circumstances, come to a conclusion that all nudity is obscene,” the magistrate said. “When it comes to fundamental rights of an individual, which are sacrosanct, especially the right to free speech and expression, which constitutes an essential foundation of a democracy and without which life itself would be meaningless, acting in a video or film, which may be perceived by some as obscene and yet some others may perceive it as artistic, cannot be a ground to jail a person, especially where the acts complained of have been documented on film,” Chief Judicial Magistrate Audi Shanoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/milind-sonam-faces-fir-charged-with-obscenity-for-naked-run-on-goa-beach/story-qNTXV5B9mxn0ccplDyddLI.html
07-11-2020||India||US supercarrier Nimitz to join Vikramaditya for QUAD Malabar exercise off Goa coast||Indian Navy’s flagship Vikramaditya and US supercarrier Nimitz along with two destroyers of the Australian and Japanese navies will conduct full-spectrum exercises off the coast of Goa as part of Malabar war games from November 17 to 20.The two carrier groups, with MiG-29K fighters on board Vikramaditya and F-18 fighters on board Nimitz, will participate in war games, while the involvement of the two other countries, which are, like India and the US, members of the Quad grouping, will strengthen multi-operability in full domain exercises. It is also expected to help all four countries understand the ethos and level of training of each other’s navies, commanders and personnel.The exercise will take place in quite a congested environment with at least 70 foreign warships patrolling the area between the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy’s warships are not in the vicinity but are not too far off either -- ostensibly conducting anti-pirate operations off the Gulf of Aden.According to top naval commanders, the Indian Navy is fully deployed on both the eastern as well as the western seaboard and prepared for contingencies in case the situation takes a turn for the worse in East Ladakh region. Analysts say it is clear that the Quad members are committed to keep the sea lanes of communication open for navigation and are ready to meet the challenge brought upon by PLA Navy by imposing constraints in South China Sea.With the Indian Navy expected to commission indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant along with its second nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine, INS Arighat, by next year, India will be able to project power from Malacca Straits to Gulf of Aden and beyond, the analysts added.Under navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh, the focus of the force has also been on rapidly developing military infrastructure in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands so that India can project power well beyond the Malacca Straits. The navy is also keen on building a third aircraft carrier so that it turns into truly blue water navy.While there is an intensive debate among national security planners over the viability of a third aircraft carrier in an age when so-called standoff weapons and long range ballistic missiles are the order of the day, the navy’s argument is that a rising power like India cannot be tethered to the shore-line. This argument makes sense, say analysts, as China’s influence in Africa, Middle-East and Persian Gulf under the Belt Road Initiative has grown with Beijing leveraging its debt-hold on these countries.With China reaching the Indian Ocean through Pakistan and Myanmar, the navy wants Indian maritime and commercial interests to be protected by three aircraft carriers, one each of Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean. The counter argument made by the national security planners is that India should simply turn some of its 1,062 island territories into permanent military bases to influence events in the region.With the US, India, Australia and Japan communicating through deployed assets, liaison officers in each other’s naval commands, and Indian Ocean Monitoring Centres, the Quad, the analysts added, is definitely a force to reckon with in Indo-Pacific with situational awareness of both West Asia and Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-supercarrier-nimitz-to-join-vikramaditya-for-quad-malabar-exercise-off-goa-coast/story-cEROSoFZP8nb23faaLltxM.html
07-11-2020||India||SIT files charge sheet in Ballabgarh case||The special investigation team (SIT) of Faridabad police on Friday filed a 700-page charge sheet in the murder case of Nikita Tomar, a 20-year-old college student who was shot dead by a stalker outside her college on October 26. Police said the charge sheet, which lists 60 witnesses, was prepared on the basis of technical, forensic and material evidence recovered during the investigation and was submitted to the court in less than two weeks after the murder.Tomar was shot dead allegedly by Touseef Ahmad, a resident of Kabeer Nagar in Sohna, in the presence of his friend, Rehaan (who goes by one name), a resident of Riwasan in Nuh. A footage of the incident purportedly shows that the two men arrived at the spot in a Hyundai i20 and tried to force Tomar, a Bcom final-year student, into the vehicle as she came out of Aggarwal College after writing an exam, police said.OP Singh, Faridabad police commissioner, said that they had formed a special investigation team (SIT) on October 27 led by Anil Kumar Yadav , assistant commissioner of police (crime), to probe the murder.“Ten crime investigation agencies (CIA) were working on this case and submitting reports to me every day. The teams have recovered crucial evidence which are enough to hold suspects guilt and they will be given harsh punishment based on our chargesheet, which was filed in 11 days after the murder,” he said.Police said that statements of friends, shopkeepers and an auto driver are crucial in the case and the suspect’s close aide has also shared important information which is against the suspect. The man who sold the country-made pistol was also arrested from Nuh on October 28.The charge sheet has been filed under Sections 302 (murder), 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder) and 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage), 302 (murder), 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code and several sections of the Arms Act was registered at the Ballabhgarh city police station.Yadav said that in the charge sheet they have mentioned the motive of murder –Tomar had stopped talking to Touseef after she returned from his house in Nuh in 2018 where her parents had registered a kidnapping case against him.“An incident of abduction was reported on August 3, 2018, against the suspect, and the victim was recovered from Nuh…after his family members and relatives apologised, the families had an agreement… Touseef was warned against repeating any such incident,” Singh said.“The brother of the deceased, Naveen Tomar, has told police in a statement that the main accused (Touseef) was known to his sister and had been harassing her; he was forcing her to convert to Islam,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-files-charge-sheet-in-ballabgarh-case/story-QK5zSTpUbzfXOhRWoedNFJ.html
07-11-2020||India||Hathras case: CBI likely to question former SP, SDM||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is likely to question former Hathras superintendent of police (SP) Vikrant Vir and sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) PP Meena, to expedite the probe in connection with the alleged gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman by four upper caste men in Hathras, senior officers privy to the investigation said on Friday.Vir was the Hathras SP when the incident took place. The state government later suspended him on October 1 for his alleged negligence in handling the case after a public outcry over cremation of the woman’s body in the early hours of September 30. He is under suspension since then.A senior CBI official requesting anonymity said the premier investigating agency may question Vir about the probe and the action taken in the case during the initial stage after the woman was assaulted on September 14. He said the former SP would also be questioned about the allegation of forcibly cremating the body and favouring the accused.The police had initially lodged an FIR of attempt to murder that was later altered to include gang rape and murder charges.The official further said that an IAS officer, PP Meena, who was posted as sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in Hathras, would be questioned about the happenings and allegations of enforcing restrictions on the victim’s family and media.The probe agency has recorded the statements of the victim’s brother, her mother and aunt, and six local police personnel. The four accused, who are lodged in jail, and their family members were also questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-cbi-likely-to-question-former-sp-sdm/story-QcwYx71SfoHFIR9gCF87cM.html
07-11-2020||India||CBI left with limited tools to counter states’ action||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has limited legal options in the seven states that have withdrawn general consent to the agency for conducting probes within their boundaries, according to current and former agency officials and experts.Since CBI does not have any legal tools to reverse the decision of these states and policing is a state subject, CBI officials who did not want to be named pointed out that they might have to approach courts on a case-by-case basis for conducting investigations and carrying out searches.They added that the central government is aware of the matter and is deliberating how to navigate the situation.“CBI cannot challenge the decision by state governments as police is state subject, but it can go to high courts or Supreme Court in individual cases,” former CBI director AP Singh said.He added that unlike CBI, other federal agencies such as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) enjoy all-India jurisdiction without any prior permission under some relevant sections related to terrorism and money laundering.According to a CBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity, the central agency’s biggest worry in this imbroglio is the withdrawal of general consent by bigger states such as Maharashtra and Kerala.The move makes it mandatory for the federal agency to seek the state government’s permission before taking up cases within its borders.CBI comes under the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act which requires states to give the agency a general consent to act. This is because public order and police are under the purview of state governments, which routinely renew the permission under section 6 of the legislation.“After New Delhi, our Mumbai unit accounts for majority of cases registered every year. (Not having general consent in) Maharashtra definitely is a big loss,” said the CBI official cited above.For example, CBI has not registered a single first information report, or FIR, at its Mumbai branch since the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government withdrew the general consent on October 21. Usually, three to four --- sometimes more --- FIRs pertaining to corruption and bank fraud, among other offences, are registered in agency’s Mumbai unit every month.A second serving CBI official, who too requested anonymity, said that “while general consent has been withdrawn in the past too, never has agency been blocked by seven states in a row”.Apart from Maharashtra, Kerala and Jharkhand, which have withdrawn general consent for CBI probes within the past month, other states to have taken a similar step are the Congress-ruled Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government, and the Mizo National Front (MNF)-ruled Mizoram.These state governments have claimed that the Centre is using the agency to settle political scores.Tripura too stopped CBI from conducting investigations in the state last year, but the general consent was reinstated earlier this year.Similarly, the Andhra Pradesh government blocked the agency in November 2018, when Chandrababu Naidu was the chief minister. When YS Jagan Mohan Reddy became the state chief minister last year, he restored the general consent.“What is happening is completely understandable. CBI has become a complete tool and instrument in the hands of the central government to practise the politics of vendetta or circumvention against non-BJP, non-NDA (National Democratic Alliance) states. Misuse as instrument of harassment and the terror have resulted in the legitimate reaction of states withdrawing general all time consent,” senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-left-with-limited-tools-to-counter-states-action/story-SlKhMVaEKAbnkqIcPYhYYO.html
07-11-2020||India||Can resolve all issues through dialogue, says Nepal PM Oli||India and Nepal can resolve all problems between them through dialogue as they have a long-standing special relationship, Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli told visiting Indian Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Friday.Oli’s remarks came against the backdrop of a border row that took bilateral ties to a fresh low earlier this year. Naravane’s visit, during which he was conferred the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army in keeping with a long-standing tradition, was seen as an effort to improve the relationship.Naravane’s meeting with Oli was seen as the most important engagement during his three-day visit, apart from his talks on Thursday with his Nepali Army counterpart Gen Purna Chandra Thapa.Rajan Bhattarai, the foreign affairs adviser to Nepal’s premier, tweeted that Oli said during the meeting that Nepal and India have a “long-standing special relationship”. Oli also expressed confidence that there is real friendship between the two countries and all problems between them could be resolved through dialogue, Bhattarai said.Chief of Army Staff (CoAS) Narravane conveyed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s best wishes to Oli and the two sides exchanged views on their bilateral partnership. Naravane said he would work to strengthen bilateral defence cooperation, according to a statement from the Indian embassy in Kathmandu.The Indian Army added in a tweet that Oli and Naravane discussed the strengthening of bilateral defence and strategic ties.Naravane also addressed student officers and faculty of the Nepali Army Command and Staff College at Shivapuri earlier on Friday. He recalled the historical linkages between both countries and said these transcend professional exchanges and annual joint exercises.Before winding up his visit, Naravane visited the Indian embassy, where he was briefed about welfare activities for more than 230,000 Indian Army veterans and their families in Nepal.Nearly 30,000 Gurkhas serve in seven regiments of the Indian Army.As a reflection of the importance attached by India to these ties, Naravane presented the second tranche of ₹5 lakh out of the total aid of ₹10 lakh announced for Lance Havaldar (retired) Dil Bahadur Chettri, who won the Mahavir Chakra for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during the 1971 war with Pakistan.Chhetri quit service on his own request in 1976 due to personal reasons before reaching the age of retirement. However, he had no major source of income and survived solely on his gallantry award allowance. The financial assistance was approved as a welfare measure to alleviate his hardships and he was given the first tranche of ₹5 lakh in November last year.The Indian Army chief’s visit came months after bilateral ties were hit in May, when defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a key border road to Lipulekh region, which is claimed by Nepal.Kathmandu responded by issuing a new map that showed Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, all controlled by India, as part of Nepalese territory, exacerbating the row.The visit was expected to prepare the ground for more political engagements and talks on the border issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-resolve-all-issues-through-dialogue-says-nepal-pm-oli/story-4IuTccv5fWOaCb3l5y7ZTL.html

There has been a settlement with the Bodos after a long struggle; talks are in an advanced stage with the NSCN to resolve the Naga issue,” he said.Bhalla also ruled out any possibilities of China making any attempts in the northeastern region through insurgent groups operating there at a time when armies of both countries are locked in a standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. “There could be potential but not that much. These people (insurgents) have lost that kind of massive support. The leadership of ULFA is back in Assam and talking to the government. The NSCN people, after the ceasefire, are sitting in Delhi and talking to us for the final settlement. We don’t see that kind of major disruptions coming,” he said.The home secretary also said that government was yet to take a call on allowing Chinese telecom companies to enter into 5G trials in India but acknowledged that the penetration of the neighbouring country into the existing network is too extensive. Bhalla, however, said that the government is making special safeguards to ensure safety and security of the country’s communication network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naga-talks-at-advanced-stage-says-home-secy/story-6vZ9Nt6WdXxCDAFxKmmhoI.html
07-11-2020||India||Favour localisation of data: Truecaller to JPC||Truecaller, a Sweden-based mobile app that helps identify unknown phone numbers and block spam calls, told the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on Personal Data Protection, headed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Meenakshi Lekhi, on Friday that it supports data localisation, a person familiar with the matter said.The JPC has met several industry leaders such as Amazon, Google, Twitter, Facebook, Paytm, Reliance Jio, Ola, Uber and Bharti Airtel over last two weeks to discuss the nuances of the Data Protection Bill. The JPC is due to submit its report by the winter session of Parliament.The person cited above told HT that while Airtel, Jio, Ola and Paytm have supported data localisation, Truecaller is the first international firm to back the move. “After hearing their reasons, it makes sense that other companies do so as well. They haven’t just cited cost-efficiency but also increased security, safety and speed of business for having the data centres in India,” the person said.Data localisation has been a sore point for many tech giants, including the four biggest technology companies in the world -- Amazon, Google, Facebook and Twitter. They have argued that localisation may lead to the possibility of a “fractured internet” or “splinternet”.Amazon has expressed reservations over restrictions in cross-border data transfer, saying that it will hamper India’s business and economy.A person familiar with Twitter’s testimony, however, said that the House panel did not pose any question on data localisation to the social media giant.The person cited above said that the prevalent view, before Truecaller spoke to the panel, had been that Indian and foreign companies are divided on the issue of data localisation.“Truecaller’s stance shows that it is not only cheaper but also more efficient to store data in India,” the person said.The Personal Data Protection Bill proposes that tech companies store data of all Indian citizens within the country and that sensitive data, such as financial or healthcare data, not be stored outside India. Currently, the companies are allowed to only process sensitive data outside India. A Truecaller spokesperson confirmed that the company has a data centre in India just outside Mumbai, where it has stored data of Indian users since 2017. Truecaller launched its India arm in 2013.Lekhi said data localisation was the way forward. “The interaction with different stakeholders has been a fantastic one,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/favour-localisation-of-data-truecaller-to-jpc/story-mzeOIq2xLlJwYrLlSK49KM.html

07-11-2020||India||Arnab Goswami’s bail to be heard today||The Supreme Court on Friday issued a contempt notice to the Maharashtra assembly’s assistant secretary for allegedly “intimidating” journalist Arnab Goswami for approaching the top court last month with transcripts of a debate on a breach of privilege motion initiated against him in connection with his television show on actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Goswami was arrested by Mumbai Police earlier this week in connection with the 2018 suicide of an interior designer. There was no immediate relief for him on Friday as the hearing on his interim bail plea before the Bombay high court remained incomplete. The division bench of Justice SS Shinde and Justice MS Karnik is likely to decide on his bail plea Saturday.An October 13 letter by the assembly’s assistant secretary purportedly cautioned him against disclosing House proceedings without the Speaker’s approval even as the editor-in-chief of Republic TV approached the apex court against the initiation of the privilege motion. The Supreme Court stayed Goswami’s arrest in this particular case and said it is “unprecedented” and “serious” that a state legislature is threatening a citizen for approaching the apex court with documents, which he received from the assembly as part of a notice asking him to explain his stand. The three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, also allowed Goswami to add the Union government as a party to the case, issued a notice to attorney general KK Venugopal, and appointed senior advocate Arvind Datar to assist the court as an amicus curiae. It posted the matter for November 23 and asked the secretary, Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, to be present during the hearing. “There is no doubt that if a citizen of India is deterred in any case from approaching this court in exercise of his right under Article 32 (allowing citizens to move Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights) of the Constitution of India, it would amount to a serious and direct interference in the administration of justice in the country,” the bench, also comprising Justice AS Bopanna and Justice V Ramasubramanian, said in its order. The privilege motion case in the Supreme Court pertains to a news show hosted by Goswami, who accused the Maharashtra government of not going in the right direction in the Rajput death probe and allegedly made derogatory comments targeted at chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, according to House proceedings. Following this, proceedings were initiated on a breach of privilege motion moved on September 9 by Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik. Goswami later filed a petition in the top court with transcripts of the debate seeking a stay on the motion. Senior advocate Harish Salve, who appeared for Goswami, produced an affidavit to bring the letter on record. “This is a matter of utmost seriousness... At times, constitutional courts must see the reality, and not the smokescreen. I want a stay of any further proceedings in this matter,” Salve said. CJI Bobde termed the matter “very serious” and said: “We have never seen such a letter in a privilege case. We find it very difficult to overlook it. How dare this officer say this?” The bench then show-caused Vilas Athawale, assistant secretary, Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, and asked as to why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who represented the Maharashtra government, informed the court that no action was expected to be taken against Goswami in the privilege motion case. Rajendra Bhagwat, secretary, Maharashtra legislative assembly, refused to react on the matter, saying it is sub-judice. Meanwhile, a division bench of the Bombay high court will continue to hear on Saturday the bail petition filed Goswami. Goswami was picked up from his home in Lower Parel by Alibag Police on charges of allegedly abetting the suicide of a 53-year-old Anvay Naik. Naik and his mother Kumud were found dead at their house in May 2018. A suicide note alleged that the two were forced to end their lives because he was not paid dues amounting to ₹5.4 crore by Goswami, two others.

07-11-2020||India||Will implement CAA, says Shah on CM Mamata’s turf||The Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government is committed to implementing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Friday, while also exuding confidence that his party will comfortably register a victory in next year’s assembly elections in the battleground state of West Bengal. On a two-day visit to the state, Shah sounded the bugle for the 2021 elections, targeted chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s government over “corruption and atrocity and political killings”, had lunch at a Dalit man’s house in a symbolic move, and also appealed to residents to restore Bengal’s “lost glory”. “The BJP is committed to enforcing the new citizenship law across the nation. The process has been held back because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said at a press conference after a closed-door meeting with BJP leaders at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre at Rajarhat, on the suburbs of Kolkata. Senior BJP leaders who attended the meeting with Shah said he spoke at length on the citizenship law -- an emotive issue in the state that shares its borders with Bangladesh -- and said the BJP has kept the promise it made to the people. Shah also offered prayers at a temple of the Matua community, a dominant part the Namasudras (or Dalits), at New Town in Kolkata and had lunch at the home of one of the community members there. Members of the Matua community, who welcomed him, said they needed the citizenship law. “Citizenship right had been a long-standing demand of the Matua community,” said Brajen Majumdar, a lawyer. A large section of the Matua community migrated to Bengal from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) after 1947 to escape religious persecution. There are about 10 million people from the Namasudra community in Bengal, according to the 2011 Census. The contentious citizenship law promises to fast-track the citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who entered India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before 2015. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is strongly opposed to the law and citizenship screening on the basis of religion. Caste politics and Dalit votes will play a crucial role in the assembly polls due in six months, according to experts. “The lunch Shah had at the home of a Matua family may be seen as a political gimmick, but it is a fact that for millions of people, citizenship is an important issue,” said political observer Suvashis Maitra. After winning 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 elections, the BJP is gearing up to challenge CM Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress in the assembly polls. Dalit communities can influence poll results in over 50 of the state’s 294 assembly seats. In the evening, Shah launched an all-out offensive on the Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) government. “Our aim is to build a strong Bengal in a new era of development. Mamata Banerjee’s aim is to make her nephew (Abhishek Banerjee) the next CM,” he said at the press meet. “Rest assured, the BJP will come to power in Bengal with more than 200 seats (out of 294)…The anger in people shows that change is imminent. I appeal to the people to give the BJP an opportunity. We will turn this state into sonar Bangla (golden Bengal) in five years.”When asked if former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly was considered as a probable CM face amidst a buzz, Shah said: “The parliamentary committee of the BJP and the party president will decide whether we need a chief ministerial face for the coming polls in Bengal, and if at all we need one, then who it should be.”Hitting back, Saugata Roy, a Trinamool Lok Sabha MP and a party spokesperson, said: “The BJP is trying to divide people. Mamata Banerjee makes no discrimination among citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-implement-caa-says-shah-on-cm-mamata-s-turf/story-2z7NuLxmtoedOm7xtu05bO.html
07-11-2020||India||Delhiwale: Portrait of a working dad||This afternoon, leaf collector Mahesh is making a round of the central Delhi park where he works, dragging his bicycle cart behind him. He occasionally stops, picks up the fallen leaves and tosses them into his cart. All of them are destined for the garbage.But what’s this curious bundle, slumped in one corner of Mahesh’s cart?On taking a closer look, it doesn’t look like a bundle.It’s a child. She is sleeping in a slouched position, her head bent down on her knees.“That’s Nandini, my daughter,” says Mahesh, casually shrugging his shoulders as if it were the most normal thing in the world to have a baby bundled up in a cart of leaves. “It’s her afternoon sleep time.”Mahesh’s wife, Saraswati, is a leaf collector too, in the same park. Natives of Gwalior, in Madhya Pradesh, they arrived in the city more than a year ago and have been in this job since about that time. The couple’s other child, the younger boy Ankit, is with his mother “somewhere over there,” Mahesh says, vaguely waving his arm towards a great tuft of trees.The family has just had lunch—every day, they have it together on the park lawn. “We had roti and bhaaji, but I don’t know which bhaaji...,” says Mahesh, grinning widely. “I don’t cook food, my wife does.”He explains that he and Saraswati divide the duties of looking after the children. “Ankit is very young and stays with his mother, while I look after Nandini.”The little girl is a first standard student. “But her school is closed due to karuna (coronavirus).” As the girl has no access to online classes, she stays with her parents while they work. “Sometimes she plays with her bhaiya, sometimes she plays alone... and when she gets tired, she sleeps.”Turning around to look at her, Mahesh affectionately taps his hand on Nandini’s head, muttering “she is very naughty when she is awake.”The sleeping girl is barefoot.A moment later, Mahesh tries to wake her up. Nandini doesn’t stir. Mahesh lifts her in his arms. The girl lets herself fall on his shoulder, eyes still closed. Mahesh cries to her, “Dekh machli (see, fish),” pointing to a flock of birds. Nandini continues sleeping. Mahesh carefully places her back in the cart and carries onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-portrait-of-a-working-dad/story-UkM5em8v8DpM0FJkUnlBTL.html
07-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||This is the 200th instalment of a column on Covid-19 that I began on March 19. I’ve written it at least five days a week since (there are a few weeks when I wrote seven or six, and one week when I could manage only four). I’m still learning, but because the column requires extensive reading, it has deepened my understanding of the virus, testing, the human immune system, drugs, and therapies. My background (in math and engineering) has helped, but not as much as my colleagues Jamie Mullick, Sanchita Sharma, and Binayak Dasgupta, who have generously shared with me their expertise in math, public health, and science. Our understanding of the virus, how it affects us, and what works and what doesn’t, continues to grow, as the pandemic itself ebbs and flows across geographies – continuing to provide me with fodder for this column. And when they don’t, I come up with something – such as Dispatch 73, on June 4, where I wrote about masks, and used the opportunity to quote from Paul Laurence Dunbar’s poem We Wear The Mask, which is about racism and identity in the US (the column appeared around the time the Black Lives Matter protests peaked).“…Why should the world be over-wise,In counting all our tears and sighs?Nay, let them only see us, while,We wear the mask.”There are some Constant Readers who have told me I should continue to write the column till a vaccine comes out, and is widely available, but I don’t know – I do have a day job, after all. But I’m being self-indulgent; 200 is a personal milestone on a day there were other not-so-personal ones related to the pandemic.The first is the peak the US touched in terms of daily new cases: at least 121,000, according to the New York Times; 102,830 according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center; and 118,319 according to worldometers.info. The third wave of the pandemic has been the worst in the country, and across most states, the seven-day average is trending up, a clear indication that the number of cases could go even higher. The world, too, saw a new peak in terms of daily cases, 605,269 according to the New York Times, and 608,550 according to worldometers.info. The US and Europe are seeing a sharp spike in cases with the onset of winter, but there is a far more disturbing statistic. On November 5, the seven-day average of deaths from Covid-19 globally reached a peak too – 7,595, according to the New York Times. This is worrying despite case fatality rates being lower (until now) than they were in the first wave – more people are dying now simply because there are more, far more, cases. At this pace, the world will touch 50 million cases shortly. According to most dashboards, the number of daily deaths around the world from Covid-19 is nearing 10,000; the NYT database says this number was actually crossed on November 4 (there are usually some differences based on reporting times and time zones).Clearly, fears about winter accelerating the spread of the pandemic were not unfounded. In Europe and in most US states, hospitals have been overwhelmed by the number of patients needing care, putting pressure on not just already stretched health care systems, but also on doctors and other health care workers who are at a breaking point after around eight months of dealing with the pandemic (although there was some respite in Europe through the summer). India is relatively better off; while cases have risen in some regions (including Delhi), at a national level, both daily case numbers and the seven-day average of cases are at levels last seen in early July. There will be a second wave, though, and the country would do well to prepare for it now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-mf3A3BQA4KpgYSHyYpK9ZN.html

07-11-2020||India||India tops global survey on Covid-19 vaccination intent; rising hesitancy in many countries||Indians are the keenest on getting vaccinated whenever a Covid-19 vaccine is available, even as people in 10 out of 15 countries showed a growing reluctance about getting vaccinated, according to a global survey.In the World Economic Forum/Ipsos survey of 18,526 adults from 15 countries, 73% said they would get a Covid-19 vaccine if available, down from 77% in August.While vaccination intent has remained unchanged at 87% in India since August, it has declined in 10 of the 15 countries surveyed, most of all in China, Australia, Spain, and Brazil.Globally, the two main reasons for not wanting to get a Covid-19 vaccine are concerns about side effects (cited by 34%) and concerns about clinical trials moving too fast (cited by another 33%). In India also, 34% respondents said they are worried about side effects, while 16% are concerned about fast-moving trials.Besides, one in ten persons globally said they are against vaccines in general (19% in India), while another 10% said they don’t think a vaccine will be effective (14% in India), and 8% cited a low risk of getting Covid-19 (14% in India), as per the survey.The World Economic Forum (WEF) said the latest survey has shown a growing reluctance to receive a vaccine, despite progress made by numerous pharmaceutical companies working on vaccine trials and international organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi and CEPI working to ensure any future solution is available for those most in need.Arnaud Bernaert, Head of Shaping the Future of Health and Healthcare at the WEF, said, “This drop in vaccine confidence is a remarkable and sad trend as we edge closer to a possible vaccine roll-out.” “The numbers are significant enough to compromise the effectiveness of a Covid-19 vaccine to manage the disease and to see an end to the cycle of new lockdowns and restrictions. It is critical that governments and the private sector come together to build trust in the next steps. It’s important to know that when a vaccine is ready, it will make a difference,” Bernaert added.The survey also asked the respondents how soon after a vaccine becomes available would they get one.Nearly half of the adults globally said they would get vaccinated within three months after the Covid-19 vaccine is available to all (54% in India).Globally, 72% said they would get vaccinated within a year (82% in India).The WHO had called ‘public hesitancy towards vaccination’ as one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019, affecting not only public health but businesses and economies also.The survey was conducted by leading market research company Ipsos from October 8-13, 2020, with a sample of 18,526 adults in the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, and the UK.The survey also put Indians as being the second most optimistic about availability of a Covid-19 vaccine soon -- 34% expecting it within three months and 72% within six months. China topped the chart with 37% expecting a vaccine in three months and 75% in six months.Globally, 16% expect the first vaccine for general use in three months and 45% in six months.More than 4.8 crore people have tested positive for the virus so far globally, while more than 12 lakh have died.India’s Covid-19 caseload has crossed past 84 lakh, while nearly 1.25 lakh have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tops-global-survey-on-covid-19-vaccination-intent-rising-hesitancy-in-many-countries/story-wYs1Ag3SlCp3t6aMu8ZFjP.html
07-11-2020||India||Air pollution may lead to faster spread of Covid-19 infections, officials tell parliamentary panel||Air pollution may lead to a faster spread of Covid-19 infections as it causes coughing and sneezing, government officials told a parliamentary panel on Friday, according to sources.Top officials of the Union environment and health ministries and the governments of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab deposed before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development to find a “permanent solution” to air pollution in the national capital and adjoining areas.In addition, officials of the Central Pollution Control Board and from other departments also depose before the panel on the ongoing situation of air pollution in the national capital and its adjoining areas.The agenda of the meeting was to deliberate upon “steps taken for prevention of air pollution special emphasis on finding permanent solution to air pollution in Delhi and NCR.” In a presentation before the panel, officials from the central government expressed concern over the threat of Covid-19 spreading faster due to air pollution.“Higher air pollution may increase episodes of coughing and sneezing spreading Covid-19 faster. More particle surface for the virus to stick to and get transported over greater distance and may potentially survive longer,” the health ministry said in the presentation to the committee.Citing a Lancet study, the health ministry said, “There is average loss of 1.7 years of life expectancy in India due to air pollution.” Similarly it said in Delhi there is 1.7 times higher risk of respiratory ailments and prevalence of breathing problems and 10,000 to 30,000 air pollution deaths are reported annually.The environment ministry, in its presentation, shared the details of the status of air quality of Delhi during four years between 2016 and 2019.As per the presentation, the quality of Delhi air was good for only four days during this period and was very poor for 319 days.And the quality of air in Delhi was severe for 78 days.Delhi’s air quality on Thursday dropped to its worst level since December 2019 with farm fires accounting for 42% of its pollution, the maximum this season so far, according to data from central government agencies.Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions -- calm winds and low temperatures -- and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states led to a dense layer of haze on Wednesday night as the air quality index entered the ‘severe’ category.The haze thinned on Thursday with higher wind speed helping in dispersion of pollutants. However, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 450, the highest since December 30 last year, when it was 446.All the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded air quality in the ‘severe’ category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Noida also recorded ‘severe’ air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-may-lead-to-faster-spread-of-covid-19-infections-officials-tell-parliamentary-panel/story-cm2iBPo13QP3tsyLpVu9IJ.html
07-11-2020||India||Panel to tackle pollution set up as air still ‘severe’||The Union environment ministry has constituted the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas, picking former Delhi chief secretary MM Kutty as its chairperson, even as the Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to ensure there was no smog in the national capital region amid sliding air quality.Besides Kutty, who is a former secretary of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, professor Mukesh Khare, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, and Ramesh KJ, ex-director general, India Meteorological Department (IMD), were appointed as full-time technical members of the commission, according to a notification issued on Thursday.On October 29, the Union government issued an ordinance and put in place the new anti-pollution agency with sweeping powers spanning five northern states where it will monitor and act against sources of air pollution. The panel has replaced all ad hoc committees and bodies created under court orders, including the SC-appointed environment pollution control authority (Epca).In the Supreme Court on Thursday, a bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian posted petitions related to air pollution for hearing after the Diwali vacation. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, informed the bench that the new commission will begin functioning from Friday after the government appointed its members.“The only thing is that you ensure that there is no smog in the city. We are not concerned with commission. There are many commissions and many brains are working but just ensure that there is no smog in the city,” the bench said. Mehta replied that government is taking all efforts on war footing.Six full-time members of the commission took charge on Friday, a day after the air quality index stood at 450 in the “severe” category, the season’s worst so far. A layer of smog blanketed the Capital on Friday, too, with the average AQI over the previous 24 hours at 406 in the “severe” category.Experts said that a delay in the commission’s functioning at this crucial juncture, when the air quality starts sliding with the approaching winter, could hamper the efforts of control air pollution ahead of Diwali. Over the recent years, illegal use of firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR region has resulted in worsening of the situation, with toxic fumes engulfing the region. On Thursday, in exercise of its powers under the ordinance, a selection panel under Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar’s chairmanship selected Kutty.The selection panel, which also comprised Union ministers Piyush Goyal, Nitin Gadkari and Harsh Vardhan, and cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, named Arvind Kumar Nautiyal, joint secretary, environment ministry, as the commission’s full-time member. While Khare and Ramesh will be the agency’s full-time technical members, Ajay Mathur, the director-general of The Energy and Resources Institute, and Ashish Dhawan of Air Pollution Action Group, have been selected as the commission’s non-government members. Respective state governments and ministries will appoint the rest of the agency’s nine ex-officio members.The rules for the commission’s functioning were yet to be formulated but two full-time members, Kutty and Nautiyal, met RP Gupta, secretary, environment ministry, to discuss when they could start functioning.“We are working on it. The members take charge immediately but I am not sure when they will have their first meeting. Other members will have to be also selected and take charge,” said Ravi Agrawal, special secretary, environment ministry.The ordinance empowers the agency to make rules, set emission standards, and slap fines of up to ₹1 crore or imprison violators for up to five years. As per the ordinance, Kutty will have a term of three years from the date he takes charge or until he is 70 years of age.Nautiyal did not respond to HT’s calls or messages through the day. Mathur said: “We have spoken to each other several times since morning and I think we will be meeting very soon. The selection happened suddenly so members will have to rework their regular schedule to get completely involved in the commission,” he said.Khare said: “I have received the notification this morning, it is too early to say anything now. Once a plan is ready we will communicate our next step.”As per the ordinance, the members of the agency have to be drawn from Union ministries, departments, non-governmental organisations and the five states of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.“We all know what needs to be done. But the scale of action will be very important. The commission will have to take deep, multisector action for the entire region. For example, all power plants will have to meet the new emission standards; all industries will have to move to clean fuel; proper waste management infrastructure needs to be put in place and a strategy for regional public transit will be crucial. The commission will have to have a very strong compliance strategy,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.While welcoming the formation of the commission, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said he hoped that the new commission will swiftly act on the rising cases of stubble burning instances in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana.“We have been seeing the effectiveness of the Pusa bio-decomposer, which melts the stubble in fields and converts it into manure. We hope that the new commission sees this cost-effective solution and directs the governments of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to make use of this solution so that Delhi does not continue to suffer on its account year after year,” Rai said.Expressing concern over poor air quality in north India, especially in the national Capital, Javadekar said the government will encourage all possible technological interventions to mitigate pollution. “The central government has been working constantly on all the fronts towards mitigation of air pollution. The government is working towards abatement of air pollution by working at the source level, be it industries or thermal power stations, vehicular pollution, construction and demolition waste or stubble burning, which are the major sources of pollution generation,” he added.An official of the Delhi government’s environment ministry said on condition of anonymity that the appointment of the commission happened at a crucial stage when the air quality levels in the city were already showing a declining trend. The official said the commission will help in better coordination between states in tackling the problem.“The problem in Delhi is that a lot of things are not in the state government’s complete control. The task of coordination used to happen better with Epca, but now we hope the commission will take on this role,” a senior Delhi government official said, asking not to be named.Farm fires are likely to be one of the focus areas of the new commission. It will have the powers to issue directions, entertain complaints; regulate and prohibit activities that are likely to cause or increase air pollution, lay down parameters and standards; restrict industry activities, processes; and direct the closure, or prohibit any polluting activity in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-to-tackle-pollution-set-up-as-air-still-severe/story-q3F79e8qMkabomYaFvUewM.html
07-11-2020||India||Baba ka Dhaba row: Case of cheating filed against YouTube ‘influencer’||Delhi Police on Friday registered a case of cheating against YouTube “influencer”, Gaurav Wasan, after conducting a preliminary enquiry into a complaint of alleged misappropriation of funds filed by an elderly man who runs a roadside eatery, Baba ka Dhaba, in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar. The eatery, Baba ka Dhaba, run by Prasad, shot to fame last month after Wasan highlighted how Prasad could run out of business because his customers were staying away due to the coronavirus disease. A first information report (FIR) was registered under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code against Wasan at the Malviya Nagar police station. The police’s initial probe and examination of the transactions of Wasan and his family members revealed that he had cheated the elderly man, Kanta Prasad, of more than R4 lakh, a senior police officer privy to the development in the case said, requesting anonymity. “We have registered a cheating case against Wasan. He will soon be served a notice, asking him to join the probe,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur. Wasan did not respond to calls and text messages seeking his response. Prasad could not be reached for his comment, as calls made to him went unanswered. An 11-minute YouTube video blog, posted on October 7, detailed how Prasad and his wife, Badami Devi, both apparently in their eighties, were in dire straits outside their tiny eatery in Malviya Nagar. On October 31, DCP Thakur said, Prasad filed a complaint regarding cheating and fraud against Wasan. He alleged that Wasan had approached him and shot a video with him to help/promote his business (Baba ka Dhaba). Wasan posted the video on social media through his account namely “Swad Official” and requested the public to donate money to financially help Prasad, said Thakur. “The said video went viral and as per the complainant, the alleged Gaurav Wasan deliberately shared only his and his family members’ bank details and mobile number for donation. Wasan collected a huge amount through donation and later cheated the complainant (Prasad),” said the DCP. Wasan’s video on his YouTube page was widely circulated, leading to 3 million views and drawing thousands of Delhi residents, and some celebrities, to Prasad’s shop to buy food and take selfies. A month later, the crowds outside Baba Ka Dhaba have vanished. The allegations of misappropriation of funds were first made by a bunch of other users on YouTube, who made videos to allege that Wasan conned the elderly couple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baba-ka-dhaba-row-case-of-cheating-filed-against-youtube-influencer/story-av2Zp125n2QCTLAezg8nzN.html

In his petition, Rameshwar claimed that Surchandra has failed to disclose full particulars of his assets and liabilities including those of his dependants and also concealed vital material information in his election affidavits.During the then scrutiny of nomination papers on February 17, 2017, the petitioner and his election agents raised objections, but the returning officer accepted the nomination of Surchandra and allowed him to contest the election, the petition said.Surchandra, 65, contested the election as congress candidate and was declared the MLA from Kakching constituency after winning the seat with 11133 votes while Rameshwar got 10,503 votes.Reacting to the court verdict, Rameshwar said, “I feel good because the judgment shows that no one is above the law of the land.”It may be mentioned that Surchandra who had served as a congress MLA allegedly joined the BJP leading to his disqualification under the Tenth Schedule of the constitution as an elected Member ahead of the Rajya Sabha election in June this year. Since then, the seat for Kakching Assembly Constituency had been lying vacant in the 11th Manipur Legislative Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-scraps-mla-s-election-over-non-dislcosure-of-info-in-poll-affidavit/story-Ekqt6d6INEdPbK9VEOn9TK.html
