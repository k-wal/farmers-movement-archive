02-11-2020||News||This is definitely not the 1991 moment for agriculture, writes Capt Amarinder Singh||We, in Punjab, are in the midst of two major crises today. The Covid-19 pandemic remains an ongoing threat, while the farm laws imposed on us unilaterally, and in the most undemocratic manner, by the Government of India have compounded the distress of our people. Anyone who believes that the farmers are braving the pandemic without understanding the implications of the central laws is either unaware of the ground realities or ignorant about the depth of understanding farmers have about the whole business of agriculture. (I am calling it a business because that is how the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its corporate coterie are looking at agriculture now).The laws are clearly designed to destroy the mandi system in favour of a select few corporates, and eventually, to destroy the minimum support price (MSP) regime as well as the Food Corporation of India (FCI), and hand over the procurement metrics to these corporates. In short, they will eliminate the entire time-tested chain of marketing, pivotal to the growth of agriculture. And once the produce is out of the hands of the government and in control of corporates, one can only imagine the fate of the food subsidy on which millions of India’s poor subsist today.The proponents of the farm laws accuse Punjab of being unreasonable and politically-motivated. It’s a different matter that not one central leader bothered to explain at any forum, including Parliament, how these laws will benefit the farmers and agriculture, before pushing them forward. This is patently evident from the fact that BJP leaders are now asking their workers in Punjab to go around villages and persuade the farmers of the “invisible” benefits of the laws. Had that exercise been done earlier, and the farmers been convinced of the need for the farm sector reforms, the situation might not have come to such a pass. As for allegations of political motivation against us, one wonders why, in that case, some of the BJP’s own leaders in Punjab have resigned in recent days in protest against the central legislations?Some have called the laws as agricultural reforms at par with the 1991 economic reforms that catapulted India to the status of a global economic giant. Nothing can be more untrue or unpalatable.First, did the then government under Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, supported by Manmohan Singh as finance minister, completely dismantle the existing system or make everything completely unregulated? No. What they did was replace the existing licence raj with a more transparent and autonomous regulatory system and regime, in which the regulators were expected to follow a clear economic logic in a fair and impartial manner. And mind you, politicisation was checked, not encouraged in the new system as part of those reforms. Second, the reforms back then were an outcome of the prevailing situation where the country was gripped by high inflation and tax rates, lack of resources, depleted foreign exchange reserves, and was getting rapidly left behind in the global economic progress chart.Contrast this with the present so-called reforms in agriculture. Whichever way you look at them, the fact is that they will open up agriculture to completely unregulated markets, which even the World Trade Organization (WTO) has not been able to achieve for agriculture. They also completely ignore the fact that the market is imperfect in the case of small and local agricultural operations, which necessitates some protection and support for small and marginal farmers, without whom India’s dream of self-sufficiency in food grains would have forever remained an elusive one.And finally, I would like to ask , what was the need for doing away with a successful and established system for a new one at this juncture? Unlike 1991, there was no compelling pressure in the present instance which would explain the haste with which the Centre brought in these laws amid the pandemic. One would have, in fact, thought that given the Covid-19 crisis, the Centre would have felt the need to buy and stock more food grains to ensure food security for the poor.There are many who counter our stand of these laws being anti-federal in nature by pointing to the concurrent nature of various facets of the agricultural marketing system, particularly trading of produce. While what does or does not constitute Concurrent List as per the Constitution might be a subject of judicial scrutiny, does the Concurrent List justify any action on the part of any government (Centre or state) to take decision/action detrimental to the welfare of any section of the society? I do not believe so, and sincerely hope the Centre does not either. Because if that happens, the constitutional ethos as we know it will be destroyed completely. Which probably explains why states, whichever political party may be in power, do not always agree with laws enacted by the Centre under the Concurrent List and exercise their powers under Article 254 (ii) to protect their rights. This was, in fact, done in the case of the Land Acquisition Act, 2015, which BJP-ruled states had then sought to negate through their own bills. Incidentally, these bills received the assent of the then President too, though their ultimate fate rests now with the judiciary.I do hope the bills passed recently in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha will not only receive Presidential assent but also stand judicial scrutiny to protect the legitimate rights of our farmers. However, since that could well be a long-drawn-out process, I hope and pray that the Government of India will set aside its ego to pull the farming community back from the brink of extinction. And I do hope they will do so before divisive forces succeed in taking control of the passions of our anguished farmers to polarise our society irrevocably, and throw our country into a vicious cycle of violence and counter-violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/this-is-definitely-not-the-1991-moment-for-agriculture-writes-capt-amarinder-singh/story-o27hI1kerDDoMQL8NUMNPN.html
02-11-2020||News||2020 marks the arrival of the Indian-American voter | Opinion||The 2020 United States (US) election has seen the four-million-strong Indian-American community come of age politically and put them on the US’s political map. What will a great night for the community on November 3 look like?For Democrats all over the country, a Joe Biden-Kamala Harris victory, which would catapult one of their own to the second-most powerful position in the land, will make it truly historic. Victory for Senate-hopeful Sara Gideon in Maine, and two congressional candidates, Sri Kulkarni in Texas 22nd district and Hiral Tipirneni in Arizona’s 6th district, would be icing on the cake. That would expand the size of the so-called Samosa Caucus, the Indian-American congressional delegation, from five to seven.Indian-Americans have been aggressively courted by both campaigns for votes and campaign money. One reason for that is the sizeable presence of the community in many swing states and its affluence. Donald Trump’s combined margin in 2016 in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin was fewer than 78,000 votes.This year, in Pennsylvania — which he won with less than 45,000 votes — there are 61,000 Indian-American voters. Michigan, where Trump’s margin was 10,794, has 45,000 Indian-American voters. In Texas, the largest red state in the country, which also appears to be in play, there are more than 200,000 eligible Indian-American voters. Similarly, Florida has 87,000 Indian-American voters.It’s not just their numbers; the community is also heavily engaged in politics, topping other Asian-American groups, both in voter registration and campaign donations. According to AAPI Data, which publishes demographic data and policy research on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, nearly 90% of eligible Indian-Americans are registered to vote, higher than the US population in general. While the community lags behind White and Black Americans in donations, it leads in campaign donations among Asian-American communities.That is the reason that Trump invested in the community, which has traditionally been part of the Democratic coalition. He appeared in two public rallies with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in Houston and Ahmedabad.Democrats, for their part, did not take Indian-Americans for granted and reached out to them in a range of ways, including ad campaigns and a personalised op-ed by Biden.Where does the community stand? In recent years, there has been a lot of speculation about whether the community has gravitated toward GOP because of Trump’s ties with Modi. Some have touted unscientific polls conducted by partisan GOP activists to claim that a significant section of the community has shifted its loyalty to the Republican Party. But two reputable surveys, released in recent weeks, contradict these proclamations.The first survey conducted by AAPI Data, disclosed that nearly half of the Indian-American population (48%) identify themselves as Democrats, while 22% of the community identify as Republicans. It also found that two-thirds of Indian-Americans planned to vote for Biden, and 28% intended to vote for Trump. An Indian American Attitudes Survey conducted by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Johns Hopkins University and University of Pennsylvania, in partnership with the polling firm YouGov affirmed the results of the AAPI Data study. This survey, released on October 14, found that 72% of registered voters from the community plan to vote for Biden, while 22% intend to vote for Trump.The YouGov survey found that Trump’s friendship with Modi and the India-US relationship, are not decisive enough issues for Indian-American voters. Another fascinating fact that this survey revealed was that second-generation Indian-Americans, like the broader American population, hold more liberal views and care deeply about the environment and racial justice.Irrespective of who wins, Indian-Americans will be winners. November 3 will mark their arrival as major players, contributors and indeed, as citizens, in the political arena of the world’s second-largest democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/2020-marks-the-arrival-of-the-indian-american-voter-opinion/story-8YpYBc4rQE9q2wp8Q9zJzH.html

02-11-2020||Chandigarh||Cong MPs in Punjab seek time to meet PM, ministers over freight trains, RDF||Congress Lok Sabha MPs from Punjab on Monday decided to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and some central ministers over the suspension of freight trains and rural development fee (RDF) to the state. The Congress MPs, who held a meeting in New Delhi, have sought time to meet the PM, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and railway minister Piyush Goyal to take up the problems being faced by the state. Fatehgarh Sahib MP Dr Amar Singh said the suspension of goods trains has severely hit the supply of coal, urea, DAP and other essential items. “The farmer unions have vacated the rail tracks and there is no train blockade in the state. They are just using it as an excuse to suspend goods trains. We will take up all these issues,” he said after the meeting, accusing the BJP of playing politics. Singh said they are hopeful of getting time from the Prime Minister and central ministers. The Centre had suspended freight trains to Punjab, citing sporadic obstruction of tracks by the protesting farmers at several places. Goyal also sought an assurance from the state government for the safety of trains and their crew members to restore freight services. Of the eight Congress MPs, seven, including Jasbir Singh Gill, Santokh Singh Chaudhary, Gurjeet Singh Aujla and Mohammad Sadique, attended the meeting. “Patiala MP Preneet Kaur was on her way but could not reach in time. We will all go together to meet the PM and ministers,” one of them said. Last week, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had also sought time to meet President Ram Nath Kovind to request him to accord speedy assent to the bills passed by the state assembly to amend the newly enacted agriculture reforms laws. He had also requested the MLAs of all parties to accompany. However, the state government is still to get any confirmation from the President’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-mps-in-punjab-seek-time-to-meet-pm-ministers-over-freight-trains-rdf/story-6Fm5iBrgCVAIEDzCLEzj7I.html
02-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Two weeks into opening, movie halls yet to see encouraging footfalls||NOIDA: It has been two weeks since movie theatres in Noida district threw doors open to audiences, after a gap of almost seven months, but footfall is yet to pick up pace.Movie theatres and multiplexes were shut, along with most commercial and entertainment activities in the country from March 25 due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. Now in the unlock mode, several activities have opened up but footfall has failed to regain its previous strength due to fears of contracting the Sars-Cov-2.The Uttar Pradesh government had granted permission to theatres to screen movies from October 16.An official of the Noida’s Great India Place mall, one of the largest commercial centres in the National Capital Region, said that taking serious note of the lukewarm response from audiences, movies are being screened in only two auditoriums out of the six. “Though footfall increased a bit last weekend, it was not more than 60 to 70 people per show. Despite regular sanitisation and maintaining social distancing, people are not very comfortable visiting theatres during this pandemic time. We hope that turnout will increase when new films are released, in the last week of this month,” the official said, requesting not to be named. A drop in the number of movies being screened has been ordered so that there is sufficient time between movies to clean, sanitise and disinfect the theatres with Ultraviolet-C for the next batch of audience. It results in increasing the turnaround time from 10 minutes to 45 minutes. To avoid overcrowding, show timings have been planned in a systematic manner so that no two films start and end at the same time. On an average, a medium sized theatre can seat up to 120 people, but since seating plans have been allowed in a chessboard fashion, so as to allow social distancing, such a theatre can accommodate only up to half the capacity, or say, 60 people. Large theatres, however, can seat about 500 people or more. The initial response of patrons was very thin, with less than a total of 100 people going to movie halls in the first week after theatres had opened up in the district, against the capacity of over 3,000 permitted seats.Angad Makan, a spokesperson of Logix mall, located in Noida’s Sector 38, said that despite running five auditoriums, the turnout is meagre. “Before the lockdown, at least 10,000 people used to visit the multiplex in a single day, which has now reduced to less than 500. We are waiting for new releases to come now,” he said.JP Chandra, the Gautam Budh Nagar entertainment tax officer, concurred, stating: “While several theatres in Noida, Greater Noida, Dankaur and Jewar have not opened yet, footfall in those which have opened is less than about 10% as a whole. Many owners say they have not opened theatre yet as they are waiting for new releases to draw in customers,” he said.He added that despite being granted permission, some multiplexes have not opened as the shops of the malls, in which the halls are located, are still closed. “According to our records, movie halls in Gautam Budh Nagar have so far incurred business of around 5% in the last 15 days, as compared to the same span of time last year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-two-weeks-into-opening-movie-halls-yet-to-see-encouraging-footfalls/story-pA16s21C1eyIdilH8DFnFJ.html
02-11-2020||City||Thane pipeline ruptures twice in one day; MIDC announces 24-hour water cuts||A water pipeline in Shilphata, Thane, burst twice on Monday, leading to waterlogging in the area. Commuters travelling along the Kalyan-Shilphata route faced traffic snarls around 7pm, with major congestion from Kalsekar Hospital in Mumbra to Khidkali temple, and along the Shilphata-Mahape route. The traffic jam extended till late on Monday night, even after the water receded. The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) pipe, which supplies water to Diva, Mumbra, Kalwa and Thane, burst twice on Monday, leading to water cuts for the next 24 hours in these areas. The pipeline first burst around 1am and was repaired within 12 hours. A second rupture occurred around 7pm. This is the second time in a month that the same pipeline was damaged. A similar incident took place in the first week of October. “We informed MIDC about both the bursts immediately, and repair work has begun after the evening incident. Areas like Mumbra, Kalwa, certain parts of Thane and Dombivli will be affected for over 24 hours. The flow of water will be at low pressure for the next two days,” said Santosh Kadam, chief, regional disaster management cell, Thane district. A senior MIDC official said that the ruptures occurred due to the age of the pipeline. “The pipeline is very old hence such incidents occur time and again. These pipelines supply water to Thane on high pressure. The pipeline burst earlier in the day must have caused pressure elsewhere. Both incidents occurred just a few metres apart near Khidkali temple,” said the official. Shilphata road regularly witnesses heavy traffic jams during peak hours. However, Monday’s incident proved to be a nightmare for commuters. “We do face traffic woes regularly on this stretch, but on Monday we had to drive through ankle-deep water due to the pipeline burst. The traffic was moving at snail’s pace,” said Sudhir Ghosh, 46, a resident of Dombivli. Sachin Gawde, traffic police inspector, said, “We had our staff on the spot to regulate traffic, and the water flow has receded.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-pipeline-ruptures-twice-in-one-day-midc-announces-24-hour-water-cuts/story-gbbA9RlCnpiNAu1XqqCemM.html

02-11-2020||Chandigarh||Delimitation of Mohali municipal wards: High court puts administration, Punjab government on notice||The Punjab and Haryana high court has put Punjab government and Mohali administration on notice on a plea seeking quashing of delimitation of wards carried out for the municipal corporation of Mohali.As per the SAD and BJP councillors, 70% seats held by them in the previous Mohali municipal corporation house have either been re-carved, reserved or de-reserved to their detriment. The five-year term of the house ended on April 26 this year. Among the 50 wards, 25 have been reserved for women, besides five for scheduled castes (including two for women) and two for backward classes (men). As many as 23 of 33 wards previously held by the SAD and the BJP have been affected, while wards of only two former Congress councillors have been converted into general category and the remaining 13 have been left untouched. The MC was led by Kulwant Singh of the SAD. “The high court has sought response from various respondents by January 6 and also asked why notification should not be stayed,” senior advocate Vikas Bahl, who appeared for these councillors said. The plea filed by five former councillors seeks quashing of July 31 notification vide which delimitation board was constituted and subsequent developments of re-carving of wards and notification on the same issued on October 28. It has been alleged that mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor were not made members of the board and no elected councillor was associated with the board as mandated. Two nominated members, who were made members of the board, are affiliated with the Congress, which is in power in the state and no member from other political parties was associated with the exercise. One of the nominated members chosen to be part of the board is facing a trial in a murder case, the court was informed, seeking quashing of board’s constitution and subsequent proceedings. The plea also says that on March 23, even as MC’s term had not elapsed, the government asked the municipal commissioner to discharge functions of the MC for which there were no compelling circumstances. The plea also demanded that objections submitted by them should be considered by the delimitation board before finalising the boundaries of the wards. In August, the high court had restrained the government from carrying out the final notification of wards of Zirakpur municipal council. The plea there too was on the violation of norms in constitution of the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delimitation-of-mohali-municipal-wards-high-court-puts-administration-punjab-government-on-notice/story-IWTpEVs4zViUZQjTbIBG6M.html
02-11-2020||City||Farmers blocking 7 Reliance trucks from entering Amritsar||Over 50 farmers agitating against the three Central farm laws have refused to allow seven trucks carrying products of the Reliance Group to pass through the toll plaza on the national highway-1 at Manawala village and enter the holy city, since stopping the consignment on Saturday evening. The trucks are transporting essential goods and processed food items for stores and malls in Amritsar. Farmers have taken the trucks in their custody, as their protest is also against the entry of corporate entities in the field of agriculture, that the Central laws facilitate. The driver, cleaner etc of the trucks are being taken care of by the farmers. Police are yet to intervene.  On Monday, representatives of the company arrived at the spot to negotiate, but farmers did not even meet them. “We will not free these trucks, till the company does not give us in writing that it will never deliver its goods in Amritsar in future,” said Dilbag Singh, of the Azad Kisan Sangharsh Committee, which has been on dharna at the toll plaza for past 25 days.A delegation of farmers from the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee will meet Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda at Kisan Bhawan in Chandigarh at 11am on Tuesday to discuss the constitutional validity of the bills that a special session of the state assembly passed to counter the Centre’s laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-blocking-7-reliance-trucks-from-entering-amritsar/story-qaIkjhgvFFm841KbDUzwgI.html
02-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government may reimburse fees to medical students from Maratha community in absence of reservation||Under pressure from the Maratha community over reservation to the community, the state government is now considering reimbursement of fees to the Maratha students who have applied for medical courses, to extend them the financial benefits they would have got under the quota. The state government also approached the Supreme Court again on Tuesday requesting it for the formation of the constitutional bench to hear the reservation petition.After the three-judge bench of the Apex court stayed the reservation in jobs and education to the Maratha community under The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act 2018, on September 9, the state government has stalled the college admissions process. Though the decision over the vacation of the stay was expected on October 27, the court adjourned the hearing for four more weeks. This has led to the unrest among the students and their parents, with other communities demanding to not delay the admissions for the Maratha community. The state government is now considering to resume the college admissions process by finding ways to safeguard the interest of the Maratha community. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh on Monday said that his department will move a proposal before the state cabinet for reimbursing the fees paid by the students from the community for the medical courses. Deshmukh said, “The final decision will be taken by chief minister Uddhavji Thackeray after discussing it in the cabinet. We will ensure that Maratha community students do not suffer,” he said. “Under the quota, the students with family income less than ₹8 lakh to get a 50% waiver in their fees of professional courses. The benefit will be given to the Maratha students by checking legal and financial repercussions.”The option was discussed during the state cabinet meeting on Thursday. “We were tapping the option of going ahead to accord the benefit of quota to the students who had completed the formalities in the first round of first-year junior college admissions, as the round had been completed before the reservation was stayed. However, the law and judiciary department has objected to it citing that it would be against the court ruling. We are now looking at other ways out to resume the admission process by ensuring the reservation benefits for the community until the court verdict does not come. The reimbursement of the fees to the students enrolling themselves for MBBS will be one of the steps. Similarly, reimbursement was done by previous Fadnavis government when enactment of the Act had got delayed,” said another minister requesting anonymity.The state government is expected to decide on resuming the admissions at the earliest.Meanwhile, Ashok Chavan, public works department minister and head of the cabinet subcommittee on Maratha reservation, said on Monday that the Chief Justice of India has hinted that the formation of the constitution bench will be done soon. The state government, again on Monday, moved the SC with an application requesting it to form the constitution bench at the earliest. The state had earlier on two occasions made similar applications. The three-judge bench, while initiating the stay on the reservation, had referred the hearing to the constitution bench on September 9. During the hearing on the vacation of the stay on October 27, the state government had requested to hold it before the constitution bench. Chavan said that a few political parties were trying to create tension between Marathas and Other Backward Classes and it was unfortunate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-may-reimburse-fees-to-medical-students-from-maratha-community-in-absence-of-reservation/story-MML2tAl14y68mx0Q2KjUSP.html

The accused was lured by his girlfriend, also one of the accused, who set a trap for him to meet her at Vasai. The other members of her family, including her father, uncle and aunt, forced her into a car and took him to an unknown spot, locked him in a room and demanded a ransom of ₹4 lakh from the man’s family. The victim was also allegedly assaulted by the accused. The man, Abhishek Pradeep Gupta, works in a call centre in a well-known IT park in Wagale Estate, Thane (West). On Saturday, around 3.15pm, Gupta received a call from Nargis Shaikh, his girlfriend, to meet her near a Dhaba in Vasai. A police officer said, “Shaikh and Gupta both hail from Uttar Pradesh. Since Gupta was in a relationship with Shaikh, he did not see the trap, He reached the spot to meet her.” There he saw few unknown persons, whom he claimed forcefully made him sit in their SUV. The accused identified as Mohammed Javed alias Nanne Madat Ali Shaikh 40, Mohammed Parvez Abdul Rehman Shaikh 29, Sabina Parvez Shaikh 31, Nargiz Shaikh 20, Amit Pirdhankar 28, Arun Panikar 24 and Lokesh Pujari 24 are all residence of Virar.

Javed, Nargis’s father, then asked Gupta to call his brother and demand ₹4 lakh. He also threatened to kill him if he did not give them the money.” Accordingly, Gupta’s brother was called at the Virar flat of the girl’s Uncle Parvez and aunt Sabina. The police during an investigation found Nargis and her family hails from Varanasi and came to Mumbai a few years ago. The police suspect his father wanted to get Nargis married and needed cash.

02-11-2020||Gurugram||Fire at electrical store put out after 3 hours||A massive fire broke out at a furniture and electrical store in Wazirabad village in Sector 52 on Monday evening. The store was completely gutted in the incident and it took 15 fire tenders three hours to douse the fire.The flames from the spot also reached a two-storey building located behind the store. However, fire department officials managed to douse it quickly, as occupants were evacuated and flammable objects, such as LPG cylinders, were removed from the building.No injuries were reported in the incident.Satyawan Samriwal, assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO), said that the fire headquarters in Sector 29 received a call about the fire at 7.06pm.“Initially, four fire tenders were spent to the spot. Soon, the firemen informed us that the fire was getting out of control and we sent two fire tenders from each of our five fire stations, along with two fire tenders from DLF fire services, as a precautionary measure,” said Samriwal.Samriwal said that the fire broke out in a one-storey store which repaired air conditioners and fridges, and also rented out furniture to people living in the neighbourhood.He said that the store shared a boundary wall with a one-storey automobile service centre. However, the flames did not reach there. “While we were able to prevent the fire from spreading to the automobile store, flames managed to reach a two-storey residential building located behind the store. Only the windows of the third-floor caught fire and we were able to douse the same immediately. The occupants, flammable and valuable items had been removed much earlier as a precautionary measure,” said Samriwal.He said that the fire was completely doused by 10.30pm. However, the store was completely gutted.“The store was illegal and hence, it did not have a valid no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department. We suspect a short circuit in the electrical unit of the store as the main cause of the fire. We have kept a fire tender from Sector 29 fire station at the spot, as a precautionary measure,” said Samriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fire-at-electrical-store-put-out-after-3-hours/story-ip4yeYzOaoYNyNWzafz4GJ.html

Sanjay Mahajan, administrator, SSVSS’s Navi Mumbai branch, said, “Our school caters to students from the lower-income group. Most of them do not have access to the internet or smartphones. Throughout the lockdown, we have not been able to conduct full-fledged online classes. As many parents were worried about their children’s future, we held a meeting to discuss the same in school. We had sent out a message that clearly said that the meeting was regarding starting online classes accessible for all. However, the message was misinterpreted and forwarded by some miscreants.”The message that was shared to most parents in English said, “As a concern of your pupil’s education, the school authorities are likely to take brave steps towards the same. We are going to re-open our school from Tuesday onwards. For that, we need to discuss some important points. For the same reason, we are going to conduct a parents’ meeting on Monday.”Govind More, a parent of an eight-year-old student of the Navi Mumbai High School, said, “We do not know to read English and were shocked with such a message. We approached those who understood the language to elaborate on the agenda. However, when we reached the school on Monday, the meeting was just to assure us of how teachers would help students without access to technology to cope up with academics.”Meanwhile, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s education department has warned schools to maintain social distancing norms within their premises and avoid calling parents in large numbers to the school.“There are no guidelines to start school yet and we are keeping a strict watch on all schools within our jurisdiction to ensure lockdown norms are followed,” said a senior official from NMMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/message-from-navi-mumbai-school-about-reopening-sends-parents-in-a-frenzy/story-A4kkQ6bhVumkhUFY5wjBLO.html
02-11-2020||City||1,000 Mohali women awaiting government’s wedding shagun are now nursing babies||Of 1,425 newly married women in Mohali district awaiting the release of ₹21,000 under the government’s Shagun (now called Aashirwad) scheme for more than a year, 1,000 have already been blessed with children. Under the Aashirwad scheme, the state government promises to provide financial assistance for the marriage of a woman belonging to scheduled caste, backward class or economically weaker section of society. The amount is transferred directly to the bank account of either beneficiary or her family. The state government has not disbursed the amount after April 2019 for the backward class beneficiaries, while those belonging to the scheduled castes haven’t received the money since October last year. The Congress government had started the scheme in 2005 and in the run up to the 2017 assembly elections, it had promised to increase the amount from ₹15,000 to ₹51,000. In July that year, the state government had announced that it will revise the aid to ₹21,000.Mohali district welfare officer Ravinder Singh said there were at least 1,425 pending cases. “Out of them, 1,093 women are awaiting the compensation since April last year and 332 cases are from this year. We have sent the entire list of eligible people to the higher authorities, but are still waiting for the funds,” he added.One such beneficiary from Lalru, who wished not to be named, said, “I got married in October last year. Before my marriage, my father had applied for the grant, but even after one year, we have not got anything and now I am even blessed with a baby boy. My family had been making rounds of the district welfare office in Mohali, but in vain.”Punjab social justice and empowerment director Malwinder Singh Jaggi said, “I have recently joined the office, but lists of eligible beneficiaries have already been prepared and sent to the treasury. We are hopeful that money will be released by the end of November.”SR Ladhar, former IAS and in-charge of an NGO, Phule Ambedkari Gauravshali Aur Adarshwadi Muhim ( PAGAAM), said, “It is unfortunate that the government is deliberately discriminating against backward class people. We request the state government to release the grant under the scheme so that the poor might get some financial relief.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-000-mohali-women-awaiting-government-s-wedding-shagun-are-now-nursing-babies/story-631azgjVGmmit7ShuyDkuO.html
02-11-2020||Mumbai||ECI declares polls on five MLC seats on December 1; Maharashtra CM yet to send 12 names to Governor||The Election Commission of India on Monday declared elections for five seats of the state legislative council on December 1. The seats got vacant on July 19 and are from graduates and teachers constituencies. Last date for filing of nominations is November 12 and nomination papers can be withdrawn by November 17, states the notification issued by ECI on Monday.Three MLCs from graduates constituencies — Satish Chavan (NCP), Chandrakant Patil (BJP) and Anil Sole (BJP) while two MLCs from teachers constituencies — Shrikant Deshpande (Independent) and Dattratray Sawant (Independent) retired on July 19. The election commission could not hold polls in the last four months due to the coronavirus pandemic.The election commission has also issued broad guidelines for the election process to ensure basic precautionary measures are followed. It has mandated every person to wear a mask during the poll process and follow social distancing norms. It has directed thermal screening of all persons at the premises where polling is going to take place, apart from making available sanitisers. Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is yet to send names of 12 nominees to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for appointing them as Governor nominated members to the legislative council. The state cabinet on Wednesday authorized the chief minister to send the names.The term of 12 legislators nominated to the Upper house from the governor’s quota had expired in June. The seats are vacant since then as the state has not made any recommendation to the Governor. All the three ruling parties — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — have decided to share an equal number of seats — four — and are supposed to give their names to the chief minister.State rural development minister Hasan Mushrif on Monday alleged that the governor has planned to delay the appointment of MLCs and the same was revealed by state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil in an interaction with former minister Vinay Kore in Kolhapur recently. “A discussion over appointment of 12 MLCs took place between the governor and Devendraji (leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis) and it was decided that the list will be kept aside. Patil said this in an interaction with Kore and others in Kolhapur,” Mushrif said. Former BJP minister Girish Mahajan clarified that the decision needs to be taken by the Governor and BJP has nothing to do with it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/eci-declares-polls-on-five-mlc-seats-on-december-1-maharashtra-cm-yet-to-send-12-names-to-governor/story-cEbAun87mTBR2vEBzQxlQL.html

02-11-2020||Mumbai||Deposit amount equivalent to losses to MMRDA for stay on tree felling on Mumbai Metro 4 line: Bombay HC to petitioner||In a setback to an NGO which had approached the Bombay high court seeking a stay on the permission granted by the Thane Tree Authority to Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), to cut over 500 trees for the Metro 4 project, the HC asked the NGO to deposit the amount equivalent to the losses MMRDA would incur in the event of a stay. The NGO has withdrawn the stay application. The court has granted the NGO permission to file a fresh petition seeking similar reliefs, however, in the absence of any stay, MMRDA will be free to go ahead with cutting the trees.A division bench of justices KK Tated and GS Kulkarni while hearing the petition filed by Thane Nagrik Pratishthan, an NGO, was informed by advocate Ankit Kulkarni that an interim application was being moved in the petition that sought the Metro 4 line which will run between Wadala – Ghatkopar- Mulund- Thane- Kasarwadavali to be underground. Kulkarni submitted that the interim application was seeking a stay on cutting of the very trees which were sought to be saved through the original petition. The original petition had prayed for the Metro line to be constructed below the ground as it would save over 500 trees, which would otherwise have to be cut to make way for the elevated line.While making submissions in the interim application on Monday, Kulkarni informed the court that the permission granted by the Thane Tree Authority on September 28, 2020, to MMRDA to cut the 500 plus trees was invalid as it had not followed the stipulated process of having the trees inspected and the order was passed in haste. He submitted that the inspection of trees by experts was mandatory as per the Act and would have a bearing on whether the trees could be transplanted or not, hence in the absence of the inspection, the NGO was seeking a stay on the implementation of the Thane Tree Authority’s order.The interim application further stated that as the original petition on whether the Metro line was to go underground or overground was yet being heard, allowing the cutting of trees would defeat the purpose of the original petition. However, senior counsel Dr Milind Sathe for MMRDA argued that the interim application was not maintainable as the cause of action was different from the original petition and hence the court could not pass any orders. After hearing the submissions, justice Tated told the NGO that it was willing to allow the interim application if the NGO would deposit the amount equivalent to the losses which MMRDA would incur due to the stay on cutting of trees. Justice Kulkarni, however, said that as issues in the interim application and the original petition were different, he suggested that the NGO file a fresh petition with specific averments opposing the Thane Tree Authority’s decision. On being faced with the two options, the NGO decided to withdraw the interim application and file a fresh petition as suggested by the court. However, in the absence of any stay by the court, the MMRDA is in a position to go ahead with the felling of the trees based on the permission by the Thane Tree Authority. Rohit Joshi, co-petitioner opposing tree cutting in Metro 4 project, said, “This is a sensitive issue and the courts have always taken a neutral stand. However we are surprised at the observation made by the court today. We are merely petitioners fighting for larger public interest and asking us to deposit huge amounts is discouraging.”“It is disheartening to see that citizens and activists voicing their concerns through the justice system are deemed to be obstructing public projects. All good democracy functions with checks and balances. However these days the government seems to be reversing all laws to make projects happen without consideration for environmental impact or safety norms; both of which are the central contentions of our main PIL. Public agencies seem to be thinking of these projects as private investments and not public good services. Such actions by Government bodies are setting wrong precedents, paving way for future violations,” Joshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/deposit-amount-equivalent-to-losses-to-mmrda-for-stay-on-tree-felling-on-mumbai-metro-4-line-bombay-hc-to-petitioner/story-ab7yKLXwku9vfkdsipZiwL.html

Day scholars were allowed on campus Monday onwards.The university had also said that the Central library, canteen, and dhabas will remain closed during the two phases of reopening, the first of which began on Monday.The JNU students’ union (JNUSU) objected to the exclusion of non-science students and has been continuing its indefinite protest inside the campus that it began on October 17. JNUSU vice president Saket Moon said, “Before the order, day scholars, who were in Delhi, were already accessing the labs. They are not being allowed since the notice was issued and now only 9B and fourth-year students are being allowed.”The students’ body also protested at the Dean of Students (DoS) office on Monday. “We met the DoS to place our demands and ask him to reopen the mess and dhabas and arrange for a proper phased entry of all students. He said he had put forward the demands of the students but the others in the administration did not agree to it.”While DoS Sudheer Pratap Singh did not respond to requests for comment, JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said the university was following the guidelines put forward by Union ministry of home affairs (MHA).“Since the reopening is happening in a phased manner, in the first phase beginning today, only 200 students will be allowed to enter the campus and they are all day scholars pursuing science courses as final-year PhD students. Deans and chairpersons across schools and centres have submitted the details of their laboratories and how many students can be accommodated while maintaining social distancing and we are following that plan,” Kumar said.He added that students not wearing masks, exhibiting symptoms, or students found to have above-normal temperatures during thermal checks will not be allowed to enter campus. “We are also setting up a Covid-testing camp on the campus for students from Tuesday,” he said.“Since faculty members were accessing the labs in the past few months, we have sanitised all labs and deans and chairpersons have been instructed to follow all guidelines on the matter,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jnu-begins-1st-phase-of-entries-for-phd-day-scholars-in-science-schools/story-92n6le1rujC6E0veUbmyyM.html

The alleged killer lived with his wife and two children. The DCP quoted his family as saying that he was under depression and shared a strained relationship with his wife. “He suspected his wife of being in an extramarital relationship with her relative. That would lead to frequent domestic violence for which he had also been jailed in the past,” said the DCP. The situation escalated a month ago, leading to his wife and their two children leaving for her paternal home in east Delhi’s Welcome. “On Sunday, the man visited his wife at her paternal home. While returning, he asked his wife’s relative (who he suspected of having a relationship with her) to accompany him,” said the DCP. Back home, they drank together, but the drinking session ended in the relationship issue getting raked up. “The suspect went on to strangle his wife’s relative to death,” said the DCP. When the alleged killer’s mother heard the commotion, she ran into his room to find the victim lying motionless and the suspect revealing that he had murdered him, said the DCP. “When his mother tried to separate him from the dying man, the suspect thrashed her. When his brother tried to save their mother, he too was assaulted,” said the DCP. His mother and brother ran into the street to call for help. “But the local residents decided not to intervene as they were aware of his violent nature,” the DCP said. By the time his mother and brother returned home, the alleged killer had hanged himself from a rod using a curtain, the officer said. The alleged killer’s family made a call to the police control room around midnight and the police rushed both the men to a hospital, but they were declared brought dead. The police have registered a murder case at Hauz Qazi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/photographer-kills-man-hangs-himself-in-old-delhi/story-RyOFjgseqsykIzTShJRZDO.html

The woman has been identified as Preeti Dhillon from New Delhi’s Patel Nagar, who claimed to have worked with several multinational companies and spoke fluent English. Preeti told the police that she “took these children along because their parents were not taking care of them”. ACP Noopur Bishnoi said, “This morning, we got information that a woman resembling the abductor was roaming with three children near Nada Sahib gurdwara. Our team rushed to the spot and found her with the missing children.”As per the police, Preeti’s in-laws lived in New Delhi, but for the past six months, she had been roaming in and around Panchkula. “She took refuge in gurdwaras or other shelter homes. She told us that she had a master’s degree in English and experience of having worked with MNCs. It is an unusual case, where a kidnapper is a well-read woman with knowledge of English literature,” the ACP said. The police are now verifying whether she is mentally fit or not. She has been, meanwhile, sent to an Ambala jail under judicial custody.Medical reports of the children are pending, but as per the police, they bear no injury marks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-woman-lands-in-panchkula-police-net-3-abducted-girls-rescued/story-UGEjUaQjiLDxPiLWeXjsyI.html
02-11-2020||City||Cotton arrival in Punjab’s mandis this season double than last season||As the third and final phase of harvesting of cotton balls is gaining momentum in the semi-arid region of Punjab, the arrival in mandis this season is already nearly double when compared with the corresponding period last season.According to the Punjab Mandi Board data till November 2, total 10.92 lakh quintal kharif crop was brought by the farmers to various purchase centres of the cotton-growing belt in south Malwa. For the same period in 2019, the arrival was 5.71 lakh quintals.Sources attribute the major spike in cotton arrival to apprehension that Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) may get out of the market where private buyers are offering much less than the minimum support price (MSP) of ₹5,745/quintal with 8% moisture level. Sources said traditionally farmers used to hold back crop harvested after October 15 for sale in mandis after the paddy harvesting phase.“But the ongoing farmers’ agitation panicked cotton-growers and they rushed to mandis in an unprecedented manner. But the purchase by the central agency is going on smoothly and payments are being released in farmers’ bank accounts within a week,” says a government functionary.Official data says a major chunk of the produce was purchased by the CCI and the private players have bought only 2.36 lakh quintals and nearly 99% of the crop reaching mandis was purchased.CCI assistant general manager and Punjab in-charge Neeraj Kumar on Monday said that a sharp spike of cotton arrival was unexpected. “As it was analysed that private players may hardly play any role in the cotton purchase as the global market was unstable due to Covid-19 outbreak, the CCI made elaborate arrangements to buy the almost entire cotton production. It is probably for the first time after 2008-09 season that this year by October-end, mandis are flooded with cotton,” he said.Sensing high-target of purchase, the CCI increased the number of ginning and pressing mills from 42 in 2019 to 83 this time.“By buying more than 80% of total arrival at the MSP, CCI has rubbished the unfounded speculations that the central agency will back out from the market,” said Kumar.Officials say the surge in cotton arrival may weaken this week as paddy harvesting in the area has entered the last stage and farmers may resume taking cotton to the mandis after Diwali on November 14.Record production unlikelyState cotton coordinator Rajnish Goel said this year, the cotton production may remain on a par with last year’s figure of about 45 lakh quintal.“About 17,000-hectare cotton-growing area in Abohar area of Fazilka district witnessed widespread flooding. Though the extent of crop damage is being assessed, the situation may impact overall production,” he said.Punjab this year had set a record by bringing 5.01 lakh hectares under cotton cultivation, which is the highest since 2010-11 kharif or summer-sown crop season. Following the addition of 25% area under cotton, the state authorities were expecting to touch record 50 lakh quintal production.Yield stableOfficials of the state agriculture department say this year’s yield was between 7-10 quintal per acre. “Like the last year, this season also did not see any major pest infestation. But the average per acre yield remained 8 quintals,” said Bahadur Singh Sidhu, chief agriculture officer of Bathinda, the district with the maximum area under the cotton cultivation.According to the progressive farmer from Bathinda’a Bajak village, Baldev Singh, said untimely rains during ball-burst period affected the yield.“The rains led to unwanted extra growth of plants that adversely affected the fruit. Farmers were expecting higher yield but the climatic conditions were not conducive,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cotton-arrival-in-punjab-s-mandis-this-season-double-than-last-season/story-GPuqxZ6ttHCO7Xagwngj1O.html
02-11-2020||Chandigarh||Attendance doubles after regular classes resume at UT government schools||Attendance in Chandigarh government schools has doubled after regular classes resumed for Class 9 onwards on Monday, with 3,288 students showing up on the first day.As per data shared by the UT education department, 1,525 students of Class 10 and 501 of Class 12 attended their classes in the first shift, while 922 students of Class 9 and 340 of Class 11 were present across 93 government high schools and model senior secondary schools of the city.Terming the response positive, UT director school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “When schools were opened for academic consultations in September, about 1,500 students would come in a day. Now, the number has doubled for regular classes. We are expecting it to increase in the coming days.”On the first day of regular reopening of government schools after March, teachers were seen at the entrances, checking the consent forms of children and taking them to their classes after they underwent thermal screening and hand sanitisation. Some students had to be sent back as they didn’t have the requisite consent forms or weren’t wearing the uniform prescribed by officials.Most of the students expressed happiness over returning to schools, with several claiming that they weren’t comfortable with online classes. Navpreet Singh of Class 11 at the government model school in Sector 46 said regular classes provided him better learning opportunities. Another student of Class 11 of the same school, Upkaar, said students were happy that all safety protocols were being meticulously followed by the management and they will be returning for classes now. Attendance in regular classes isn’t compulsory and online classes will continue to be the primary mode of instruction to the students. The education department is now mulling conducting offline mid-term tests once students in sufficient numbers start showing up for classes and begin to feel comfortable studying with the SOPs in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/attendance-doubles-after-regular-classes-resume-at-ut-government-schools/story-KnNMFbrODTNfwzeAm96tQO.html
02-11-2020||Gurugram||City shivers as mercury drops to 10.2 degrees Celsius; air remains toxic||The minimum temperature in Gurugram hit a season low of 10.2 degrees Celsius on Monday, which, coupled with slow winds, has halted the diffusion of airborne particles, retaining Gurugram in the ‘very poor’ category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI).Gurugram’s AQI on Monday, as per the daily bulletin, was 304, a marginal improvement from Sunday’s AQI of 306. Experts and officials said that the change in meteorological conditions — which had brought down pollution levels on Sunday from Saturday, when the city had an AQI of 358 — has affected dispersion of particles. The minimum temperature recorded on Monday is the lowest so far this season, and a degree below Sunday’s minimum temperature. The maximum temperature was recorded at 29 degrees Celsius, same as the previous day. The minimum temperature is expected to rise slightly, and will hover around 11 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, while the maximum temperature is expected to remain stable at around 29 degrees Celsius, as per a forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Clear skies during the day with fog, and mist in the morning, are expected to prevail over the next seven days.As per the air quality warning system, “The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming Northwest direction of Delhi with wind speed up to 05-12 kmph, mainly clear sky and mist in the morning on 03.11.2020.” About 190 fire counts were also detected over Haryana on November 1, which may further exacerbate pollution levels over parts of Delhi-NCR, as per the forecast. However, as per the CPCB’s central control room for air quality monitoring, Gurugram may likely see ‘poor’ air tomorrow, with an AQI reading just below the 300 threshold. “This is because the major impact of stubble burning is now passing. If we see a slight uptick in the minimum temperature as is predicted, then we can expect a few days of ‘poor’ air ahead of us,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist. “Once temperatures drop below a certain threshold and the surface of the earth actually becomes colder than the air above it, then we can expect the situation to deteriorate again. As this will coincide with Diwali season, any relief will be temporary,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-shivers-as-mercury-drops-to-10-2-degrees-celsius-air-remains-toxic/story-s0R3djZ0v7QfBkjhxp2zfP.html
02-11-2020||Gurugram||MCG working on action plan for 14 most-polluted areas in the city||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) are together working on individual action plans for reducing air-pollution at 14 hot spots across the city. These spots comprise the city’s 10 most-polluted spots, the three most-congested stretches, and the solitary landfill at Bandhwari, said officials on Monday.Officials of the civic body and CSE visited these areas on both Friday and Saturday to identify the hot spots in each areas and understand the different types of violations that can be found in these areas. Based on their findings, remedial measures would be taken and enforcement of Grap measures would be strengthened if necessary. Ten most-polluted spotsThe 10 most-polluted spots in the city, as per MCG’s air lab data, are Sector 14, DLF-4, DLF-5, Sector 44, Sector 49, Sushant Lok-1, Udyog Vihar, Sadar Bazaar, Basai Chowk, and areas around Sirhaul toll plaza. The air lab, which opened on October 15, monitors air-pollution data from 24 air-monitors located across the city.CSE programme officer Shambhavi Shukla said that the types of violation found at each of these 10 spots were almost similar in nature.“We found large-scale constructions at these sites, generating construction and demolition (C&D) waste and accumulation of dust caused by uncovered construction material. In each of them, illegal dumping of C&D waste in vacant areas could be easily spotted. Another common feature was large-scale waste-burning,” said Shukla.Three most-congested stretchesOn Monday, the teams also visited the three most congested spots in the city, namely Subhash Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, and Sohna Road, with the aim of finding the need for engineering changes that can reduce congestion and fix potholes and broken roads. Shukla said that although the road construction at these stretches, barring Sohna Road, was largely of superior quality, the presence of road dust and high traffic volume were the primary causes of air pollution.“Pollution caused by vehicular traffic was high at each of these three points. However, we also found that a lot of excavated soil, which had been piled up on the footpaths at these three stretches, is leftover from infrastructure projects recently undertaken. These were leading to a lot of suspended particles in the air and causing further deterioration in the air quality,” said Shukla.At both Sohna Road and Subhash Chowk, large-scale construction activities are currently being undertaken as part of the Sohna elevated road project. Hero Honda Chowk has also witnessed several engineering changes over the last two years, leading to the construction of a bi-directional flyover and an underpass at the junction.Shukla further said that the teams also found the presence of the highly-polluting diesel auto-rickshaws at both Subhash Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk and would recommend appropriate action against them in the report. City solitary landfillThe team also visited the Bandhwari landfill on Monday to take stock of the situation.“We had received a lot of complaints about open waste-burning around the Bandhwari landfill. Although we didn’t find such cases at the landfill itself, we spotted few such instances in the nearby areas. In addition, the MCG had also received complaints with pictures of open waste-burning in the area,” said Shukla, who added the action plan for each of the 14 spots would only be compiled following a meeting with senior MCG officials, where all the findings would be discussed and analysed with remedial and enforcement measures being suggested. Although enforcement teams from the civic body have been fining on-ground violations of the Grap measures, officials said that they needed additional measures to curb rising air pollution in the city.“MCG believes in an inclusive approach to ensure that we check and penalise all violators. We hence felt that there was a need for greater supervision on the matter along with a scientific approach. Thus, the MCG has initiated several new measures in this regard such as observing pollution data through its air-lab, involving residents and non-profit organisations such as CSE to assist in this endeavour,” said Chahat Sanghvi, consultant, MCG commissioner office.Last week, the civic body formed civil defence teams, comprising of around 60 resident volunteers, to scan the city for polluting activities, such as waste-burning and dust pollution. Since the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures came into effect in the city on October 15, MCG has issued 129 fines worth ₹29.70 lakh to violators. MCG has issued 13 fines and recovered ₹65,000 for open waste-burning. Twenty fines have been issued by the MCG for illegal C&D dumping leading to the recovery of ₹5 lakh. As many as 11 fines have been issued by the civic body for littering while 80 fines have been issued for dust mitigation leading to penalties worth ₹23.50 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-working-on-action-plan-for-14-most-polluted-areas-in-the-city/story-w63bEwEFlqnES4mCxsX9kK.html
02-11-2020||Gurugram||Antigen tests down, more kits to arrive this week||Due to insufficient availability of rapid antigen testing kits with the district health department, the antigen testing has declined in the district over the last week. The diagnostic test used for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 has declined from 900 tests a day to as low as 176 on some days over the last one week, according to the district health bulletin.The test, which delivers results within 30 minutes, detects proteins found on or within the virus by testing samples collected from the nasal cavity using swabs. It has, however, been under the scanner for its specificity and accuracy, having a higher chance of a false-negative result. In many cases, it fails to detect the active infection, in comparison to the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction(RT-PCR), the gold standard for Covid-19 testing.As per the health department data, on October 26, the health department and private lab together conducted 716 antigen tests. The number slumped to 428 on October 27 and reached 193 on October 31 and 176 on November 1, the lowest till now. On Monday, 259 antigen tests were conducted.In the total antigen test, the share of the health department is higher than that of private labs, as reported by HT earlier. Private labs mostly conduct the RT-PCR test, which costs Rs 900, while antigen test costs Rs 500.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “The antigen kit stock is limited. It is only being used in emergency cases. Presently, sufficient stock is not available at the warehouse. But there is no downfall in overall testing as we have increased RT-PCR. The testing continues to be above 3,000 every day, except on Sunday.”The state health department provides kits at the district level, while private labs have to procure kits on their own. Senior state officials were unavailable for comment when contacted by HT.Earlier, companies were donating kits under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). “Donations cannot be relied upon. It is likely that we can get the kits this week,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/antigen-tests-down-more-kits-to-arrive-this-week/story-YSXIdbqDRwf2vHj2vyQ3FL.html
02-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram focuses on increased awareness, enforcement and testing as cases spike||Due to the surge in Covid-19 infection over last two weeks, the health department, in coordination with the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the police department, is planning to intensify testing and increase awareness and enforcement drives in the district.On Monday, Gurugram reported 398 new infections, after crossing the 500-mark on Sunday. The total tally now stands at 30,925, of which 3,799 are active cases. In the last two weeks, the test positivity rate — the percentage of the total tests that come back positive — has grown exponentially, from 12% to almost 16% on November 2. As reported by HT earlier, the impact of easing curbs can be seen in market places, parks, local buses and wholesale markets, where people are moving around without masks and social distancing norms.“Health department can only focus on administering tests. An appropriate number of people are being tested. To reach out to more people, the health department is holding over 100 testing camps this week, higher than before. A detailed date-wise plan has been prepared for these camps. Also, containment zones will be increased,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Dr MP Singh, nodal officer for organising testing camps, said that testing camps held under each Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) has increased, with nearly 15 camps being held every day. “This time, almost 100 camps are being conducted in high-risk and containment zones, where cases are repeatedly increasing. With the help of RWAs and health workers, people are made aware of these camps. The team mostly administers RT-PCR test based on the symptoms,” said Singh.Yadav said that it was decided in a meeting of district administration officials that the MCG will continue to focus on awareness campaigns, while the police would focus on enforcement of norms.Earlier this month, a Covid-19 action team was set up by the MCG to increase the awareness outreach by figuring out various measures to sensitise people with problems related to coronavirus disease. The agency had also issued a letter to residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) for the awareness campaign to combat Covid-19 pandemic. They shared pamphlets mentioning dos and don’ts, along with the important helpline numbers.SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO), MCG, and a member of the action plan, said, “About 50,000 pamphlets have been shared with various RWAs to educate residents. Posters are pasted outside RWA offices. Since October, over 200 hoardings on mask discipline, plasma donation and increasing immunity have been put up at major junctions, crossings, parks and government buildings. Almost 250 Ecogreen vehicles for collecting door-to-door waste are also playing pre-recorded messages in different areas.”Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, on Monday, issued a statement asking citizens to take precautions against Covid-19 due to changing weather. “Citizens should be cautious as Covid-19 numbers are not yet down. The district administration with the help of the health department is working on providing facilities like testing in a planned manner. But people should also wear masks, sanitise or wash their hands and maintain social distancing. People should follow these basic precautionary measures, which would be helpful in controlling the spike.”For the enforcement, Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they are increasing vigilance on major roads and crossings. “We will continue to issue challans for mask discipline violation. Our local teams are keeping a check on gathering and visiting market places.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-focuses-on-increased-awareness-enforcement-and-testing-as-cases-spike/story-enCzo0QwhTZJObJIdjcB5J.html
02-11-2020||Gurugram||Government schools in city resume regular classroom sessions||Government schools in the city opened for regular classes on Monday four days after the state government issued an official notification for their resumption. While schools had already initiated regular sessions from October 15, no official notification had been issued. As a result, schools were continuing with the schedules that they had individually adopted for the guidance sessions. Across the district, 7,078 students from classes 9 to 12 turned up for the sessions out of a total strength of 40,273. The highest attendance was recorded in class 10, with 2,260 students across the district visiting their respective schools out of a total strength of 9,694. District education officer Indu Boken said that the numbers were expected to increase in the coming days. “Today is only the first day of the regular classroom sessions. We expect the student strength to increase subsequently in the coming days,” said Boken. Unlike the classes that have been taking place since September 21, sessions on Monday were structured and divided into periods of fixed durations for different subjects. Further, the roster system being followed so far was disbanded. Teachers were required to report full time for work from Monday. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that different subjects were taught for 30 minutes each on Monday. “Around 300 students came for regular classes today. In order to observe physical distancing norms, a limited number of 15 students were seated in one classroom and one subject was taught for 30 minutes. Earlier, students could leave after clarifying the doubts,” said Sharma. She said that the turnout was the highest since the beginning of the academic guidance sessions since September 21. Teachers of classes 6 to 8 were also roped in by the school for teaching the senior students. “With students occupying multiple classes, we had to involve more teachers. We, therefore, asked teachers of classes 6 to 8 to take sessions,” said Sharma. A few of the city schools, however, saw a lukewarm response on Monday. School heads and teachers said that they were expecting the turnout to improve after Diwali. “Around 15 students came to school today. We expect the numbers to increase post-Diwali since many students are yet to return back to the city and might do so after the festival session,” said Arun Kumar Raghav, vice-principal, Government Senior Secondary School in Islampur. Kumar said that although classes had been taking place for over a month now, we are now conducting regular lessons for board classes. “While too many students are not visiting the school ever day, our sessions for classes 10 and 12 are going well since we are able to give individual attention to students. We will be able to complete the syllabus in time if students continue to visit regularly,” said Kumar.Most private schools in the city are continuing with online classes with parents refusing to send their children to school for physical classroom sessions. Successive feedback sought from parents by private schools have shown that parents were in favour of continuing with online classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/government-schools-in-city-resume-regular-classroom-sessions/story-8ED23caOCl0Uyt4XHpH3AO.html
02-11-2020||Gurugram||Three of thirty-two rioters held for protesting over death of F’bad student test Covid positive||Three of the thirty-two people arrested by the Faridabad Police on Sunday for allegedly pelting stones, damaging shops and blocking the Delhi-Agra Highway tested positive for Covid-19, said the police on Monday. The suspects were demanding justice for the family of 20-year-old Nikita Tomar, who was shot dead by her alleged stalker outside Aggarwal College in Ballabhgarh, Faridabad, on October 26. The police said the three Covid-19 positive suspects have been sent to the isolation ward of ESI Hospital in Faridabad and health officials have been informed to start contact tracing. OP Singh, police commissioner, Faridabad, said that they have appealed to the people who had attended ‘Mahapanchayat’ to follow home quarantine for 10 days to ensure they do not infect others. “We got antigen test conducted for all 32 suspects, who were arrested. Twenty-nine of them have been sent to judicial custody and three have been admitted at the isolation ward of ESI hospital,” he said. On Sunday, a ‘mahapanchayat’ was called at the Dussehra ground over the murder. The assembly later turned violent as 200 people created ruckus and attacked police personnel. The police said the mob blocked the highway and started pelting stones at them, leaving 10 policemen injured. A case under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 152 (assaulting or obstructing public servant), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 189 (threat of injury to public servant), 188 (disobedience to order ), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease), 283 (danger or obstruction in public way), 332 (voluntarily causing injury to public servant ), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant), 427 (mischief causing damage), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance ) of the Indian Penal Code, Section 8B of National Highway Act, and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act was filed on Sunday. Singh said they have provided 24-hour security to the victim’s family members and her brother has been provided the licence to hold arms for self-defence. “We have provided police protection to father, mother and brother to ensure their safety,” he said. The police also that while 32 people were arrested, police are also searching for others who had instigated violence and had given the demonstration a communal colour. The suspects had come from Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Delhi, Nuh, Palwal and Gurugram to attend the ‘mahapanchayat’. Plans were afoot to disrupt the peace and create communal tensions, said the police. On October 26 afternoon, Touseef Ahmad, a resident of Kabeer Nagar in Sohna, and his friend, Rehaan (who goes by his first name), a resident of Riwasan in Nuh, arrived in a Hyundai i20 and tried to force Nikita Tomar — a B. Com final-year student — into the vehicle as she came out of the college after writing an exam, the police added. After their attempt failed, Touseef chased the victim down and shot her in the head from a close range at around 3:48pm as passersby watched, showed a video. The suspects escaped from the crime scene, leaving Tomar, who was accompanied by a friend, in a pool of blood. She was rushed to a government hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival. Both the suspects were arrested within 36 hours and the weapon and car used in the crime were recovered from Nuh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-of-thirty-two-rioters-held-for-protesting-over-death-of-f-bad-student-test-covid-positive/story-IWJESGF6FOKhvPW7Y5tNtI.html
02-11-2020||Gurugram||16.5% of 800 respondents have antibodies, shows sero survey||At least 16.5% of the district population surveyed for a serological study last month has developed antibodies to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as per the results announced on Monday.This was the second round of serological survey in the state, conducted on October 19 and 20 among 800 people in the district. In the first round held in August, the district had a seropositivity rate of 10.8% among 1,049 people. Although the sample size has decreased in the second round, seropositivity rate has increased.The survey found the overall prevalence of the virus to have increased, with about 90% of the respondents in Gurugram claiming not to have any history of Covid-19 symptoms.The overall seropositivity of the state has also increased by over six percentage points, compared to the first survey. This time around, at least 14.8% population in the state has developed antibodies against the virus without showing any symptom, which is higher than the 8.1% recorded in August.Haryana health minister Anil Vij said, “The sero prevalence of Haryana is found quite less than the other sero surveys conducted in various states. The health department has been on its toes for the last seven to eight months and has done commendable work in controlling the spread of Covid-19 as shown by the two rounds of sero survey conducted in the state of Haryana.”Similar surveys in Delhi showed that the prevalence of antibodies increased from 22.8% in July to 29% in August. Likewise, in Ahmedabad, it increased from 17.68% in June to 23.24% in August.In Haryana, across the 22 districts, 16,512 samples were collected (720-800 samples in different districts), out of which 35 were rejected. As per the data, 2,432 of 16,477 samples were positive, 23 had inclusive results, while the remaining were negative. The data of the survey was collected using a digital tool — COVID19 Sero Survey Mobile Application — developed by the Haryana IT department.Dr Usha Gupta, director, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), said, “A stratified multistage random sampling technique was used. Twelve rural and four urban clusters were randomly selected for taking samples in each district. Blood samples were collected from selected individuals after taking written consent and their sera were tested for IgG antibodies using ELISA test kit approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research.”Gupta, said, “The SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity observed in urban area is 19.8% and in rural area is 11.4%, which were 9.6% and 6.9% in the first round. Rural areas of Faridabad and Jind were found to have highest positivity rate of 25.5%, while urban areas of Faridabad, Yamunanagar and Panipat had the highest seropositivity rates of 40.2%, 37.1% and 36.3%, respectively.”The survey covered population from different age groups, with the majority in the 28-47 age group. Nearly 91% of the sample size had no co-morbidity issues. Those with co-morbidity were patients of diabetes and hypertension.In Gurugram, a total of 800 were tested for IgG antibodies, which are developed in the body a week after the infection. Since a high proportion of asymptomatic or Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms are missed from the data of laboratory-confirmed cases, the serological survey covers this section to study the prevalence of the virus.The findings show that at least 131 (16.5%) of the 800 had antibodies, while 81% of the samples tested negative for the antibodies. The remaining 2.6% showed inclusive test results. Nearly 632 people who gave their blood samples for the survey never got tested for Covid-19 before, while 146 had tested negative for the virus.High prevalence in urban areasSince the sample size of the survey covers nearly 60% of rural and 40% urban population, Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department said, “It has been observed that the risk of transmission is higher in urban areas as compared to rural areas. This only means that a larger portion of the population must continue following Covid appropriate behaviour.”He said, “A sero survey is about testing a group of individuals for the presence of antibodies as it helps in understanding the number of people affected by the disease. The study helped us to determine the burden of COVID-19 at the community level in the state and monitor the trends of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”Dr SB Kamboj, director general of health services, said, “Although 14.8% population of Haryana has developed antibodies, a significant proportion of the population is still vulnerable. Therefore, the containment measures need to be continued with the same rigor. Further, other non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical distancing, use of face mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoidance of crowded places, must be followed strictly and must not be overlooked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/16-5-of-800-respondents-have-antibodies-shows-sero-survey/story-GZX6eSJdt74inEA4kNQhuK.html

He also asked them to highlight the 550 projects completed in 65 villages during this period. The closing functions will take place over three days at the end of this month, culminating on November 30, when the CM will visit Sultanpur Lodhi and Dera Baba Nanak to pay respects in the historic towns associated with the Guru. Chairing a high-level meeting to discuss the programme, the CM asked various departments to avoid events with large crowds and instead to organise virtual functions amid projections of a second Covid wave in the state. At a virtual meeting, attended by cabinet ministers Charanjit Singh Channi, Tript Bajwa and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Amarinder also released a coffee table book based on the 550th Prakash Purb celebrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/complete-all-projects-to-mark-guru-nanak-dev-s-birth-anniversary-capt/story-Q14w63iJQnXlnxbYf37W5O.html
02-11-2020||Chandigarh||Freight train service off track, Punjab exhausts gunny bale stock||With freight trains service not available due to the ongoing farmers’ protest, the Punjab food and civil supplies department has fallen short of gunny bales for the ongoing paddy procurement. Over 150 lakh tonne paddy has been procured and the state says another 25-30 lakh tonne is still to be procured. “Procurement can take place only when the gunny bags are made available,” said a food department officer. A bale has 500 gunny bags, with each used to fill 37.5kg paddy. Sources in the state food department said 1,154 containers of gunny bales are stuck on rail tracks in and around Delhi. There is, however, no sign of freight trains resuming service. Protesting against the Centre’s three farm bills, farm organisations started their blockade of tracks on September 24. In October, the Centre announced stopping trains, including freight, seeking assurance from the state government for safety and security of tracks.The shortage has occurred even as state food department has increased the quota for rice millers to use gunny bags from the previous season to 70% from 50%. “Paddy can be filled in old bags, but rice (after shelling) has to be filled in the brand new bags to check damage to the grain,” said an officer in the food department. The state government is contemplating bringing gunny bales via roads from places where freight containers are stuck. The Jute Corporation of India supplies gunny bales and the Container Corporation of India, a subsidiary of the railways, supplies gunny bales to different mandis of Punjab from jute mills in West Bengal. “We are planning to bring bales to Punjab via road. The bales come on advance payment, so if they remain stuck in transit it is our loss,” said state food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. With no freight service, the government has also missed out on transportation of about 20 lakh tonne of wheat and rice from the state in October. “Had the trains been allowed, we would have been in a comfortable position as far as storage space for food grain is concerned,” said an officer, adding that 136 lakh tonne of wheat and 55 lakh tonne of rice is stuck in the state’s godowns. After paddy procurement in complete, at least 120 lakh tonne more rice would need storage in godowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/freight-train-service-off-track-punjab-exhausts-gunny-bale-stock/story-mSnzcGwJHniEoGnmFoB4LO.html
02-11-2020||City||Naib tehsildar, 4 others held for land fraud in Mohali||The Punjab Vigilance Bureau on Monday arrested five people, including Zirakpur naib tehsildar Varinder Pal Dhoot, after booking 11 for illegally usurping a village common land in Majri block of Mohali district.The case dates back to 2017, when Dhoot was posted as the naib tehsildar in Majri. He allegedly in connivance with subordinate revenue officials and private individuals fraudulently sold off 99 acres of shamlat land in Seonk village, leading to losses to the government exchequer in crores.Others arrested have been identified as kanungo Rughubir Singh, patwari Iqbal Singh, nambardar Gurnam Singh and property dealer Sham Lal. The vigilance had been probing the case since 2017.According to the FIR, the accused prepared forged land documents and got the village common land registered in the name of people known to them in lieu of high amounts of money. Later, the plots were sold at high rates.In his statement to the VB, the block development and panchayat officer has stated that, as per land records, the land in question was shamlat (owned by the panchayat, and not any individual) from 1946 to 2000 and was never an agricultural land.‘Remaining six will be arrested soon’A senior VB official, who did not wish to be named, said the five arrested persons will be produced in court on Tuesday. “We are still investigating the case and trying to find how much loss has been caused to the state government. We will be arresting the remaining six people in this connection soon,” he said.The accused have been booked under Sections 7 (offence relating to public servant being bribed) and 7A (taking undue advantage to influence public servant by corrupt or illegal means or by exercise of personal influence) of the Prevention of Corruption Act besides Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 466 (forgery of record of court or of public register), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine documents) and 120B (criminal conspiracy ) of the Indian Penal Code.In a similar case of corruption registered against revenue officials in the district, the VB in May 2018 had arrested the Bassi Pathana tehsildar and block development and panchayat officer for embezzling funds pertaining to acquisition of shamlat land in Jheourheri village for the international airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/naib-tehsildar-4-others-held-for-land-fraud-in-mohali/story-SGKDPEW7ysJHEo5MNa4bXK.html

However, I am anyway going to Delhi tomorrow and join my party colleagues in the national capital on Wednesday (Nov 4),” said rural development and panchayats minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa. Cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa too said he had no knowledge about the status of the appointment with the President. “We are with our CM and will do whatever directions come from him,” he said. There’s uncertainty: SAD Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said there was uncertainty over the meeting with the President. “There has to be confirmation about the programme first. But there is no news,” said Cheema, adding that there was no point going to Delhi under such circumstances.

Meanwhile, 1,200 patients consulted the doctors through telephone.Before the pandemic, OPDs witnessed a footfall of more than 10,000 patients a day. The services were abruptly shut on March 19 due to fear of infection spread among patients and for diverting more health workers to Covid duties. From May 19, tele-consultation started, and around 2,100 patients are using it every day. Even now, patients are first being evaluated through tele-consultation and only those requiring physical examination are being called to the OPDs through an appointment system.“I have directed the officials to see what issues are faced at OPDs in the next 10 days, and to resolve them, so that the number of patients allowed at OPDs can be increased gradually. After Diwali, we expect to provide physical consultation to more people,” said Dr Jagat Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/opd-services-resume-at-chandigarh-s-pgimer/story-qoXmMMlXKQvAD7s20Pu4LJ.html

02-11-2020||Chandigarh||October gone by was warmest in six years in Chandigarh||Even as there is a nip in the air with winter knocking on the door, the October gone by was warmest in the past at least six years.According to data readily available with India Meteorological Department, average maximum temperature in Chandigarh in October was 33.7°C, highest in the past six years. The weatherman attributed it to more sunny days and improved air quality. “The higher maximum temperature this year can be attributed to more sunny days during the month. Cloud cover remained scanty and we had bright sunny days almost every day,” said IMD, Chandigarh, director Surender Paul. “The comparatively improved air quality also had a role to play. Pollutants in the air, especially particulate matter, reflect sunlight, which is why smog can reduce the temperature. The cleaner air this year led to more sunlight reaching the surface and thus higher temperatures during the day.”The month also remained dry, with no rain recorded on any of the days, as both western disturbances and low-level easterly winds, which cause light showers during October, remaining elusive this year.Mercury to plunge post DiwaliOctober’s average minimum temperature of 17.6°C was a notch below that recorded in previous years. After Diwali on November 14, it is expected to drop below 10°C. Minimum temperature on Monday went down to 12.5°C from Sunday’s 13.6°C . Even maximum temperature fell to 29.5°C from 30.5°C, dropping below the 30°C mark for the first time since the end of monsoon. In the next three days, the maximum and minimum will remain around 29 and 13 degrees, respectively.Meanwhile, the air quality index (AQI) continues to remain between 110 and 130 according to the monitoring station in Sector 25, much lower than 280 recorded on November 2 last year. With no rain likely in the first two weeks of November, it is expected to go up after Diwali.The IMD has predicted an “average winter” this season, with the peak period likely to start towards the year end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/october-gone-by-was-warmest-in-six-years-in-chandigarh/story-EV5l57sW0yjoEuIoNXxtyI.html

According to an estimate, there are around 30,000 beneficiaries,” said Sharma.The progress in the case is being monitored by the high court, he said.“On the basis of CAG report, I moved a petition in the high court against the open loot of the state land under the garb of Roshni Act. I also challenged the constitutional validity of the flawed Act in a separate PIL,” he informed.Sharma said that the high court has asked the J&K administration not to only retrieve land allotted under the Act but also other state land under illegal occupation in Bhatindi, Sidhra and Tawi riverbed in Jammu district.“Roshni Act was used to change Jammu’s demography. Unabated capture of forest and river lands by Muslims, settlements of Rohingyas and Bangladeshis exclusively in Jammu, clandestinely issuing SROs, handing over state lands to Auqaf was all part of a deep conspiracy,” he alleged.However, principal revenue secretary Pawan Kotwal has claimed that the total land allotted under the Roshni Act was only 3.44 lakh kanal.On October 10, the J&K high court had ordered CBI probe into the Rs 25,000-cr Roshni land scam and directed the investigating agency to file status reports every eight weeks.More than 90% land cannot be sold to outsiders: UT admn The UT administration on Monday said that it has repealed 11 land laws that existed in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and replaced the “old, regressive, intrinsically contradictory and outdated” legislations with a set of modern, progressive and people friendly provisions.“The new land laws will not only afford protection to over 90% of the land in J&K from being alienated to outsiders but will also help revamp the agriculture sector, speed up industrialisation, aid economic growth and create jobs in J&K,” said principal secretary and UT spokesperson Rohit Kansal, while allaying apprehensions among the people related to the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of State Laws) Fifth Order, 2020.The repealed laws were made to serve the old agrarian-based economy and were required to be modified for modern economic needs, said Kansal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/roshni-land-scam-cag-report-was-trigger-behind-petition-says-hc-lawyer/story-aDfySRJsi3zfsqfLbA1J0N.html

The court declined to grant him parole following a report from SSP, Crime Branch, Jammu, in which it was stated that if the petitioner is granted parole, there is apprehension of community clashes and protests in J&K.“Consequently, given the genuine apprehension expressed as regards the possible law and order consequences if the petitioner’s prayer for parole is granted, the court is not inclined to accept such prayer at this stage,” the bench of justice S Muralidhar and justice Avneesh Jhingan said.On June 10, 2019, the Pathankot special court, while holding that strained relations between the local Hindu community and nomadic Bakarwal Muslims was strong motive behind the rape and murder, had convicted Sanji Ram, Parvesh Kumar and Deepak Khajuria and awarded them life term.Ram was the village head and priest of the temple where the crime took place. The Supreme Court had transferred the case from Jammu in May 2018. The rape and murder of the girl had resulted in widespread chaos in J&K. The trial court had also convicted three cops for destroying evidence and helping the accused.

Suddenly, four stray dogs resting nearby attacked him, dragging and pulling him in different directions.Hearing his screams, locals rushed out of their houses and rescued the boy, but he had already suffered severe bite injuries on his legs, arms and back by then.He was rushed to Christian Medical College and Hospital, where he remains under treatment.“Given the scale of injuries on my son’s body, I can’t even muster the courage to see the CCTV footage of the attack. He has been in immense pain, which breaks my heart. The civic body needs to take swift action so such incidents are not repeated. We are fortunate that neighbours rushed to my son’s aid or it could have ended in a tragedy,” said Ekam’s father, Amanpreet Singh.He added that the stray dog menace in their street had not been tackled despite several complaints. “Senior deputy mayor Sham Sunder Malhotra told us there is no solution to the problem, as MC’s hands are tied by law. But, should the civic body continue to sit on its hands? The dogs attacked another child the very next day, but still MC took no action. The stray dogs need to be removed before they cause a casualty,” Singh demanded.On Monday, area residents held a protest and raised slogans against MC authorities. They accused the senior deputy mayor of turning a deaf ear to the issue. A resident, Pritam Singh, said, “Malhotra even visited the area a day after the incident, but failed to provide any solution. The fear of stray dogs has forced people to stay indoors.”On his part, Malhotra said, “The stray dogs don’t leave the area as some residents shelter and feed them. MC cannot relocate or cull the dogs as per the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. But, the civic body is already taking up the stray dog sterilisation project to rein in the menace.”He, however, admitted that the project was moving at a snail’s pace and he will take up the matter with MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal.Despite several attempts, MC senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dhalla was not available for comments.Dog sterilisation stalled due to shortage of manpowerMeanwhile, amid the rising dog bite cases, the city’s dog sterilisation project being taken up at the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Centre at Haibowal Dairy Complex has come to a halt for want of manpower.Work has been stalled since the last week of September, when the workers and doctor involved in the project left citing personal reasons. This is the second time that the project has been affected in the last three months. It was also stopped in August due to shortage of workers.Since the project started in 2015, over 42,000 dogs have been sterilised to curtail their population.An average of 35 to 40 dog bite cases are reported at the civil hospital on a daily basis. While 15,000 cases were reported in 2019, another 8,951 cases were recorded till July this year.No let-up in dog bite casesJanuary 27, 2020: Four-year-old Viraj Kumar was mauled to death by stray dogs in Bahomajra village of Khanna May 30, 2019: A six-year-old girl, Dania, was bitten by a stray dog in Sector 32 on Chandigarh RoadMay 25, 2019: Mehtab Singh, aged four, was bitten by a stray dog on the cheek in Barmalipur villageDecember 31, 2018: A stray dog ripped off the finger of a workshop owner in Gurdev Nagar December 5, 2018: Stray dogs attacked a four-year-old at Bhamiyan RoadOctober 2018: A five-year-old girl allegedly died of rabies in Sarabha Nagar after stray dogs attacked herJanuary 2016: A stray dog ripped off the ear of a 12-year-old boy when he came out of his school bus in South Model Gram area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/8-year-old-boy-attacked-by-stray-dogs-in-ludhiana-s-tajganj-area-residents-hold-protest/story-MgNgYQ6iNhr0Rxbn2c3bwN.html

The forum was protesting against the new land laws, removal of Article 370 and limiting of employees’ service tenure to 22 years.The forum members led by former trade union leaders Abdul Qayoom Wani and Farooq Trali had assembled at the Press Enclave and started sloganeering against the new land laws and removal of J&K’s special status.Before being detained by the police, Wani, who had contested the last parliamentary elections from Baramulla on the PDP ticket, told the media that they would never accept the new land laws. “These laws are not only against the people of Kashmir but also unfavourable for those living in Jammu and Ladakh,” said Wani, chairman of the forum.He said that due to the government’s new order that limits the service of government employees to 22 years, the sword of unemployment will be hanging over all of them, which is against the service rules.A senior police officer said some civil society members were taken into preventive custody.This is the second protest against the newly introduced land laws that was prevented by the police in the past 10 days. Last week, a dozen PDP leaders were detained for taking out a similar protest in Srinagar. On Saturday, the valley had observed a shutdown against the laws on the call of the Hurriyat Conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-foil-another-protest-over-new-land-laws-in-srinagar/story-s6Ah1oslh52vDMOv4Rvv4M.html

02-11-2020||City||A little less glitz on Karva Chauth in Ludhiana this year||With Karva Chauth just a day away, very few women are flocking mehendi stalls in the city due to Covid fear. Earlier, women used to stand in queues alongside roads to get mehendi applied, however, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, very few women are visiting henna stalls.Henna artists in the city said that customers either prefer to visit after taking an appointment or get the services at home. The artists said that their business has gone down by 70%.To maintain social distancing, henna artists have put up stalls at a distance of at least 2 metres and were seen sanitising frequently.A visit to various markets such as Ghumar Mandi, Kipps Market, Sarabha Nagar, Shahpur road, Field Ganj and Chaura Bazaar revealed that very few customers are showing up at henna stalls and artists were getting calls from customers asking them to visit home. This year, very few special henna artists from Mumbai, Mathura and other cities have turned up here.Sagar Nayak, a mehendi artist from Ghumar Mandi said, “We are receiving more bookings for home service and very few customers are interested in visiting the stall. Last year, I got 50 artists here to handle the rush during Karva Chauth but this time we have only 20 artists as very customers are visiting the stalls. We have made proper seating arrangements and conducting a thermal screening of my employees. Due to the pandemic, our business is severely affected.” Another henna artist from Lucknow, Sunil Kumar in the Kipps Market area and Sarabha Nagar said, “I am into this business for the last 20 years and this is the first time very few women are visiting the stall. I have 15 other artists to manage the rush at the stall but half of them are sitting idle as in the daytime, only five customers showed up and in the evening 20 came to apply mehendi. Last year, two days before Karva Chauth women had to stand in queue for their turn apply mehendi.” Meanwhile, the artists were seen charging about Rs 100 to Rs 5,100 per hand and for bridal mehndi designs, the charges are Rs 1,100 to Rs 7,000.Trendy patternsIn the last years, designs such as Arabic, floral patterns, and peacocks were very popular among customers but now stylish theme patterns such as clip art, portrait and life photos are in trend.Images of a newlywed bride looking at the moon, Radha and Krishna designs that symbolise marriage and love are also an in-thing.Ridha Chawla, a resident of Civil Lines, said, “I booked a henna artist and asked him to visit my home as I do not want to visit the stall due to heavy rush.”Many artists could be seen showing various designs on their iPads, tabs and cell phones, hence replacing display boards and books.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/a-little-less-glitz-on-karva-chauth-this-year-in-ludhiana/story-878uoSHoD70BEMBFN0LloL.html

The government had made it mandatory for students to seek consent from parents to attend regular classes while the attendance was not compulsory.On the first day of resumed schooling, not more than 25 students attended the classes at Government Senior Secondary School for Girls in Shimla’s Portmore, where 1,240 of them are enrolled in the higher classes.Despite the fear of contagion, students were elated to be physically present in their classrooms after a gap of eight months. “It feels nice to be back to school after so long. As Covid cases are still on a steady rise, we are taking all precautions to safeguard ourselves against the disease,” said Ishika Singh of Class 9.“Online classes were fine too, but learning is more effective in school and we can directly raise our queries to the teachers,” said added.Similarly, Ashima Sharma of Class 10 said, “I am happy to be out of my home after eight months. I missed my friends and the active classroom environment. As it is the first day of school resumption, only a few students came, but more will turn up in the coming days.“The school authorities sanitised the classrooms and premises ahead of time. Students were scanned at the gates. However, it appears that parents are still sceptical about sending their wards to school,” said the government school principal, Narendra Kumar Sood.Many students also faced transportation problems as less number of buses are plying in the morning hours in Shimla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/schools-reopen-in-himachal-few-students-turn-up-on-day-1/story-yrluMCf6eTFqBnw9AR4OpI.html

Every vote cast in favour of BJP will contribute to making of a prosperous Madhya Pradesh and strong India.”State BJP president VD Sharma, under whose leadership the state BJP is facing elections for the first time, also appealed to people to vote for the BJP on November 3. State Congress president Kamal Nath said, “By-polls will be known as a different chapter in MP’s history. People will definitely give a befitting reply to those who betrayed them.” By-polls on 28 assembly seats will decide the fate of the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government which has 107 MLAs in 230-member state assembly against the Congress’ 87, Bahujan Samaj Party’s two, lone Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA and 4 independent MLAs. One of the seats is vacant. Thus, the BJP will need 8 MLAs to reach the majority mark of 115 and the Congress needs to win all the 28 seats to get to the majority mark if these parties don’t need any support from other parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-by-poll-every-3rd-polling-centre-declared-critical-heavy-security-in-place/story-dIStsuW4hk99LzTC1gOUWP.html

Light snowfall and rainfall were recorded in Lahaul-Spiti, Chamba and Kullu districts. Chamba and Kullu, however, witnessed 99% rain deficit with 0.3mm actual rainfall each while Lahaul-Spiti witnessed 95% less rainfall as it received 1.5 cm rain.Overall, October rain of 0.4 mm precipitation was recorded in Himachal, which was 99% less than normal.

02-11-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Punjab CM orders expansion of contact tracing to 15 people||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday ordered the expansion of contact tracing of positive patients to 15 persons and made it mandatory for hospitals and radiology labs conducting CT scans to report such patients to the state administration in case of suspicion of coronavirus.As per the official release, the move is part of a slew of measures taken by the state government to strengthen the Covid management systems amid the apprehension of the second wave.“Further, to streamline and prioritize the process of Covid vaccination, the chief minister ordered a state-level 3-tier vaccine supervision mechanism, comprising a steering committee as well as state and district task force, to be put in place,” the release said.It said that ‘in sharp contrast to some other states that are depending heavily on the less reliable Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT)’, the chief minister directed the Health Department to make RT-PCR the rule, with RAT to be treated as an exception, while ordering another Serro Survey to assess the ground situation.In other steps, Singh directed 24x7 testing facility to be made available at district hospitals, all fever cases, and other symptomatic coming to health facilities to be tested with RTPCR, and all patients attending the flu corners to be tested with RTPCR.“He stressed the need to make arrangements for walk-in testing at multiple points and asked the Health Department to consider branching out testing by scaling up local initiatives like Mohali’s out-door testing,” the release stated.The chief minister further asked the state Health Department to get information from private and public hospitals regarding Covid mortality and complete the audit by November 9, so that remedial action can be taken by mid-November.“Emphasising the importance of ensuring preparedness for a second wave, he also directed the Department to meet manpower shortage, especially in L-II facilities, by filling all gaps in mission mode. Those who have been selected must be immediately given appointment letters and asked to join, he said, in response to a concern expressed on this count by Health Minister Balbir Sidhu,” said the release.chief minister also urged organisers of social and religious congregations, that have been permitted, to also encourage the participants to get themselves tested.“He asked officials to encourage citizens organisations and NGOs, and also to reach out to people through the Lok Sanjhedari program, to discourage the use of firecrackers this Diwali season,” it said.To ensure that distribution of the vaccine, once available, is prioritised among the vulnerable groups, including health workers and people with co-morbidities, Amarinder Singh ordered the constitution of a State Steering Committee, to be headed by the Chief Secretary, with monthly meetings to supervise the progress.He also ordered that a State Task Force, headed by Principal Secretary Health, shall hold meetings every fortnight, while at the district level, the Districts Magistrates will head the District Task Force, which will meet on a weekly basis.“Stressing the need for extreme caution and extensive testing so that the situation, which has improved in recent weeks, does not aggravate, the chief minister said the positivity rate had come down to around 2% but the state could not afford to be lax under any circumstances. He stressed the need to increase surveillance and strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviours till a safe and effective vaccine is available,” it stated.The chief minister asked the concerned departments to dedicate the month of November to carry out testing of all staff, including health, police, revenue, and other civilian staff.“He said his government had already sanctioned approximately Rs. 900 Crore for Covid response and added that funds will not be allowed to become a constraint for ensuring full preparation and best response. He directed the Health Department to increase testing to 30000 a day, with at least 100 tests per lakh population,” the release stated further.The focus areas for monthly testing in the state would be healthcare workers, government staff, industry workers, migrant labor (Mandis, residential areas of labor, brick-kilns, etc.), office and commercial establishments, markets, schools/colleges, m multiplexes, containment/micro containment zones, persons with comorbidities, dhabas and restaurants.The chief minister said at least 50 per cent samples should be from these categories and directed the Health and Medical Education departments to come up with weekly sampling and surveillance plans indicating focus area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-punjab-cm-orders-expansion-of-contact-tracing-to-15-people/story-GQGnGvPKefO5rUH5Ki6fQM.html
02-11-2020||City||Straw burning incidents 5% lesser as compared to previous years: PAU||Even as pollution monitoring bodies claim that incidents of paddy straw burning are higher this year as compared to the last four years, data by Punjab Agricultural University’s (PAU) states that the area under stubble burning in the state has declined by 5.23%.“The Punjab Remote Sensing Centre data shows the area under paddy straw burning (which is more reliable parameter than a number of fire incidents) during this year as 749.43 thousand hectares as compared to 790.77 thousand hectares last year, clearly showing a decline of 5.23%,” claimed GS Manes, additional director of research (farm mechanisation and bioenergy).He said that this decline in the paddy straw burnt area despite early harvesting clearly showed improvement in the adoption of paddy straw management technologies as compared to last year.Manes added that the harvesting of paddy had just crossed its peak in Punjab with 62.5% area harvested on October 30. The arrival of paddy during the same period this year was higher than last year by 32.46% for parmal and 29.47% for parmal and basmati combined, indicating early harvest.Elaborating this, Manes said, “Some farmers, who have adopted in-situ straw management technologies over the past few years, will complete three or more years of this practice this year. It will be interesting to see whether there is an improvement in wheat yield as shown in experiments conducted by PAU, Ludhiana, which is observed in farmers’ fields.

02-11-2020||City||Sangrur facing 80% urea shortage in wheat sowing season||With goods trains suspended in Punjab due to farmers’ agitation, Sangrur is facing an 80% shortage in urea supply amid the wheat sowing season.The district cultivates wheat crop on 2.9 lakh hectares, which require about 1.1lakh metric tonne (MT) urea, but currently, only 25,000 MT is in stock.Agriculture department officials say that they are trying to arrange more urea but they have a sufficient supply of diammonium phosphate (DAP), which is another important fertiliser. Sangrur chief agriculture officer Jaswinder Pal Singh Grewal said that farmers initially need DAP, but after 21 days of wheat sowing, the crop demands urea.“We have sufficient stock for the first dose of urea. However, if goods trains are not started soon, we will face a shortage of fertiliser as we need 30% urea by November-end, 30% in mid-December and 15% in January,” said Grewal.“The government will arrange urea for farmers. However, some farmers are also purchasing it from Haryana,” he added.On Monday, a few farmers from the district met agriculture department officials, seeking adequate supply of urea. The farmers alleged that the central government is targeting Punjab due to its opposition to farm laws.“If the Modi government is taking anti-farmer decisions, the state government should come forward to provide urea by road. It is the responsibility of the Congress government to address farmers’ concerns,” said Gobinder Singh, Sangrur block chief of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sangrur-facing-80-urea-shortage-in-wheat-sowing-season/story-8XQJUiLfeyl65QUYGuuJhN.html
02-11-2020||Chandigarh||Second sero survey: Covid antibodies found in 14.8% population of Haryana||The second round of serological survey conducted by the health department in October has revealed that 14.8% of the population in Haryana has developed Covid-19 antibodies as opposed to 8% of the population in August. The serological survey was conducted to determine the extent of coronavirus spread in the state and helps in measuring the proportion of population exposed to the infection including asymptomatic people. State health minister Anil Vij on Monday said sero-positivity during the second round was 19.8% in urban areas and 11.4% in rural areas. It was 9.6% in urban and 6.9% rural areas during the first round of survey. Vij said rural areas of Faridabad and Jind districts were found to have the highest positivity rate of 25.5%. The urban areas of Faridabad, Yamunanagar and Panipat have the highest sero-positivity rates—40.2%, 37.1% and 36.3%, respectively. The districts which had lower sero-positivity of less than 10% were Hisar (9.7%), Mahendergarh (8.6%),Charkhi Dadri (7.7%), Sirsa (7.5%), Palwal (5.5%) and Bhiwani (3.1%). Additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora, said these finding will guide the officials in planning and implementation of appropriate measures to contain the spread of virus. Arora said a sero-survey is about testing a group of individuals for presence of antibodies as it helps in understanding the number of people affected by the disease. The study helps in determining the burden of virus at the community-level and monitor the trends of transmission. Arora said that it has been observed that urban population was more affected than people in rural areas. “Overall low prevalence findings can be attributed to the proactive measures taken by the government to prevent the spread of infection including prompt lockdown, testing strategies, containment and surveillance measures including contact tracing and tracking,” he said. Director health services, IDSP, Dr Usha Gupta said 720 samples were collected from each of the 22 districts covering both urban and rural population. “A stratified multi-stage random sampling technique was used. We had selected 12 rural and four urban clusters randomly for taking samples. Blood samples were collected from selected individuals after taking written consent and then their sera were tested for immunoglobulin antibodies using ELISA test kit approved by Indian Council of Medical Research,’’ Dr Gupta said, adding that 16,512 samples were collected from the 22 districts. Director general health services Dr SB Kamboj said though 14.8 % population has developed antibodies but still a significant proportion of the population is vulnerable. Therefore, the containment measures need to be continued with same rigor. Other non-pharmacological interventions such as physical distancing, use of face mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoidance of crowded places must be followed strictly, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/second-sero-survey-covid-antibodies-found-in-14-8-population-of-haryana/story-3PPRCuc3ubZdAmT0Vx9B6K.html

Under the campaign, 11 special squads of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and city police will inspect firecracker manufacturing units to ensure that there is no old stock left. The government has also urged people to not burn crackers at all this year as the city battle surge in Covid-19 cases.On Wednesday, Environment Minister Gopal Rai had said that only ‘green’ firecrackers can be manufactured, sold and used in the national capital. Every year in winters, Delhi’s air turns hazardous due to bursting of firecrackers and stubble burning in neighbouring states. On Monday, Delhi’s air quality was in the “very poor” category, as per the data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The capital recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 310 at 7 am.Meanwhile, Delhi is witnessing a surge in cases of Covid-19, a respiratory disease. On Monday, the city saw a drop in cases after recording more than 5,000 cases for five consecutive days. According to the state health department, 4,001 fresh cases were detected in Delhi in the last 24 hours, pushing the total tally more than 3.96 lakh.The death toll mounted to 6,604 with 42 more fatalities, it also informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-launch-anti-firecracker-campaign-amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases-air-pollution/story-ZIjL7kOHwppcvZADWlmU4I.html
02-11-2020||City||Custom Hiring Centres fail to put a check on farm fires in Haryana||There has been no respite from stubble burning in Haryana even as the state government has spent a whopping ₹1,300 crore to set up Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) to provide machinery at subsidised rates and help farmers manage paddy straw.As per the data provided by the Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC), the state has reported 27% rise in farm fires this year. The state registered 5,584 Active Fire Locations (AFLs) till October 31 this year against 4,280 AFLs as compared to last year. More than 80% farm fires have been reported from six districts—Kaithal, which tops the list with 1,027 incidents followed by Karnal 920, Kurukshetra 806, Ambala 729, Fatehabad 605 and Jind 403. As per the official data, 13,236 machines were provided on 80% subsidy to farmers in the state. Last year too, the government had spent huge amounts on the subsidised machines for management of crop waste. A subsidy of around ₹329 crore was provided to set up 1,320 custom hiring centres (CHCs) for in-situ and ex-situ crop waste management the previous year. Most CHCs were set up by big farmers as marginal farmers cannot afford these machines. The owners of CHCs, who had purchased these implements at 80% subsidy, were charging rent from all farmers.Farmers have demanded that the government should ensure that these machines, purchased by the CHCs, are provided to small and marginal farmers as well so that they can be used to manage crop waste and avoid stubble burning. Jagminder Nain, joint director (agriculture engineering) at Haryana agriculture department said, “The equipments provided by the government for management of crop waste are very helpful and farmers are reaping benefits from these machines. As per the HARSAC data, the AFLs in the state are more than last year. However, as per our data, the area under stubble burning has decreased as compared to last year.” Karam Chand, deputy director agriculture department, said, “Around 50% Active Fire Locations shown by HARSAC are not found on the ground. Out of 974 locations provided by the HARSAC, 447 farm fires were not found during physical verification.” He said this has led to a confusion on the AFLs and actual cases of stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/custom-hiring-centres-fail-to-put-a-check-on-farm-fires-in-haryana/story-7pTB6Jwv2tmsqoAImN0OYP.html

02-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi pollution unchanged despite high wind speed, air quality still ‘poor’||Pollution levels in the national capital dipped on Monday with high wind speed aiding dispersion of pollutants, even as farm fires continued to rage in neighbouring states.  The city recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 293, which falls in the ‘poor’ category.It was 364 on Sunday, with stubble burning contributing 40 per cent to Delhi’s pollution and negating the effect of better ventilation.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’,201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.  The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said a “significantly” large number of fires were observed over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Sunday which is likely to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR and northwest India.Also Read | Farm fire share in Delhi’s pollution but opposition parties are in denial: Gopal RaiHigher wind speed and better ventilation index will be favourable for dispersion of pollutants on Tuesday, it said.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution was 16 per cent on Monday. It had soared to 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season.Stubble burning accounted for 32 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday.Last year, the farm fire contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.According to Punjab Pollution Control Board, the state has recorded 33,165 “fire events” this season so far, while Haryana has reported 6,034 farm fires during the period.NASA’s satellite imagery also showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was westerly-northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 18 kilometers per hour on Monday. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the season so far.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.According to the central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the city’s ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 12,000 meter square per second on Monday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.Earlier during the day, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai targeted the BJP and the Congress on the issue of stubble burning, saying the share of farm fires in Delhi’s pollution has soared to 40 per cent but the opposition parties were in denial.“We have been saying it again and again that stubble burning is a major reason behind severe levels of pollution in Delhi around Diwali, but the BJP and the Congress say the share of farm fires in Delhi’s pollution was just 4 to 6 per cent, whereas statistics show it has increased to 40 per cent,” Rai told reporters. In Delhi, the administration sprayed the bio-decomposer developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, in non-Basmati rice fields to prevent stubble burning. “The preliminary reports have been extremely positive. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will ascertain the ground reality on November 4,” he said.In a bid to control pollution, the Delhi government has also said that only “green firecrackers” can be manufactured, sold and used in the national capital in accordance with a 2018 Supreme Court order. The ‘green crackers’ are not as polluting as the conventional types of firecrackers and they contain at least 30 per cent less particulate matter such as Sulphur Dioxide and Nitrogen Oxide.Fireworks can take place between 8 pm and 10 pm only on festivals like Diwali and Gurpurab etc. On Christmas eve and New Year eve, it would be from 11:55 pm till 12:30 am only, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-unchanged-despite-high-wind-speed-air-quality-still-poor/story-31itI4FxQ77WC0DYgkF0VK.html

02-11-2020||Chandigarh||Covid: Panjab University asks departments to cut expenses||With Panjab University taking various measures to curtail spending this year to minimise the loss in revenue due to pandemic, it has also asked all departments to cut down their expenses. In a recent communication from the assistant registrar (budget), the teaching and non-teaching departments were told to adopt the austerity measures taken by the varsity on the recommendation of a special panel. PU is not expecting to earn any revenue from the various sources, including hostels, amid the pandemic. The annual fee hike was put on hold this year and, a concession of 5% in semester fee for all students resulted in losses to the tune of ₹2 crore. As per the communication, the heads of all departments and branches, except the dental institute, have been asked to reduce the budget provision meant for lab expenditure by 40%. It also stated that there will be a general cut of 10% in the budget provision of office and general expenses instead of 20% as had been recommended by the austerity committee. Moreover, the departments have been asked to not use budget provision under the head ‘Books of Journals’, to purchase of books. However, the department may use the same for the purchase of online textbooks and reference books only. NO NEW DEMAND TO BE CONSIDERED The varsity also stated that to curtail the spending, the finance department will not consider any new or additional demands in the revised budget estimates of 2020-21 and the budget estimates of 2021-22. However, the decision will be reviewed at the time of the formulation of revised estimates of 2021-22 in July 2021. Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) president Mritunjay Kumar said, “We have put forth several demands during the budget estimates meeting keeping in view the problems faced by the teaching community. We have also demanded ₹1 crore for streamlining the online teaching facilities.” PU has already suspended the leave travel concession/ home town concession to its employees for 2020-21 and, libraries have been asked to cut short the online journal subscriptions based on their usage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-pu-asks-departments-to-cut-expenses/story-d4yxOlJ2Eoc41UUpfmXG4M.html

02-11-2020||Chandigarh||Want to make a mark in Women’s T20 Challenge, says Chandigarh-based fast bowler Kashvee||Chandigarh Chandigarh-based fast bowler Kashvee Gautam, the first Indian woman cricketer to have taken a perfect 10-wicket haul, will be playing for the Trailblazers in the Women’s T-20 Challenge to be held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) between November 4 and 9.Seven months ago, Gautam, then aged 16, had made ripples in the women’s one-day tournament being held in Andhra Pradesh where she took 10 wickets against the home team in a plate group game at Kadapa. Taking note of her feat, BCCI’s newly appointed selection panel led by Neetu David selected Gautam to play for the Smriti Mandhana-led Trailblazers. Two other teams — Supernovas and Velocity — will also participate in the T20 challenge in Sharjah.Ask Gautam how she feels and she says, “Life has been strange over the last six months. I only started training a fortnight ago. I was excited to play in the women’s U-19 World Cup that was to be held in January 2021 in Bangladesh. However, it was postponed in the wake of the pandemic. Now, the Almighty has given me another chance to exhibit my skill among senior women. I have been following the Indian Premier League matches. I aim to do well by my team and also make a mark.”Gautam, who said this before leaving for Mumbai ahead of the tournament, had scored 350 runs and scalped 66 wickets for Chandigarh in plate group one-day U-19 and U-23 tournaments last season.Apart from Kashvee, Chandigarh’s Taniya Bhatia will also be seen in action during the tournament. She will play for the Supernovas led by Harmanpreet Kaur. Meanwhile, Mohali-based Harleen Deol will also be part of the Trailblazers.Gautam eyes Indian team berth While Gautam was with Punjab, she seldom got a chance to represent the state in different age categories but once Chandigarh got BCCI affiliation, Gautam was unstoppable.“I would not get many chances to play for Punjab. When Chandigarh became a BCCI unit, it was a big thing. I gave my best shot and at the end of the season, I was peaking at the right time. Using pace well along with variations will be key in UAE. Shafali Varma did well in the last edition. I, too, want to make an impression and make the Indian team berth,” said Gautam, who trains with Coach Nagesh Gupta at Government Model Senior Secondary School cricket academy in Sector 26.She had missed bagging a second perfect 10 in the same tournament against Sikkim by a single wicket. “Things were clicking for me. I bowled aggressively and bagged nine wickets. That is in the past now. The plan will be to get used to the UAE heat ahead of the matches and bowl well,” says the Class-11 student, who idolises England’s Jofra Archer.Praising Gautam, Chandigarh senior women team coach and former first-class cricketer Khyati Gulani said, “She is talented and electric on the field. India needs such a multi-talented cricketer. She can bat well and is a superb fielder. India lacks in the fast-bowling department, Kashvee can be groomed well and included in the national team. She will be an asset. She should make most of the UAE experience.”Harmanpreet Kaur and Mithali Raj will be captains of Supernovas,and Velocity, respectively.The 2020 Women’s T20 Challenge will begin with last year’s finalist Supernovas taking on Velocity in the opening game.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/want-to-make-a-mark-in-women-s-t20-challenge-says-chandigarh-based-fast-bowler-kashvee/story-FA6UWm6yD5NNXqE8BSEhIJ.html
02-11-2020||City||Goa: Midnight protest against railway expansion gets huge support||Hundreds of protesters gathered at Chandor in south Goa and camped along the railway track with candles, beating drums and raising slogans against the state government’s move to push through railway expansion through a stretch located between Margao and Sanvordem. The conversion of a single-track route into a double line is being opposed, which protesters allege will cause irreparable damage to the fragile Western Ghats ecosystem. The expansion work is aimed at transportation of coal from the Mormugao port to steel plants located in north Karnataka via a protected forest in the Western Ghats. The vigil was attended by prominent members of the leading opposition parties. “Work is in progress, even though all the permissions are yet to be granted. The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change’s (MoEFCC) guidelines stipulate that for linear projects, the construction work should not begin until all the permissions have been granted,” said Abhijit Prabhudesai, who is leading the agitation against the expansion under the banner of Goyant Kollso Naka, which loosely translates to we don’t want coal in Goa. The South Western Railway Line that runs between Londa in north Karnataka and Vasco da Gama in Goa was built in the late 19th century by the colonial Britishers to connect the Mormugao port with the hinterland via the Western Ghats. The railway track has become saturated ever since the Mormugao port emerged as a focal point for the import of coal. In 2010, the Union Ministry of Railways had sanctioned the doubling of the existing Hospet-Tinaighat-Vasco railway line in Karnataka and Goa. The construction work in the first phase between Hospet and Tinai ghat, which involved easier terrain atop the largely flat Deccan plateau, has been completed. The second phase between Tinaighat and Vasco da Gama involves crossing steep slopes, raging rivers and thick forests of the Western Ghats and densely populated parts of coastal Goa are being contested. Earlier this year, the standing committee of the MoEFCC recommended the grant of clearance for diversion of forest land to construct the railway line, along with permission for two other projects such as expansion of the existing state highway and a power transmission line. All three projects are being opposed on environmental grounds. The clearances have been challenged before the Bombay high court (HC) at Goa and the Central Empowered Committee (CEC), which was set up by the Supreme Court (SC) to adjudicate environmental matters. “The Congress and other opposition parties have spoken in one voice against the doubling of the railway track, which is being carried out for facilitating transportation of coal through Goa,” said Digambar Kamat, leader of Opposition in Goa legislative assembly, after taking part in the vigil. The protest was organised to coincide with the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited’s (RVNL) bid to carry out the laying of a track at Chandor village, which lies along the stretch of track between Margao and Sanvordem.The stretch involves three distinct sections. The easternmost part that passes through wildlife sanctuaries crossing steep slopes, raging rivers and thick forests of the Western Ghats, a middle section involving easier terrain and the coastal stretch between Margao and Vasco, which is densely populated. The project is also beset with land acquisition troubles and stiff opposition by local residents living along the track.However, the RVNL authorities have refused to stop the construction work on grounds that unless a government authority or a court of law directed them to do so.Though the agitation was the biggest amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant is not willing to accede to the protesters’ demands. Initially, he claimed that the project was not aimed at transportation of coal and later changed his tack to allege that expatriate Goans was behind “these agitations”. “The infrastructure is not being created for the transportation of coal alone. Stop these agitations. We have not started importing coal. Coal has been imported for many years. We have not even increased the import of coal. We are carrying out the construction work in a bid to develop industries and give a boost to exports and imports,” Sawant had said at a function last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/goa-midnight-protest-against-railway-expansion-gets-huge-support/story-iSI3uqWalQZa1gZyc9pW0M.html

02-11-2020||City||Rajasthan’s Gujjar quota stir: One faction continues agitation, the other calls for ending it||As the Gujjar quota stir entered its second day in Rajasthan, one faction continued its protest on the railway tracks of Delhi-Mumbai passing through Peelupura village of Bharatpur district on Monday, while the other called a meeting of the community members to form a strategy to end the stir. Compared to earlier years, this time the protesters are divided into two factions — one led by Kirori Singh Bainsla and his son Vijay Bainsla, and the other, by Himmat Singh. Singh, along with a delegation of 41, had met a government panel where the administration reportedly agreed to meet all their demands. The meeting was organised around 12noon in Gargara Nagla village where many panch and heads from different villages of the community participated and appealed for an end to the agitation in order to maintain peace. Gujjar leader Deewan Singh Sherpur, who was part of the delegation, said it was wrong on the part of Kirori Singh Bainsla to blocked a rail route while the state government had agreed to fulfil all demands of the community. “People of the Gujjar community of Bharatpur will not allow Bainsla to break law and order. To launch a stir without any reason is not favourable for community,” he said. Meanwhile, Vijay Bainsla said they were not ready to leave railway track on any condition. “We have jammed Bayana Hindaun road...Agitators in large numbers have been on the rail route and are cooking here itself. We would not approach any representative of the government...they need to come here to talk to us,” he said.Meanwhile, the agitation found echoes in Ajmer where roads were blocked on Monday afternoon for a couple of hours. Routes of at least 60 trains, including 40 freight trains, had to be diverted on Sunday because of the agitation and two trains were cancelled. Also, about 220 buses from five major roadways depots of Dausa, Hindaun, Karauli, Bharatpur and Bayana were stopped. Bharatpur inspector general of police Sanjiv Narzary said police force in adequate numbers has been deployed in Bayana. Internet services have also been snapped in the Gujjar dominated areas across Dausa, Hindaun, Karauli, Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopru and Jaipur rural to check the spread of rumours. Collectors of eight districts in Rajasthan have been authorised to make preventive detentions under the National Security Act 1980. Different state governments have brought in laws to give Gujjars (and four other communities) 5% reservation under special backward classes (SBC) and later, as the most backward classes (MBC) but the Rajasthan high court struck down the laws .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rajasthan-s-gujjar-quota-stir-one-faction-continues-another-calls-for-end-to-agitation/story-e29wy4zlhIIKOtmzVmfspI.html
02-11-2020||Delhi||‘Metro travel in Delhi should be regulated’: Home ministry after Covid-19 review meeting||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Monday said that the surge in active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in national capital Delhi is due to the festival season and the laxity shown by people in adhering to safe Covid behaviour.“The recent surge in the number of active cases was attributed to the festival season, which has witnessed greater movement of people, accompanied by laxity in adhering to the basic principles of safe Covid behaviour,” the ministry said in a statement.The home ministry further said that hospital bed situation is comfortable in Delhi with 57 per cent of 15,789 dedicated Covid-19 beds being vacant.It also said that the government will focus on efforts like targeted RT-PCR testing in sensitive zones such as restaurants, markets and salons.The statement came after a Covid-19 review meeting conducted by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla with health ministry and other experts. Decreasing temperature and rising pollution was discussed as part of the strategy to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease.It was emphasised in the meeting that Metro travel in Delhi should be carefully regulated, strictly in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that have been issued in this regard, the MHA said.The national capital on Sunday recorded 5,664 new cases of Covid-19 and 51 fatalities, as the positivity rate soared to 12.7 per cent, according to Delhi government’s health bulletin.So far, 392,370 people have contracted Covid-19 in Delhi, of whom 352,635 have recovered, the bulletin said.With 44,623 total tests recorded on Sunday, the positivity rate shot up to 12.7 per cent - up from an average of 5.3% recorded for the week ending October 8. The positivity rate stood at 11.42 per cent on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/metro-travel-in-delhi-should-be-regulated-home-ministry-after-covid-19-review-meeting/story-QCl0QKPQciRp2ujJ1NYcrI.html
02-11-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka by-polls: BJP looks to wrest Sira, RR Nagar; Congress hopes for upset wins||All the three main parties in Karnataka – the BJP, the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) - have made it a prestige battle to win the Sira and Raja Rajeshwari (RR) Nagar assembly constituencies which will go to polls on Tuesday. The fate of 31 candidates who are in contention for the two seats will be sealed tomorrow even as the Election Commission has made elaborate arrangements to ensure a peaceful and safe polling in light of the Covid-19 situation.The Sira seat fell vacant after the sitting JDS MLA B Satyanarayana died due to Covid-19. The RR Nagar seat is witnessing by-polls as MLA Munirathna resigned and crossed over from the Congress to the BJP helping topple the JDS-Congress coalition government in the state.Both the constituencies are Vokkaliga dominated. While the BJP, which has never won either constituency, is looking to break into new territory and expand its base, for Congress this is the first poll the party is facing under new Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar who wants to prove a point.For the regional JDS, it is an existential question as any loss would diminish the party’s historic role as a key third pole in the state politics. Also, the role of HD Deve Gowda and HD Kumaraswamy as the traditional voice of the Vokkaliga community is likely to be challenged by Shivakumar who also belongs to the same community.The outcome of the polls though is unlikely to affect the power balance in the state as BJP enjoys a clear simple majority with 117 members in the 225 member assembly apart from the support of three independents. However, a win for the BJP in Sira, where CM Yediyurappa’s son BY Vijayendra is leading the party’s campaign, would help cement his position in the party.Also read: Kejriwal announces ‘historic step’ for industrial areas of DelhiFor Shivakumar, it is a prestige fight too as RR Nagar is part of the Bengaluru Rural parliamentary seat represented by his brother DK Suresh. A win in either or both of the seats could propel his claim to be the Congress party’s candidate for the Chief Ministership at the cost of Siddaramiah.JDS too wants to defend what it sees as its turf. In Sira, it is hoping for a sympathy wave that would help its candidate Ammajamma, the widow of Satyanarayana. In RR Nagar, it is hoping to emerge as the player who decides who will be the winner.Leaders of all three parties have expressed confidence that they will win both seats. CM BS Yediyurappa even announced that Munirathna would be made a minister after he wins the polls and in Sira, he promised several developmental works if the party were to win.Congress PCC chief DK Shivakumar and Leader of Opposition Siddaramiah, both of whom have been campaigning relentlessly, say that despite BJP’s best efforts, they are confident of winning both the seats. ‘The ruling party has unleashed money and muscle power but we are still confident of winning both the seats,” Shivakumar told media.Political analyst Manjunath says that though the survival of the state government is not at stake, the outcome could influence the political tenor for the near future. “If BJP loses both the seats, it might accelerate the party high command’s desire to replace Yediyurappa. A heavy loss in both seats by the JDS would push it further to margins. For Congress, if they lose both seats, there might be a blame game between Shivakumar and Siddaramiah factions.”Manjunath says in case of Congress’ victory in either or both seats, Shivakumar’s hold on the party is likely to increase. In case BJP pulls off victories in both seats, it would help Yediyurappa to further consolidate his position, he added. The results of the by-polls will be declared on 10 November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-by-polls-bjp-looks-to-wrest-sira-rr-nagar-congress-hopes-for-upset-wins/story-xCE8FCcPdD1kO84W7L8zXK.html
02-11-2020||City||Covid-19 still here, need to exercise caution in festive season||Festival shopping at brick and mortar stores during Deepavali has always had its charm. So also melas and special exhibitions that have become part of the celebrations of festival of lights. But this year, both retailers and consumers need to exercise utmost caution when it comes to Deepavali shopping.Usually, this is the time when retailers go all out to draw huge crowds -- the bigger the better. And what can be better than offers of special discounts and gifts to attract consumers ? But Covid-19 has unfortunately changed all that. In fact, several outlets that offered huge discounts and attracted massive crowds in Tamil Nadu were forced to down their shutters by the local administration for violating the Standard Operating Procedures meant to contain the spread of Covid-19.What were these inducements that got the consumers so excited and rush to the venue, throwing caution to the wind? While in one instance, the bait was an inaugural offer of ‘buy any dress for Rs 25’, in the other, it was a T-shirt for Rs 9 and a set of three shirts for Rs 999. But one saw a similar rush even in an upscale saree shop in Chennai that had announced clearance sale. Here too, the local administration had to shut down the outlet after videos of the crowd inside the shop made the rounds on social media. Here again, there was no social distancing and many of the shoppers were sans the mandatory mask. State health authorities should in fact test all those who went to these ‘sales’.Going by the crowd frenzy at these outlets, it seems like even the threat of contracting Covid is not a deterrent when it comes to grabbing goodies at a marked down price. Or may be such discounts are even more valuable in these times when people have considerably less disposable incomes to spend on clothes for the festival.With Deepawali just a fortnight away, there is every likelihood of shoppers and the shopkeepers forgetting the precautions against Covid and committing similar blunders. While consumers are suffering from Covid-fatigue, the retailers, whose businesses have taken a huge hit on account of the pandemic, are desperate for business. Besides, with online shops organising massive festival sales, the brick and mortar stores are really in a panic.So the civic authorities have to be highly vigilant and prevent super spreader events such as exhibitions and deep discounts that attract huge crowds. They have to ensure all businesses follow the mandated precautionary measures, particularly in respect of staggering the number of visitors or customers, ensuring social distancing norms outside as well as inside the outlets, allowing only those customers who are wearing masks to enter (or providing them with masks) , ensuring the availability of sanitizers at the entrance, etc. Let us not forget that we are finally seeing a decline in the number of coronavirus cases in the country and any let up at this time could well reverse that trend.Several studies have shown that when a number of people come together, particularly in a closed environment, even one super spreader in the group can infect a very large number of people. And this person may well be asymptomatic or the symptoms may not have manifested as yet. This is the reason why gatherings such as these that would contribute to increasing number of positive cases are to be shunned. I must mention here, a yet to be peer-reviewed, pre-print article in medRxiv, which puts considerable emphasis on the need for anticipating and preventing superspreading events to cut down on overall transmission rates . “A skewed distribution where few individuals or events are responsible for the majority of transmission, can result in explosive, superspreading events which produce rapid and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or late in epidemics”, says the article. (‘Chopping the tail: how preventing super spreading can help to maintain Covid-19 control’)A good advice indeed, particularly in these festival times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-still-here-need-to-exercise-caution-in-festive-season/story-fxyfa6pIwTa1KsDrv70yZO.html

He said that “personal liberty of an individual, though precious, is of little value if the larger interest of the people and nation are at stake.”Also read | ‘Not allowed to meet anyone’: Delhi riots accused Umar Khalid tells courtThe Delhi police had challenged the bail granted to Farooq who had been charged for hatching a conspiracy to precipitate and aggravate riots, in and around his school. According to the police, it was on his directions that the adjacent convent school, two parking lots run by the other party and the building of one Anil Sweets were destroyed by the mob. The police claimed in the charge sheet that the call detail analysis of Farooq suggested that the he had links with prominent members of Popular Front of India, Pinjra Tod group, Jamia Coordination Committee, and other persons, which indicate the depth of the conspiracy.While cancelling Farooq’s bail, the judge said, “The accused has been charged with criminal conspiracy. His absence from the spot does not absolve him of his liability in this case.” In their charge sheet, the police had claimed that the rioters had camped inside and fired bullets from the terrace of Rajdhani School. They also threw petrol bombs, acid, bricks, stones and other missiles using an improvised large iron catapult, specially installed for the purpose, from the terrace. Police also said that on February 24, the day of the riots, many children had been told to leave the school early, along with their parents, during the half time recess, which showed that the riots were premeditated. At least 53 persons died and 607 were injured when clashes broke out in parts of north-east Delhi. The riots had started on the evening of February 23, after a clash between supporters and protesters of the Citizenship Amendment Act. Farooq’s counsel was yet to respond to HT’s calls. The copy will be updated once he does that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-east-delhi-riots-hc-sets-aside-trial-court-s-order-granting-bail-to-private-school-principal/story-O4SiXMxUiRhvW2vGccuitJ.html

The report specially deals with the promises made by him related to improvement of education, health, environment, transport, housing , infrastructure, women and child welfare, law and justice including sanitation.Of the 39 promises assessed by the NGO related to the public announcements made by him, the NGO claims that none of them have been answered by the parliamentarian despite sending a detailed questionnaire to him on August 14.HT sent Bapat sent a detailed a copy of the report seeking his response on Sunday. Phone calls to his contact number went unanswered. His close aide and secretary Sunil Mane, said, “The MP is extremely busy with graduate constituency election related to work. I will see to it that you get a response soon.”The NGO has focused on his public promises like setting up a skills university in Pune, working towards improvement of sports and education system in Pune, river cleaning and development projects, starting hyperloop project.Avinay Sanyogita, researcher, MumbaiVotes, said, “If the MP made promises before elections, he should also declare the status of those promises after elections. Had MP Bapat declared his performance since his election, he would have set an example strengthening democratic principles of accountability and transparency of elected representatives.

02-11-2020||Chandigarh||Surge in Covid-19 cases in Haryana amid festive season||Haryana is seeing a new surge in Covid-19 cases with the state reporting 2,305 more infections last week as compared to the week before. The spike between October 26 and November 1 comes after a five-week decline in the infection rate.Though the 10,576 fresh infections reported last week were way below the all-time high of 17,616 infections reported in the second week of September when the virus spread was at its peak, health officials fear a gradual surge in numbers in the coming weeks.Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said at present the surge is concentrated in districts bordering Delhi but there are concerns that the virus may spread to other parts by November-end. “It is according to our projections. We anticipated a surge during the festival season since there is a tendency of people to lower their guard and shun safety measures during festivities. Further, the resumption of activities such as the opening of schools, colleges, cinemas, multiplexes, entertainment parks, allowing social, religious and political congregations are also factors that contribute towards increasing the spread,” the ACS said.Districts in Delhi’s neighbourhood worst affected Four national capital region (NCR) districts abutting Delhi – Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Rohtak – contributed 53% of the 10,576 new infections reported last week. In fact, Gurugram (2,912) and Faridabad (1,692) alone accounted for 43% of the new infections.Hisar, a district in the north-western part of the state also reported a sizeable 1,160 new infections, primarily due to it being a commercial hub. “Once the numbers start increasing in Delhi, the bordering districts also see a spike because of inter-state movement of men and material,” health officials said.Dr Dhruva Chaudhary, the nodal officer for Covid-19 in the state, said that a surge is expected in winter due to the opening up of educational institutions, increase in air pollution and festival season.RT-PCR sampling picks up Statistics show that the health authorities have stepped up the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, considered the gold standard test for detecting new infections and reduced the rapid antigen tests (RAT) significantly.While the total number of samples tested last week was less than the week before, the number of RT-PCR tests done was stepped up by 16,500. Also, only 29,787 rapid antigen tests were done last week as compared to 48,653 the week before, a decrease of over 18,000.The last time the RT-PCR testing was conducted at this intensity was in mid-September.“We are ramping up the RT-PCR testing again. The RAT will be significantly reduced. Civil surgeons have been directed to organise sampling camps for two weeks. Crowded areas, markets, slums and the vulnerable groups such as frequent travellers will be the focus of our stepped-up testing,” the ACS said.Nine districts have less than 1% fatality rate While the infections have started increasing, health officials say the case fatality rate in the state was low at 1.1% last week. In fact, nine districts – Gurugram, Faridabad, Charkhi Dadri, Jhajjar, Mahendergarh, Palwal, Rewari, Rohtak and Sonepat – have either 1% or less fatality rate, a desirable value as per the Union health ministry’s parameters. None of the remaining 13 districts have shown critical value of more than 6% fatality rate so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/surge-in-covid-19-cases-in-haryana-amid-festive-season/story-zX05qgKnsAfbHAduTNQbCK.html

Ranjan Mishra, additional principal chief conservator of forest for wildlife, said the process started with a ground survey in areas above 3000m height.“We are starting with a survey where locals from snow leopard habitat areas will be asked to complete a questionnaire on direct and indirect signs for the presence of snow leopards. This will include information about domestic animals being killed, direct sightings, pug marks,” said Mishra.The process is being carried out in ten forest divisions of the state in the higher reaches of districts like Uttarkashi, Chamoli and Pithoragarh.Also read | Uttarakhand govt trying to generate jobs via country’s first snow leopard conservation centre“This estimation process is not just an exercise in finding the number of snow leopards in the area but also about studying the landscape. We want to know about the prey base, the ecology of the area and what improvements are needed. Along with the process, we will also be training the locals on how to earn a livelihood by combining conservation with ecotourism,” added Mishra.From the ground survey, areas will be identified and broken down into grids for installing camera traps with the help of experts from Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. Snow leopards are found in about 23% of the geographical area of the state which is about 13,000 sq km and for preliminary investigation, this area is likely to be divided into 80 grids of 15 sq km each.Mishra said that an estimate of the number of snow leopards in the state will be released by December 2021Last year in October, the first national protocol for snow leopard population assessment in five Himalayan states, including Uttarakhand, was released by the union environment ministry. The protocol is titled ‘Snow leopard Population Assessment in India (SPAI). Snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is facing many threats to its existence due to poaching and habitat destruction. It inhabits the Himalayas at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uttarakhand-starts-snow-leopard-population-estimation-process/story-CgpEwq67rNvlx5LJ1u2CGP.html

02-11-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Why is CBI silent on status of probe, asks Maharashtra Congress||Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) has questioned the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for its radio silence regarding the probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case and the New Delhi-based All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences’ (AIIMS) panel report that was made public in October. The party has questioned if the central investigating agency is under political pressure to keep mum in the case, which has caught the nation’s imagination, till the ongoing three-phase Bihar elections end on November 7.Sachin Sawant, general secretary of the MPCC and a party spokesperson, tweeted on Monday morning: “Is the CBI following code of conduct for Bihar elections in the #SushantSinghRajputCase? Why no action and statement has been made even after the AIIMS panel submitted its report? It has been a month since the AIIMS panel report was made public. Has the Narendra Modi-led government told them (CBI) to keep matters in abeyance until Bihar elections are over.”Also read | ‘We didn’t leak information,’ CBI, NCB, ED tell Bombay high courtSawant found it strange that the CBI did not utter a word on the status of the probe in the case after more than two months of taking it over and a month after the AIIMS panel report was submitted. “We have two questions for the CBI. Is it silent because of the prevailing code of conduct for the Bihar elections? We would also like to know if there is any pressure from the Modi government directing the CBI not to issue any statement in the case until the elections are over. The political use of the CBI in this episode and an attempt to defame Maharashtra has been established. It is high time for the central probe agency to speak up,” he said.Rajput (34) was found dead at his Bandra apartment on June 14. The investigation of the case was handed over to the CBI from Mumbai Police in August after an order from the Supreme Court (SC). The AIIMS panel report ruled out the possibility of poisoning as the cause Rajput’s death.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition in Maharashtra, had criticised Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, comprising the Shiv Sena, the National Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, and Mumbai Police for their inept handling of the investigation into Rajput’s death.Meanwhile, BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar said the Congress leaders should not be impatient as the CBI is doing its job professionally and will soon come out with the report. “There is no question of political use of the investigating agency. Had it been the motive of the BJP, there could have been arrests of political leaders here. CBI has been doing the probe very professionally and will soon come out with the report in the SSR death case. Congress leaders should not forget that there was not a single arrest for nine months in rationalist Narendra Dabholkar’s killing in 2013 when Congress was in power here,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-why-is-cbi-silent-on-status-of-probe-asks-maharasthra-congress/story-2618B09yveoG1uIMWT9StN.html

Closed for the last eight months, multiplexed resume operations in Unlock 5 in Delhi-NCR and some other parts of the country. However due to various reasons, the turn-out was very low and there seems to be no relief for multiplexes for the upcoming months too. According to a survey conducted by Local Circles, Only 7% citizens plan to visit movie theatres in the next 60 days. Sachin Taparia, founder, says, “We conducted a survey to know if citizens if plan on visiting movie theatres in the next two months. The survey received 8,274 responses from across the country. In response, only 4% said they would go to watch if any new releases come and 3% said they will go regardless of new or old movie. 74% said they will not go while 2% were unsure and 17% said they don’t watch movies in theatre.”Since people are taking no interest, multiplexes wants to experiment with private screening. They have rolled out a plan and movie lovers are already excited about it. Kunal Sawhney from Carnival Cinemas says, “Due to the re-runs and pandemic crisis, there are not much viewers. So we have recently started private screening of movies to make it convenient for people who loves theatre experience. College students and families are booking with us. There are various plans for the private screening that includes food, without food, type of screen and the standards. We are getting lots of queries regarding it and we feel it would be a hit.”Even in the private screening, all the norms are followed strictly. Saurabh Varma from INOX, says, “Anyone can book for private screenings to experience it in an exclusive and personalized manner, while maintaining social distancing. The guests can choose the content, either from the current play list, or an old blockbuster. We believe that a large segment of our audience would feel more comfortable enjoying a movie with their family members and friends.”Those who watched the movies in private settings are elated to have that experience. “My family wanted to watch a movie in theatres but we were unsure due to the presence of so many people, but we got to know about private screening and booked for eight people. It was cool to book it entirely and it was more fun indeed.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/theatres-reopen-private-screenings-in-delhi-ncr-excites-denizens/story-ZUFdrYUpQQ5Li8d8oZB4gP.html
02-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC grants bail to man arrested with 84kg poppy straw||The Bombay high court (HC) last week granted bail to a Nashik resident arrested by local police authorities for allegedly possessing 84 kilograms (kg) of poppy straw.Acting on a tip off, police had intercepted Ratan Morade on August 6, 2018 and had found three polythene bags in his scooter that allegedly contained 3 kg and 150 grams (gm) of poppy straw. Police claimed that he later led them to a house from where another 81 kg of poppy straw, kept in three bags, was seized.Morade’s arrest also led to the arrest of one of his accomplices, from whom another 18 kg 400 gm of poppy straw was recovered.Morade and his accomplice were booked under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.Morade had moved HC for bail.His counsel, advocate Ayaz Khan, pointed out the discrepancies in weight and seal on the samples drawn from six bags, allegedly containing poppy straw, recovered from the scooter of the accused and the house pointed out by him. Khan also pointed out that there was nothing on record to show ownership of the house from where 81 kg of poppy straw was recovered and that Morade was in exclusive possession of the contraband material.Justice CV Bhadang accepted the argument and granted bail to the Nashik resident.The judge noted that though the police claimed that they had drawn separate samples from each of the six bags recovered from the accused. However, the record of the inventory prepared before the judicial magistrate on August 8, 2018, showed that the samples contained between 0.4gm and 0.6 gm of poppy straw.Also read | SC rejects PIL seeking to withdraw Mukesh Ambani, family’s Z+ securityJustice Bhadang noted that the record mentioned that the samples were resealed with the seal of the magistrate.But, the covering letter of the police and the chemical analyser’s report also indicated that the samples were bearing seal of the police station and weight of the samples ranged between 49.9 and 50.2 gm.“Prima facie it appears that the samples which were produced before the magistrate, were not weighing 50 gm. At any rate the samples which were produced and resealed before the magistrate are not the ones, which were sent to the chemical analyser,” said Justice Bhadang.At this stage there is also no evidence about the ownership or possession of the house from where 81 kg of poppy straw was recovered, said the judge and ordered Morade to be released on executing a personal recognisance (PR) bond of Rs 25,000 with one or two solvent sureties in the same amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-hc-grants-bail-to-man-arrested-with-84kg-poppy-straw/story-uwMxx2T9n0PfZ807jxUxLJ.html

02-11-2020||Lucknow||UP: After losing son to liver cirrhosis, BJP MP, wife to launch campaign against alcohol abuse||Weeks after losing his 28-year old son to liver cirrhosis due to excessive drinking, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Lucknow’s Mohanlalganj Lok Sabha constituency, Kaushal Kishore, has decided to roll out a campaign to save the young from “getting consumed by the brew”. Cirrhosis is a late-stage liver damage caused by a variety of factors, with chronic alcoholism being among the leading causes, say doctors. From December 3, Kishore and his wife Jaya Devi, a BJP lawmaker from Malihabad assembly segment, would administer a pledge against alcohol consumption to a thousand young people. He said he intends to run it as a regular campaign under which each of the participants would be tasked with taking the campaign forward. He said his three other sons will be a part of the campaign that would be launched from Lucknow’s Gandhi Bhawan auditorium on December 3.The MP’s son, Aakash Kishore, died on October 19 and he regrets how he couldn’t save his own child. “One of the biggest regrets of my life is that I got so many young people to give up liquor but failed to do so with my own son. Liquor ruined his life. He has left behind his wife and a two-year-old son,” he said. “When I was admitted for coronavirus infection, my son again resumed his drinking and it proved fatal. He died due to liver cirrhosis. I lost my son but now I don’t want any other parent to suffer the same,” he said. While praising Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s decision to ban liquor in his state, the BJP MP, however, said such bans aren’t of much help unless the will to refrain from drinking comes from within.“We need to motivate young people to be able to say no to those who entice them to take to drinking. I want to build it into a nationwide movement, and for that purpose, we have decided to take Rs 100 from each person who commits himself for the cause,” said the BJP MP. His wife, Jaya Devi, said, “Someone must have got my son to drink for the first time. That first time is when one needs to stay strong. This strength can come from one’s own conscience.” The couple has also shared about their campaign on social media. “People have been writing their appreciation for our move. Someone had to make a start somewhere,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-after-losing-son-to-liver-cirrhosis-bjp-mp-wife-to-launch-campaign-against-alcohol-abuse/story-AUkhIdx1o2LsvDFGr7JwBP.html

HT had reported on Saturday about these walk-in testing facilities at all 24 administrative wards.Also read | Over 45,000 new Covid-19 cases, 496 deaths take India’s tally to 8.22 millionThose who want to get tested will get a two-hour window from 10 am to 12 noon to get themselves tested at these facilities. While some facilities have RT-PCR testing, others have rapid antigen testing. Antigen kits deliver test results in less than 30 minutes but are less sensitive as compared to the RT-PCR tests.Along with the 244 testing facilities, there are 54 private laboratories, approved by BMC, that conduct Covid-19 tests. These labs cost Rs 1,800 for sample collection at home and Rs 1,400 for getting tested at their facility. Apart from this, government-run and municipal hospitals conduct Covid tests for free. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Increasing testing will help timely diagnosis of the infection and early treatment is the key to better recovery. These testing facilities will have a team of medical professionals. The move will scale up our daily testing capacity.”Authorities had also anticipated a surge in Covid-19 cases in this festive month for which strict adherence to Covid-19 norms will be enforced. BMC has planned to scale up its testing capacity. Since September, the BMC has been conducting anywhere between 8, 000 and 15,000 tests on a daily basis, 30-40% of which comprised rapid antigen tests. The civic body is now targeting up to 24,000 daily tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-starting-today-citizens-can-call-bmc-control-room-for-nearest-covid-testing-centre/story-Co5GsBitRRFdVFSoJ14s1O.html

Legally, it is possible. The rule laid down by the central government states that no person can trade or do commerce in cigarettes or any other tobacco product, unless when such product is sold, supplied or distributed by him/her, it bears thereon on its label the specified health warning,” said the official.Also read | Health warnings on each cigarette may help reduce smokingThe ban can be imposed under sub-section 2 of section 7 of the cigarettes and other tobacco products (prohibition of advertisement and regulation of trade and commerce, production, supply and distribution) Act, 2003, the official added.However, with such products readily available across the city, a second official said it would be difficult to ensure strict compliance if the ban is actually put in force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-government-mulls-ban-on-sale-of-loose-cigarettes-beedis/story-WkkB7saORCP6wZfqs7JcdP.html

02-11-2020||Election:||Will skip voting: Transgenders rue lack of facilities at polling booths||A large number of transgenders living in Patna are unhappy with inadequate facilities for the community members at the polling stations and mulling to skip voting on November 3. As per the district administration, there are 137 transgender voters 94 assembly constituencies which will go to polls on November 3.Several transgenders said that they would skip voting as no political party has included transgenders’ welfare in their manifesto nor polling booths have arrangement of third line for them.Reshma Prasad, transgender activist and also member of National Council for Transgender Persons, said, “Not a single party has mentioned transgenders’ welfare in their manifesto. Apart from this, no awareness drive was conducted among transgenders. Election commission has also not given adequate facility to transgenders for casting their votes.”She said, “10 years back, I was living with a male identity in the same colony. Now I wear saree. Standing in female queue may cause discomfort due to unfavourable public reaction. Who will take responsibility if anybody makes mockery or misbehave?”Similar woes echoed 26-year-old dancer transwoman living in Danapur constituency. She said, “If there can be ‘pink booths’ for women voters and special arrangements for physically disabled voters, why can’t we get just a separate queue to stand in public? We often face humiliation while mixing in male or female queues.”Another transwoman of Digha constituency said, “I would press NOTA as none of the political party has visited us nor any candidate has promised betterment of our community. If they are boycotting us, we will do the same.”“Our struggle will continue until we get social acceptance at educational institutions and workplaces. Contesting political parties have not considered us for seeking vote, how can we expect they will stand for our community?”, said 28-year-old third gender who works in an NGO.As per electoral rolls released by the Election Commission, there are altogether 2,344 transgender voters eligible to exercise their franchise in the Bihar Assembly election.Prasad said, “There are around 40,000 transgenders in voting age across Bihar.

02-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi AQI continues to remain very poor, at 310 on Monday||Delhi’s air quality remained in the “very poor” category on Monday morning as per the data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The capital recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 310 at 7am on Monday.The 24-hour average AQI was 364 on Sunday. Except for Thursday, when AQI had dropped to 297, the air quality remained in very poor category all of last week.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Scientists said over 3,000 incidents of stubble fires in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on Saturday contributed to 40% of PM 2.5 load in Delhi’s air -- the highest so far.Vijay Soni, scientist, IMD, air quality division, said, “The only reason Delhi escaped the impact of severe air quality is because of favourable meteorological conditions. Wind speed ranged from 10 to 18 kmph on Sunday which aided dispersal but air quality can deteriorate if the high number of farm fires persist.”Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union, agreed that the number of farm fires is unusually high. “This is because of two reasons. One is that farmers are agitating against the farm bills. They are not in a mood to comply with directions. They are also looking to complete harvesting in the next 10 days. There is little monitoring by law enforcing agencies also because of widespread agitation. Farm fires are particularly high in Barnala, Bhatinda, Ludhiana and surrounding areas,” he said.Meanwhile, IMD predicted that the city will experience a minimum temperature of 11 degree Celsius on Monday with fog and mist in the morning which will clear later in the day. At 30 degree Celsius, the maximum temperature is also predicted to be marginally lesser than Sunday’s 30.6 degree Celsius.Indicating an early onset of winter, the minimum temperature in Delhi dropped to 11.4 degree Celsius -- 5 degrees below normal -- on Sunday morning.This came after October was the coldest Delhi has experienced in 58 years, with the mean minimum temperature for the month at 17.2 degrees Celsius. November also started on a very cold note suggesting colder days ahead.“A western disturbance is impacting the higher reaches of the Himalayas. The minimum temperature has dipped because of that. Colder conditions are likely this month,” said K Sathi Devi, head, National Weather Forecasting Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-aqi-continues-to-remain-very-poor-at-310-on-monday/story-AiHrqTjOpn3plX7sfxqwHJ.html
02-11-2020||Election:||Over 15% candidates did not file I-T returns||With the end of election campaign for second phase of elections for 94 assembly constituencies going to the polls on November 3, some startling facts have come to the fore about the nominees of the these seats.Nearly 15 per cent candidates did not file their income tax returns irrespective of their incomes.It has come to light during analysis of their affidavits, submitted with their nomination forms before the election department officials and uploaded on the websites of the Election Commission of India (ECI) as well as the districts’ official sites.Altogether 1,463 persons have filed their papers for contesting the elections for these seats. However, more than 200 contestants have not filed their income tax return before filing the papers for the election. The candidates from 11 constituencies of Muzaffarpur district have topped the chart of this list as nearly 42% of them have not filed their income tax return. “There are 95 candidates in the battle for ballot this time for 11 seats. Forty out of them have admitted through affidavits that they had never filed their income tax,” said Pramod Kumar, a social activist and an independent data analyst from Muzaffarpur.“We have analysed the data from entire state, filed by the contestants for second phase elections. And many interesting facts have come out. This fact is one of them. They have not furnished their permanent account number (PAN), issued by the Income Tax Department for financial transactions, even after they showed their income over Rs 5 lakh per annum, the lower limit of filing an ITR for any financial year. It indicates that most of the candidates are illiterate on their financial management front,” said Kumar.“Ironically, three toppers of the list of the richest candidates, too have never filed their ITR and they have asserted it through their affidavits. Jagdish Prasad Verma, an RLSP candidate from Patna Sahib is one of them. Chandrika Rai of JD(U) from Parsa in Saran and Suman Kumar Mahaseth of VIP are other two candidates. Verma admits that his income is Rs 11 crore per annum, while Rai and Mahaseth earn Rs 11 crore and Rs 9 crore respectively,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/over-15-candidates-did-not-file-i-t-returns/story-MMNPvPdGMT9XvpEZJOoEBM.html
02-11-2020||Election:||In Bihar, PM Modi warns against ‘jungle raj’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the third leg of his Bihar assembly election campaign in Chapra on Sunday and urged the electorate to defeat the opposition which, he said, had presided over “jungle raj” in the state during its 15-year reign.Without naming the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Modi said that some parties were working for the welfare of their families instead of the development of the state. “Self-serving dynasts treat the state and government as their personal properties. No one from the families of Modi or Nitish Babu has reached the corridors of power,” the PM said in a speech in Samastipur.Addressing the people of 24 assembly constituencies from Chapra and 21 assembly seats from Samastipur, PM Modi said the high turnover in the first phase of Bihar assembly polls on October 28 had proved political pundits wrong.“The trends from the first phase of polls show the NDA is coming back to power again. It is clear that {chief minister} Nitish Kumar is all set to form government again,” said the PM.The second phase of elections on November 3 is crucial in the NDA’s quest to return to power. Out of the 94 seats going to the polls in the second phase, the BJP is contesting 46 and Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), 43. The remaining five seats are being contested by their smaller partners. In 2015, the JD(U) had won 30 of the seats that are up for grabs on November 3. This time, it has fielded 19 new faces; the fate of two ministers will be decided in the phase.For the BJP, the second phase is equally crucial in its quest to emerge as the single biggest party in the assembly. The party contested 29 seats in first phase and will contest 35 more in the third phase on November 7.Without taking the name of any political party, but in an oblique reference to the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) of the late Ram Vilas Paswan, Modi said efforts by some to create confusion in the minds of the voters had been nullified by the people of Bihar. LJP leader Chirag Paswan has pulled the party out of the NDA in Bihar, citing ideological differences with Nitish Kumar, while remaining in the alliance at the Centre“On one hand, you have a government with double engines {at the Centre and state}; on the other hand, there are two prince (referring to RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Congress’s Rahul Gandhi). While the double engine government of Bihar is committed to the state’s development, the two princes are busy saving their thrones,” he added.“You must have seen 3-4 years ago during UP elections, double Yuvarajs there as well, climbed on top of the bus, wore black jackets and used to visit villages while waving,” he added in an apparent reference to the Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi.Targeting young voters who are seemingly distancing themselves from the present government, Modi asked women of the state to tell them about the situation that existed in Bihar 15 years ago. “First-time voters should remember how much effort it took to pull out the state out of this situation. Ask your mothers how they feared kidnappers...The lantern has only spread darkness,” he said, referring to the RJD’s election symbol.“I am sure that with your vote you will save Bihar from getting bimaar {sick} again,” the PM said.The PM said the government had opened up 30 passport centres, including one in Gopalganj, for those aspiring to go abroad, adding that now there was no need to travel all the way to Patna to secure a passport.The region has one of the populations employed in West Asia.“We have removed the language barrier by emphasising the {importance of the} mother tongue as the medium of instruction in the new education policy,” he said.“The Bihar government laid special emphasis on providing electricity, water and road connectivity to people across the state,” Modi said, adding that the Centre had implemented railway projects worth Rs 2,500 crore in the state.PM said that the BJP has decided to form 1,000 farmer producer organisations in Bihar. “Also, the central government has created a fund of ₹1 lakh crore for agriculture infrastructure for our farmers,” the PM said.With the biggest festival of Bihar, Chhath Puja, taking place after the election results are out on November 10, Modi appealed to the sentiments of women. “I want to tell the mothers in Bihar, your son in Delhi will make sure you celebrate Chhath Puja with pride. I won’t let your family sleep hungry at night. We have ensured free grains for the poor till Chhath puja,” he saidModi accused the Opposition of politicising the February 14, 2019 Pulwama terror attack, which left 40 paramilitary troopers dead, and demoralising the armed forces. “The Pakistani admission has shown the real face of opposition,” he said in an apparent reference to an admission by a Pakistani politician that Pakistan had a hand in the attack.He paid rich tributes to the 20 Indian troops who died in a June 15 clash with Chinese soldiers in the Galwan valley in Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/in-bihar-pm-modi-warns-against-jungle-raj/story-FAuU1mvs3cqIW6etIbqosJ.html

No FIR has been registered yet in the case,” Atul Kumar Thakur, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South), said.After the video went viral, Baba ka Dhaba was the cynosure of many eyes across the country, including celebs from showbiz who posted appeals asking people to go there and get themselves a meal.A day after the heartbreaking video, #Babakadhaba was trending on Twitter and the food joint was flooded with more customers than it had seen in 30 years of being in business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/baba-ka-dhaba-owner-accuses-youtuber-of-misappropriation-of-funds/story-soByr6xKWyZDkjhFjD5AxN.html
02-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The republic of pink||Pink, but slightly faded—this is their colour. The flowers of floss-silk — or kurejia — trees are blossoming across Delhi. A brash display stands near the ITO crossing. Another is showing off adjacent to the Defence Colony flyover. There’s also a stunning row running along the driveway to Ambience Mall in Gurugram. A most magnificent spectacle is inside the Shantinath-Satya Marg roundabout in Chanakyapuri.The most heart-touching sight of these trees, currently in blossom, is by the lakeside in Lodhi Garden. This weekday afternoon there’s no one in this secluded corner of the park — except for a duck stranded in the middle of the water, like a motorboat without fuel.The surface of the lake is crowded with the inverted images of the many trees reflecting into its still water. You can see the sun too, as well as the birds flying above. The lake appears to be aglow, here and there, with smidgens of something pink—that’s the reflections of the kurejia flowers above. Under the sun’s momentary glare, some of these blurs momentarily burn into utter whiteness before regaining their pink. The fragility makes the kurejia reflections look more delicate.And then some more magic.Like most flower-laden trees, kurejia’s flowers keep falling off their branches. Even as we talk, they are dropping off one after another, noiselessly, into the water. Each detached flower occasionally floats across the reflected image of the tree it was recently a part of. The sight is surreal, as if a freshly departed soul was surveying the details of its dead past. In a corner of the lake, a solitary pink kurejia happens to be lying atop a mass of slow-drifting dry leaves, as if being carried to its funeral by a crowd of professional mourners.The most unlucky of these pink flowers have fallen on the shrubberies skirting the lake. There, they have crash-landed most crudely, their petals squashed across leaves and grasses. Distorted into weird shapes, the flowers are looking ugly. Some of these must have died a day or two ago, for they have turned brown. And now you again look up at the trees to see the kurejias, still alive and so pretty. They too will soon fall.“The flowers are in season for some more days, and then they will go away,” says a gardener. Come before it gets too late. And if it gets too late, then come in February when they will be back, briefly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-republic-of-pink/story-TZf0vMG3w44p9ecWDBluZK.html

Minister Ashu tells Ludhiana MC commissioner||In an unusual directive, Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu has asked the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) commissioner to check the shoes of civic body’s field staff to see whether they actually went to the field or were whiling away their time in office or at home. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal was briefed by the minister on the sidelines of a cycle rally on Saturday and was told to direct all officials and employees to visit the field to ensure proper compliance in various projects being undertaken in the city. “I told the commissioner that it is easy to check the efficiency of field officials. Check their shoes. If their shoes are carrying enough dust, you will get to know that they are out on the field,” said minister Ashu, who is MLA from the Ludhiana (West) constituency. Also, he asked the commissioner to direct the officials to give an hour (11am to 12noon) to address the grievances of the councillors. Sabharwal said he has instructed the zonal commissioners and superintendent engineers to conduct public dealings between 9am and 11am from Monday so as to address the grievances of residents. “This will boost understanding between the officials and the councillors as the majority of the public representatives have a grouse that the former are not available on this or that pretext. More interaction will bring an end to the unnecessary confrontation and dharnas,” said Ashu. Sabharwal said to improve the efficiency he has directed the officials to conduct a meeting after 5pm on Wednesday besides telling all supervising engineers to check the ongoing development works in the city on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dustier-the-field-staff-s-shoes-better-their-performance-minister-ashu-tells-ludhiana-mc-commissioner/story-AOKCZv5uvHC2yM70v8KTTI.html

An Uttar Pradesh (UP)-based syndicate is suspected to be behind the smuggling. The consignment was to be transported to UP’s Moradabad city. The officers are on the lookout for the accused who are a part of the racket. Recently, DRI officers had received inputs about a syndicate from UP that was involved in the smuggling of cigarettes from Dubai to India. Based on intelligence inputs, the officers learnt that a live consignment, declaring the contraband as aluminium powder, will be imported by the syndicate through Nhava Sheva port in a container. Based on the inputs, the container was seized under the Customs Act, 1962, said DRI. “The cigarettes were found concealed cleverly under the aluminium scrap of motor vehicle engine parts and other waste,” a statement from DRI read. An officer said, “Foreign-brand cigarettes are in high demand in party circuits at metro cities. The cigarettes had to be taken to New Delhi from UP. As there is strict vigilance at the Tughlakabad port (in Delhi), the syndicate had planned to store the consignment at a facility in Moradabad before transporting it to Delhi via road. The consignment had to be transported from Navi Mumbai to UP by the railways’ freight service.” This is the third major consignment of foreign cigarettes seized from the Nhava Sheva port by DRI Mumbai during the Covid-19 pandemic period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/70-lakh-smuggled-foreign-brand-cigarettes-worth-14-crore-seized-from-navi-mumbai-port/story-duD2rEKGyhsNG1RMl7iDvN.html

They will also question the loan recipients to determine their alleged role in the fraud, as police suspect some of them to be aware of the irregularities.The suspects were booked for cheating and forgery (sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code) and produced before a magistrate from where they were sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gang-providing-loans-fraudulently-via-finance-firm-nabbed-in-noida/story-DazLWu6SsUTbWobsx0M0zO.html
02-11-2020||Noida||Noida: 35-year-old arrested for extorting money while pretending to be govt official||Noida: A 35-year-old man was nabbed by the Noida police Saturday night for allegedly extorting money from a businessman while pretending to be a senior official of the government and threatening him that he would send the victim to prison as he “knew” other senior government officials.The suspect was identified as Ankit Dwivedi. He is from Kannauj district in Uttar Pradesh and lived in a rented accommodation in Sector 53.According to the police, a complaint was filed against him by a man named Rajveer Singh, a departmental store owner, who alleged that the suspect had been extorting ₹40,000 monthly from him for the past six months and had also taken expensive liquor bottles from him. Based on his complaint, a case of extortion and cheating had been registered at the Sector 58 police station. “Two of the complainants’ sons are history sheets with cases against them under the Narcotics Drugs Act. It seems the suspect was threatening him as well that he’ll send him to prison, in order to extort money from the victim,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.Police officers said the complaint alleged that the suspect allegedly claimed to be acquainted with senior government officials and often used that to intimidate the victim.Dwivedi allegedly had a Honda Civic car on which there were fake government department stickers, said the police. He also claimed to be a frequent guest at a five star hotel located under the Sector 58 police jurisdiction and would often meet the victim in that area to show that he was really living there.The suspect was nabbed from in Sector 55 near the hotel at 11.50pm, hours after he had allegedly taken ₹10,000 from the victim, the police said. The money and the car were recovered, along with gold jewellery and an expensive wrist watch, the police added.The suspect also writes a social media blog, said officers.“He would specifically target people with some criminal background in order to threaten and intimidate them, while pretending to be a government official who knew other government officials. We are verifying his criminal history from other districts as well to determine how many other people he duped. We are also finding out his bank account details to gather more information,” said the DCP.The suspect was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-35-year-old-arrested-for-extorting-money-while-pretending-to-be-govt-official/story-9hio0HsW87hS40JKG2NIHO.html
02-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Road safety month launched||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar police on Sunday launched the road safety month aimed at raising awareness among the public about the traffic rules.According to police officials, the month-long programme will focus on five Es – education, enforcement, engineering, emergency and environment. On the occasion, a bike and car rally for traffic awareness was flagged off from the police commissionerate in Sector 108. The officials said that the traffic awareness programme this year will emphasise on environment friendly initiatives. People will be asked to keep their vehicles in good condition to check air pollution, they said.Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said that this year ‘environment’” has been added to the traffic programme as Noida’s air quality continues to deteriorate. “We have planned different initiatives considering all the five Es. We will organise awareness programmes in different schools and colleges for road safety. We will also do enforcement and seek people’s participation,” Saha said. The DCP said that residents can join the traffic police as traffic volunteers and traffic wardens. “We will coordinate with the residents welfare associations (RWAs) and select traffic volunteers. They will be deployed near their housing societies and sectors to manage traffic with the police,” he said. On enforcement part, the police will launch intensive drive to check traffic violations such as riding bike without helmet, speeding, drunken driving, using mobile phone while driving, wrong-side driving, and unauthorised parking. Saha said that the Noida traffic police have already launched a control room to establish communication with the residents. Alok Singh, police commissioner, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the UP government has already announced to pay Rs 2,000 to the good Samaritans who help road accident victims reach hospital and save lives. “The police will not question the good Samaritans. We will reward them for their noble works,” Singh said. The police last year had identified 33 ‘black’ (accident-prone) spots in the district. “In the one-month drive, we will take initiatives and try to remove the black spots and ensure no accidents take place there,” the police commissioner said.Singh said that the Covid-19 lockdown had forced people indoor for a few months and the city’s air had become clean. “But again people have started their normal activities. We should mend our ways and not wait for another such pandemic to learn a lesson,” he said. Rohit Baluja, director, Institute of Road Safety Education, who attended the Sunday’s event, said that most road accidents take place due to indiscipline by road users. “People violate traffic rules which lead to accidents. In 2019, a total of 1.54 lakh people had died in road accident in India as per National Crime Records Bureau. Every year, around 23,000 people die and 28,000 are injured in road accidents in Uttar Pradesh only,” he said.A number of local residents and school children also attended the inaugural programme. Alok Singh, a resident of Sector Alpha-1 in Greater Noida, said that the violators should be made to do community service. “The cash penalty does not yield good result. The traffic violators should be engaged in community service for one-two hours. They should also attend traffic orientation programme so that such violations are not repeated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-road-safety-month-launched/story-h1vSkgYL9fpELP8jkPXF8J.html
02-11-2020||Noida||Anti-Human Trafficking Units notified as police stations in Uttar Pradesh||Noida: The Uttar Pradesh government has notified the Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTU) as police stations in the state. UP has AHTU’s in 35 districts, including Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Meerut and Lucknow. On October 20, Awnish Awasthi, the state additional chief secretary, issued an order for setting up AHTUs in the rest of the 40 districts in UP. All these units will be developed as separate police stations which will facilitate rescue and rehabilitation of children and other persons. The ministry of home affairs guidelines state that the trafficking of human beings is a crime committed in order to target/drive a human being into an exploitative situation, with the aim to make profits; such exploitation may take many forms, for example commercial sexual exploitation, child labour, forced labour, bonded labour.Devendra Kumar, inspector at AHTU, Gautam Budh Nagar, said he has received the information about government notification making the unit a police station. “This will facilitate the process and the team will be able to help the victims efficiently. There are eight persons in the unit including one inspector and two sub-inspectors, at Noida. We hope the team size will be increased and infrastructure will be augmented after the new initiative,” he said.The government has sanctioned ₹12 lakh to each existing AHTU and ₹15 lakh to set up the new units in the state.As of now the unit operates from the Noida Police office in Sector 14 A. Love Kumar, additional commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, said he will go through the government order and take necessary measures. Satya Prakash, programme manager of FXB India Suraksha – Childline, an NGO that works towards child rights, said that the government order notifying AHTUs as police stations will definitely help in the rescue and rehabilitation of these people. “At present, the police and Childline rescue people but sometimes face problems in jurisdiction issues. Sometimes, two police stations pass the buck in registration of FIR over jurisdiction. The AHTUs will be able to register FIRs in cases which will facilitate the process,” he said. Prakash said that sometimes, a missing child from one district is found in the neighbouring district. “In such cases AHTUs in one district can swiftly contact their counterparts in other districts” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/anti-human-trafficking-units-notified-as-police-stations-in-uttar-pradesh/story-4useTt5pTVLkLWR5Q3RGEO.html
02-11-2020||Noida||Trial for ‘e-corridor’ on Yamuna Expressway to start on November 25||Noida: A month-long high-tech trial for electric vehicles (EV) will be conducted Yamuna Expressway beginning November 25 to examine the viability of EVs on expressway and the charging stations and other basic facilities for the project. The ‘e-corridor’ on the Yamuna Expressway is proposed to be the first under the Ease of Doing Business programme of the Advance Services for Social and Administrative Reforms (ASSAR), a private entity supported by the central government.On Sunday, Gautam Budh Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh flagged off three e-taxis in a traffic rally from the commissionerate office in Sector 108. “The e-vehicles are environment friendly. The use of e-vehicles will lead to a healthy environment as they are better than petrol/diesel powered vehicles. A trial for EVs on the Yamuna Expressway is scheduled for later this month. A private firm engaged three of its e-taxis in the traffic rally on Sunday,” he said. The taxis were provided by Gurugram-based cab aggregator Blue Smart Mobility. “We displayed three e-cabs (Tata Tigor models) in the programme. In one-and-a-half hour charting, the e-vehicle can run up to 220 km. We have also placed a Covid safety sheet inside the vehicles to separate riders and drivers. We have launched our services in the National Capital Region. People can download our app from the Google Play Store too books cabs,” said Akash Grover, executive assistant, Blue Smart Mobility.Abhijeet Sinha, director, ASSAR, said that his organisation associated with the Noida police in the traffic safety month. “From November 25, we have planned to conduct a trial of EVs from Greater Noida to Agra on National Highways to test the EV viability. This will be a one month trail on the Yamuna Expressway. A similar trial will be conducted on NH 48, which connects Delhi to Jaipur,” he said. The programme will be launched on the 96th birth anniversary of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on November 25. In the first phase, trials will be conducted on the Yamuna Expressway only. Once this is completed, trials on the Delhi-Jaipur route will be started.He said that in the trial, the number of charging stations needed, total charging points, cafeteria, budgeting, etc. needed on the route will be examined. The combined strength of corridors which will be examined on the Yamuna Expressway (Noida-Agra) and NH 48 (Delhi - Jaipur) will be 500 km. According to an estimate, eight-10 charging stations will be set up along the Yamuna Expressway and a similar number on NH 48.Sinha said that the e-highway project can be developed in 90 days. “The e-highway will be technology-led. The e-vehicles will be connected to nearest charting stations digitally. If a vehicle breaks down, help will reach within 30 minutes,” he said. Pratap Chandra Sarangi, minister of state for Animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries and MSME, will flag off the trail on November 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/trial-for-e-corridor-on-yamuna-expressway-to-start-on-november-25/story-pVhcqt6vqW0lqVpfecQh2O.html
02-11-2020||Mumbai||Beer sales in Maharashtra drop 62.5% from pre-Covid||The sales of beer in Maharashtra fell by 62.5% per day last month, compared to the period before Covid-19, which officials attributed to people avoiding cold products. Sales fell to 3 lakh litres per day in October, down from 8 lakh litres per day in January, officials said. “Due to Covid-19, people are being asked not to consume cold products. This has played a huge role in people avoiding cold beer, impacting its sale,” said Kantilal Umap, state excise commissioner. However, sales of other liquor were not impacted much. The sale of country liquor is about 9 lakh litres per day, compared to 10 lakh litres in the pre-Covid-19 days. Whiskey, vodka, rum and other sales have reached approximately 6 lakh litres, almost the same before Covid-19 struck the city in March, Umap said. The daily overall sales of alcohol in the state fell to ₹35 crore, from the average ₹38-40 crore. “Beer is the leading selling item in wine shops. However, sales have fallen in the past six months ever since liquor shops opened in May. Our customers are avoiding chilled beer as it can lead to developing a cold, one of the symptoms of Covid-19,” said Arvind Miskin, president, association of progressive retail liquor vendors.Customer said that they have stopped it for health reasons. “In Covid-19 days, we have been avoiding frozen and chilled items as it can lead to a cold,” said Satendra Chouhan, who works in a private firm. Liquor has been one of the major sources of revenue for the state government. The state has been able to garner ₹6,024 crore as excise duty in sales of liquor from April 1 to October 23, 2020. This was one of the reasons the government allowed opening of liquor shops from May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/beer-sales-in-maharashtra-drop-62-5-from-pre-covid/story-pf0TIcW788qPwDr7PMzEQL.html
02-11-2020||Delhi||AAP calls North MCD ‘corrupt’, demands CAG probe; BJP says allegation ‘baseless’||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation of corruption, and said the civic body has been under-recording the amount of property tax it has collected every year, and demanded the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) investigate the matter.The BJP, which governs the three municipal corporations in the city, hit back, calling the allegations “baseless”.“The North MCD should be collecting ₹2,100 crore as property tax from 12 lakh people every year, but records show that only ₹700 crores is collected annually from four lakh people. The remaining ₹1400 crore is siphoned off,” said Durgesh Pathak, AAP’s in charge of municipal corporation affairs.He also said, “The BJP leaders are looting ₹1400 crores collected by the MCD in the name of property tax, due to which they cannot pay their employees — doctors, nursing staff, teachers and sanitation workers. AAP demands that this matter should be thoroughly investigated by the CAG.”BJP’s Delhi unit spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “AAP is a bunch of people who are experts on baseless statements. The party is in power in the Delhi government, and if they feel there is any kind of scam in MCDs they are free to recommend a CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation] probe, or else they should stop churning baseless allegations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-calls-north-mcd-corrupt-demands-cag-probe-bjp-says-allegation-baseless/story-hw1vtNwgi0fBdzGIGT74UI.html
02-11-2020||Gurugram||Staffer given clean chit over rape allegations at Gurugram private hospital||A person accused of raping a woman in the intensive care unit of Fortis Hospital in sector 44 last week was given a clean chit by the city police on Sunday. Police said the suspects, who was a contractual staff at the hospital, was questioned and given a clean chit after no concrete evidence was found to prove his culpability. The woman, in her twenties, is a tuberculosis patient and was admitted to the hospital on October 21. She had informed her father about the alleged sexual assault through a hand-written note on Tuesday, following which a complaint was registered by the police. The main accused and another person were X-ray technicians who had gone to scan the patient, who was admitted on October 21. Police have now initiated proceedings to quash the FIR in the case. The police on Saturday had recorded one-page statement of the woman, and according to the investigators, she contradicted the details of her complaint before her legal counsel, police, the board of doctors and her father, police said. The woman is still recovering and is under observation. She has been provided police protection, said officers. Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police (headquarters), said that they have scanned all the CCTV footage and they could not get any substantial corroborating evidence to prove the crime. “The victim has alleged that she was raped by the X-Ray staff on October 7 and 8, but she was brought to the hospital on October 21. She has presumed things which never happened and such cases have been reported in the past where patients undergoing treatment hallucinate and imagine things,” she said. Kundu said the two men who came with the portable X-Ray machine had immediately left and a woman technician performed the X-Ray. She said when the woman technician, as per scanning protocol, asked the patient if she was pregnant, the woman thought she had conceived, Kundu said. Police said the main suspect and another contractual staffer, who was questioned along with him, have been allowed to resume their duties at the hospital. Police said the patient will be counselled by a psychologist. The police said the family suspected that the incident took place between October 21 (when she was admitted) and October 27 (when she fully regained consciousness). The victim had informed her father about the alleged incident through a handwritten note on Tuesday after she gained consciousness. The family then approached the police and a case was registered on Tuesday at Sushant Lok police station. A board of doctors from the Civil Hospital conducted a medical investigation on Wednesday and stated that sexual assault cannot be ruled out. A police team has been deployed in the room and protection has been provided to her. The entire area is under scanner, said police. In an earlier statement, the hospital had said: “With 58% female staff, women’s dignity and safety is our utmost priority and we have acted in accordance with this ethos from the very start. We have full faith in our system and know that truth and justice will prevail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/staffer-given-clean-chit-over-rape-allegations-at-gurugram-private-hospital/story-9pOAqzZ6U4bxu8kru03WmM.html
02-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt lists over 800 open spaces for residents to burn crackers during Diwali||The Delhi government has published a list of over 800 open spaces across the city where people will be permitted to burn “green” firecrackers between 8pm and 10pm on Diwali.The list comes even as the Delhi government is scheduled to launch a campaign on Tuesday urging people not to burn fire crackers this Diwali in light of air pollution, which is a greater concern this year owing to the present Covid-19 crisis.Diwali this year will be celebrated on November 14.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai, in line with a 2018 Supreme Court order, said the government has allowed the manufacture and sale of only green crackers, which contain fewer polluting substances as compared to traditional ones, and are less noisy as well.In 2018 and 2019, despite the ban on the sale of traditional crackers and due to the low availability of low-emission varieties, pollution levels in the city saw a major spike after Diwali. Till last year, green varieties of only ‘phuljhari’ (sparklers), rocket and ‘anar’(flower pots) were available. More options are available in markets this year.Rai also said, “I appeal to people to not burn any fire crackers at all this year. Because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, health hazards due to air pollution could turn more dangerous. If anyone really wants to burn firecrackers, then please use only green crackers.”The list of 824 locations, published on the Delhi government’s website, includes parks, vacant plots, school playgrounds and open grounds covering all of the city’s 272 municipal wards. Some of the prominent locations include Buddha Park in Mayur Vihar, a park in B block of Chanakyapuri, Ramleela ground in Laxmibai Nagar, Ajmal Khan Park in Karol Bagh, Sudarshan Park in Moti Nagar, West Mehram Nagar Park in Delhi Cantonment, CBD ground opposite Hotel Leela and Gandhi Park in Saket.A senior government official said the list was released to ensure that even if people choose to burn green firecrackers, they do it in common locations that are more open, instead of streets, lanes and parking areas in residential areas.Local police and administration officials are also likely to set a cap on the size of gatherings in each open space. Enforcement teams will also remain active during Diwali, a senior official in the government’s revenue department said.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi resident welfare associations’ front, said: “We shall be asking members to celebrate Diwali without firecrackers this year. We have already started campaigns through social media platforms. The initiative on part of the government to identify locations for community celebrations reflect good intent, but it can’t be said how much it can actually persuade people. We need better awareness campaigns and stricter enforcement of existing norms.”A total of 260 applications for firecracker shop licences have been received so far by Delhi Police, which issued 138 licences till Thursday -- a number much higher compared to 2019 when only 97 had applied of which 62 had received permission to sell firecrackers. Eligible shopkeepers can start selling from Monday.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the Centre for Science and Environment, said: “The government has to invest in an intensive campaign this year to encourage people not to burn firecrackers. The air pollution problem and spike in covid-19 cases together can create a health disaster. With issuing a list of designated locations for burning firecrackers and setting a time window, the government is apparently trying to ensure that residential areas witness less pollution because of firecrackers during Diwali. But, with that, the government should also make firecracker sales’ licensing norms more stringent in order to curb accessibility to firecrackers.”In 2019, the Delhi Police arrested 166 persons and registered 315 cases against people found bursting firecrackers on Diwali night in violation of the Supreme Court’s guidelines – mostly caught with firecrackers which did not qualify as green crackers and on the basis of complaints concerning violation of the time window between 8 pm and 10 pm.“The police will patrol residential areas during Diwali to ensure that prescribed green crackers are burnt during the stipulated time. Violators will be booked under relevant provisions of law depending on the nature of the violation,” said deputy commissioner of police Eish Singhal, spokesperson of Delhi Police.(with inputs from Anvit Srivastava)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-lists-over-800-open-spaces-for-residents-to-burn-crackers-during-diwali/story-jnQtkpHUaClLsVxIQ19hKM.html
02-11-2020||Delhi||Hotels and guest house owners worried about fire clearance||Two months after they were allowed to reopen their businesses, owners of hotels and guest houses in the national capital are a worried lot. While their businesses were already badly hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a lack of clarity about new fire safety norms, notified by the Delhi government in May last year, have compounded their concerns.The Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners Association (DHROA) met state urban development Satyendar Jain last month to request him to extend by a year the deadline for the implementation of the new norms that are currently under review. The existing deadline was March 31, 2020.The Delhi government had notified the new fire safety norms in May, three months after a fire in Karol Bagh’s Arpit Palace hotel claimed 17 lives.But following objections raised by hotel and guest house owners, the Delhi government had in November last year constituted a sub-committee chaired by a special commissioner of police (licensing) to review and make appropriate recommendations for fire safety in these institutions. The owners were given time till March 31 this year to comply with the new norms.Mohit Shah, general secretary, DHROA, said, “There is no clarity on what the status of the new fire safety norms is. We are in a Catch-22 situation. Our establishments have clearance from the fire department as per the old norms. We don’t know if we should carry out changes as per the new norms or not, as there is no clarity about the new norms. We want the deadline to be extended till March 31, 2021 so that we can run our businesses without any fear.”However, this committee is yet to submit its report, a senior government official said. A senior Delhi Police officer with the licensing department said, “The report is almost final and is expected to be submitted in the coming week.”When contacted, Jain said, “We will extend the time for compliance due to the Covid-19 situation.”Hotel owners said they want the deadline to be extended at the earliest. Murli Mani, owner of a hotel in Karol Bagh and DHROA chairman, said, “The business is badly hit due to Covid. We are operating the business in fear due to a lack of clarity about the fire norms. In case there is a fire incident, will the existing fire NOC [no-objection certificate] be considered valid? The fire department is also not renewing expired NOCs. What will happen to those people? ”A senior Delhi Fire Services (DFS) official, who asked not to be named, said, “Those who have not complied with the changes notified in May 2019, do not technically have a valid NOC. As the deadline for implementation has not been extended and the amendment to the new rules not notified, the rules that were notified in May are in force.”As per the new amendments, kitchen or cooking activity in any form is not allowed on rooftops or basements of buildings, and storage of inflammable materials or temporary roofing is banned in terraces.Besides, inflammable materials — like carpets and wooden or foam panellings — are not allowed on passages, corridors and staircases of buildings, and storage of gas cylinders in violation of standards prescribed by the National Building Code is also banned.The hotel owners had raised objections to a few provisions in the amendment, such as installation of Carbon monoxide detectors and fire check or protection doors, and no fire NoCs to hotels with more than four floors. “We had objected to installation of fire check doors in guesthouses and suggested that sprinklers be allowed. There were other issues which we had raised. We want our fire NOC to be considered valid till next year. The government should notify the new norms at the earliest,” said Boddy Lohia, president of Mahipalpur hotel owners’ association.Former DFS chief AK Sharma said that the government should notify the new norms so that hotel owners can comply with it. “The government should take cognisance and extend the deadline for implementation. Now that the deadline for implementation has not been extended so far, the new rules notified in May are currently in force. But hotel owners can’t be held responsible as the government is yet to notify the final norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hotels-and-guest-house-owners-worried-about-fire-clearance/story-HhItHnoqswb577zNhb49YN.html
02-11-2020||Delhi||40% of Delhi’s PM2.5 on Sunday from over 3,000 farm fires, says IMD||Over 3,000 incidents of stubble fires in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on Saturday contributed to 40% of PM2.5 load in Delhi’s air -- the highest so far, scientists said. With over 6,000 points of fire visible over thee states in the satellite thermal imaging on Sunday, the air quality in Delhi-NCR may further deteriorate, they have warned. North-westerly winds blowings towards Delhi are bringing pollution particles from north-western states where farm fires are raging as well as cold air from the Himalayas, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. Farmer leaders said farm fires will continue in Punjab for at least 10 more days until harvesting of Kharif crop is complete.An unusually high number of fire counts were observed over Punjab (3,616), Haryana (162), UP (47) and MP (404) on Saturday which is impacting air quality in Delhi NCR and the entire north-western region, said air quality early warning system under the ministry of earth sciences. “There are over 6,000 fire points visible today which is extremely high. Air quality may deteriorate to a severe category in Delhi if wind speed reduces,” said Vijay Soni, scientist, IMD, air quality division.Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union, agreed that the number of farm fires is unusually high. “This is because of two reasons. One is that farmers are agitating against the farm bills. They are not in a mood to comply with directions. They are also looking to complete harvesting in the next 10 days. There is little monitoring by law enforcing agencies also because of widespread agitation. Farm fires are particularly high in Barnala, Bhatinda, Ludhiana and surrounding areas,” Lakhowal said. Soni, however, pointed out that if not for good wind speed, Delhi’s air might have plunged to the ‘severe’ category. “The only reason Delhi escaped the impact of severe air quality is because of favourable meteorological conditions. Wind speed ranged from 10 to 18 kmph on Sunday which aided dispersal but air quality can deteriorate if the high number of farm fires persist,” added Soni.The ventilation index on Sunday was approximately 10,000 m2/s on Sunday. The ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 sq metres/second is considered poor. Mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air.“On Saturday, there were 3,826 fire points according to the analysis I got. Out of that around 3,600 fires were in Punjab. It’s true that more stubble fires are being recorded in Punjab this year. Last year, a total of 19 million tonnes of paddy from Kharif season had arrived at the mandi. This time already 15 million tonnes has arrived. Out of the 4 million tonnes that is left, 2 million tonnes is Basmati which leaves a stubble that is normally used as fodder. So, I would say 75 to 80% of harvesting is done already. Let’s see what happens in the coming days,” said Trilochan Mohapatra, director general, Indian Council for Agricultural Research.“My personal understanding is that farmers’ anger against farm bills is having an impact on farm fires,” he added.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 370 at 3 pm. The 24-hour average AQI was 367 on Saturday. It was 374 on Friday, 395 on Thursday, 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday and 353 on Monday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maximum-pollution-due-to-stubble-fires-more-raging/story-Nkg5BwRPjP5A2cqbpVom7L.html
02-11-2020||Delhi||Hint of early winter? Min temperature drops 5 degrees below normal on Sunday||Indicating the early onset of winter, the minimum temperature in Delhi dropped to 11.4 degree Celsius -- 5 degrees below normal -- on Sunday morning, as cold winds from the Himalayas brought the mercury down in many parts of northwest India.This October was the coldest Delhi has experienced in 58 years, with the mean minimum temperature for the month at 17.2 degrees Celsius, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had said on Saturday. November also started on a very cold note suggesting colder days ahead. “A western disturbance is impacting the higher reaches of the Himalayas. The minimum temperature has dipped because of that. Colder conditions are likely this month,” said K Sathi Devi, head, National Weather Forecasting Centre.The long-range forecast for the next two weeks also suggests below normal temperatures over north India according to IMD Pune. “Western disturbances normally bring down temperatures but temporarily till the system ceases to impact the region. The long-range forecast suggests minimum temperature will be below normal till around November 12. Overall, La Nina years are also associated with colder winters which may be also having an impact. Though it starts getting cold from November, in the northern hemisphere December, January, February are the winter months,” explained DS Pai, senior scientist, IMD Pune. El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters. IMD is likely to issue a winter forecast later this month.The Regional Meteorological Centre, Delhi said minimum temperatures are likely to range between 10 to 12 degrees Celsius for the next three to four days. “There are no cold wave conditions yet but if the minimum temperature falls below 10 degrees with a departure of 4.5 degrees Celsius then cold wave conditions will set in. There was snowfall and rainfall in the higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday and Sunday. But there has been light snowfall so far,” explained Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. He added that farm fires are impacting Delhi’s air quality because of northwesterly winds but wind speed is moderate over 10 kmph.Minimum temperature dipped by 1 degee Celsius each in Shimla, which recorded a minimum temperature of 10.7 degrees Celsius, Chandigarh at 13.6 degrees and Amritsar at 11.4 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hint-of-early-winter-min-temperature-drops-5-degrees-below-normal-on-sunday/story-rsyhrbgszXwoHJotju8sqM.html
02-11-2020||Gurugram||30 detained for rioting over college student murder||Thirty people were detained on Sunday following a clash with the police in Ballabhgarh, as a group of over 200 persons blocked the Delhi-Agra highway demanding justice for the family of 20-year-old Nikita Tomar, who was shot dead by her stalker outside Aggarwal College on October 26.Earlier in the day, a ‘mahapanchayat’ was held at Dussehra ground over the incident. The police said the mob blocked the highway and started pelting stones at them when they intervened, leaving 10 personnel injured.OP Singh, Faridabad police commissioner, said that the family members of Tomar had called a ‘mahapanchayat’ of 36 communities in Ballabhgarh to demand justice. “Both the suspects were arrested within 36 hours and the weapon and car used in the crime were recovered from Nuh. The investigation was conducted by a special investigation team headed by an assistant commissioner of police and a speedy trial has been initiated. We have ensured strict punishment for the suspects,” he said.Singh said that while 30 people were detained, others who had directed the group to disrupt peace and give it a religious angle are being identified.Last Monday, Touseef Ahmad, a resident of Kabeer Nagar in Sohna, and his friend, Rehaan, a resident of Riwasan in Nuh, arrived in a Hyundai i20 and tried to force Tomar, a final-year physiotherapy student of Gurugram University, into their vehicle as she exited the college after writing an exam.When she resisted their attempts, Touseef chased her down and shot her in the head from close range at 3:48pm in full public view, as seen in the footage that emerged. The suspects escaped from the crime scene, leaving Tomar, who was accompanied by a friend, in a pool of blood. She was rushed to a government hospital, where she was declared dead.The entire incident was captured by CCTV cameras in the area and sent shock waves across the state, triggering protests by her classmates and students’ groups.The two suspects — of whom one is politically connected, according to the police — were arrested from Nuh on Monday and Tuesday after a massive search operation, the police said.On Sunday, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that the Centre and state governments are looking into the case. “Since the murder case of the B.Com student is being linked with ‘love jihad,’ the Centre, as well as the state government, is looking into it and considering legal provisions so that the guilty is not able to escape, and no innocent person is punished. Fast track court would be established in this case for giving strict punishment to culprits,” he said.Tomar’s murder has triggered communal rage in the region, as right-wing leaders are alleged to have made “hate speeches” in the ‘mahapanchayat’ held on Sunday, the police said.Sumer Singh Yadav, the deputy commissioner of police (Ballabhgarh), said that the people had come from Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Delhi, Nuh, Palwal and Gurugram to attend the ‘mahapanchayat’ and plans were afoot to disrupt the peace and create communal fervour. The rioters damaged a few shops too, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/thirty-detained-for-rioting-over-college-student-murder/story-3kRWkbCEDM8zQFId2hwhdP.html

02-11-2020||Pune||Pictures of Macron appear on two streets of Pune||Photos of French president Emanuel Macron were found stuck on roads in two areas in Pune. The photos have been perceived as a form of protest against the tensions between France and Turkey and comments made by Macron. The tensions between the two countries had escalated after a French school teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded on October 16 for showing caricatures of Prophet Mohammad made by a publication called Charlie Hebdo. In January 2015, a shooting at the offices of Charlie Hebdo had left 17 people dead. Subsequently, three people were stabbed to death in a church in Nice on Thursday. In the first instance that came to light on the day of Eid, October 30, the pictures were stuck when the residents of Ghorpade peth went to offer Namaz in the afternoon. “When we came out for the first time that day, it was all normal. Then, we went to offer Namaz and came back and saw the pictures stuck throughout the road stretch. We did not think much about it. The police came and cleaned it,” said a 67-year-old man whose house overlooks the street where at least 50 pictures of Macron covered the street. The same series of events was repeated by the owner of a pharmacy and of a paan stall which overlooks the street between Ghorpade peth police outpost and a local mosque. Nobody wanted to be named in the story and did not wish to name the people who did the deed. However, the police found three people and served them notices under Section 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The three have been identified as Shoaib Salim Shaikh (32), Arbaz Shakal Shaikh (26), and Zunaid Suleiman Momin (20), all residents of Ghorpade peth. The remnants of the pictures could be clearly seen even on Sunday when another street was covered in the Macron’s pictures in A4 size paper printouts. This time, the pictures appeared on a street in Parvati Paytha area of Dattawadi at night. While the people of Ghorpade peth were aware of who had stuck the pictures, the people in Parvati Paytha appeared unaware of who the perpetrators were. “I close at around 10pm and open again at 9am. Even till 3-4am, I know there was nothing there. When I came in the morning, however, the photos were stuck to the road. The people called the police on patrol and they tried to pull them off,” said Azar Memon, a paan shop owner in the vicinity “I’m working in place of my brother. I shut shop at 9pm and open at 8am. When I left there was nothing, and when I opened this morning people had gathered. People came to took pictures. I went by my work and did not pay much attention to the incident,” said a butcher at Aamir chicken shop located on the spot. Police sub inspector Arjun Naikawadi remained clueless about the pictures on the spot which is barely 400 metres from the police outpost. However, outgoing police station in-charge police inspector Devidas Gheware said, “Yes, there was information of the incident. I have relinquished charge of the police station, but was in the area for a medical camp. Policemen on the night shift went and checked it out and the locals there cleared it.”As the pictures have disappeared and a police station in-charge is absent, the stand of the local police remained unknown. “Everybody has the right of expressing their outrage and it should be expressed on the right platform too. Nobody can tolerate the disrespect of their saints. People have taken to the streets for such behaviour before as well. This should not affect the Indian people. In fact, like Muslims have supported protests against insult of Jija Mata, people of other communities should actively support these protests of Muslims. The only measure undertaken should be to ensure that nobody is inconvenienced by any of these protests,” said Anjum Inamdar, president of Mool Niwasi Muslim Manch, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pictures-of-macron-appear-on-two-streets-of-pune/story-PeGR0Wysf6QDdQDFi94xsM.html
02-11-2020||City||Pune wakes up to a walk in the park as public gardens reopen amid restrictions||With strict norms in place, as many as 81 public gardens and parks in the city opened for public at 6 am on Sunday, bringing cheer to many.The regular walkers were seen wearing masks and carrying sanitisers at various gardens in the city.At Sarasbaug, a popular destination for a morning stroll, a group of regular walkers “Sarasbaug Mitra Pariwar” felicitated the staff members and gardeners for keeping the gardens well maintained during the lockdown restrictions.Anand Saraf, a regular at Sarasbaug, was elated when the local authorities announced the opening of gardens. “I was here before 6 am, along with a few of my friends, waiting to see the lawns after seven months. The lotuses are in full bloom in the pond and there was this pleasant fragrance of dew-wet grass as we walked around the garden. I am happy to be back here after a long time,” said Saraf.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has opened 81 of its 196 gardens with certain restrictions including a ban on any Diwali related programmes and activities such as Yoga and laughing clubs.For Ajit Pimple, businessman and a resident of Kasba peth, it was a relief to be back in the gardens for his regular walks. “I have been a regular to Sarasbaug for 15 years, and these seven months were indeed difficult for it also put a dent into our habit of walking,” said Pimple.Due to the restrictions, not everyone could enter the garden. People above 65 years of age are not allowed inside the gardens.“We were not allowed to enter the garden. Sarasbaug is a special place for us, retired people, as we sit on the mounds of grass, spend time with friends and simply relax,” said Anil Gelada, a retired teacher.According to Vilas Pathak, Sarasbaug garden incharge, PMC, at least 80 people were allowed inside the garden on the first day.“Everyone was maintaining social distance and we were not allowing anyone inside without a mask,” he said.There were no sanitiser stands nor thermal scanning was done at either of the gardens, to which Ashok Ghorpode, garden superintendent, PMC, said, “We will be installing sanitiser stands within the gates, after gauging the response from people by Tuesday onwards.”While the timings created confusion among people at Sambhaji Garden, where Banu Shaikh, a security guard had a tough time explaining joggers, walkers to come back in the evening.“There is a board displayed at the gate informing people that the gardens will remain open from 6 am to 8 am and later from 5 pm to 7 pm, but still people are not aware and were requesting us to open and let them in,” said Shaikh.Dos and don’ts*Timings morning 6 am to 8 am, evening: 5 pm to 7 pm*Residents need to maintain social distance and wear mask*No permission for laughing clubs, yoga, festival programme and group activity*Kids below 10 years, citizens above 65 years are not allowed||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-wakes-up-to-a-walk-in-the-park-as-81-public-gardens-reopen-amid-restrictions/story-dMItZEQ7O4bkiTX0cy2HHI.html
02-11-2020||Pune||Despite govt directions, no fixed rates for masks||Medical stores in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad have been selling masks at no fixed rate despite the state government’s October 20 circular on the issue. According to the state government’s rate, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certified N-95 V shape (including magnum N-95 V-shape mask) should cost Rs 19. However, a range of medical stores have their own price tag for the masks. “We have informed all the chemists to sell masks according to the fixed rate as per the state government. While many chemists have different types of masks like the one made of cloth; they have different rates. Many chemists also have an old stock available which has an old maximum retail price tag and regarding it neither the food drug and the administration nor the mask manufacturer companies have given us any direction until now. So, at many places there is confusion,” said Anil Belkar, secretary, chemist association of Pune district. “Our intention is to not make money selling masks and if we find any case where a chemist is flouting rules then we will take action against them,” added Belkar. A spot visit by HT found out that prices of the same mask vary in different medical shops. Vivekanand medical were selling N-95 V shape masks at Rs 60 while Ganesh Medical at Dange Chowk claimed the same mask was Rs 80. According to Ganesh Medical store, the original N95 cost Rs 200, Mahadev Medical at Thergaon also had their own set of rates – single layer Rs 50, double layers Rs 100, and five layers Rs 200.” Same fluctuations of rates were noticed in Pimpri market, Morwadi, Sadashiv peth, Kothrud, Baner, and Aundh. Aditya Medical at Dange chowk, claimed “I don’t have the N95 masks available now, but rates are between Rs 19-Rs 50.” Vivekanand medical store who was selling other varieties of masks along with N-95 said, “The demand of N95 has gone down as people are preferring buying matching masks from cloth shops and for most people single layer, the double-layer does not matter.” “Seven days before I purchased a mask of Rs 150 from a medical shop and the same mask my friend purchased it for Rs 80 yesterday (October 31),” said Rushikesh Phadnis, a resident. “On October 23, we sent a circular to all chemists regarding the selling of masks at the rates fixed by the state government. Even if they have old stock, they have to sell masks at new rates. Till now we have done 336 inspections in Pune and Pimpri and Chinchwad among which 22 have been given show-cause notice. The inspection will continue further as well,” said Suresh Patil, joint commissioner, food and drug administration, Pune.Box Description of Masks; MRP per piece + GST (in Rs); NIOSH certified N-95 V shape (Including *Magnum N-95 V shape mask); Rs 19 2 NIOSH certified N-95 3D mask (Including *Magnum N-95 MH 3D mask); Rs 25 3 NIOSH certified N-95 without valve (including #Venus 14488 V4400-N-95 mask without valve ); Rs 28 4 NIOSH certified N-95 cup shape without valve A Magnum N-95 MH cup; Rs 49 B Venus CN95+ N-95 cup shape mask without valve; Rs 29 C Venus 713W-N-95-6WE cup style without valve; Rs 37 D Venus 723W-N-95-6RE cup style without valve; Rs 29 5 FFP2 Mask: ISI certified (including #Venus 14491 V-4420+ FFP2 mask); Rs 12 6 2 Ply surgical with loop or tie; Rs 3 7 3 Ply surgical with Melt Blown (including #Venus 14520-3 Ply Mask); Rs 4 8 Doctors kit of 5 N-95 masks + 5 3Ply melt-blown mask (including #Venus doctors kit); Rs 127 NIOSH: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, USA.

02-11-2020||World||Labour blames Rishi Sunak for blocking lockdown earlier||Labour leader Keir Starmer on Monday blamed chancellor Rishi Sunak for blocking previous attempts to impose a three-week lockdown in England, which allegedly led to inaction, deaths and more caseload of Covid-19.As new cases and deaths surge, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday announced a month-long lockdown from Thursday until December 2. Ministers admitted that the lockdown could be extended if cases and deaths do not come down by then.Addressing a meeting of the Confederation of British Industry, Starmer described the decision not to lock down earlier as “his (Sunak’s) decision”. Sunak had reportedly opposed it in cabinet on the ground that it would further aggravate economic distress. According to Starmer, Sunak was trying to “pretend that you can protect the economy without controlling the virus”. He also used the occasion to burnish pro-business credentials of the Labour party under his leadership.He said: “The impact on business – and jobs – will be severe. Make no mistake, the Chancellor’s name is all over this. His decision to block a circuit breaker, to dismiss it as a ‘blunt instrument’ and to pretend that you can protect the economy without controlling the virus will now mean that businesses have to close for longer, more people will lose their jobs, and the public finances will be worse than they needed to be”.Labour is due to support legislation in the House of Commons on Wednesday on the second lockdown, but has often pointed out that its demand to impose the lockdown weeks ago had been dismissed – even ridiculed – by Johnson.Starmer said: “The government was slow to act – again. But it can’t now waste these four weeks. They must be used to fix test, trace and isolate – and to give control to local authorities; to get a grip on messaging and rebuild public trust; and to provide a clear and transparent roadmap to protect businesses and the NHS over the months to come”.Johnson was due to make a statement on the lockdown in the House of Commons on Monday, justifying the second lockdown and mentioning the possibility of deaths being twice as high as those in the first wave earlier this year, when daily deaths reached nearly 1,000.According to excerpts from his statement released, Johnson would say: “Models of our scientists suggest that unless we act now, we could see deaths over the winter that are twice as bad or more compared with the first wave. Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/labour-blames-rishi-sunak-for-blocking-lockdown-earlier/story-t44oLvzLIZowd8zoBjM1QM.html
02-11-2020||World||Portugal wins Inter-Parliamentary Union polls, Pak candidate bags least votes||Pakistan’s candidate in the election for the president of the governing council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) bagged the lowest number of votes and was easily defeated by his candidate from Portugal on Monday.A total of 394 votes were cast in the election and the candidate from Portugal won with a commanding lead of 222 votes, more than the absolute majority of 198 votes. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India had backed the winning candidate.The election of the new president of the IPU for the period 2020-23 was done through remote electronic secret ballot. The voting was part of the virtual session of the governing council, the main decision-making body of the IPU comprising parliamentarians from around the world.The four candidates in the fray for the post of IPU president were Salma Ataullahjan of Canada, Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani of Pakistan, Duarte Pacheco of Portugal, and Akmal Saidov of Uzbekistan.The Uzbek candidate received 67 votes, the Canadian candidate 53 votes and the Pakistani candidate 52 votes. Sanjrani, the chairman of Pakistan’s Senate or upper house of Parliament, had widely canvassed for his candidature and even travelled to some countries as part of his campaign.Also read: 19 Indians test Covid positive on Vande Bharat flight to Wuhan, ChinaThe IPU is the apex body of parliaments of countries around the world. The people cited above said it had been clear from the start that the Pakistani candidate had little support.India has often criticised Pakistan at international forums for its continued support to terrorist groups and leaders, including those designated by the UN Security Council. Pakistan has also tried to raise the Kashmir issue at the Security Council several times with the backing of its close ally China but has found few other takers for its position.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla is leading the three-member Indian parliamentary delegation participating in the virtual session of the governing council of IPU during November 1-4. Besides the election, the session will decide on key issues such as the adoption of the IPU budget and programme of work for 2021.The presidency of the IPU is rotated between geo-political groups. The outgoing president is Mexican, MP Gabriela Cuevas Barron, who was elected in October 2017. India, part of the Asia-Pacific Group, held the presidency during 1999-2002.Under the principle of geographical rotation, the next president was to be from the “Twelve Plus Group”, which comprises 47 countries. The group had endorsed the Portuguese candidate by an overwhelming majority.The IPU president is the political head of the organisation and acts as the body’s representative at global events and gatherings. The IPU, with its headquarters in Geneva, comprises 179 national parliaments and 13 regional parliamentary bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/portugal-wins-inter-parliamentary-union-polls-pak-candidate-bags-least-votes/story-7fSv2caLj68PzNAnvfcs5K.html

While not as a strict as the shutdown in spring, businesses are unhappy and the suggestion of an extension if the virus is still out of control has fuelled a rebellion in his ruling Conservative Party.When is the vote and why is it controversial?On Wednesday evening, in the House of Commons, mere hours before the new restrictions are due to go into effect. Some Tory members of Parliament, dissatisfied with the chaotic handling of the Covid-19 crisis, see this as further evidence the government has failed to get a grip on the situation. They also suspect that the government could try to extend it beyond Dec 2 end date and disrupt the Christmas holidays, a move that would make them unpopular with voters. That would require a fresh vote.Will all MPs vote?The principle of “English votes for English laws” was suspended by Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg during the pandemic to simplify the passage of legislation. While Conservatives in Scotland will not vote on Wednesday, as it is an England-only matter, Labour’s Scottish and Welsh MPs will. Labour has been calling for a nationwide lockdown for weeks. The Scottish National Party has not yet indicated how it will vote.Will Johnson lose the vote?No, he would need a rebellion of around 280 of his 364 Conservative MPs to vote against him. Some will instead abstain to show their opposition to the measure and leave Johnson relying on Labour votes, which would be an embarrassment for him. The Tories gave a signal on the scale of backbench disquiet about the effects of government measures to curb coronavirus on Oct 12 when 42 of them voted against a series of restrictions, including the introduction of a 10 p.m. curfew for pubs in England.What will the vote cost Johnson politically?Labour’s Keir Starmer has been calling for a nationwide lockdown for several weeks, giving Johnson’s decision to move away from localized lockdowns the appearance of a government in reactive mode. Combined with an increased bill for the public finances and inevitable job losses, his own party is becoming increasingly fractious and difficult to manage. That will have a knock-on effect on decisions Johnson takes, or tries to take, in the near future. Rumors swirl of Johnson being a one-term premier, even with the next election not until 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-will-find-out-size-of-tory-rebellion-in-lockdown-vote/story-vFEXlx01Ne3QPVJP6JTcOO.html
02-11-2020||World||6 key questions going into the 2020 United States presidential election||Election Day is finally upon us.Or at least what we still call Election Day, since more than 93 million Americans have already cast ballots in an election that has been reshaped by the worst pandemic in more than a century, its economic fallout and a long-simmering reckoning with systemic racism.Here are some key questions we are considering as the final votes are cast and counted:What do Americans want from a President?Elections are always about where Americans want to steer the country. That’s especially true this year as the US confronts multiple crises and is choosing between two candidates with very different visions for the future.President Donald Trump has downplayed the coronavirus outbreak even as cases surge across the US. He has panned governors — virtually all Democrats — who have imposed restrictions designed to prevent the spread of the disease. And he has bucked public health guidelines by holding his signature campaign rallies featuring crowds of supporters — often unmasked — packed shoulder to shoulder.His Democratic rival, Joe Biden, has said he’d heed the advice of scientists. He’s pledged to work with state and local officials across the country to push mask mandates and has called on Congress to pass a sweeping response package.Trump casts protests of systemic racism as radical and has emphasized a “law and order” message to appeal to his largely white base. Biden acknowledges systemic racism, picked the first Black woman to appear on a major party’s presidential ticket and has positioned himself as a unifying figure.The candidates also hold distinctly different views on everything from climate change and the environment to taxes and the scope of federal regulation.Whose turnout approach wins?The two parties took wildly different approaches to contacting voters amid the pandemic.Democrats stopped knocking on doors in the spring, going all-digital and phone. They resumed limited in-person contacts in September. Republicans continued traditional field work the entire campaign.The GOP can point to success in increasing their voter registration in battleground states. Democrats can point to their early voting success, including from notable slices of new voters. But only the final tally will vindicate one strategy or the other.Will voting be peaceful?Each major party can install official poll watchers at precincts. It’s the first time in decades Republicans could use the practice after the expiration of a court order limiting their activities. So it’s an open question how aggressive those official poll watchers will be in monitoring voters Tuesday or even challenging eligibility.The bigger issue is likely to be unofficial “poll watchers” — especially self-declared militias. Voter intimidation is illegal, but Trump, in the Sept. 29 presidential debate, notably refused to state plainly that he’d accept election results and instead said he is “urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it.”Also Read| Will never forget what China did to US: TrumpIn Michigan, where federal authorities recently arrested members of anti-government paramilitary groups in an alleged plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic secretary of state tried to impose a ban on carrying firearms openly at a polling place. A Michigan judge struck down the order.Whither the exurbs and smaller cities?Trump’s re-election depends on driving up his margins in rural areas and smaller towns and cities — those expansive swaths of red on the county-by-county results map from 2016.But acres don’t vote, people do, and Biden is casting a wide demographic and geographic net. His ideal coalition is anchored in metro areas, but he hopes to improve Democratic turnout among nonwhite voters and college-educated voters across the map.There are places where the competing strategies overlap: exurban counties — those communities on the edges of the large metropolitan footprints — and counties anchored by smaller stand-alone cities.Two potential indicators that could have close-to-complete unofficial returns sooner than later and portend broader results:Forsyth County, Georgia— Part of metro Atlanta’s growing, diversifying northern ring. Republican Mitt Romney won 80% of 81,900 votes in 2012, while Trump’s share dropped to 70% of nearly 99,000 votes in 2016. If that trendline continues, it would signal first that GOP-controlled Georgia is indeed a tossup. More broadly, it would suggest Trump’s suburban-exurban problems are real.Montgomery County, Ohio — Dayton and its surroundings. They make up one of the 206 “pivot counties” that flipped from President Barack Obama to Trump. Obama won 51.4% of the vote in 2012 to 46.8% for Romney (Obama’s statewide win was 50.6-47.6). Trump nipped Hillary Clinton in 2016, but mostly because she lost 15,000 votes from Obama’s 2012 count (137,139), while Trump fell only about 950 votes short of Romney’s mark (124,841). A clear Biden rebound with a Trump drop-off is not the trend Republicans want to see in a midsize metro footprint. A 1968 REDUX? HOW ABOUT 1980?Trump spent considerable energy this year posturing as a “law and order” president, blasting nationwide protests of racial injustice and occasional violence as left-wing rioting that previewed “Joe Biden’s America.”Also Read: For less-raucous Joe Biden, election hope rests on PennsylvaniaThe president’s allies pointed to 1968, when widespread unrest amid the Vietnam War, general social upheaval and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy benefited Republican Richard Nixon as he built his “silent majority.” But Nixon wasn’t the incumbent in 1968. In fact, the political atmosphere was so bad for President Lyndon Johnson that the Democrat didn’t seek re-election.Many Democrats and some Republicans are now pointing more at 1980, when Republican Ronald Reagan trounced President Jimmy Carter and the GOP flipped a whopping 12 Democratic Senate seats. Trump’s standing in the polls over 2020 has tracked only slightly above where Carter spent much of the 1980 election year, as he battled inflation, high unemployment and the Iran hostage crisis. But what appeared a tight race on paper as late as October turned into a rout. Even Democratic heavyweights like Indiana Sen. Birch Bayh and South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, once a presidential nominee, fell.It’s a more polarized era four decades later. But the lesson is that Trump would defy history to win reelection amid such a cascade of crises and voter dissatisfaction.When will the race be called?Absentee voting amid coronavirus has changed the vote-counting timeline, and there aren’t uniform practices for counting those ballots. That makes it difficult to predict when certain key battlegrounds, much less a national result, could be called.For example, Pennsylvania and Michigan — battlegrounds Trump won by less than 1 percentage point in 2016 — aren’t expected to have complete-but-unofficial totals for days. Florida and North Carolina, meanwhile, began processing early ballots ahead of time, with officials there forecasting earlier unofficial returns. But those two states also could have razor-thin margins.Early returns, meanwhile, could show divergent results. Biden’s expected to lead comfortably among early voters, for example. Trump is likely to counter with a lead among Election Day voters. Depending on which counties report which batch of votes first, perennially close states could tempt eager partisans to reach conclusions that aren’t necessarily accurate.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

02-11-2020||World||Germany launches four-week partial shutdown to curb Covid-19||A four-week partial shutdown has started in Germany, with restaurants, bars, theatres, cinemas and other leisure facilities closing down until the end of the month in a drive to flatten a rapid rise in coronavirus infections.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The restrictions that took effect Monday are milder than the ones Germany imposed in the first phase of the pandemic in March and April. This time around, schools, kindergartens, non-essential shops and hairdressers are to remain open.But leading officials decided last week that a “lockdown light” was necessary in light of a sharp rise in cases that has prompted many other European countries to impose more or less drastic restrictions.On Saturday, the national disease control center reported the highest number of infections in one day -- 19,059 -- since the pandemic began. Figures at the beginning of the week tend to be lower, and the center reported 12,097 cases Monday. But that compared with 8,685 a week earlier, underlining the upward trend.Germany has reported over 100 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past week. That is fewer than in many other European countries, but far above the 50 mark that officials set earlier this year as an alarm signal that requires action by local authorities.Chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors are to review the situation after two weeks and discuss whether the measures need to be adjusted.“The aim is to get back under this level of 50 at which health offices are in a position to trace contacts,” Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told RBB Inforadio.Merkel said last week that authorities are currently unable to trace the source of three-quarters of infections.The restrictions taking effect Monday allow groups of at most 10 people, from a maximum two households, in public. Germans have been asked to refrain from making non-essential journeys and hotels are barred from accommodating people on tourist trips.Asked whether the restrictions might last beyond November, Braun replied: “Our declared aim is that we want to end the measures in this strictness at the end of November.”“This is also about enabling Christmas business for German companies, and Christmas celebrations with the family for all of us,” he added. “I consider that important ... the stricter the measures, the quicker they work, so we decided on relatively strict measures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-launches-four-week-partial-shutdown-to-curb-covid-19/story-1gYdiD1CFakfJn8nOHenJN.html

In a security advisory issued by its regional office in Bangkok, the UN’s department of safety and security asked UN personnel, particularly those of French nationality, to be alert and observant of their surroundingsThe advisory, which noted that the threat could extend to commercial or educational institutions perceived to be linked to France, also asked all staffers to consider the time they spent in locations associated with French interests.“It must be noted that factors such as appearances or spoken language in themselves do not denote nationality, and the outspoken threats against French nationals is assessed as having a potential to collaterally affect other nationalities as well,” according to the 28 October advisory seen by HT.The advisory follows the recent beheading of a French teacher in Paris at the hands of a religious extremist that led French President Emmanuel Macron to defend the right to depict Islam’s Prophet Muhammad in caricatures as freedom of expression and pledged to fight what he had described as “Islamist separatism”.Also Read: The challenge ahead for terror-hit France | OpinionThe UN safety department’s Threat and Risk Assessment Service (TRS) said there has been an observed increase in anti-Western sentiment and anti-France rhetoric across pre-dominantly Muslim States, including the Asia-Pacific region including Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Indonesia.There have been calls for attacks against French assets by extremist groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaeda. In Bangladesh, there have been large-scale protests against Macron’s support.In Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan led the pitch, accusing French President Emmanuel Macron of “attacking Islam” and of “creating further polarisation that would in turn lead to further radicalisation”. Pakistan’s Foreign Office also issued a statement condemning what it called a “systematic Islamophobic campaign under the garb of freedom of expression,” it said.The Ministry of Religious Affairs had also announced country-wide celebrations as part of Ashiq-e-Rasool (Love for Prophet Muhammad) from 30 October to 6 November. As part of these celebrations, small to medium scale public gatherings and religious conferences will be held by the government. Medium to large scale protest rallies are also likely through this week.France has endured three attacks blamed on Muslim extremists in the last two months: one by a Pakistani refugee that injured two people outside the newspaper’s old headquarters, the slaying of the schoolteacher, and a deadly knife attack last Thursday in a church in the Mediterranean city of Nice. All three have prompted terrorism investigations and France has been at its highest level of alert.India had last week come out in support of the French president who faced vicious attacks after he spoke in favour of the freedom of expression“We strongly deplore the personal attacks in unacceptable language on President Emmanuel Macron in violation of the most basic standards of international discourse. We also condemn the brutal terrorist attack that took the life of a French school teacher in a gruesome manner that has shocked the world. We offer our condolences to his family and the people of France,” the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement last week.The advisory underscored that the Twitter hashtag #IStandWithFrance was trending in India, with thousands of netizens expressing their support and appreciation for French President Macron’s decision to “take a stand against extremism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/threats-posed-by-extremists-lone-wolf-to-increase-says-un-security-agency/story-Ng6Byx7qjzgQTxKnuZlmvL.html
02-11-2020||World||Tory fears England lockdown extension, Rishi Sunak says its ‘time-limited’ by law||Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said the government expects strict new rules to bring Covid-19 infections down sufficiently in England, as he sought to reassure Conservative lawmakers who fear ministers will extend the four-week partial lockdown in December.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The tougher restrictions announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson will see pubs, gyms and non-essential shops closed from Thursday, subject to a vote in Parliament. But after senior cabinet minister Michael Gove said over the weekend the rules could be extended beyond the planned Dec 2 end-date, Sunak on Monday stressed they are “time-limited” by law and will expire.The fresh lockdown, which the government resisted for weeks amid calls for a so-called virus circuit breaker by the opposition Labour Party, threatens to foment a rebellion within Johnson’s Tory party, with a number of senior rank-and-file members voicing their opposition. They’re concerned about the impingements on civil liberties and the damage being wrought on the economy by repeated national closures.Sunak said the government expects the lockdown to reduce infections enough to resume Johnson’s regional, tiered approach to social-distancing rules in December -- though he also warned there’s no single criteria that will be used to determine if that’s the case. By saying the lockdown will be time-limited in law, it means MPs will get another vote if the government wants to extend it.‘Firm Hope’“Our expectation and firm hope -- on the basis of everything we know today -- is the measures we put in place, for the time that they are going to be in place for, will be sufficient to do the job that we need,” Sunak told BBC Radio.Johnson will deliver a statement to the House of Commons on Monday afternoon to set out the latest measures, after a leak on Friday night rushed him into an announcement on Saturday. He’ll say that scientific modelling showed that without action, the rate of deaths could be twice as bad as in the first wave of the pandemic.“Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level,” Johnson will say, according to his office. “I know some in the House believe we should have reached this decision earlier, but I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership.”The prime minister will also give details of extra assistance to self-employed people during the lockdown, raising state aid to more than current plans for 40% of their usual earnings, Sunak said. The chancellor has already increased aid to the employed by extending his flagship wage support program, which had been due to end at the weekend, for the duration of the new restrictions.Too LateBut the extension came too late for many people laid off by companies last week ahead of the program’s scheduled end. Sunak defended his decision to stick with his original time frame, saying it was only the changing health data and subsequent lockdown that forced a rethink.Bloomberg Economics said the second lockdown will mean the economy contracts in the fourth quarter and that the Bank of England will increase its asset purchase target this week by possibly more than the 100 billion pounds ($129 billion) previously forecast.A second national lockdown will be “truly devastating,” Carolyn Fairbairn, outgoing director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said on Monday. The government must keep as much of the economy open as possible and needs a clear strategy for exiting the lockdown, she said.Still, Johnson’s plan is almost certain to pass in the House of Commons because it’s backed by Labour. Of bigger concern to the prime minister will be the size of any Tory rebellion, and if he has to rely on opposition parties to win the vote.Also Read | England to enter into new month-long lockdown as UK virus cases pass 1 millionRebellionTory lawmakers have already shown their displeasure at the coronavirus restrictions, when 42 of them rebelled in a vote last month to confirm the government’s imposition of a 10 p.m. curfew on pubs and restaurants.“This repetitive cycle of lockdowns is immensely damaging to people’s livelihoods, is deeply depressing and is causing a huge toll in terms of people’s mental health and family relationships,” Graham Brady, who heads the influential 1922 committee of rank-and-file Conservatives MPs, told BBC Radio late Sunday.Adding to the potential danger is the latest intervention by Nigel Farage, one of the architects of Brexit. Following a pattern of entering the political scene when he senses Tory disquiet, Farage announced the re-branding of his Brexit Party as Reform UK He sent a message to supporters calling the government’s “woeful” response to the pandemic the “most pressing” issue facing the country.“The government has dug itself into a hole and rather than admit its mistakes, it keeps on digging,” Farage wrote. “The new national lockdown will result in more life-years lost than it hopes to save, as non-Covid patients with cancer, cardiac, lung and other illnesses have treatments delayed or cancelled again. Suicides are soaring. Businesses and jobs are being destroyed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tory-fears-england-lockdown-extension-rishi-sunak-says-its-time-limited-by-law/story-frbBoMgVqHF7RBmv8i9HJN.html
02-11-2020||World||19 Indians test Covid positive on Vande Bharat flight to Wuhan, future flights may be delayed||As many as 19 Indians are said to have tested positive for Covid-19 in a Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flight, which landed in the central Chinese city of Wuhan from New Delhi on Friday.The 19 including both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients have been taken to designated hospitals for treatment and quarantine as per protocol followed by the Chinese government.Asymptomatic patients are those who do not show symptoms of the disease like fever and cough but could infect others.It’s the largest number of Covid-19 positive cases for any VBM flight to China until now.Among the 277 passengers who came on the flight, at least 39 were found to have Covid-19 antibodies – an indication they had the disease but have recovered – and are being monitored.The remaining passengers are currently undergoing the mandatory 14-day quarantine in designated hotels.It was not immediately clear what impact the cases in the Wuhan VBM flight will have on the ones planned ahead for China . Flights are scheduled for November 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th and December 4th.More than 1,500 Indians are waiting to return to China in upcoming VBM flights expected over the coming weeks.The Friday flight was the sixth VBM flight by Air India to China to help Indians stranded in both the countries to travel back to their destinations.More than 1500 Indians are waiting to return to China in upcoming VBM flights expected over the coming weeks.There is still no word from China when nearly 23000 Indian students studying here will be able to return.The Delhi-Wuhan-Delhi flight was announced after the cancellation of the October 23 flight to Guangzhou in south China.The large number of positive cases in the Air India VBM flight could lead to the postponement of the upcoming flight to Wuhan later this month.India has sent a “request for approval” to Chinese authorities for next flight in November to land in Wuhan but is yet to get a response.Receiving the required permission will not be easy -- authorities in Ningbo in eastern China’s Zhejiang province had declined permission for a second VBM flight after a couple of passengers tested positive for Covid-19 for the first flight on September 11.With the pandemic situation in China normalising, health authorities are focussing on controlling imported cases and localised clusters.Until Friday, VBM flights to China have landed in Shanghai in eastern China, Guangzhou and Ningbo besides Wuhan.As of September 14, the Chinese embassy in New Delhi had said all Indians flying to China on “irregular commercial flights, charter flights or special flights from India to China, double nucleic acid tests of Covid-19, in the labs authorised by the ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research), the first within 120 hours (5 days) before boarding and the second within 36 hours before boarding” were mandatory.“The negative report of the second nucleic acid test within 36 hours before boarding to China needn’t be sent to the Embassy or Consulates, and can be printed out together with the first negative report as well as the stamped Health Declaration Form by the passengers for the flight check-in and China Customs procedures, except otherwise required by the competent departments of the Chinese Government as individual cases.”China’s civil aviation administration hasn’t permitted Air India’s VBM flights to land in Beijing as a precaution against, what Beijing calls “imported cases” of Covid-19.The coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, the capital of central China’s Hubei province, in late December before spreading across the country and then globally, triggering the worst pandemic in several decades .India had dispatched three flights to Wuhan to airlift Indians stranded in the city when the virus was at its peak in the city in February this year.China has brought the pandemic under control though local clusters have broken out in cities like Dalian, Qingdao, Urumqi and Kashgar in past weeks, triggering partial lockdowns and mass nucleic acid testing.It has also placed strict measures to control imported cases including cancelling flights on routes where Covid-19 cases were reported.On Monday, mainland China reported 24 new confirmed Covid-19 cases for Sunday, including three cases of local transmission in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and 21 cases from overseas, the national health commission (NHC) announced.The NHC reported no new asymptomatic cases, down from 38 a day earlier. China does not count symptom-less patients as confirmed Covid-19 cases. Total confirmed Covid-19 cases until Sunday in mainland China stand at 85,997. The death toll remains at 4,634.With 21 new imported Covid-19 cases for Sunday, the total number of imported cases has risen to 3,401.Of the new imported cases, six were reported in Shanghai, five in Guangdong, three each in Shanxi and Gansu, two in Sichuan, and one each in Tianjin and Jiangsu, the commission said in its daily report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/19-indians-test-covid-19-positive-on-vande-bharat-flight-to-wuhan-future-flights-may-be-delayed/story-RofsxIM55RPXSFdnjyl0dP.html
02-11-2020||World||China shops for graphene clothes for PLA soldiers at Ladakh border, flaunts it||China has shortlisted nearly two dozen private companies to supply advanced unmanned weaponry and graphene clothing to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) regiments deployed along the long high-altitude border areas with India, state media reports said.The PLA’s wish list includes “smart warm clothing made of graphene”, a revolutionary form of carbon, the discovery of which led physicists Andra Geim and Konstantine Novoselov to the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010.The Chinese armed forces are also looking for advanced logistics support equipment like portable solar chargers, portable oxygenators and a multifunctional dining vehicle.The rare, and surprisingly publicised, move is an indication that China is working towards fusing its military needs with technology available in the civilian sector - an effort to leverage civilian service and logistical capabilities for military purposes amid the months-long border standoff with India in eastern Ladakh.The private companies, some of them based in south China and specialised in drone technology, are known to manufacture vertical takeoff and landing unmanned vehicles, which can operate at high altitudes. It is rare for the PLA to disclose the names of private companies from which it plans to procure military equipment.It’s a sign that the world’s largest military force is expanding procurement from traditional suppliers, China’s state-owned enterprises, and buying specialised equipment from niche manufacturers.The PLA’s Tibet Command invited 22 private “arms companies” and held meetings to review their products to be potentially used during “plateau warfare and border defence”, national broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV) and the nationalistic tabloid, Global Times reported.“Many types of rotor-wing and fixed-wing aerial drones, including the Blowfish A2 helicopter drone developed by Zhuhai-based Ziyan UAV and the CW-25 vertical take-off and landing fixed-wing drone made by Chengdu-based JOUAV, were inspected by the PLA,” the CCTV report said.They are specially designed for use in high elevation, low temperature regions, with the aim of conducting unmanned missions including material supply, border defense and management, “…surveillance and armed reconnaissance along the border of southwest China’s Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR),” the CCTV report said.The reports didn’t specify which private Chinese company manufactures clothes made of graphene, which has been hailed as a “wonder material”.The website, Dailytechlife.com which tracks technology and invention, says as an item of cloth, graphene can be “thermal, waterproof, and fireproof” and have other advanced technical properties not normally associated with cloth.Beijing’s decision to look at private companies matches with its goal to merge the military and civil sectors.“PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) long-term goal is to create an entirely self-reliant defence-industrial sector—fused with a strong civilian industrial and technology sector—that can meet the PLA’s needs for modern military capabilities,” the USA’s Defence Department said in its annual report on China’s military in September.Calling it the “Military-Civil Fusion (MCF) Development Strategy”, the report said China is pursuing its “…MCF Development Strategy to “fuse” its economic and social development strategies with its security strategies to build an integrated national strategic system and capabilities in support of China’s national rejuvenation goals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-military-to-buy-graphene-clothing-chopper-drones-from-pvt-cos-for-india-border/story-Ddrzp2oFawwBxIwrMsFjoJ.html
02-11-2020||World||France may reverse bookstore closures amid lockdown anger||The French government is facing stiffer resistance to its second lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus, forcing it to rewrite rules on book sales and consider lifting restrictions early for smaller stores. France went into a second national lockdown on Friday as a surge in cases risks overwhelming the health system. Unlike in the spring, schools remain open and a wider range of businesses and retailers can continue to operate.But local shops selling items deemed non-essential, such as clothes, toys and books, are not permitted to open to the public. After a weekend of outcry and defiance from shopkeepers, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said late Sunday he would ban supermarkets from selling non-essential products such as toys or books “as a matter of fairness.” On Monday morning, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire went a step further, saying he would look at the option of reopening small stores as soon as November 12 instead of December 1.“I can totally understand that people are upset that you can sell items such as flowers and books in supermarkets but not in local shops,” Castex said in an interview on TF1 Sunday. He added that the lockdown measures “aren’t meant to annoy the French population but to protect them.” He said the pandemic “has taken dramatic proportions” with one person every 30 seconds hospitalized in France.Read more: Terror returns to France | HT EditorialLe Maire, who called for bookstores to be permitted to reopen in the first lockdown, will meet with shopkeeper federations this week to work on new protocols, such as shopping by appointment. That could allow as many retailers as possible to open from November 12. In the meantime, the finance minister urged French people to respect the latest rules and warned that a deeper health crisis would worsen the economic situation.“When we are in a health crisis, an economic crisis and a terrorism crisis, there is no room for the positions of individuals, there is just room for the collective position,” Le Maire said on RTL radio Monday. “That’s called the state and today we need to respect the rules of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-may-reverse-bookstore-closures-amid-lockdown-anger/story-D3sTkk3HrEbNl2XDS5c6OP.html
02-11-2020||World||Samuel Paty beheading: French schools reopen with minute of silence||French schools held a nationwide minute of silence Monday in tribute to a teacher who was beheaded for opening a class debate on free speech by showing students caricatures of the prophet of Islam.Samuel Paty was killed on Oct. 16 outside his school in suburban Paris by an 18-year-old refugee of Chechen origin to punish him for showing the caricatures published by the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which triggered a newsroom massacre by extremists in January 2015.Since their re-publication in September at the start of the ongoing Paris trial over the killings, France has endured three attacks blamed on Muslim extremists: one by a Pakistani refugee that injured two people outside the newspaper’s old headquarters, the slaying of the schoolteacher, and a deadly knife attack last Thursday in a church in the Mediterranean city of Nice. All three have prompted terrorism investigations, and France is now at its highest level of alert.French President Emmanuel Macron promised to increase protection of schools and churches immediately after the Nice attack, more than doubling the number of soldiers actively deployed in the country. Paty was killed at the beginning of a two-week French school holiday.On Monday, the school where he taught at Conflans-Saint-Honorine reopened for teachers only. France’s prime minister minister, Jean Castex, arrived to lend support. Other schools throughout the country resumed as usual to both students and teachers.At schools throughout the country, students will read the letter of Jean Jaurès, a 19th century French thinker and politician, to instructors urging them to teach the country’s children to “know France, its geography and its history, its body and its soul.”Macron has defended the decision to publish the caricatures, which he says falls squarely into two of France’s most cherished rights: freedom of expression and secularism. The cartoons were originally published in Denmark in 2005 and elsewhere later in countries where freedom of expression is considered inviolable. Many Muslims see them as sacrilegious.“We have the right to believe that these caricatures are in bad taste. There are plenty of people I believe are in bad taste. There are plenty of people who I think say idiotic things,” Gerald Darmanin, France’s interior minister, told BFM television. “But I’ll defend to the death your right to say them, as Voltaire said.”In Germany and the Netherlands, many schools were also paying tribute to Paty.“We can send a sign of solidarity with those teachers who are committed to democratic coexistence,” state Education Minister Sandra Sheeres wrote in a message to Berlin schools asking them to participate.Scheeres also asked those participating to explain the background to their students to make them aware of “tolerance and solidarity as well as against violence and extremism.”The Dutch education ministers asked schools, colleges and universities to find ways to express their support.“The Netherlands stands squarely behind teachers and the constitutional freedom of expression,” ministers Arie Slob and Ingrid van Engelshoven wrote. “Teachers must be able to do their work in freedom and security so our children and youth can develop into independent citizens who can live together in a country that is characterized by freedom, equality and solidarity.”___David Rising in Berlin and Mike Corder in The Hague contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-schools-reopen-in-mourning-after-beheading-of-teacher/story-EOcFBuqxXwNSV7jxFOmjrK.html
02-11-2020||World||Kabul University attacked by armed gunmen; 19 dead, 22 injured||Gunmen stormed Kabul University on Monday as it hosted a book fair attended by the Iranian ambassador to Afghanistan, sparking an hours-long gun battle and leaving at least 19 dead and 22 wounded at the war-torn country’s largest school.The ministry’s spokesman, Tariq Arian, also said there were three attackers involved in the assault, all of whom were killed in the ensuing firefight. As the sun slowly set over the Afghan capital, there were few other details though the Taliban issued a statement denying they took part in the assault.The attack came as the insurgents are continuing peace talks with the U.S.-backed government. Those negotiations, taking place in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, aim to help the U.S. finally withdraw from America’s longest war, though daily bloodshed continues and an Islamic State affiliate launches its own attacks on Shiites in the country.Five hours into the fighting, sporadic grenade explosions and automatic weapons fire echoed down the empty streets surrounding the university’s fenced compound. Afghan troops stood guard. Earlier, students were seen fleeing for their lives from the site.“Unfortunately, there are casualties,” Arian said as the assault unfolded, without elaborating.Ahmad Samim, a university student, told journalists he saw militants armed with pistols and Kalashnikov assault rifles firing at the school, the country’s oldest with some 17,000 students. He said the attack happened at the university’s eastern side where its law and journalism faculty teach.Afghan media reported a book exhibition was being held at the university and attended by a number of dignitaries at the time of the shooting.While Afghan officials declined to discuss the bookfair, Iran’s semiofficial ISNA news agency reported Sunday that Iranian Ambassador Bahador Aminian and cultural attaché Mojtaba Noroozi were scheduled to inaugurate the fair, which would host some 40 Iranian publishers. Iranian state television reported the attack occurred, but did not offer information on its officials.Iranian diplomats have been targeted previously by attacks in the country and nearly sparked a war between the two countries. In 1998, Iran held the Taliban responsible for the deaths of nine Iranian diplomats who were working in its consulate in northern Afghanistan and sent reinforcements to the 950-kilometer- (580-mile-) long border that Iran and Afghanistan share.No group immediately took responsibility for the ongoing attack though the Taliban issued a statement saying they were not involved. However, suspicion immediately fell on the Islamic State group.Last month, the Islamic State group sent a suicide bomber into an education center in the capital’s Shiite dominated neighborhood of Dasht-e-Barchi, killing 24 students and injuring more than 100. The Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan has declared war on Afghanistan’s minority Shiite Muslims and have staged dozens of attacks since emerging in 2014.Schools have been targeted for attacks in the past as well. Last year, a bomb outside of the Kabul University campus’ gates killed eight people. In 2016, gunmen attacked the American University in Kabul, killing 13.Violence has been relentless in Afghanistan even as the Taliban and a government-appointed negotiation team discuss a peace agreement to end more than four decades of war in the country. The talks in Qatar have been painfully slow and despite repeated demands for a reduction in violence, the chaos has continued unabated.A U.S. deal with the Taliban in February set the stage for peace talks currently underway in Doha. The deal also allows for the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops from Afghanistan.Meanwhile Monday, a vehicle hit a roadside mine in the country’s southern Helmand province, killing at least seven civilians, most of them women and children, provincial governor spokesman Omer Zwak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-gunmen-stage-attack-on-kabul-university-taliban-denies-involvement/story-uC7Archw9sFUVUEaPoxT9H.html

02-11-2020||World||Barrett to join Supreme Court arguments for the first time||Justice Amy Coney Barrett is expected to join her Supreme Court colleagues on Monday to hear arguments for the first time. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the high court began hearing cases by phone in May.That means the public won’t see the new justice, but they’ll be able to hear her if she asks questions, as all her colleagues have been doing. Also because of the pandemic, the court has been allowing the public to listen to arguments in real time, a change from the past.Participating in oral arguments will be among the first things Barrett will do after being confirmed last week in a 52-48 virtual party-line vote, with Republicans overpowering Democrats to install President Donald Trump’s third Supreme Court nominee. She did not participate in decisions the high court issued last week involving extended timelines for receiving and counting ballots in Pennsylvania and North Carolina because of the need for a quick resolution and “because she has not had time to fully review the parties’ filings,” the court’s spokeswoman said in a statement. But her vote also wouldn’t have changed the outcome in either case.The two cases Barrett will hear Monday are relatively low-profile, a dispute involving the Freedom of Information Act and another involving disability benefits for railroad employees. On Tuesday, however, as the country finishes voting, the court’s cases include one about sentencing young people to life without parole. And on Wednesday, the day after Election Day, the court hears a case that involves a clash of LGBTQ rights and religious freedoms in a major swing state, Pennsylvania.Click here for complete US Presidential Election coverage. Next week brings a case that could threaten the Affordable Care Act, one that was front and center during Barrett’s confirmation hearings last month. Democrats claimed that the Obama-era health law, known as “Obamacare,” would be in jeopardy if Barrett joined the court. Trump has urged the court to overturn the law.The justices have said they will continue to hear cases by phone through at least December. So it’s unclear when Barrett will move in to her offices at the court, taking over the space of her predecessor, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. On Monday, Chief Justice John Roberts is expected to offer a traditional, short welcome, to Barrett before arguments begin, wishing her “a long and happy career in our common calling.” And the court will have a typical two hours of argument in two cases.Read more: Will never forget what China did to US: TrumpThe pandemic has upended other traditions. If the justices were in their courtroom, Barrett would join her colleagues in a round of handshakes before taking the bench, a tradition every time the justices meet for argument or their private conference that was suspended months ago because of the pandemic. Spectators would see her emerge from behind the court’s red curtains and take a seat on the far right hand side of the bench, the junior-most justice’s seat. She would be seated next to Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first nominee to the court.And while arguments in the courtroom are a free-for-all, with justices constantly jumping in with questions, the court’s phone-arguments are more orderly. Each justice gets to ask each lawyer questions in order of seniority. As the junior justice, Barrett will ask her questions last.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barrett-to-join-supreme-court-arguments-for-the-first-time/story-aDvUrVgAEyrMd5gXtRe0IJ.html

The households were vandalised and later set on fire on Sunday after a Bangladeshi man, who lives in France, allegedly praised President Emmanuel Macron for taking steps against “inhumane ideologies” after a teacher in Paris was decapitated for showing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, bdnews24.com reported.The headmaster of a kindergarten school in Purbo Dhour welcomed Macron’s action in a comment on the post.As the rumours about the Facebook post spread, tension mounted in the area on Saturday, the report said.Also Read | Thousands stage anti-France protests in Bangladesh, PakistanThe police arrested two people on charges of hurting the religious sentiments on Sunday, the report quoted Qamruzzaman Talukder, Officer-in-Charge of Bangra Bazar Police Station, as saying.They include the headmaster of the kindergarten.

02-11-2020||World||Typhoon Goni: 16 dead, thousands of homes damaged in Philippines||At least 16 people were killed as Typhoon Goni lashed the Philippines over the weekend, and about 13,000 shanties and houses were damaged or swept away in the eastern island province that was first hit by the ferocious storm, officials said Monday.Goni blasted into Catanduanes province at dawn Sunday as a super typhoon with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph). But the storm weakened considerably after making landfall and shifted direction to spare the capital, Manila, before blowing out into the South China Sea.The Office of Civil Defense said at least 16 people were killed in Catanduanes and nearby Albay province, where three others remain missing.Catanduanes, an island province of more than 260,000 people that is often lashed by Pacific storms, was isolated after losing power and communications due to Goni and another typhoon that had hit a week earlier. But officials there managed to connect to the outside world on Monday after disaster-response authorities flew to the devastated island with satellite phones.Catanduanes Gov. Joseph Cua and other officials said at least five people drowned and four were injured in the typhoon, which whipped up 5-meter (16-foot) storm surges. About 13,000 shanties and houses were damaged or swept away when the typhoon slammed into the province, they said. Many residents fled to safety from their homes as the typhoon approached.Cua described the onslaught as “severe” and reported that some coastal areas were swamped by frightening storm surges. His brief conversation with some Cabinet officials in Manila was broadcast live on state-run TV.About 10,000 shanties were “totally washed out along the coastlines that were hit by the typhoon,” Catanduanes Rep. Hector Sanchez said.About 80% of the electric posts on the island were toppled and roads linking the province’s 11 towns remained impassable to vehicles, Cua said.An army general on the island appealed for more troops to help distribute food packs and water to residents. He added that the army camp was destroyed by the typhoon and soldiers have camped out at the airport, which remained open.An air force cargo plane was to deliver food packs, drinking water, blankets and other relief goods to the island province.The typhoon also devastated the nearby province of Albay, where heavy rains washed down boulders and mudflows from Mayon Volcano, engulfing about 150 houses in a single community in the town of Guinobatan.Two residents were killed in the community and three others remain missing, Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara said.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was to conduct an aerial inspection of the typhoon-hit region on his way to Manila on Monday from his southern hometown, officials said. The 75-year-old leader has been criticized for his absences from public view amid the coronavirus pandemic and recent storms, but aides say he’s working even when away from the public.One of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines in November 2013.The Philippines is lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It’s also located on the so-called Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-goni-16-dead-thousands-of-homes-damaged-in-philippines/story-mS3BX2wesdZ7MM3EthETsJ.html
02-11-2020||World||India could resume foreign secretary-level dialogue with Nepal. There is one condition||Army Chief General MM Naravane, who travels to Nepal this week to be conferred the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army, will meet Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on November 5. The meeting, being described as crucial, could lead to resumption of foreign secretary-level dialogue between the two countries, people familiar with the matter said.New Delhi had paused talks with the Himalayan nation’s communist government earlier this year after its parliament cleared a new map in June this year that incorporates Indian territory near its border with China. The move, believed to have been backed by China’s communist party, was an effort by KP Sharma Oli to whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments in Nepal to consolidate his hold on the party and the government.Over the last few months, the two neighbours softened their posture and attempted to reboot ties. In September, PM Oli decided to stop distribution of next school textbooks that had been published with the country’s revised political map.In October, PM Oli cleared Gen Naravane’s three-day visit starting November 4 and removed deputy prime minister Ishwar Pokhrel from the defence ministry. Pokhrel, seen as a sharp and consistent critic of India, was believed to have been reluctant to host Gen Naravane.PM Oli retained the charge of the defence ministry and will meet Gen Naravane this week as the country’s defence minister.“If the conversation goes as well as expected, India will reciprocate with resumption of the foreign secretary-level talks and a meeting of the Joint Technical Level Boundary Committee,” a top government official said.Research and Analysis Wing chief Samant Kumar Goel who made a quiet visit to Nepal last week held one round of talks with PM Oli where both sides emphasised the civilisational, cultural and multi-faceted friendly relations with the two countries.Gen Naravane’s Nepal visit comes at a time PM Oli is still in the middle of an acrimonious power struggle within the Nepal Communist Party. The communist party was formed in 2018 after the merger of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre.Over the weekend, PM Oli, who is confident of getting the numbers to stay in power, is learnt to have made it clear that he wanted the merged party to split rather than cede control to buy peace with detractors led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal. The intra-NCP struggle, which had been simmering for months, erupted after PM Oli appointed three ministers in his cabinet without consulting Dahal with whom he shares the post of NCP co-chairman. A peace pact agreed to by the two sides earlier mandated that consultation with the party.But PM Oli refused to abide by this agreement and is seen to have engineered a rebellion in the Province 6 government run by chief minister Mahendra Bahadur Shahi, a confidant of Dahal. A vote of no-confidence moved against the chief minister under this plan wasn’t successful but brought out the differences between the two camps out in the open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-india-nepal-take-firm-step-to-reboot-ties-a-5-nov-meet-will-be-crucial/story-X77guYbrNk007s2XGZ5XAO.html
02-11-2020||World||Top Trump adviser Scott Atlas apologizes for interview to Russian agency listed as foreign agent in US||One of President Donald Trump’s top medical advisers issued an apology on Sunday for giving an interview to a Russian news agency that’s registered as a foreign agent in the US.Scott Atlas, a physician and one-time Fox commentator who rose to the president’s inner circle after repeatedly downplaying the risk of the coronavirus, issued an apology Sunday, in particular to US national security officials.In the interview with RT, formerly known as Russia Today, Atlas was deeply critical of lockdown measures and also criticized US media for its portrayal of the pandemic.“The lockdowns will go down as an epic failure of public policy,” he told the Russian agency. US public health officials are “killing people with their fear-inducing shutdown policies.”Atlas also said that deaths in Asia are lower than the US not because of public health measures, but because of what he termed higher existing immunity in countries like South Korea to the novel coronavirus because of previous viruses in the region.White House Slams Fauci After Comments on PandemicAtlas is a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where members of the medical faculty issued a public letter in September disavowing Atlas’s remarks. He responded with a legal threat.Atlas routinely diverges from consensus health advice of senior public health officials. Two weeks ago, Twitter blocked a tweet of his that said masks don’t work in slowing the virus’s spread. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have both criticized Atlas.More than 230,000 Americans have died from the virus, and more than 9 million cases have been confirmed. The virus is surging again in the U.S., with a record 99,000 cases reported on Friday. Roughly 1,000 people are dying in the U.S. daily from the virus.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-trump-adviser-scott-atlas-apologizes-for-interview-to-russian-agency-listed-as-foreign-agent-in-us/story-ksP9GaZbFTyr7QQXNx1inK.html
02-11-2020||World||US Elections 2020: Trump hints at firing Dr Anthony Fauci after presidential polls||President Donald Trump is suggesting that he will fire Dr. Anthony Fauci after Tuesday’s election, as his rift with the nation’s top infectious disease expert widens while the nation sees its most alarming outbreak of the coronavirus since the spring.Click here for full US Elections 2020 coverageSpeaking at a campaign rally in Opa-locka, Florida, Trump expressed frustration that the surging cases of the virus that has killed more than 230,000 Americans so far this year remains prominent in the news, sparking chants of “Fire Fauci” from his supporters.“Don’t tell anybody but let me wait until a little bit after the election,” Trump replied to thousands of supporters just after midnight Monday, adding he appreciated their “advice.”Trump’s comments on Fauci less than 48 hours before polls close all but assure that his handling of the pandemic will remain front and center heading into Election Day.It’s the most direct Trump has been in suggesting he was serious about trying to remove Fauci from his position. He has previously expressed that he was concerned about the political blowback of removing the popular and respected doctor before Election Day.Trump’s comments come after Fauci leveled his sharpest criticism yet of the White House’s response to the coronavirus and Trump’s public assertion that the nation is “rounding the turn” on the virus.Fauci has grown outspoken that Trump has ignored his advice for containing the virus, saying he hasn’t spoken with Trump in more than a month. He has raised alarm that the nation was heading for a challenging winter if more isn’t done soon to slow the spread of the disease.In an interview with the Washington Post this weekend, Fauci cautioned that the U.S. will have to deal with “a whole lot of hurt” in the weeks ahead due to surging coronavirus cases.Fauci said the U.S. “could not possibly be positioned more poorly” to stem rising cases as more people gather indoors during the colder fall and winter months. He says the U.S. will need to make an “abrupt change” in public health precautions.Fauci added that he believed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden “is taking it seriously from a public health perspective,” while Trump is “looking at it from a different perspective.” Fauci, who’s on the White House coronavirus task force, said that perspective emphasizes “the economy and reopening the country.”In response, White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump always puts people’s well-being first and Deere charges that Fauci has decided “to play politics” right before Tuesday’s election. Deere said Fauci “has a duty to express concerns or push for a change in strategy” but instead is “choosing to criticize the president in the media and make his political leanings known.”Trump in recent days has stepped up his attacks on Biden for pledging to heed the advice of scientists in responding to the pandemic. Trump has claimed Biden would “lock down” the nation once again. Biden has promised to heed the warnings of Fauci and other medical professionals but has not endorsed another national lockdown.Trump has recently relied on the advice of Stanford doctor Scott Atlas, who has no prior background in infectious diseases or public health, as his lead science adviser on the pandemic. Atlas has been a public skeptic about mask wearing and other measures widely accepted by the scientific community to slow the spread of the virus.Other members of the White House coronavirus task force have grown increasingly vocal about what they see as a dangerous fall spike in the virus.Trump’s aggressive approach to Fauci carries some risks this close to Election Day,A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in September showed 68% of Americans have a great deal or a fair amount of trust in Fauci to provide reliable information on the coronavirus. That compares with 52% of Americans who trusted Biden to do that and just 40% for Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/us-elections-2020-trump-hints-at-firing-dr-anthony-fauci-after-presidential-polls/story-6PLn7MKtZvEIJSGy6kQagL.html

Rescue efforts were continuing in eight buildings in Izmir where 79 people were killed, making Friday’s earthquake the deadliest in Turkey for nearly a decade. Two teenagers died on the Greek island of Samos, authorities said.Television footage showed the girl, Elif, being pulled from the rubble and carried by rescue workers on a stretcher to an ambulance, 65 hours after the earthquake struck. Elif’s two sisters and brother were rescued along with their mother on Saturday, but one of the children subsequently died. “A thousand thanks to you, my God. We have brought out our little one Elif from the apartment block,” Mehmet Gulluoglu, head of Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), wrote on Twitter.Read more: ‘I never lost hope’: 70-year-old pulled out alive in Turkey as earthquake toll hits 75More than 3,500 tents and 13,000 beds have been supplied to provide temporary shelter, according to AFAD, which said 962 people had been injured in Friday’s earthquake.More than 740 victims have so far been discharged from hospitals, AFAD said.It was the deadliest earthquake in Turkey since one in the eastern city of Van in 2011 which killed more than 500 people.

While Donald Trump barnstormed five states 48 hours before the election, Covid-conscious Joe Biden homed in on one valuable patch of political turf: battleground Pennsylvania.Instead of also jetting to Michigan or Wisconsin, swing states he most likely must flip to defeat Trump, Biden spent Sunday campaigning in his birth state, pleading for some voter love in the City of Brotherly Love to help pull him over the finish line.“Philadelphia, two more days!” the 77-year-old former vice president boomed to a few hundred people weathering the chill and drizzle as they sat in -- or on -- their cars at a drive-in rally.“We need every single one of you to get out and vote on Tuesday,” he implored. “In two days we can put an end to a presidency that has fanned the flames of hate all across this nation.”Biden narrowly leads Trump in Pennsylvania, according to the RealClearPolitics polls average showing him 4.3 percentage points up.But his style Sunday was less of a momentum-seizing challenger about to topple the most controversial US leader in a century, and more of a cautious contender going up against a loud-mouthed Goliath.At a surprise stop in Philadelphia, a few dozen people gathered in a parking lot to hear a masked Biden speak -- sometimes in tones so hushed people could barely make out what he was saying.The neighborhood scene, at dusk during a break in daylong rain, was picturesque, but felt more like a campaign stop by a young wannabe stumping in Iowa six months before the first nomination contest.Journalists were kept out of one Biden stop altogether when he addressed a union in nearby Chester, making those in the small pool of reporters following him wonder why he would not want every second of possible exposure.- Safety over ‘bravado’ -The race is boiling down to this eastern state of nearly 13 million residents that Trump won by just 44,000 votes four years ago.A full-on Sunday focus on Philadelphia apparently is not enough.Biden is scheduled to hold at least three more major events Monday in Pennsylvania, including an Election Night eve drive-in event in Pittsburgh, featuring pop star Lady Gaga.The Republican incumbent spent all day Saturday campaigning in Pennsylvania, holding far more audacious and rowdy rallies than Biden. They featured thousands of supporters with “Make America Great Again” caps. Social distancing and face masks? Not so much. “Nobody’s ever seen anything like this,” Trump said to cheers.Biden’s events are a world apart, the poster children of health-conscious campaigning during the Covid-19 era. An aide wipes down the microphone and lecturn just before Biden speaks. Unlike Trump, the 77-year-old Democrat wears a mask whenever he is not on stage.Voters at Biden’s events didn’t appear to mind the differences.“I care more about the votes than the optics, and I think the votes are on our side,” Birgit Hottenrott, a 52-year-old mother, told AFP at Biden’s drive-in rally.“The optics may be more visible from him,” she said of Trump, but “everybody’s safety is what’s so much more important than ego and bravado.”Biden is trying to squeeze every last vote particularly out of Philadelphia’s black community, a constituency that traditionally supports Democrats but which fell short of expectations in 2016 with Hillary Clinton.He brought his campaign to Sharon Baptist Church where some 50 cars were gathered in the parking lot to hear and honk for Biden.Bishop Millicent Hunter, a black pastor in Philadelphia, said that while she was confident of Biden taking Pennsylvania, she was on a mission “to encourage people that this is not a time to become complacent.”When pressed on whether she worried about a 2016 repeat, in which Clinton led in polls in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin only to lose those states and the election, she hesitated.“I think we’ve seen that movie, it was a tragedy,” the 60-something pastor said. “I just still think this is going to work for Joe Biden.”- ‘He’s a disgrace’ -Biden laid into Trump for having the “gall” to suggest doctors and hospitals were “falsely inflating” Covid-19 death numbers in order to boost profits.“It’s more than offensive, it’s a disgrace. He’s a disgrace,” he said, as supporters honked in agreement.Trump presents himself as “a tough guy, a macho man,” Biden sneered. “Gimme a break.”Each candidate has brought contrasting styles to Pennsylvania, and Joseph Gidjunis, a photographer and Biden volunteer from Philadelphia, made clear he understood the stakes in his state. “Everyone is doing their closing messages here because the Keystone State could be the key to their victory,” the 38-year-old said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-less-raucous-joe-biden-election-hope-rests-on-pennsylvania/story-7l5RmAO6vzxk7JdP7yUgDL.html
02-11-2020||World||World’s largest consumer of sugar wants people to eat more||In a world where sugar has attracted increasing scrutiny for its impact on health and obesity, there are moves afoot in the biggest consuming country to persuade people to eat more of the sweetener.Mills in India are eyeing increased consumption as a way to cut the nation’s chronic oversupply, which stems partly from the favorable incentives provided to growers in politically powerful rural areas. High production costs mean the country finds it hard to sell sugar on the global market without subsidies.To push forward their initiative, the mills have begun an online campaign to boost domestic demand, involving workshops and webinars, where everyone from nutritionists and endocrinologists, to public health experts and medical practitioners will share their expertise and knowledge.“Sugar is the most preferred source of the body’s fuel for brain power, muscle energy and every natural process that goes into proper functioning of our body cells,” the Indian Sugar Mills Association said, adding that the calories in sugar are the same as calories from any other food, and it’s only when calories are not burnt adequately or too many are consumed, that body weight increases.Social MediaConsumption in India has stagnated at 19 kilograms per capita per year compared with a global average of 23 kilograms as social media campaigns saying the cane-based sweetener is unhealthy discourage people from eating it, according to the association. Per capita consumption growth between 2000 and 2016 was among the lowest in the world, it said.If per capita consumption rises to the global average, domestic demand will climb by 5.2 million tons a year, according to Sudhanshu Pandey, the top bureaucrat at the food ministry. That would slash the surplus, cut overseas sales and save the government money by reducing export subsidies.India, also the world’s second-biggest producer, exported a record 5.65 million tons in 2019-20, with the help of these subsidies, which are opposed by Australia, Brazil and Guatemala. Mills are aiming to ship 6 million tons in 2020-21 with production expected to rise 13% after good rains boosted planting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-s-largest-consumer-of-sugar-wants-people-to-eat-more/story-vtqeA30xBm8oaXcwBqeaqN.html
02-11-2020||World||Canada stabbing attack suspect who killed two people identified, charged with murder||The 24-year-old who went on a stabbing rampage on Halloween night in Quebec City has been identified as Carl Girouard, who is believed to be from Sainte-Thérèse, a suburb of Montreal.He was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder as he made an appearance via video before a judge. Dressed in medieval costume, Girouard allegedly attacked multiple people, resulting in two fatalities and leaving five others injured. The city’s police, Service de police de la Ville de Québec, named the two victims as François Duchesne, 56, and Suzanne Clermont, 61.The stabbing spree occurred in the historic district of Quebec City, and according to Radio-Canada, police were first notified at about 10.30 pm local time on Saturday night, and launched a manhunt, finally captured him at around 1 am on Sunday.Police said there was no terror connection to the attacks, and that “he chose his victims at random” and came to Quebec City “with the intention of doing the most damage possible.”He used a Japanese katana sword for the attacks which took place at four locations in the city.According to the police, while Girouard did not have a criminal record, he had come to their notice five years earlier for wanting to allegedly commit a violent act.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his shock over the incident in a statement issued by his office. “We wish a full recovery to those who have been injured. We are keeping you in our thoughts. On behalf of the Government of Canada, we will always be there for you,” he said.“I would also like to thank first responders for their crucial work. They responded quickly to this tragedy and were there to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens.”Girouard is expected back in court on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-stabbing-attack-suspect-who-killed-two-people-identified-charged-with-murder/story-JULEGTURLLI3ITtzIaVv9N.html
02-11-2020||World||Pakistan dismisses India’s strong opposition to its moves in Gilgit-Baltistan||Pakistan, whose prime minister has officially declared a “provisional provincial status” to Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), has rejected India’s assertion that Islamabad did not have any locus standi to bring such material changes to the region, which is part of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.In a statement issued on Sunday, the Pakistan foreign office said it categorically rejected the Indian ministry of external affairs’ “irresponsible and unwarranted statement” regarding GB.India had firmly rejected the attempt by Pakistan “to bring material changes to a part of Indian territory under its illegal and forcible occupation,” after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan declared the provisional provincial status to GB, carved out from the former occupied Northern Areas.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said on Sunday that the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, “including the area of so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’, are an integral part of India by virtue of the legal, complete and irrevocable accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Union of India in 1947.”“The government of Pakistan has no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it,” he said. Attempts by Pakistan to “camouflage its illegal occupation cannot hide the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom for over seven decades to the people residing in these Pakistan-occupied territories”, Srivastava added. In its statement, the Pakistan foreign ministry claimed that India has no locus standi whatsoever on the issue — legal, moral or historical. “For more than 73 years, India has been in illegal and forcible occupation of parts of Jammu and Kashmir. Regurgitation of false and fabricated claims by India can neither change the facts nor divert attention from India’s illegal actions and continuing humanitarian crisis resulting from perpetration of the worst human rights violations” in Kashmir, it said.“Pakistan’s position on the Jammu & Kashmir dispute remains firmly anchored in the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions. The final resolution of the Jammu & Kashmir dispute is only possible through the exercise of the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination by holding free and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations.”It said the so-called provisional reforms in GB reflect the aspirations of its indigenous populace, adding that administrative, political and economic reforms are their long-standing demand.“Pakistan calls upon India to immediately end its illegal and forcible occupation of parts of Jammu & Kashmir and comply with its international obligations by allowing the Kashmiris to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination through a free and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations as enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” the statement said.The Pakistan government plans to make GB its fifth province, conduct elections there in mid-November, and send representatives to both houses of Parliament. Khan’s ruling party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, hopes to boost its numbers from the elections in GB. The move has the support of Pakistan’s military leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-dismisses-india-s-strong-opposition-to-its-moves-in-gilgit-baltistan/story-X73i4Sa5JmdbGFYQFhPWQN.html

He is the first openly gay person to hold the position. He also retains the finance portfolio, Al Jazeera reported.Women and the Maori community were also strongly represented in the 20-member Cabinet, including new Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta, who has a “moko kauae” - a traditional Maori tattoo on her chin. Ardern has revamped her ministerial line-up in the wake of a landslide election victory in October.“The next three years will be very challenging for New Zealand,” she told reporters in Wellington. “With the global outlook worsening, we won’t be immune to the ongoing effect Covid-19 is having around the world.”Taking pride in her Cabinet’s diversity, Ardern added appointments were made on merit.“It is both a Cabinet with huge merit and talent and which is incredibly diverse,” the 40-year-old said.“I think it’s an important point to make - these are individuals who have been promoted for what they bring to the Cabinet, they also reflect the New Zealand that elected them. I think as a country we should be proud of this,” she said.Prime Minister Ardern is now set to serve a second term. With 87 per cent of the votes counted, Ardern’s centre-left Labour Party has won 48.9 per cent of the vote, meaning her party looks likely to score the highest result that any party has achieved since the current political system was introduced in 1996.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jacinda-ardern-unveils-incredibly-diverse-cabinet/story-4YSsHFH56OOodioXR2ZJSM.html

At the same time, he indicated that his team is gearing up for a legal battle on the election night itself.“I think it is a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election. I think it is a terrible thing when people or states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over because it can only lead to one thing,” Trump said.“We are going in the night of -- as soon as the election is over -- we are going in with our lawyers,” he said as he criticised the decision taken by the Supreme Court to allow ballots to be received after Election Day in several battleground states.Click here for complete coverage of US Election 2020“I think there is a great danger to it and I think a lot of fraud and misuse can take place,” the president said. “I think it is a very dangerous, terrible thing. And I think it is terrible when we cannot know the results of an election the night of the election in a modern-day age of computers. I think it is a terrible thing,” he added.Critical of the Supreme Court decision, Trump said: “I think it is a very dangerous decision because you are going to have one or two or three states, depending on how it ends up, where they are tabulating ballots, and the rest of the world is waiting to find out. And I think there is a great danger to it, and I think a lot of fraud and misuse could take place.” Trump said if people wanted to get their ballots in, they should have gotten their ballots in long before. “They do not have to put their ballots in the same day, they could have put their ballots in a month ago. And we think it is a ridiculous decision,” he said. The president said he is doing well in the election. “We have great crowds. The first two were extremely cold. But they are great people, so that warmed it up,” he said.“We are doing tremendous numbers. Florida is doing very well. Ohio, as you heard, is doing phenomenally well. I think we are ahead in Ohio from four years ago, and we won by eight. If you look at North Carolina, we are doing great. I think we are doing well all over,” he asserted.“Georgia...is in our camp all the way. Texas is beyond good. We seem to be doing well all over. And that is not based on polls, that is based on numbers based on early ballots. So we are very happy with it. I think Michigan is plus-two, it just came out. We are plus-two in Michigan. We are really doing incredibly well,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-denies-report-that-he-would-declare-poll-victory-early-indicates-gearing-up-for-legal-battle/story-qP7Bh4X9TI7R7fOsfKbQgK.html

William, grandson of Queen Elizabeth and second-in-line to the British throne, kept his diagnosis a secret because he did not want to alarm the country, The Sun newspaper reported.“There were important things going on and I didn’t want to worry anyone,” William was quoted by the newspaper as having told an observer at an engagement.He was treated by palace doctors and followed government guidelines by isolating at the family home Anmer Hall, in Norfolk, the newspaper said, adding he still carried out 14 telephone and video call engagements during April.“William was hit pretty hard by the virus - it really knocked him for six. At one stage he was struggling to breathe, so obviously everyone around him was pretty panicked,” a source told The Sun.The BBC also confirmed the news from sources late on Sunday, with Kensington Palace and the office of Prince William refusing to comment officially to the news outlet. The palace was not immediately available for comment late on Sunday. The residence of William’s father, Prince Charles, had said on March 25 that Charles tested positive for the coronavirus. The heir to the throne had self-isolated at his residence in Scotland for seven days with mild symptoms.Britain has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak and has reported 46,717 Covid-19 deaths - defined as those dying within 28 days of a positive test.

Electors are nominated by the state’s party committees; the number is determined by the strength of a state’s House of Representatives and Senates. The electors usually follow a winner-takes-all system, voting for whichever candidate has won the popular vote in their state.Does popular vote count?The presidential candidate who wins the popular vote in the state picks up all the state’s electors except in Maine and Nebraska, which allow their electoral vote to be split. The candidate with 270 or more electoral votes wins. Winning the popular vote nationally is not enough — Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million in 2016, but Donald Trump got more electoral votes.Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic...More than a third of all eligible voters (including President Trump) have already cast their ballot in person, and via mail in a record-setting early voting turnout.Besides presidential elections...Americans will also vote to elect 435 members of the House of Representatives, 33 members of the senate (a third of the 100 seats of the upper chamber are up for election every election cycle), 11 state governors (and two of US Territories), and members of 86 state legislative chambers (lower and upper chambers) on November 3.Cost of the electionThe 2020 elections to the White House, House of Representatives are expected to cost an estimated $14 billion — a record. This includes money spent by candidates, parties and outside bodies and does not include expenses incurred by state governments.

02-11-2020||World||China’s Xi wants to diversify supply chains amid US curbs||Chinese President Xi Jinping called for setting up independent and controllable supply chains to ensure industrial and national security, just as the U.S. moves to cut China off from key exports.“We must strive to have at least one alternative source for key products and supply channels, to create a necessary industrial backup system,” Xi said in an April speech on the nation’s economic development that was only published Saturday by the Qiushi Journal, a publication of the ruling Communist Party. The magazine didn’t say why it had waited to release the remarks.Xi said the impact of the coronavirus epidemic exposed hidden risks in China’s industrial and supply chains, without elaborating, thus necessitating “independent, controllable, safe, and reliable” chains.Beijing last week outlined strategies for greater self-sufficiency as it unveiled its five-year economic plan after a plenum of top leaders and as tensions with the U.S. intensify. The U.S. has pressured allies to shun equipment from Huawei Technologies Co., barred dozens of China’s largest tech companies from buying American parts, and even slapped bans on ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat.Initial details of the five-year plan stressed the need for sustainable growth and also pledged to develop a robust domestic market. Officials didn’t specify the pace of growth they would seek over the period, but said the National Development and Reform Commission would work on guidelines to be submitted to country’s parliament in March.Xi’s April speech called for strengthening China’s advantages, saying its strong position in international industrial chains could act as a deterrence for external parties to cut off supply. He also called for China to consolidate its role as a global leader in the digital economy, and actively participate in formulating international rules in digital currency and digital tax to create new competitive advantages.Xi emphasized the role of state-owned enterprises -- a sticking point in trade negotiations with the U.S. -- calling them “an important pillar and support for national rejuvenation and for the party to govern.” He said SOEs must be “stronger, better, and bigger,” but that they also needed reform, without specifying.The speech also touched on expanding domestic demand, improving urbanization strategies, optimizing technology resources, and prioritizing the environment and public health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-xi-wants-to-diversify-supply-chains-amid-us-curbs/story-lmblJ8vYkcy3bO4Xh4FduL.html

Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Wednesday said that “legs were shaking and forehead perspiring” at a meeting of Pakistan’s top leaders, including Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, wherein Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi pleaded to release Wing Commander Abhinandan, saying if he was not released, India would attack Pakistan. “Legs were shaking and forehead perspiring, and the foreign minister (Qureshi) told us, ‘For God’s sake, let him (Varthaman) go back now because India is attacking Pakistan at 9 PM in the night’,” Sadiq said, recalling the meeting which was also attended by parliamentary leaders, including those from Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and PML-N, and added that “India was not planning to attack...They just wanted to kneel before India and send back Abhinandan.” Responding to Sadiq’s remarks, Pakistan Interior Minister Ejaz Shah told reporters that the government was pondering over registering a treason case against Sadiq as police have received a number of complaints against him. He said those toeing the line of India should better go to Amritsar. Posters of Sadiq have also appeared in Lahore, dubbing him a “traitor”. A number of posters and banners with pictures of Wing Commander Abhinandan and Sadiq were displayed in the constituency of the former National Assembly Speaker. Portraying Sadiq in Abhinandan’s getup, the posters read: “Mir Sadiq, Mir Jaffar... Ayaz Sadiq.” The PML-N has strongly reacted to the move blaming the PTI government for ‘awarding traitor certificates’ to its political opponents. PML-N Punjab information secretary lawmaker Azma Bokhari said the one who put up “traitor” posters of Sadiq must be having a criminal record like in the past cases registered against the PML-N leadership. The 37-year-old Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during aerial combat. In the early hours of February 26, 2019, the IAF jets bombed the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camps in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan and avenged the Pulwama terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel. Before his jet was hit, Abhinandan downed an F-16 fighter of Pakistan. He was released on the night of March 1 by Pakistan. In a speech in the National Assembly, Sadiq said that Prime Minister Imran Khan skipped the high-level meeting, which was attended by top leadership, including Army chief Gen Bajwa and Foreign Minister Qureshi.

02-11-2020||World||Vaccinationalism will prolong pandemic: Andrea D. Taylor of Global Health Innovation Center||High-income and a few middle-income countries with vaccine production capacity such as India and Brazil have pre-ordered nearly 3.8 billion doses, and are negotiating options for five billion more for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to an analysis released by the United States (US)-based Duke Global Health Innovation Center.India has pre-ordered 600 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, with another 1 billion doses under negotiation. India is second only to the US, which has pre-ordered 810 million and another 1.6 billion doses under negotiation.This “vaccinationalism” will lead to some countries being able to vaccinate their entire populations — and some many times over— while denying low-resource regions such as sub-Saharan Africa access to Covid-19 protection until 2024, said Andrea D. Taylor, the assistant director of programs at Global Health Innovation Center, Duke University, who led the analysis.Excerpts from the interview:What is the global annual manufacturing capacity for Covid-19 vaccines? This is unknown. What we do know is that capacity is dynamic and changes depend on a number of variables. Additional investments can open up more manufacturing capacity in three different ways: reserving capacity with existing vaccine manufacturers such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations,(CEPI) has recently done, building new manufacturing capacity as the United Kingdom (UK) and many countries are doing, and retrofitting pharmaceutical manufacturing centres that produce therapeutics to be able to produce Covid-19 vaccines. The manufacturing capacity is not set in stone and we can indeed expand it to some degree with targeted investment.How many people can get vaccinated by June 2021, assuming we need two doses for each person?There are too many unknowns to answer this question. None of the current vaccine candidates are through the regulatory process yet. There is some hope that at least one or two vaccines will be approved and start to ship by March 2021, but again, we do not know what will happen. Some manufacturers, including the Serum Institute of India (SII), are manufacturing and stockpiling doses of leading vaccine candidates in a bid to have a jump start if the candidates are approved. This will help to ensure that millions of doses are ready to go if the vaccines do receive approval.How have some nations managed to pre-order COVID-19 vaccines before others?Our analysis indicates that there are four factors that have allowed countries to secure pre-orders of Covid-19 vaccines: capacity for vaccine development in-country, capacity for vaccine manufacturing in-country, large investment of public dollars into the development vaccines, and purchasing power to make large orders that assume some level of risk, given that the product is not yet approved. Primarily, it is the high-income countries that have most or all of these factors and have been able to secure enough doses to cover their entire populations and in some cases several times over. There have been some middle-income countries, including India, that are able to leverage their vaccine development and manufacturing capacity to secure pre-orders. Some other middle-income countries that do not have any of these factors have been able to support clinical trials and use that to leverage purchase deals. But our analysis shows that low-income countries have not been able to make any pre-orders and are losing out.Also read | Public participation a must to contain infection spreadWhich countries are the worst offenders? In terms of numbers of confirmed doses, the US has pre-ordered the largest number at 810 million confirmed, with another 1.6 billion doses under negotiation, followed by India at 600 million doses confirmed, with another 1 billion doses under negotiation, and the European Union (EU) at 400 million doses confirmed, with another 1.565 billion doses under negotiation. But in terms of per cent of population covered by confirmed purchases, Canada has pre-purchased enough vaccine to cover 527% of their population, followed by the UK at 277%. Of course, it is important to remember that mostly likely only some of the vaccines purchases will come through, depending on regulatory approval.How will Advanced Market Commitments (AMCs) set back access to vaccines in less and least developed nations? What will be the size of the global population denied access to vaccination?We do not have the data to predict this, as the landscape is changing almost daily. What we do know is that, because of manufacturing constraints, AMCs reduce the number of doses available to partnerships like Covax that are committed to equitable access for the least developed nations. As a manufacturing powerhouse, India will play a critical role in ensuring that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) do have access to the vaccine. India’s stated commitment to prioritising distribution not only within India but also to neighbouring LMICs is very important.Do you have projections of morbidity and mortality as a result of equitable access to vaccines? We do not have any data on this. Our study does not project morbidity and mortality. We may look at that in the future.Can the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Covax Facility ensure equitable global access to Covid-19 vaccines?Yes, the Covax facility is our best opportunity to ensure global access for three reasons. First, it mitigates risk by investing in a portfolio of vaccine candidates to maximise the likelihood of having one or more succeed through the regulatory process. Countries are doing this individually, but it is generally only high-income countries that can afford large orders of multiple vaccines. For the rest of the world, Covax’s portfolio approach is critical.Second, the Covax Facility, through partners CEPI and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) can reserve manufacturing capacity globally without tying it directly to a specific vaccine, ensuring that there will be capacity to ramp up production once a winner is identified.Third, and this is most critical for equitable access, Covax can function as an air traffic controller, ensuring that vaccines ship out to all countries at the same time, rather than the first doses to the highest bidder. Through Covax’s coordination, all participating countries can receive initial doses to vaccinate frontline workers at the same time. There is no global coordination of distribution, as doses become available, without Covax. Given that many countries are acting in national interest, what is the way forward to stop the spread of Covid-19?It is understandable that countries are acting in their national interest; they are incentivised to focus first on the safety of their populations. But globally, this leads to a pattern of behaviour that will leave some countries with little to nothing, deepen existing inequities, and prolong the pandemic. Our research points to the need for countries and multilateral funders to unlock additional manufacturing capacity, particularly in the Global South, and invest in preparing countries for effective distribution of vaccines. High-income countries should also work with Covax, as a global coordinator, to ensure that, once their populations are covered, excess doses are redeployed where they are needed most around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinationalism-will-prolong-pandemic-andrea-d-taylor-of-global-health-innovation-center/story-QJst27YNJ93DHdG3PHH0zO.html

Vaccine candidates of several companies are at various stages of trials meaning that it might take some more time before the world eventually gets its first shot against Covid-19.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe pandemic, meanwhile, continues to surge across Europe, after a brief lull in cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom has announced a new four-week lockdown in England, which will come into effect from Thursday. Also, the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Sunday he had been identified as a contact of someone who tested positive for Covid-19.Read: UK’s Johnson says there is no alternative to lockdownHere are the latest updates on a potential Covid-19 vaccine:1. India’s Bharat Biotech International Limited on Sunday said it is planning to launch its vaccine candidate in the second quarter of 2021, after getting approval from regulatory authorities. The Hyderabad-based company said it plans to conduct recruitment and dosage for the third phase of its vaccine trials in November. Sai Prasad, Bharat Biotech’s executive director, said the trial will take place in 25 sites across 10-12 states in the country. During the trials, two doses each for the vaccine and placebo recipients will be provided.Read: WHO chief says he is identified as contact of Covid-19 positive person2. A global study has said India has used its manufacturing capabilities to pre-order 600 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine and is negotiating for another billion. The doses, says the study, are enough to vaccinate at least half the population. Only the United States, which has the highest number of cases, has pre-ordered more doses--810 million-- than the second worst-hit India. Most experimental Covid-19 vaccines require two doses.Read: Global study sees India having edge in Covid-19 vaccines3. Israel has started human trials for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, with 80 volunteers participating in the initial phase. The number of volunteers will be expanded to 960 by December. If the first two phases are successful, a third phase will be launched in April/May 2021 with 30,000 volunteers. If these trials are successful, the vaccine will be ready for the general public by the end of next summer.(4.) 4. AstraZeneca Inc, which is among the companies testing a vaccine candidate, has said Britain’s health regulator has started an ‘accelerated’ review of its potential vaccine. AstraZeneca is working on the vaccine along with the University of Oxford and their vaccine candidate is called ‘AZD1222’ or ‘ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.’ In an ‘accelerated’ review, also called a ‘rolling’ review, regulators can view clinical data in real-time and talk to drug makers on the manufacturing process and trials to accelerate the approval process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-bharat-biotech-to-launch-candidate-in-q2-2021-israel-starts-human-trials/story-QQWn3o8pBlnVHhIMzEBnTN.html
02-11-2020||World||‘I never lost hope’: 70-year-old pulled out alive in Turkey as earthquake toll hits 75||Rescue workers in western Turkey extricated a 70-year-old man from a collapsed building Sunday, some 34 hours after a strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea struck Turkey and Greece, killing at least 75 people and injuring close to 1,000.The man was pulled out of the rubble overnight and doing well at a hospital, according to the Turkish health minister. The minister tweeted that the survivor, Ahmet Citim, told him, “I never lost hope.” The operation that saved Citim was the latest in a series of remarkable rescues after the Friday afternoon earthquake.But on the third day since the disaster, search-and-rescue teams appeared to be finding more bodies than survivors in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city. They continued searching in eight toppled buildings, but work was paused at one when authorities determined the damaged structure next door was also at risk of falling, forcing rescuers and people waiting outside to retreat.The earthquake was centered in the Aegean northeast of the Greek island of Samos. Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) raised the death toll Sunday in Izmir province to 73. The agency said 961 people were injured in Turkey, with more than 220 still receiving treatment Sunday.The earthquake also killed two teenagers on Samos and injured at least 19 other people on the island.There was some debate over the magnitude of the earthquake. The US Geological Survey rated it 7.0, while the Istanbul’s Kandilli Institute put it at 6.9 and AFAD said it measured 6.6.The quake triggered a small tsunami that hit Samos and the Seferihisar district of Izmir, drowning one elderly woman. The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Hundreds of aftershocks followed.Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said 26 badly damaged buildings would be demolished in Izmir.“It’s not the earthquake that kills but buildings,” he added, repeating a common slogan.Turkey has a mix of older buildings and cheap or illegal construction, which can lead to serious damage and deaths when earthquakes hit. Regulations have been tightened in light of earthquakes to strengthen or demolish buildings and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities but it is not happening fast enough.Two destroyed apartment buildings in Izmir where much of the rescues are taking place had received reports of “decay” in 2012 and 2018, according to the municipal agency in charge of such certificates. Turkish media including the Hurriyet newspaper said one of the apartments, which was built in 1993, was at risk of earthquake damage because of its low quality concrete and the lack of reinforcements. However, the building continued to be occupied.A 73-year-old survivor from one of those buildings said she was on her third-floor balcony when the quake struck and believes there were at least 50 people in the building, which also had a café on the bottom floor.“In the first tremor nothing happened. During the second tremor, the seventh floor, sixth and fourth floors fell on top of another like a sandwich,” Suzan Dere said. “The building collapsed in a cloud of dust onto the street with a very loud noise. It all happened within one minute.”Turkey’s justice minister said prosecutors have begun investigating several collapsed buildings and promised legal repercussions if experts identified neglect.AFAD said nearly 6,400 personnel had been activated for rescue work and hundreds of others for food distribution, emergency help and building damage control.Turkey is crisscrossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece as well.In a rare show of unity amid months of tense relations over energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity over the quake toll.Pope Francis on Sunday asked the faithful to pray for the people of the Aegean Sea.The quake occurred as Turkey was already struggling with an economic downturn and the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Turkey has more than 10,000 confirmed virus deaths but some experts have accused the government of concealing the true impact of the virus with the way it counts new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-never-lost-hope-70-year-old-pulled-out-alive-in-turkey-as-earthquake-toll-hits-75/story-eRHh5VfAOGyoAv9LIiXYzM.html

The Texas Tribune newspaper reported that the sideswiped vehicle was being driven by a Biden campaign staffer.According to the Biden campaign, staff aboard the bus called emergency-911 to report the incident, and local law enforcement responded to the calls and assisted the bus in reaching its destination.Neither Biden nor his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, was aboard the bus. The Texas Tribune reported that its passengers included Democratic U.S. House of Representatives candidate and former Texas state Senator Wendy Davis.“FBI San Antonio is aware of the incident and investigating,” special agent Michelle Lee, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Antonio, told Reuters in an email. “No further information is available at this time.”Close race in Texas The highway confrontation came as polls showed an unexpectedly tight race between Biden and Trump in Texas, which has long been a Republican stronghold.“Rather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters and others in harm’s way,” Biden’s Texas campaign spokesman, Tariq Thowfeek, said in a statement. “We’ll see you on November 3rd.”Texas Republican Party Chairman Allen West, in a statement, dismissed media reports of the incident as “more fake news and propaganda,” adding: “Prepare to lose ... stop bothering me.”Speaking about the Texas bus incident on the campaign trail on Sunday in Philadelphia, Biden called Trump’s endorsement of such actions abnormal and divisive, saying: “We’ve never had anything like this. At least we’ve never had a president who thinks it’s a good thing.”Commenting during a campaign stop of his own in Michigan on Sunday, Trump said: “Did you see our people yesterday? They were protecting his bus.”Texas was not the only place where “Trump trains” of supporters forming vehicle convoys have caused consternation. Video footage on social media on Sunday showed vehicles flying pro-Trump flags blocking traffic on the Whitestone Bridge over the East River in New York City’s Bronx borough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-probing-donald-trump-caravan-confrontation-with-joe-biden-campaign-bus-in-texas/story-ogeIq8Lk21zrDf3l9BXSqM.html

Scientists have warned a worst-case scenario of 80,000 dead could be exceeded this winter.“Models of our scientists suggest that unless we act now, we could see deaths over the winter that are twice as bad or more compared with the first wave,” Johnson is expected to say, according to his office.“Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level.”Britain has reported 46,717 Covid-19 deaths - defined as those dying within 28 days of a positive test. A broader measure of those with Covid-19 on their death certificates puts the toll at 58,925.Essential shops, schools, and universities in England will remain open but pubs and restaurants will be shut apart from for takeaways. Outbound international travel will be discouraged except for work and non-essential retail will close.Lawmakers will vote on these measures on Wednesday and the opposition Labour Party has offered its support.The rest of the United Kingdom - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - have their own lockdown policies and enacted tougher health restrictions last month.Cabinet minister Michael Gove on Sunday said England’s lockdown could be extended beyond December 2 if necessary, but Johnson will tell lawmakers that an extension is not the plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-johnson-says-there-is-no-alternative-to-lockdown/story-4sgOJGlUySl7tQ8noVX2JJ.html

Topping the list of Indian Americans are well known community leaders Swadesh Chatterjee, Rameshk Kapoor, Shekar N Narasimhan, R Rangaswami, Ajay Jain Bhutoria, and Frank Islam.Among other prominent Indian American bundlers are Neil Makhija, Rahu, Prakash, Deepak Raj, Raj Shah, Rajan Shah, Radhika Shah, Jill and Raj Singh, Nidhi Thakar, Kiran Jain, Sony Kalsi, and Bela Bajaria.Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has also been listed as a bundler. Given that the list of bundlers includes all those who have raised more than USD 100,000, the number of Indian Americans in far less than those of former presidents Barack Obama and Bil Clinton campaigns. Some of the traditional Indian-American Democratic donors like hotelier Sant Chatwal are missing from the list.According to The Wall Street Journal, the list of “bundlers” includes a who’s who of Democratic politics, including former and current governors, Senators, Cabinet secretaries and big names from Hollywood.Film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, writer and director Lee Daniels, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; media mogul Haim Saban and former US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker are on the list, the daily said.According to CNN, Biden is on track to become the first presidential candidate to raise USD 1 billion from donors in a two-year cycle, and he entered the final sprint to Election Day with a big cash advantage over US President Donald Trump.In August and September alone, Biden raised more than USD 700 million. Biden and Trump, a Republican, are facing each other in the November 3 presidential polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-polls-joe-biden-discloses-names-of-major-bundlers-including-indian-americans/story-I0o8EnrfePrJhkzRytr52N.html

Top US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the US “could not possibly be positioned more poorly” to stem rising cases. He told the Washington Post he believed Biden “is taking it seriously from a public health perspective,” while Trump is “looking at it from a different perspective.” As England goes into coronavirus Lockdown 2 from Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called in the army to help with a massive testing drive. AstraZeneca said on Sunday UK’s health regulator had started an accelerated review of its potential vaccine. The lockdown may be extended if cases are not down, senior minister Michael Gove said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-says-18-donald-trump-rallies-led-to-30-000-covid-19-infections/story-dShw3ynSNYVdwXEUBDwMaL.html

Large crowds of people gathered in the eastern part of Minsk headed toward Kurapaty, a wooded area on the city’s outskirts where over 200,000 people were executed by Soviet secret police during Stalinist-era purges.Demonstrators carried banners reading, “The people’s memory (lasts) longer than a life of a dictatorship” and “Stop torturing your people!” The crowds directed chants of “Go away!” at Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who won his sixth term in an August 9 election that is widely seen as rigged. Lukashenko’s crushing victory over his popular, inexperienced challenger, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has triggered the largest and the most sustained wave of mass protests of his 26 years in power.The 66-year-old former state farm director, who was once nicknamed “Europe’s Latest Dictator,” has relentlessly suppressed opposition and independent media in Belarus but struggled to quell the recent unrest. Large protest crowds have assembled in the streets of Minsk and other cities almost daily, despite police countering the demonstrations with water cannons, stun grenades, rubber bullets and mass detentions.The Belarusian Interior Ministry threatened to use firearms against the rally-goers “if need be.” On Sunday, police acknowledged officers fired several warning shots into the air during the demonstration in Minsk “to prevent violations of the law.” Armoured off-road vehicles equipped with machine guns were seen in Minsk for the first time in almost three months, along with water cannon vehicles and other anti-riot equipment. Several metro stations were closed, and mobile internet service did not work.Police detained over 150 people in Minsk and other Belarusian cities where protests were held Sunday, according to the Viasna center. Several journalists were among the detainees, and many of those detained were beaten up, human rights activists said.“The authorities are trying to close the lid on the boiling Belarusian pot more tightly, but history knows very well what this leads to,” Viasna leader Ales Bialiatski said.Tsikhanouskaya entered the presidential race instead of her husband, a popular opposition blogger, after he was jailed in May,. SHe challenged the results of the election in which she secured 10% of the vote to the incumbent president’s 80%, then left Belarus for Lithuania under pressure from the authorities.She issued a statement Sunday in support of the ongoing protests.“The terror is happening once again in our country right now,” Tsikhanouskaya said. “We haven’t forgotten our past, we won’t forget what is happening now.” Over 15,000 people have been detained since the presidential election, and human rights activists have declared more than 100 of them to be political prisoners.All prominent members of the opposition’s Coordination Council, which was formed to push for a transition of power, have either been jailed or forced to leave the country.Lukashenko scoffed at suggestions of dialogue with the opposition and instead intensified the crackdown on protesters, ordering officials to expel students from universities for participating in demonstrations and to take action against plant workers that go on strike.On Thursday, the government shut Belarus’ borders with Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine, They said the move was intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, although officials previously accused neighbouring countries of trying to destabilize Belarus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-fire-warning-shots-as-thousands-protest-in-belarus/story-kek3uVywgxqb1dMtYcKlGM.html

In September, leaders of the two principal Opposition parties in Canada’s Parliament, Erin O’Toole of the Conservatives, and Yves-François Blanchet of the Bloc Québécois, went into self-isolation after testing positive for the virus. Both recovered and returned to the House of Commons session.In mid-March, as the pandemic first started making its presence felt in Canada, Trudeau also went into self-isolation for several weeks after his wife Sophie Gregoire was infected during an event in London.The government has faced criticism in recent days as the second wave of the pandemic has exposed the lack of an efficient and timely testing protocol, with results often delayed, as well as the low uptake of the app. While about five million persons have so far downloaded the app, a couple of provinces have yet to adopt it citing shortcomings in how it works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-deputy-pm-self-isolates-after-contact-with-covid-positive-person/story-xGUvVc0gC8zlw0VqjA5iSM.html

This comes in less than a year after the people of Jharkhand voted in favour of the ruling JMM and Congress candidates in the regular assembly polls which were held in December 2019.The by-election on two seats was necessitated as chief minister Hemant Soren vacated Dumka assembly after registering victory from two seats and retained Barhait. Bermo fell vacant after veteran Congress legislator Rajendra Prasad Singh died of illness in May. There are 17 candidates in Dumka while 16 are in the fray in Bermo constituency. However, the contest is bipolar in both seats with the ruling JMM and Congress locked in a direct battle against the BJP candidates. The BJP has received an extra boost in its contest after Sudesh Mahto-led AJSU Party has also extended support to the saffron party. One of the oldest allies of the BJP in the state, AJSU is back in the national democratic alliance (NDA) folder, after having parted ways in December polls and going solo. While the JMM has fielded Basant Soren, younger son of party patriarch Shibu Soren from its traditional stronghold Dumka, Congress has fielded Jaimangal Singh, son of the deceased six-term party legislator Rajendra Singh from Bermo, inviting the ire of the opposition that has accused the ruling allies of nepotism. On the other hand, the BJP is banking on its old faces, former minister from Dumka Lois Marandi and two term-legislator Yogeshwar Mahto Batul from Bermo in Bokaro district. The campaigning for the two seats was led by the top local leaders and central leaders from neither the Congress nor the BJP entered the campaign trail. While three former BJP chief ministers campaigned for the BJP candidates, chief minister Hemant Soren remained the star campaigner for the ruling alliance, besides state-level leaders of the Congress. As the campaign reached its end on Sunday, the war of words got shriller, especially over the alleged unparliamentary language used by former CM Raghubar Das against the ruling combine. The BJP leaders also dared the state government to arrest its state president Deepak Prakash after a Congress leader registered an FIR accusing him of criminal conspiracy and treason.Prakash, also a member of Rajya Sabha had stated during the campaign that the JMM-Congress-RJD combine government would fall after the by-poll and the BJP would form government in the state within few months.Though both sides are claiming victory in both seats, the electoral outcome is unlikely to make any immediate impact to the stability of the 10-month old government as the numbers in the 81-member assembly are stacked in favour of the ruling JMM-Congress-RJD combine with support of at least 48 legislators of the existing 78 members.One seat fell vacant last month after the demise of JMM legislator and minority affairs minister Haji Hussain Ansari.Political experts say it would be too early to term the electoral outcome of the by-polls as a referendum on the government. “Almost six of nine months of this government has been under covid crisis. So it would be too early to view it as a litmus test. Though it is difficult to predict the outcome, ruling parties have a history of enjoying an advantage in by-polls,” said LK Kundan, who teaches political science at Ranchi University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-by-polls-bjp-eyes-to-wrest-dumka-bermo-from-ruling-jmm-congress/story-NG7MIVczxrjVZHk9Sjqz2L.html

Goriakothi assembly constituency is one among the 94 seats for which election would be held in the second round of polling.Three main parties, namely Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) will closely contest for the Goriakothi seat which falls in Siwan district.While the seat has swung between the BJP and the RJD in the past, RJD candidate Satyadeo Prasad won in 2015 assembly elections with a margin of 7,651 votes. He secured 70,965 votes in total and BJP candidate Devesh Kant Singh finished second with 63,314 votes.

02-11-2020||India||Baroda bypolls: Why this seat is a battle of prestige for Congress, BJP||A head-to-head contest between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress is in the offing for the Baroda bypoll in Haryana which will go to polls on Tuesday.Riding on the charisma of former chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the Congress is hoping for a fourth consecutive victory from this Deswali belt seat since 2009 assembly polls. Additionally, in a bid to open an account from this seat, the saffron party is making the last ditch effort. The seat fell vacant after the demise of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda on April 12 this year.A total of 14 candidates are in the fray for the bypoll. While the BJP has fielded Olympian wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, who lost by about 4,800 votes to Hooda in the 2019 assembly election, the Congress has put its money on a newcomer, Indu Raj Narwal, a former member of Sonepat zila parishad.A total of 1.78 lakh voters- 97,819 males, 80,429 females and 2 transgender will exercise their voting rights, according to figures released by the Election Commission officials. Of these, 5,092 voters are above 80 years of age and 1,860 service electors. As many as 280 polling stations (223 main and 57 auxiliary) have been formed and a booth can have a maximum of 1,000 electors.As the seat will undergo polling exercise during a coronavirus disease outbreak, the Election Commission of India has arranged for one lakh single–use gloves for Baroda voters to put on when they press the EVM button to cast their votes, 57,500 surgical masks, 3,500 face shields, 1,650 bottles of hand sanitiser (500 ml each) and 3,500 each personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and N-95 face masks. Why Baroda seat is a battle of prestige for HoodaAnant Ram, retired professor of political science at Bhiwani Government College, said the bypoll is a challenge for Hooda to save his bastion and similarly the results of the election will be a verdict on the performance of the BJP-JJP government.“A win here will underscore Hooda’s hold in the Deshwali belt and restore the Congress tally in the assembly to 31. However, the bypoll is significant for the BJP-JJP government as the outcome will reflect the performance of the government and mood of the voters towards the alliance partner, who had contested the 2019 assembly election separately and targeted guns at each other. Ram explained that the BJP has made an experiment to pitch a non-Jat candidate from the rural Jat dominated seat amid three laws’ protests. “If they win from the Baroda seat, they will adopt this strategy in other Jat dominated seats in the future elections. If they lose this election, it will impact the image of the chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar,” he added.BJP distributes money, liquor and refill gas cylinders to woo voters, alleges HoodaAddressing a press conference at his residence, leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda alleged that the BJP leaders and workers have been distributing money, liquor and refilling gas cylinders of poor voters to influence the election.“The BJP has reached such a low level but they can’t purchase the self respect of voters. The Congress will definitely defeat the BJP in this high-stake bypoll. Even the Jind Director Inspector General (DIG) OP Narwal, is canvassing in favour of the BJP candidate. We have written to the election commission of India (ECI) to take action in both incidents,” Hooda said.The Congress and Hooda are banking heavily on the support of Jat voters who have a brute 52% majority in this Deswali belt constituency. The Congress nominee, Indu Raj Narwal,40, is a Jat who comes from Rindhana village in neighbouring Gohana tehsil, a village known to spring up international kabaddi players. He was a surprise pick after Hooda’s original choice Kapoor Singh Narwal, a turncoat from the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) stable and who till recently was in the BJP, was not given a Congress nomination.His BJP rival, 37-year-ol Yogeshwar Dutt, a Commonwealth gold winning wrestler is a Brahmin and banks heavily on being a sporting icon and the BJP’s ability to sway the non-Jat votes. Dutt who comes from Bhainswal Kalan, a Jat dominated village had made his electoral debut in 2019 assembly polls after securing a BJP nomination from Baroda. His second shot at Baroda will depend on his star power and consolidation of non-Jats in this Jat dominated constituency. Brahmins account for about 12% votes in Baroda.Om Prakash Chautala’s Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has fielded Joginder Singh Malik,41, a candidate who badly lost the 2019 assembly election from Baroda. Malik, a Jat candidate finished a poor fifth securing only 3,145 votes, less than 3% of the total votes polled.Former BJP MP from Kurukshetra, Rajkumar Saini, who had floated his own outfit last year has also thrown his hat in the contest. However, the INLD candidate and Saini are unlikely to affect the outcome of the Congress versus BJP contest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baroda-bypolls-why-this-seat-is-a-battle-of-prestige-for-congress-bjp/story-Ko32ALSmvKX8hX1bys4O3J.html

The drug has been included as an “investigational therapy” and recommended only for restricted emergency use purposes. The drug, which is administered in the form of an injection, has been allowed for restricted emergency use for a maximum five-day period for treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 in adults and children hospitalised in moderate stage of the illness, subject to several safeguards. Several companies in India, such as Dr Reddy’s, Hetero and Cipla among others have been granted permission by the the DCGI to manufacture and market remdesivir for “restricted emergency use” on hospitalised Covid-19 patients.Written informed consent of each patient is required before the use of the drug and results of additional clinical trials, active post-marketing surveillance data and reporting of serious adverse events have to be submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcgi-rejects-dr-reddy-s-laboratories-application-for-full-marketing-authorisation-of-remdesivir/story-NWtbrcKTODailLMNzOwmWJ.html

The by-poll was necessitated after Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) MLA and former chief minister Ajit Jogi passed away in May this year. The constituency has been the bastion of Jogi for last two decades but this is the first time in last 20 years when the Jogis are not in the fray because Amit Jogi’s nomination from the JCC was rejected.Jogi’s nomination was rejected based on a high-power committee report which found that he was not a tribal. The nomination papers of Jogi’s wife Richa Jogi, who had filed nomination for the same seat, were also cancelled by the district collector on the same ground On Saturday, the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (Jogi) had extended support to the BJP candidate alleging that the ruling Congress has insulted late Ajit Jogi. The JCC has four MLAs in the 90-member Chhattisgarh assembly. In another development on Sunday, a couple of JCC MLAs extended their support to Congress in a press conference in Marwahi.

The people have understood that the present government is pro poor and pro tribal and hence they have decided to vote for us,” said state minister Jai Singh Agarwal, in-charge of the Congress for Marwahi by-poll.While the BJP accused the Congress government of failing on all fronts, it also alleged that the law and order situation in the state has deteriorated. As many as 1,90,907 voters - 93,694 males, 97,209 females and four from the third gender - will exercise their franchise for which 286 polling stations have been set up.

A group of community stalwarts scattered across the world has decided to chip in with a foundation. It will help create a sustainable ecosystem to incubate start-ups and encourage young entrepreneurs to scale up their businesses to the next level.The Global Kashmiri Pandit Business Foundation (GKPBF) was formally launched on 22 October, a day marked in the memories of Kashmiri Pandits as a Black Day when tribals backed by Pakistani army invaded Jammu and Kashmir in 1947.The foundation hopes the community would have something positive to remember the day for. “22nd October of year 2020 would be known as a historic day for Kashmiri Pandit (KP) community in the world,” said a statement issued by the foundation that hopes to build the ground for a new legacy.A little over 40 years after the 1947 invasion, the Kashmiri Pandit families in Kashmir found themselves under attack again in 1990 when Pakistan backed terrorists forced Pandits out of the Kashmir Valley.“But they forgot that we are seeds, we bloomed again after getting scattered all around the globe,” said founder and GKPBF director DK Bakshi.“Three decades of struggle put in by the most peaceful, educated but resilient community of KPs with utter confidence and grit came, saw and conquered the world. The talent in the community is absolutely of the highest order and today you name any country and you will find KP community there trying to work towards development of their families and future generations and giving it back to them who gave them those opportunities,” said DK Bakshi.The foundation, formally launched on 22 October at an online event, was the first step.   trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("GEO_MAP", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"/m/0cqt90","geo":"US","time":"today 3-m"},{"keyword":"/m/012gx2","geo":"US","time":"today 3-m"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0cqt90,%2Fm%2F012gx2&hl=en-US&tz=-330","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"});  The GKPBF co-founders include Ash Raina from Brisbane, Australia, DK Bakshi from Thailand, Jyotsna Fotedar from Gurugram India, Ravi Kachroo from Bangalore India, Vinod K.

Notice has been issued on behalf of the speaker,” his counsel told the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.In its order, the bench said, “There is nothing wrong in summoning by the Assembly but if any action is taken by the privilege committee then you can challenge it.” “As prayed for, list the matter on November 6, 2020. In the meantime, the petitioner (Goswami) is directed to file requisite affidavit.” On September 30, the apex court had sought Maharashtra Assembly secretary’s response on Goswami’s plea.Goswami’s counsel had earlier told the bench that the journalist has not interfered with either the proceedings of any of the committees of the Assembly or the Assembly itself. Rajput, 34, was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. The CBI is probing the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-arnab-goswami-s-plea-against-show-cause-notice-on-nov-6/story-XJo9Xc6emXVhowPTjkmY4H.html
02-11-2020||India||10 states to go to by-polls on Tuesday; keen contest in MP, UP, Gujarat, Karnataka||Along with the second phase of polling in Bihar, voting for 56 other assembly seats across 10 states would also take place on Tuesday, a first electoral test for political parties in times of Covid-19. Although the ruling party in the state wins the by-polls majority of times, there is a keen contest on cards in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka and Manipur.Except for Madhya Pradesh, the outcome of by-poll will have no impact on the incumbent state governments. In MP, the BJP needs to win at least 8 of the 28 assembly seats to have a majority in the 230-member house. The Congress needs to win all seats to touch the magic figure of 115. Even though 63 seats were vacant, the Election Commission announced polls on 56 seats. These 7 vacant seats are in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam, and West Bengal, all of which are scheduled to get new Assemblies next year. The remaining two seats – in Manipur - would go to polls in November 7. Counting of votes for all by-polls would be on November 10 along with Bihar.Also read: Karnataka by-polls - BJP looks to wrest Sira, RR Nagar; Congress hopes for upset winsUttar PradeshStage is set for multi-corner contests in the by-elections to seven assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday with ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress candidates in fray. Elections will take place in Naugawan Sadat (Amroha), Bulandshahr, Tundla (Firozabad), Bangarmau (Unnao), Ghatampur (Kanpur), Deoria and Malhani (Jaunpur) seats. Polling will begin at 7 am and continue till 6 pm with strict enforcement of Covid-19 guidelines. Of the seven, six seats were held by the BJP and one by SP.GujaratBy-polls to eight Assembly seats in Gujarat will be held on November 3. The eight seats that will go to polls — Abdasa, Limdi, Morbi, Dhari, Gadhada (ST), Karjan, Dangs (ST) and Kaprada (ST) — fell vacant after Congress MLAs representing them quit the party before the Rajya Sabha elections in June, thus bringing down the strength of the party in the polls. The elections were necessitated by the resignation of Congress MLAs before June 2020 assembly elections, helping the saffron party win both the RS seats. In all the assembly seats, it is a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP. The Congress sees good performance in by-polls as seeds of revival before 2022 assembly elections and the BJP would like to cement its position in state politics by winning all the seats. The new Gujarat BJP chief, CR Patil, has set himself an ambitious goal of winning all 182 seats in the Assembly elections of 2022. While the BJP’s campaign has been largely around the national issues of the Ram temple at Ayodhya, the abrogation of Article 370, and attacks against the “sinking ship” of the Congress, the Congress has focused on the MLAs who were “bought over” by the BJP. The economic distress brought by the pandemic and the lockdown have not got much attention from either party.KarnatakaAll the three main parties in Karnataka – the BJP, the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) - have made it a prestige battle to win the Sira and Raja Rajeshwari (RR) Nagar, two assembly constituencies which go to polls. The Sira seat fell vacant after the sitting JDS MLA B Satyanarayana died due to Covid-19. The RR Nagar seat is witnessing by-polls as MLA Munirathna resigned and crossed over from the Congress to the BJP helping topple the JDS-Congress coalition government in the state. The fate of 31 candidates who are in contention for the two seats will be sealed on Tuesday.Also read: Uttar Pradesh bypolls on Tuesday, multi-corner contests to decide fate of 88 candidatesBoth the constituencies are Vokkaliga dominated. While the BJP, which has never won any of the two constituencies, is looking to break into new territory and expand its base, for the Congress this is the first poll the party is facing elections under new Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar who wants to prove a point. For the regional JDS, it is an existential question as any loss would diminish the party’s historic role as a key third pole in the state politics. The outcome of the polls though is unlikely to affect the power balance in the state as BJP enjoys a clear simple majority with 117 members in the 225 member assembly apart from the support of three independents.However, a win for BJP in Sira, where CM Yediyurappa’s son B Y Vijayendra is leading the party’s campaign, would help cement his position in the party.JharkhandOf the two by-polls in Jharkhand, all eyes are on Dumka from where chief minister Hemant Soren’s young brother Basant Soren is in fray against former minister and BJP leader Lious Marandi. The other constituency going to polls is Bermo from where sitting Congress legislator Rajendra Prasad Singh died of illness in May. Hemant Soren vacated Dumka assembly after registering victory from two seats and retained Barhait. There are 17 candidates in Dumka while 16 are in the fray in Bermo constituency. The contest is bipolar in both seats with the ruling JMM and Congress locked in a direct battle against the BJP candidates.ChhattisgarhIn Chhattishgarh’s Marwahi assembly constituency, Congress’s Krishan Kumar Dhruv and BJP‘s Gambir Singh are pitted against each other with no one from the Jogi clan in the fray for the first time in 20 years. The election was necessitated after Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) MLA and former chief minister Ajit Jogi passed away in May and his wife Richa Jogi’s nomination was rejected on technical grounds. The Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (Jogi) had extended support to BJP candidate alleging that the ruling Congress has insulted Ajit Jogi.Odisha More than 5 lakh voters would decide the fate of candidates in Balasore Sadar and Tirtol. By-poll to the Balasore Sadar and Tirtol constituencies was necessitated following the death of incumbent MLAs - Madan Mohan Dutta of BJP and Bishnu Das of BJD respectively. Though Congress is in the fray in both the constituencies, the fight in the two seats will be mainly between the BJP and the BJD. In both the seats, the sons of the sitting MLAs were chosen by their respective parties as candidates. In Balasore, Manas Dutta is the BJP candidate while in Tirtol, Bijay Shankar Das is the BJD candidate. Though the result of the seats is not going to have any bearing on the Naveen Patnaik government, the BJD has deployed over a dozen state ministers and 35 MLAs to win Balasore Sadar. HaryanaBharatiya Janata Party’s Yogeshwar Dutt, an Olympian, is trying his luck for the second time as he takes on Indu Raj Narwal of the Congress. Dutt lost by 19,000 votes to Congress’ Sri Krishan Hooda in 2019 state assembly election who died on April 12 this year. The Congress is hoping for a fourth straight win from this Jat dominated constituency riding on former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s popularity. A total of 14 candidates are contesting. Anant Ram, retired professor of political science at Bhiwani Government College said the by-poll would indicate whether chief minister Manohar Lal Khatter has been able to dent Hooda’s popularity in this Jat belt which Congress almost swept in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-states-to-go-to-by-polls-on-tuesday-keen-contest-in-mp-up-gujarat-karnataka/story-BK67h7zJsx4Ql2LUhE25TM.html

The actor recently completed his shoot for the film ‘Bagawat’, directed by Sanjiv Jaiswal, in Lucknow.Sharing his apprehensions before he started to shoot, “All required safety measures were there but you tend to worry when you shoot with so many people around. The production team too was taking extra care of me. Rest, you can’t force people to be careful but I wish all to understand that it’s not just about them — it’s about others as well! All are susceptible to the virus but as I’m a diabetic so the fear is twofold,” he said.Agreeing that we all need to get back to work, Shishir said, “How long can we sit at home? We’re aware that Covid is here to stay till we have a vaccine so only way is to work with precautions. I’m keeping my diabetes in check and take vitamins to boost immunity.”Post-lockdown he shot for a few advertisements and then ‘Bagawat’ was his first major project in the unlock phase. Next, he is going to shoot for an OTT original film in Kerala. “Then I’ll be back in Uttar Pradesh to shoot Sanjay Upadhyay’s directorial ‘Ek Masoom Sawal’ in Vrindavan and Mathura. Besides, I have completed the patch-work for the second season of ‘City of Dreams.’ Major portion of which was shot before lockdown.”Last winter, he had shot three short films in Singapore which will also release soon. “Now, people have started planning projects that have been stalled so I hope there is going to be a lot of work for next year.”Shishir was in Lucknow last year too. “I shot for ‘Ek Chhoti Se Guzaarish’ with Smita Jaykar in Lucknow and Kanpur for Pragyesh Singh and had attended a premiere of another film ‘Shinaakht’ that was shot in Mumbai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/there-is-going-to-be-a-lot-of-work-for-next-year/story-SOCbCmit0QniuOeIs3Xj5I.html
02-11-2020||India||Oil drops as Covid-19 lockdowns widen and US election looms||Oil prices fell‮‮‮ ‬‬‬on Monday on worries that widening coronavirus lockdowns in Europe would weaken fuel demand while concerns remain over potential turbulence resulting from this week’s US presidential election.Brent crude was down 80 cents, or 2.1%, at $37.14 a barrel by 1140 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate fell 93 cents, or 2.6%, to $34.86. Both contracts fell more than $2 earlier in the session. Countries across Europe have reimposed lockdown measures to try to slow Covid-19 infection rates that have accelerated over the past month. “The number of lockdowns - and the oil demand the countries that imposed them account for - will lead to some demand destruction, depressing balances and putting further strain on the already fragile market,” said Rystad Energy analyst Paola Rodriguez-Masiu.Global oil trading companies expect further demand destruction, though estimates differ. Vitol sees winter demand at 96 million barrels per day (bpd) while Trafigura expects demand to drop to 92 million bpd or lower.A tight race in the lead up to the US election on Tuesday and accompanying uncertainty also prompted investor caution in global markets.“The concerns over oil supply and demand fundamentals ... are going to play second fiddle to the US presidential election and to how risk markets will react to the outcome,” said BNP Paribas analyst Harry Tchilinguirian.Oil pared some losses after Japan’s export orders grew for the first time in two years and China’s factory activity rose to its highest in nearly a decade in October. More manufacturing surveys are expected from the euro zone and the United States later in the day.Sharply rising Libyan oil production also added to price pressures. Libya’s output stands at about 800,000 barrels per day (bpd), up more than 100,000 bpd from a few days ago, a Libyan source told Reuters on Saturday.Meanwhile, output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose for a fourth month in October, a Reuters survey found.OPEC and allies including Russia are cutting output by about 7.7 million bpd to support prices. This OPEC+ group is scheduled to hold a policy meeting on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, with some analysts expecting a postponement of plans to ramp up output by 2 million bpd from January.“A resolute and coordinated announcement and action by OPEC+ are what is really needed to prevent any further price slide,” said Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oil-drops-as-covid-19-lockdowns-widen-and-us-election-looms/story-PpUQUZKkHFdgTE16SxczMJ.html

The notice came on a petition filed by Indian Social Responsibility Network, a non-profit organisation.Through the notice, the NGT sought responses from the environment ministry, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Delhi Police Commissioner and governments of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan.The four states are severely impacted by air pollution ahead of the winter season. The situation is aggravated by dipping temperature, high number of vehicles on the road, industries and crop fires. The Centre has already put in place a pollution control mechanism under Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).News agency PTI reported that the petitioner sought action against pollution caused by the use of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) at a time when the air quality is unsatisfactory with potential of severity of the spread of Covid-19.Also Read| ‘Metro travel in Delhi should be regulated’: Home ministry after Covid-19 review meetingThe plea referred to the statements from Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain which said during the festive season, there will be a rise in coronavirus infections because of air pollution.“Increased pollution may further affect the vulnerable groups and increase the fatality rate. Covid-19 cases in Delhi may go up to 15,000 per day, as against the current cases of about 5,000 per day,” the plea claimed. It also stated that the use of green crackers is not a remedy.Delhi, for the past few days, has been witnessing a sharp spike in its daily Covid-19 tally with possibilities that the national capital might face a fresh wave of the coronavirus disease outbreak.Also Read: Delhi AQI continues to remain very poor, at 310 on MondayEarlier, the Delhi government published a list of more than 800 open spaces across the national capital where people will be allowed to burn “green” firecrackers between 8 pm and 10 pm on the day of Diwali.Meanwhile, the Union home ministry in its release attributed the recent rise in coronavirus cases in Delhi due to festive season and leniency shown by residents in following virus related restrictions.

02-11-2020||India||From BRICS to SCO: India, China leaders to have face time at 5 summits in November||November is shaping up as one of the busiest months of 2020 for the external affairs ministry in terms of virtual summits of groupings such as the SCO, the BRICS and the ASEAN, with leaders of India and China expected to be on the same online platform at five meetings.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping are expected to join the virtual summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on November 10, the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping on November 17, and the G20 during November 21-22.The leaders of India and China are also expected to be part of the East Asia Summit on November 11 and the SCO council of heads of government meeting on November 30, which will be hosted by New Delhi.The virtual SCO summit, to be hosted by Russia, will be the first time that PM Modi and Xi will join an online meeting since the border standoff in Ladakh emerged into the open in May. The two leaders had joined a virtual G20 summit in April this year to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic, which has disrupted most diplomatic engagements.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the external affairs ministry is making hectic preparations for all these summits and meetings, especially to push India’s efforts to have a greater role in the manufacturing and delivery of vaccines for Covid-19 and in shaping the post-pandemic world order by reforming multilateral bodies and creating more resilient and diverse supply and value chains.Also read: India could resume foreign secretary-level dialogue with Nepal. There is one conditionHowever, the people said the summits and meetings will not result in any substantive bilateral engagements as they are all being held virtually. “In such meetings, there is no scope for things such as pull asides or even bilateral conversations. Besides, some of these meetings will feature numerous leaders presenting their views within a limited time,” one person said.Russia, which is hosting the SCO and the BRICS summits, had made a push for holding both meetings in-person but wasn’t able to make much headway as leaders of several countries were reluctant to travel amid the continuing spread of Covid-19, the people said. Of all the upcoming meetings, the G20 Summit being hosted by Saudi Arabia is expected to play a key role in efforts to shape the post-pandemic world order and global economic recovery from the impact of Covid-19. The East Asia Summit is usually attended by prime ministers of India and China and will be followed by the ASEAN-India Summit.The people said Pakistan will be invited to attend the SCO council of heads of government meeting being hosted by India, though there is no clarity on who will represent Islamabad at the meet.Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said all countries had responded to the abnormal circumstances created by the pandemic with innovative responses and that even such “truncated and limited” diplomatic engagements were welcome. “It is good the leaders will have some face time though they may not have substantial bilateral discussions,” he said.“The meeting of Prime Minister Modi and President Xi on a virtual platform will have no impact on the situation in Ladakh and there will be continuum in terms of optics. Even a limited outcome is more desirable than none, though some of these meetings will be important in terms of the Covid-19 response and economic recovery,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-face-off-likely-during-at-least-5-upcoming-virtual-meetings/story-BcF8To5ETToblCwopn8PKK.html

The accused identified as Sunil Tambe and his deceased elder brother Sudhir were residents of Khar Danda, Khar. Sudhir’s wife Anjali told police in her statement that her husband was physically challenged and did not go out for work. The incident took place on October 18 when Sudhir was shouting at his mother. “At around 10:50 pm Sunil came home drunk. When he saw Sudhir shouting and fighting he asked why he could not be amicable with everyone at home and why he fought all the time.” Gajanan Kabdule senior inspector from Khar police station said, “The brothers started arguing following which Sunil picked up a grinding stone and warned Sudhir that if he did not listen to him then he would hit him on the head.”“Sudhir was not ready to listen to his brother and repeatedly dared him to hit him. Sunil eventually smashed the grinding stone on his brother’s head. Sudhir started bleeding from his head and was rushed to Cooper hospital,” Kabdule said. Sudhir seemed to respond to treatment initially but slipped into a coma later and died on October 28.“The initial four days Sudhir was quite well and was even talking to his family members but on the fifth day he was unable to talk as he went into a coma and slowly his health deteriorated, on October 28 he succumbed due to brain haemorrhage.

02-11-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh busts major scam in paddy procurement process||A resident of Gulenda village of Jabalpur district Ajeet Rajak cultivated crop of green peas in his one acre land but his name was registered in a co-operative society to sell paddy crop in October, said an official of the agriculture department. Rajak is among more than 300 farmers in Jabalpur, whose names were fraudulently used by middlemen and businessmen to register online at co-operative society, the official said. Middlemen and businessmen impersonated farmers and registered themselves in the cooperative societies to sell paddy, which they purchased from different places at much lower rates. The scamsters made money selling the paddy to the government at the minimum support price (MSP) which was higher that their purchase price.The irregularities came to light during physical verification of farmers in Jabalpur after many of them had complained to the agriculture department that their names were being misused. . The farmers who grew some other crops on their farmlands, were found registered with societies to sell paddy. More than 300 such registrations of farmers were found fake in Jabalpur only in the past 10 days, said the official. Similar complaints were lodged in Hoshangabad, Harda, Sehore, Narsinghpur and Raisen districts too. Now, the state government has asked the administration in all the districts to carry on physical verification of all farmers, who registered themselves with different societies, before procurement of paddy crop. The administration has been also asked to file FIRs against persons, who are committing fraud, said Kamal Patel, minister of farmers welfare and agriculture department. Jabalpur district collector Karamver Sharma said, “An FIR has been registered against three people including a businessman Kamlesh Patel and manager of a cooperative society of Gulenda.” Sharma said, “The registration for sale of paddy crop took place from September 15 to October 15 and verification started on October 20. During physical verification, farmers were surprised to know that their names figured in the list with societies for sale of paddy crop. In the inquiry it was found that middlemen and businessmen accessed the names of farmers with the help of society members and registered themselves in their names. Some even registered in the name of people who had died a few years ago.” “In the inquiry it came to light that the middlemen and businessmen, purchased the crop from farmers, who need money for different purposes in urgency, before procurement of the state government at much lower rate of Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,400 per quintal. Later, they registered in the name of farmers, who didn’t cultivate paddy or in name of those people who sold their agriculture produce to them so that these traders and middlemen could sell the paddy to the state government at MSP of Rs 1,865 per quintal,” said the collector. Raisen collector Umashankar Bhargava said, “We have started an inquiry in which we have received complaints and we are also carrying on physical verification of all the farmers.” According to an officer, online registration of farmers from private kiosk paved the way for fraudsters. “Earlier, farmers used to go to co-operative societies and got themselves registered. So, there was no possibility of fraud but now the farmers get themselves registered through the kiosks of MP Online. The kiosk owner, middlemen and society members hatched a conspiracy in the registration,” said the officer. Bhartiya KIsan Union, MP general secretary Anil Yadav said, “The fraudsters are misusing online registration and the officers and cooperative society members are also a part of it. It is a major scam and happening in almost all the districts. If the state government does verification properly, thousands of registrations will be found fake.” Last year the state government had procured 2.6 million tonnes of paddy and this year the target is 4 million tonnes. More than 5 lakh farmers were registered for procurement of paddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-busts-major-scam-in-paddy-procurement-process/story-X12n0Frlx54QcVVxam4POJ.html

They said the enforcement officer, who is posted in Gurugram, has been booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 420 for fraud, 467 for forging document with purpose of cheating, 471 for using forged document as genuine and 120-B for criminal conspiracy.A senior CBI official privy to the investigation said the preliminary enquiry suggested that Ramesh Chand Meena got the forged ST certificate issued from sub-divisional magistrate of Hindaun, Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan in June 1983.He said the accused used the same certificate to get employment as a lower division clerk with EPFO in August 1985 and had been working as a central government employee since then.“As per the findings, the accused not only forged the documents to get employment but also deprived genuine ST candidates of their rights,” he said.“The inquiry suggested that the accused in connivance, with other state government officials of Rajasthan, procured the forged ST certificate and even mentioned his fake permanent address,” the official said.He said the alleged forgery came to light when the accused applied for changing his permanent address, stating that he is a resident of Mathura and does not hail from Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan.He said the inquiry further revealed that the accused’s son Nikhil, in his documents, had mentioned that they had migrated from Alwar, Rajasthan, which was contrary to the claim of the accused in his ST certificate that he hailed from Sawai Madhopur district.He said CBI was investigating the matter in detail and recovery of money earned from his job procured using forged means could be recommended if concrete evidence was found against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/address-change-request-trips-epfo-officer-who-forged-st-certificate-for-job-35-years-ago/story-lko8r9FJu8FxlVtZq2IrkN.html

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde dismissed Saritha Nair’s petition terming it ‘frivolous’.Nair was barred from contesting the parliamentary polls as she was convicted in the solar scam case in the southern state with a sentence of three years. Nair’s nomination papers were rejected by the returning officers under Section 8(3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 which prescribed for disqualification on account of conviction and sentencing in a criminal case. She later obtained a stay in the case, which, however, was not considered by the returning officers.Nair had moved the top court against the October 31, 2019, decision of Kerala High Court by which her election petitions challenging the Lok Sabha polls in Wayanad and Ernakulam also were dismissed. She had earlier approached the Kerala high court over the election officers’ move stopping her from contesting the elections.The high court had held that the stay was on the sentence and not on conviction and hence her plea was rejected. “It was clear from the relief sought in the appeal petition that Nair had only sought suspension of the sentence and not the suspension of conviction,” the court had said.Gandhi had won Kerala’s Wayanad seat -- the second seat he contested in the 2019 polls -- with a margin of 431,770 votes. He defeated runner up PP Suneer of the Communist Party of India, who secured 274,597 votes, while Gandhi got 706,367 votes.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-dismisses-frivolous-plea-challenging-rahul-gandhi-s-election-as-wayanad-mp/story-QqVUb1OP60OWOOVHhKTzjP.html
02-11-2020||India||Shivraj Singh Chouhan lists Kamal Nath’s sins, Congress leader says everything’s a lie||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday accused Congress leader Kamal Nath of withdrawing crucial schemes floated by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under his regime. Nath, the former chief minister, was quick to respond by saying that all the allegations were a lie.The squabbling between the two senior leaders comes ahead of the by-polls on 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday. Of them, 25 seats became vacant after the Congress MLAs left the party in March to join the BJP. This resulted in the fall of the Kamal Nath-led Congress government. BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan then became the chief minister.“Today, Kamal Nath has given advertisements in newspapers that ‘What sin did I commit?’ Kamal Nath ji, you have sinned, you snatched away laptops of children who brought good numbers in Class 12, stalled the development of the state. You have converted Madhya Pradesh into a market of brokers,” Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, according to news agency ANI.Watch: MP bypolls: ‘BJP leaders are saleable, voters aren’t’, says Kamal Nath“The Rs 5,000 we paid to the poor for funerals was snatched away. We used to help the elderly make pilgrimages, you ended that plan. How many sins can I count? You have destroyed Madhya Pradesh, it was your sin and you have to pay the same penalty,” Chouhan added. The chief minister was referring to the MP Funeral Assistance Scheme, which provided aided the poor registered labourers by providing money for last rites of their loved ones.A little later, Kamal Nath responded. “Every single thing is their lie. I wonder how they can lie so shamelessly,” the Congress leader said. “Shivraj Singh’s lies also exceeded limits. He had said that Kamal Nath is a sinner. When I asked what I sin did I commit, he said that Kamal Nath did not waive loans. While his government itself has said that the debt of 27 lakh farmers has been waived, the rest was going to be in the second-third instalment,” Nath pointed out.Read more: Kamal Nath vs Shivraj Chouhan over Class IV employees’ retirement ageOn November 1, Nath had accused the BJP dispensation in the state of reducing the retirement age of Class-IV government employees. In a tweet, Nath said the ruling BJP has brought down the age of retirement of Class-IV employees from 62 years to 60 years, prompting the BJP government to issue a clarification about it. Chief minister Chouhan had dubbed it as a “rumour”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-lists-kamal-nath-s-sins-congress-leader-says-everything-s-a-lie/story-4utc9yvz4Qx2vb5DoEYdEJ.html

02-11-2020||India||5 alleged red sanders smugglers die in fiery road crash in Andhra’s Kadapa||Five alleged smugglers of red sanders were charred to death when two vehicles which they were travelling in rammed into a truck in Andhra Pradesh’s Kadapa district in the early hours of Monday, the police said. While four of them travelling in a sport utility vehicle were burnt alive along with the vehicle, one more person from another car died while undergoing treatment at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Kadapa town. Two others, who were grievously injured are undergoing treatment in the hospital. All the deceased and injured are believed to be smugglers from Salem in Tamil Nadu, who were transporting red sanders from the forests of Bhakarapet to their state. Several logs of red sanders worth lakhs of rupees were also gutted in the fire in the cars. Kadapa superintendent of police K K N Anburajan told Hindustan Times that the incident happened at around 3.30 am at Gotur village near airport on Kadapa-Tadipatri road on the outskirts of the city. “Bhakarapet forests are known for smuggling of red sanders by people from Tamil Nadu and of late, we have intensified operations to prevent smuggling. We have kept ambush parties of police at two check posts on the road. The smugglers coming in two vehicles saw the police forces at one of the check posts and tried to take a detour on the airport road. We did not chase the vehicles, as we knew that they would definitely be caught at another check post,” the SP said. Both the cars were travelling at high speed and did not notice a truck coming out of a construction venture in the area. “They rammed into the diesel tank of the truck resulting in its explosion. Both the cars caught fire and were burnt completely,” he said. Four persons travelling in the first car could not come out and were charred to death, as flames engulfed the vehicle, while three others who were travelling in another car managed to escape with injuries. One of them died while undergoing treatment at the hospital,” Anburajan said. Police and fire service personnel rushed to the accident spot and doused the fire using two fire tenders. “We have registered a case and are investigating,” the SP said. Red sanders, a precious wood which is an endemic species confined only to the Seshachalam forests spread across Chittoor, Kadapa and parts of Nellore and Kurnool, has been the prime target of timber smugglers for several years. The wood fetches crores of rupees in the international market, particularly in China and Japan, where it is used for making cosmetic products, furniture, musical instruments and even drugs. One tonne of the wood costs Rs 20 lakh locally, but it fetches around Rs 1 crore in the international market. Because of its high value, timber smugglers from Tamil Nadu have been indulging in large scale cutting and smuggling of the wood and exporting the logs abroad. They are engaging trained wood cutters and transporting them through dense forests into the Tamil Nadu borders. The wood cutters risk their lives to enter forests and smuggle the red sanders, because they are paid around Rs 1 lakh per tonne towards labour charges. The Andhra Pradesh government has constituted a Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling Task Force (RSASTF) in 2014 to periodically conduct combing operations in the forest areas and check the smuggling of the wood. There have been frequent encounters between the task force and the smugglers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-alleged-red-sanders-smugglers-die-in-fiery-road-crash-in-andhra-s-kadapa/story-9izHs7wUlW5jRX9Ux7cLPK.html

A single bench of Justice V G Arun posted the matter for hearing on Friday and trial will be deferred till then. The counsel appearing for the victim told the court that she had to undergo “severe ordeal” of continuous cross- examination for nine days by many lawyers of the accused and they raised objectionable questions. Though the prosecution raised repeated objections, the trial court did not intervene to protect the victim and overruled its objections. At this point the public prosecutor said the judge was not ready to heed the objections raised by him also on several occasions. He also said that the sequence of events show the “trial was not proceeding in a fair and transparent manner.” The approach of the trial court judge in the case was “unheard of in a criminal case trial,” he said. In the transfer application, the victim stated that “she was aggrieved by the attitude of the trial court and though proceedings were in-camera a battery of lawyers were present when she was cross-examined”. When many witnesses turned hostile the prosecution had asked the court to cancel the bail of the eighth accused in the case, actor Dileep and it was also turned down by the court, the victim pointed out. In January, the Supreme Court had ordered the court to complete the trial in six months. But the lockdown induced by Covid-19 rendered that virtually impossible. In August, the Supreme Court gave another six months to the trial court. The attack on the 33-year-old woman took place in February 2017 in Kochi. She was allegedly abducted and assaulted by a gang led by Pulsar Suni, a history-sheeter, in a moving car. They set her free after three hours but threatened to circulate the video of assault if she approached the police. However, she filed a complaint the same day. Dileep was arrested five months later on charges of hiring a criminal gang to settle personal scores with her. He is the eighth accused in the case. Dileep was in judicial custody for 85 days before he was granted bail under strict provisions. Later he moved different petitions which the prosecution claimed was to delay the trial but it began in a court in Ernakulam last month. Earlier, his plea for a CBI probe was rejected by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-stays-trial-in-actor-s-abduction-case-till-nov-6/story-bRvXNH92dn8znhdJbauv3O.html

Top leaders of the BJP have alleged several times in the past that more than 100 party workers have been killed by goons backed by the ruling Trinamool Congress during Mamata Banerjee’s regime. The TMC, however, has rubbished the allegations. A 32-year-old man Bijoy Shil was found hanging from a tree at Kalyani in Nadia around 50 km north of Kolkata, on Sunday. While BJP alleged that Shil was an active party worker and was murdered by TMC goons, TMC claimed that Shil was a TMC worker, though not active, and had probably died by suicide. “Investigation is on. Some political parties are trying to politicize the issue and create problems. The family members, including the deceased’s wife, have told the media that the victim didn’t belong to any party,” said a senior police officer of Nadia district. In another incident on Sunday, the BJP alleged that a party worker was killed at Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas district. Following the alleged killings, BJP decided to gherao multiple police stations in Kolkata and in the adjoining districts. Senior BJP leaders including MPs led the protests at various places. The BJP which made impressive gains in the 2019 parliamentary election winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal is now eyeing a victory in the 2021 assembly election in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-tries-to-gherao-police-stations-in-kolkata-to-protest-alleged-murders-of-party-workers/story-VIyanyhMjZt9BvBQ2YrfYO.html
02-11-2020||India||India’s manufacturing PMI rises for 3rd straight month; output rises at quickest pace since October 2007||India’s manufacturing sector activity improved for the third straight month in October with companies raising output to the greatest extent in 13 years amid robust sales growth, a monthly survey said on Monday. The headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose from 56.8 in September to 58.9 in October, and pointed to the strongest improvement in the health of the sector in over a decade.In April, the index had slipped into contraction mode, after remaining in the growth territory for 32 consecutive months. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.“Levels of new orders and output at Indian manufacturers continued to recover from the Covid-19 induced contractions seen earlier in the year, with the PMI results for October highlighting historically-sharp monthly rates of expansion,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.Lima further noted that “companies were convinced that the resurgence in sales will be sustained in coming months, as indicated by a strong upturn in input buying amid restocking efforts”. Manufacturers indicated that the ongoing relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions, better market conditions and improved demand helped them to secure new work in October.On the employment front, the compliance of government guidelines related to the Covid-19 pandemic caused a further reduction in employment. The fall was the seventh in consecutive months. “There was disappointing news on the employment front though, with October seeing another reduction in payroll numbers. Survey participants that noted job shedding mentioned having observed containment measures to halt the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019,” Lima said. Inflationary pressures, meanwhile, remained subdued as seen by a modest increase in input costs and only marginal rise in selling prices. Meanwhile, hopes of an end to Covid-19 cases and the reopening of other sectors in the economy underpinned positive sentiment towards the year-ahead outlook for production. The level of confidence was at a 50-month high. “Also, confidence towards the year-ahead outlook for production improved as firms hoped that fewer Covid-19 cases and the reopening of other businesses could boost output growth,” Lima noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-manufacturing-pmi-rises-for-3rd-straight-month-output-rises-at-quickest-pace-since-october-2007/story-gEmAFu5PVonIUOHHTBonWI.html

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde questioned the poll body over its decision. “Where does EC have the power to determine who will be the leader of a party under Section 77 of Representation of People Act?” the bench asked.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Nath, said that an advisory was issued by the commission on October 26 following which the October 30 order came citing a complaint against the Congress leader over his October 13 speech, Sibal said the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister was not heard on the issue.The order against Nath concerned two comments. He made a comment against chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan on October 13 and then on October 18, Nath had said at a rally in Gwalior that the Congress candidate was a simple man, unlike his opponent who is an ‘item’. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded Imarti Devi from the Darba seat in Gwalior in the bye-elections. The election regulatory body was represented by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi who said that the matter had become infructuous as elections are due tomorrow and campaigning has ended.“We are staying your order as you have no power to pass this order,” the bench said. The court directed EC to file its response to Nath’s petition that had argued that the selection of star campaigner under Section 77(1) of RP Act was the sole prerogative of the political party.Responding to the apex court’s stay, the Commission said, “Hon’ble Supreme Court is supreme. EC has been given an opportunity to file a reply in the matter, which shall be filed at the earliest.”Congress had submitted a list of 28 star campaigners to the Election Commission for MP bye-elections on October 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-election-commission-s-order-revoking-kamal-nath-s-star-campaigner-status-in-madhya-pradesh-by-polls/story-M8zCHCUdJ85s1jdAFCaToO.html

02-11-2020||India||Covid-19 warriors, survivors wield pen as pandemic inspires fiction||Dr Maheshwar Prasad Chaurasia always wanted to write a novel. In May, he attended a webinar on how to write and publish a book. At the workshop, his writing instructor suggested that he start his journey as an author with a non-fictional work. He decided to write a book on Delhi’s fight against the coronavirus disease pandemic. Dr Chaurasia was qualified to do so —as additional superintendent at Delhi’s government’s Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital, he was part of the core team that set up the city’s first quarantine centres, isolation wards and testing facilities in the initial months of the pandemic. “Those were the early days of the pandemic and we did not know much about the virus. Doctors and officials went sleepless for days as they fought the pandemic. People were in a panic and were asking so many questions. My book is about how the doctors and the administration fought the pandemic in its initial months,” says Chaurasia , whose book -- Just Switch Off Corona -- was released last month. Chaurasia is not the only writer to have been inspired by the pandemic. Hundreds of books with titles such as Corona: A Checkmate; Murder in the Time of Corona; The Corona Wars; Corona Kiss; The Pandemic Plot; My Pandemic Experience, have been published in the past couple of months. Interestingly, a majority of these books -- poetry, fiction, non-fiction in English, Hindi, Tamil and many other Indian languages -- are by first- time writers and have been brought out by self- publishing companies. The writers of these books include doctors, information technology (IT) professionals, teachers, most of whom seem to have drawn from their own experiences and understanding of the pandemic. Dr Kumar Shyam, who lives in Hapur, a town in the National Capital Region, about 70 km from Delhi, last month published The Pandemic Plot, a novel that he says draws from the conspiracy theories surrounding the origin and nature of the coronavirus. The book that moves from Wuhan in China to Italy is the story of an international medical team comprising scientists from many countries, including India, who go on a mission to find the answers to some of the trickiest questions about the origin and spread of the virus. His slim page-turner about this global quest ends with the conclusion that researchers at a Wuhan lab get infected and die and the virus spreads into the rest of the world. “The governments and health systems around the world did not know what had hit them and there are so many conspiracy theories surrounding the origin and spread of the virus. l thought all of this made for a novel. I used many real incidents to connect the dots, ” says Dr Shyam, a general surgeon, who owns a 100-bed hospital in Hapur.“Being a doctor helped me write about virology with authenticity,” says the doctor, who wrote the book every night in his personal library that boasts 3,000 books. Rahul Bhardwaj, managing director at Yash Publications, which published The Pandemic Plot, says the book is a hit, having sold over 3,000 copies in hardback and paperback since its release last month. “We have got 30 proposals for books on Corona and have already published three. Four more will be published next month,” Bhardwaj adds. Notion Press, one of the country’s biggest self- publishing companies has brought out as many as 40 titles on the coronavirus, both fiction and non-fiction in English, Hindi and Tamil. Some of the titles published by it include Born in Lockdown, Pandemic Spell, Murder in the Time of Corona, Why and How China developed the Coronavirus. Interestingly, Naveen Valsakumar, co-founder and CEO of Notion Press, says that one of the reasons why there are so many coronavirus-related books on his company’s platform is that a lot of the writers are young and tech-savvy, who studied Google Trends and realised that there was a lot of curiosity about the pandemic. “So, they decided to write books based on those trending searches. We made it clear to all writers that we will not publish any book offering unvalidated medical advice on Corona. For many people, writing about the pandemic has been a cathartic experience,” says Valsakumar. Love and romance are among the most popular genres among those writing on the coronavirus. Sample some of the titles in the category: Corona Kiss, Cupid Covid; Love in the Time of Corona Virus, A Second Chance with Love in Corona. In fact, there are dozens of books titled Love in the Time of Corona. A lot of these stories involve young doctors whose lives are torn apart as they fight the virus. “Lockdown had a deep impact on relationships and that is the subject of my two Corona books” says Kawalpreet Kaur, a 26-year-old teacher. Her first book, Love in the Time of Corona Virus, and its sequel, The Dark 21 Days, feature the stories of two youngsters who battle not just caste, and but also Covid-19 in a hospital in Italy. Sayed Arshad, founder of Blue Rose Publishers says the reason why most books have been published by self- publishing companies is their ability to bring out a book fast, something many of the writers want. “Normally it takes about seven months to bring out a book, most self- publishing companies take three weeks flat,” he said. After English, the maximum number of books on the coronavirus are in Hindi, and with some curious tiles: Namaste Corona ; Corona se Atmagyan ( Enlightenment through Corona) ; Akash Me Corona Ghana Hai ( The Sky is eclipsed by dense Corona) ; Corona Ek Safar ( Corona, a journey) . Rounak Rai, an art teacher and author of Corona se Atmagyan, a collection of 33 poems accompanied by his drawings, says he wrote the book during the lockdown. “Corona brought out the best and the worst in human beings. My book captures the pain, the suffering and what this pandemic taught us about ourselves and about others,” said Rai. “ But one of the unintended benefits of the pandemic is the fact that it encouraged people to look within and become writers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-warriors-survivors-wield-pen-as-pandemic-inspires-fiction/story-Ry8ArMSlW0Eypv6FJMhEkP.html

They have also refused to visit any government office to interact with the administration. “This time our delegation will not go anywhere to hold talks with the government. If the government wants to talk, they can come and meet us here on the railway track,” a protestor was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.A large number of Gujjars in the Peelupura village of the district had on Sunday launched their agitation by blocking railway tracks. Officials said the protest turned violent after some agitators damaged the Mumbai-Delhi railway tracks passing through Peelupura. They later uprooted the fish plate of the Mumbai-Delhi tracks and some blocked the Bayana-Hindaun route, the officials added. The tracks were cleared after some time.Bharatpur district collector Nathmal Deedal said that state minister Ashok Chandna met Gujjar leader Kirorilal Bainsla in Peelupura where they held a round of “positive talks.” “Yesterday also we had a meeting with one faction of the Gujjar community who were satisfied with the assurances of the state government,” Deedal said on Sunday.Gujjar leader Vijay Bainsla, however, said that they had not spoken with anyone. “The youth are not getting employment. There is anger among them. Our movement will continue. We have spoken to Gehlot Ji, but nothing has happened so far,” he told ANI. “We have not spoken to anyone. Youth is unemployed, 25,000 jobs are stuck and nobody is talking about it. This protest will continue until our demands are not fulfilled,” Bainsla added.“We have spoken to Gehlot Ji four times in the past but nothing materialised. It’s been two years, how much patience do they demand from us?” Bainsla asked.Due to the protest, railway traffic was also halted on the Delhi-Mumbai line passing through the Kota division following which at least 450 personnel of the railway police force (RPF) and government railway police were deployed in Kota railway division, officials said. Alert was also sounded across all the stations of the division.Officials have said that an extra police force will be also sent to the Gujjar-dominated areas in districts across eastern Rajasthan, especially in Bharatpur and Karauli. “We are monitoring the situation from the headquarters,” Saurabh Srivastava, additional director general of police, law and order, had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-can-meet-us-on-rail-tracks-gujjars-continue-quota-protest-in-rajasthan/story-ihkiqKiVT5rOm9ih7xpAFN.html

The accused identified as Sudip Syama Chakrabarty hails from Jharkhand. The complainant said he could not recollect the country Chakrabarty claimed he is based in.According to the police, a Raigad -based government servant’s 18-year-old daughter wanted to take admission in a medical college for MBBS studies. Though she had appeared for the NEET exam but was unable to secure a seat due to low marks.“Meanwhile her father came in a contact with the accused who promised him that he has good contacts in reputed colleges and asked him to meet him at Vile Parle. The complainant reached the meeting place where Sudip demanded that he pay him Rs 30 lakh as a token amount so that the process could be initiated,” an officer from Airport police station said. “The accused on many occasions took money from him by giving him various reasons and by the end of September he had taken Rs 61.25 lakh from him but kept on delaying the work,” the officer said. The officer said the girl’s father finally discovered on the internet that the person was a conman and had been arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir police in December 2019.“The complainant later searched his name on the internet where he found one article in which a similar name was shown as a fraud. He found a Jammu and Kashmir police case on the internet where the J & K crime branch arrested him for cheating many students to the tune of Rs 1 crore in the name of admission in medical college. After he found himself cheated, he approached the Airport police station and filed a complaint against him,” officer added. Following his complaint police registered a case under section 419 (Punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120 (B) [Punishment of criminal conspiracy], and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 66 (C) [punishment for identity theft], and 66 (D) [Punishment for cheating by personation by using computer resource] of Information Technology act. During investigation police found Sudip’s location in Versova and a team from Airport police laid a trap and arrested him. He was produced before the court which remanded him in police custody till November 2. Police are looking for two accomplices of the accused. “Sudip is a history sheeter and there are more than eight cases of cheating registered against him at Goregaon, Oshiwara, Bangurnagar, Kothrud (Pune), Hanehalli (Karnataka), Jammu and Kashmir crime branch,” a police officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-claiming-to-be-nri-cons-mbbs-aspirant-s-father-of-rs-61-lakh-nabbed-in-mumbai/story-S85Z3JidWmjldNJdlobV1O.html
02-11-2020||India||Maharashtra: 19 new species, records discovered in 2019; 2 from Aarey Forest||One new species and a record has been documented from Mumbai’s recently designated forest area at Aarey Colony in Goregaon, while 17 new species and records have been identified from Maharashtra last year, according to Animal Discoveries 2019 annual report, which has been compiled by the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) under the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. On an average, Maharashtra has been recording 20 new species and records annually, according to ZSI, mostly from the Western Ghats range or across isolated forest patches along the Konkan coast, including Mumbai.In October, new floral and faunal species were discovered, including damselflies, colourful freshwater fish (Schistura), new record of a golden-backed frog from Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, and a plant species, Echinops sahyadricus, from the Western Ghats.New species of geckos, frogs, spiders, and new records of insects and crabs were the highlights for Maharashtra last year. “Researchers from Maharashtra have been working hard and the state has been annually recording over 15 new species or records, which shows the abundant biodiversity in the state,” said Kailash Chandra, director, ZSI.Overall, 368 faunal species were discovered and 116 new records from India. Of these 155 species alone were recorded from the Western Ghats in 2019.From Aarey Colony, where 328.9 hectares (ha) was declared as reserved forest by the Maharashtra government in October, a new species of jumping spider was discovered last year identified as Jerzego sunillimaye. This was the first ever species of this genus Jerzego, whose taxonomic details, mating behaviour, and egg development were documented. However, this was the fourth species under this genus in the world and second from India. The species was named to honour Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife east), Maharashtra. The ZSI report also showed a new record from Aarey of an insect species (heptacarus neotropicus) originally described from France and recorded in the area last year.“The recent designation of Aarey as a forest is important as the commitment made to ensure the natural vegetation of any area remains protected automatically. It develops a network for the safety of the area’s biodiversity and livelihood. We expect more discoveries from these green lungs in the coming years,” said Chandra.State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said, “It is undoubtedly exciting that even this year, as we think we know everything about our environment, and we deal with a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, we have so many species being newly described. These findings only tell us how less we still know about our own planet and nature. The good news is that the present Maharashtra government is pro-environment, working on sustainable development and we are committed to the cause.”Thackery’s brother Tejas along with researchers, A Khandekar and Ishan Agarwal, discovered the Amba dwarf gecko (Cnemaspis amba) from Kolhapur district last year.The same researchers also discovered a Koyna dwarf gecko (Cnemaspis koynaensis) in Satara district.Other geckos discovered last year include Chikhaldara brookiish gecko (Hemidactylus chikhaldaraensis) near Gawligarh Fort in Amravati district and the Giri’s brookiish gecko or the Amboli brookiish gecko (Hemidactylus varadgirii) from Amboli in Sindhudurg district named after veteran herpetologist Varad Giri.“The trend shows many new species are getting described every year and this indicates we still have to discover the diversity. New species described from Maharashtra and Mumbai highlights the importance of this landscape as many of these species are only known from a few localities and nowhere else in the world. The protection of these species means conservation of these landscapes and vital resources which we humans need,” said Giri.The information about the species and their habitats are essential to design a strong conservation management plan, he added.Striking discoveries from Maharashtra Western Ghats in 2019Some striking discoveries from the Western Ghats last year included a new species of cricket frog from the northern Western Ghats in Maharashtra called Fejervarya Marathi, or the Marathi Fejervarya frog, named after the official language of the state, where the frog is found. The research was conducted by Savitribai Phule Pune University and ZSI. Other species discovered included Channa rara -- a new species of snakehead fish --- from the Jagbudi river near Khopi village in Khed taluka in Ratnagiri district. A new species of damselfly, Sindhudurg marsh dart (Ceriagrion chromothorax), was discovered as an endemic species of Western Ghats by Mumbai-based researchers. Damselflies are similar to dragonflies. They are small soft-bodied insects and have three pairs of long legs, and very large eyes. “These discoveries are testimony to the fact that it is essential to protect the Western Ghats not only for its rich biodiversity but as a critical source of water. The government should not give away more areas in the Western Ghats to industries and mining,” said Romulus Whitaker, veteran herpetologist and wildlife conservationist.New records from the state in 2019Several new records included insect species originally recorded from different parts of the world and new records identified in various districts of Maharashtra.These included:* An insect species (gymnodamaeus glaber) was recorded from Majiwara Thane, Ratnagiri Fort, Sinhagad Fort in Pune, and Tumsar village in Bhandara district. It was earlier known from Europe.* A crab species (pea crab) Arcotheres pernicola was reported for the first time from India based on a collection from Alibag in Raigad district. It was earlier known from the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Djibouti.* A fish species (notopthiracarus pavidus pavidus) recorded from Aurangabad district in Maharashtra. Originally, it was known from Greece(Source: Zoological Survey of India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-19-new-species-records-discovered-in-2019-2-from-aarey-forest/story-W7G7MdpKoaPCIAvnTfeIOI.html

The FIR was lodged on a complaint submitted to the state’s director general of police, Vivek Johri by director (security), MP state assembly JK Sharma after the alleged threat to the protem Speaker on his social media account when he posted a text on Sunday opposing the protest held in Bhopal on Thursday against French President Emmanuel Macron’s stand on a row over cartoons of Prophet Mohammed in that country.The accused include A Khan, Muhammed Kaleem and Javed Akhtar whose addresses are not known and one unidentified person, the police said.The complaint lodged by JK Sharma states, “Recently there was a demonstration by certain people in Bhopal against France in respect with which the protem Speaker wrote in social media that instead of creating an atmosphere of fear here while showing fundamentalism the protesters should have organised their protest in France as the issue is related to France. On this, some people threatened the protem Speaker with dire consequences while commenting that he would meet the same fate that Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Kamlesh Tiwari had met.” The state assembly officer demanded action against the accused and adequate security to the protem Speaker in view of threat to his life. DGP Johri could not be reached for his comments. He did not respond to phone calls and text messages in this regard. Rameshwar Sharma said, “I received the threat on social media and the state assembly staff has submitted a complaint to the director general of police.” Additional superintendent of police, crime branch, Gopal Dhakad said, “An FIR has been lodged. Now, we will look into the IP addresses of the accused who posted the comments and track them down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-protem-speaker-threatened-online-for-opposing-protest-on-french-cartoons/story-EdBP1xJ2wSsLxDS16QyFML.html

November also started with very low minimum temperature suggesting colder days ahead.“The western disturbance didn’t impact the plains. But it brought snowfall to Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) and higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh. So, there are cold winds. Also, the sky is cloud free and at night winds are calm so the heat radiates back at night making the mornings cold,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.North-east India is likely to receive heavy rainfall. A low-pressure area was lying over north-east and adjoining east central Bay of Bengal on Sunday. The system is likely to move towards the Bangladesh coast during the next 48 hours. Under its influence, fairly widespread rainfall activity is very likely over Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Meghalaya; scattered rainfall activity is likely over Assam during the next two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-mercury-again-dips-to-5-degree-c-below-normal/story-qKc2f4NROuKHFlIYBOc2ZJ.html

02-11-2020||India||Govt working on another stimulus package: Finance secretary||Finance secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey on Sunday hinted that the government is working on another stimulus package but he refrained from giving a timeframe.“We keep monitoring the situation on the ground to assess which sector of the economy or segment of the population needs what kind of help at which time and respond accordingly. We keep taking suggestions from industry bodies, trade associations, various ministries and after going through their suggestions and requirements of the economy, we come out with timely measures,” Ajay Bhushan Pandey said in an exclusive interview to ANI.Pandey said that he could not give a timeframe for the stimulus package, but yes the government was on it and deliberations on further interventions were on.Talking about the current state of the economy, Pandey said that the economy was recovering and moving towards sustained growth.The October GST collection has been Rs 105,155 crore which is 10 per cent higher year-on-year for the corresponding month last year. This September, the economy had also shown 4 per cent growth at Rs 95,480 crore in GST collections y-o-y. Further, the country has seen a growth in electricity consumption, exports, and imports, he said.“September and October data shows that we have reached Pre-COVID-19 level and gone into positive territory. If we compare with the last year, the E-Way bill in September has seen year on year growth of 10 per cent and in October it has seen a growth of 21 per cent,” he said.“If we are able to maintain this growth for the next five months, then we can say that we can transition from deep negative zone to near-zero growth zone by March 2021. International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected India’s GDP to contract 10.3 per cent this fiscal year, revised from its forecast of a 4.5 per cent decline in June,” he added.The Reserve Bank of India had last month said that the economy is likely to contract by 9.5 per cent in the current fiscal. GDP contracted 23.9 per cent in the first quarter of the fiscal, as per the estimates of the Central Statistics Office (CSO).The Finance Secretary said the government has started electronic invoices from October 1. On an average 8 lakh invoices were being generated daily. It picked up quickly and on October 30, in a single day 29 lakh electronic invoices were generated. “If we see the growth of the FMCG, auto sectors, it shows that we are going in the direction of sustained growth,” he said.Pandey said, “We are analysing every sector and this is a continuous process. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, we have been continuously monitoring every sector. Whatever was required for helping migrants, vulnerable sections of the rural or urban populations, we did. When the nation was in lockdown, we gave cash to women Jan Dhan account holders in their bank accounts through DBT. We provided early instalments to farmers under PM Kisan Yojana.”“We helped employees and employers in their EPF contribution. We earmarked Rs 3 lakh crore for enhanced working capital to MSMEs, out of which Rs 2 lakh crore has been sanctioned and amounts are being disbursed. MSMEs were also given the benefits of loan moratorium. We have given income tax refunds of Rs 1.27 lakh crores in last seven months. We have given GST refunds of Rs 70,000 crore,” he added.He said that a total refund of Rs 2 lakh crore has been given in the last seven months. During this period, revenue collections were impacted but the government did not stop or slow down the refunds.Ruling out the possibility of any cut in GST rates in near future during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said that there is the wrong impression that rate cut boosts sales and growth.“One may see the example of mobile phones. Mobile phones are attracting an 18 per cent GST rate from April 1, 2020, up from the earlier rate of 12 per cent, after the GST Council corrected the inverted duty structure. Now see the current sales figures for mobile phones. Despite the increased tax rate, their sales are up,” he said.“Frequent tinkering with the tax rates is not good for the economy. It also sends wrong signals to domestic industry and international investors. We have to provide stability and predictability in our tax systems,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-working-on-another-stimulus-package-finance-secretary/story-QAyRp1Bn6LH7Sk7xrXw9YP.html

I hope that the court will consider my demands as mentioned in the affidavit. Our demand is that the chief minister promised a job to one family member but nothing has been done so far. The other is that the family should be provided with a permanent accommodation in Delhi as Hathras is influenced by upper caste and the family is Dalit,” Kushwaha told ANI.She said that the demand for protection to the family has been fulfilled while adding that officials related to the case should be terminated.Kushwaha said that post-mortem has confirmed that the victim was raped. The 19-year-old had succumbed to her injuries at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on September 29 after being assaulted and allegedly gang-raped in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras on September 14.On October 12, the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court has said that the decision of cremating the Hathras victim’s body in the night is an “infringement” of her human rights.The Supreme Court, on October 27, directed that the Allahabad High Court will monitor the probe, being conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), into the case related to the alleged gang-rape and subsequent death of a Dalit girl in Hathras.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, which was hearing a plea seeking to transfer the trial in the case from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi, said that the same will be decided at a later stage.The bench said that all aspects of the Hathras case, including security to the victim’s family and witnesses, will be looked after by the Allahabad High Court.

The protest turned violent after some agitators damaged the Mumbai-Delhi railway tracks passing through Peelupura, officials said. Around 3pm, some agitators uprooted the fish plate of the Mumbai-Delhi tracks and some blocked the Bayana-Hindaun route, the officials said. The tracks were cleared after some time, they added. “Gujjar leader Kirorilal Bainsla reached Peelupura where he held talks with [sports and youth affairs] minister Ashok Chandna. The Gujjar leader asked the minister about the steps taken for the community. The talks were positive. Yesterday also we had a meeting with one faction of the Gujjar community who were satisfied with the assurances of the state government,” said Nathmal Deedal, Bharatpur district collector. Railway traffic was also halted on the Delhi-Mumbai line passing through the Kota division. “Railway traffic has been stopped on Delhi-Mumbai railway route as of now due to Gujjar agitation in Bharatpur,” said AK Pal, senior divisional commercial manager, Kota railway division. “Alert has been sounded across all the stations of Kota railway division.

02-11-2020||India||Green piece: States need to fight bad air menace together||Are relations among different state governments in India failing? We’re behaving as if we are a territorial union, not a country where every citizen matters. State governments are not treating air pollution as India’s top enemy. We haven’t heard from West Bengal, or Bihar and Delhi can’t find common ground with Punjab and Haryana. As a consequence, India’s economy will suffer even more. We know Covid-19 is worsened on account of air pollution. I was reading a piece where an Assistant Professor at the Georgia State University is quoted as saying if air pollution was low, then it’s possible to re-open and help the economy recover. But in places like Delhi, we can’t imagine this. The pollution might have contributed to a spike in Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, using 17 years’ data, Harvard and other medical schools found a link between air pollution and dementia. Are people from the Indo-Gangetic plain-the world’s most polluted region- in danger of Alzheimer’s? Finally, the State of the Air 2020 report says strokes can be triggered by exposure to PM 2.5.Commissions aside, policy makers must put into place tougher policies. From private vehicles to public transport, to improved standards for coal-based thermal power plants, to construction and waste-the possible solutions are on the table. India’s GDP has shrunk after Covid-19. We can’t afford to lose our human resources next. But we don’t have much time --even the best policies will take time to bear results. India can’t afford a brain drain but not acting on air pollution is going to do just that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-piece-states-need-to-fight-bad-air-menace-together/story-3LDW5Di1bouSxKYdPCUPkN.html
02-11-2020||India||Lockdown govt’s self-goal: Subhash Chandra Garg||A premature hard lockdown imposed across the country to curb the Covid-19 pandemic was responsible for India’s economic plunge, according to former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg, who claimed that he opted for voluntary retirement after being shunted out by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman because of a personality clash.“There is a lot of cynicism presently about India’s ability to become even a $5 trillion economy anytime soon. This is largely because of government taking the eye off the ball of economic growth and making a big self-goal by imposing the world’s most stringent lockdown in the entire country at a time when the virus was not present in more than 1% of India,” Garg wrote in his latest blog. The Indian economy shrank by a record 23.9% in the three months ended June mainly because of a 68-day hard lockdown enforced on March 25 that shut down factories and business establishments, closed down public transport, caused an exodus of millions of migrant workers.from the cities back to their homes in the countryside and confined citizens indoors.Garg wrote in the blog he was transferred from the finance ministry because of Sitharaman. “It became quite apparent very early that working with her [Sitharaman] was going to be quite difficult and it might not be conducive to undertaking necessary reforms for the attainment of the objective of building a $10 trillion economy of India,” he wrote. He said that the new finance minister who took the charge of the ministry after the 2019 general elections had a “very different personality, knowledge endowment, skill-set and approach for economic policy issues and also for the officers working with her” in comparison to former finance minister Arun Jaitley.Garg was shifted out of the finance ministry less than a month after the first budget presented by Sitharaman in July 2019 after the re-election of the Narendra Modi government. He alleged that the new finance minister got him transferred out of North Block to the power ministry that compelled him to opt for voluntary retirement.Explaining the reason for taking voluntary retirement , Garg wrote: “...quite frankly... I did not share a good and productive working relationship with the new Finance Minister [Sitharaman] and I did not want to work anywhere outside the Ministry of Finance”.“It was the best of the time personally and professionally to work with Shri Arun Jaitley,” Garg wrote.Drawing a comparison between his two bosses, he wrote: “Shri Arun Jaitley, with whom I spent most of my time in the Ministry of Finance, was a mastermind with an uncanny ability to sift through massive amounts of information and government files to discover the pith and substance of the public policy issue involved. He also had right temperament and ability to forge consensus.”“By devising the most acceptable solutions and then engendering wider acceptance for the same, Shri Jaitley was able to get solutions for most divisive and intractable solutions accepted by all. The GST [Goods and Services tax] reforms are a case in point,” he wrote, pointing to the recent disagreement over between the Centre and some states ruled by opposition parties over the issue of compensation for a shortfall in revenue from the indirect tax this financial year. The former civil servant said the late former finance minister was not a micro-manager. “Shri Jaitley focused on broader policy issues. He left the running of the departments and implementation of policies to the Secretaries.... He made the Secretaries present the policy proposals to the Prime Minister’s Office as well as to the media and the public. He was a very magnanimous and broadminded person,” he wrote. Garg said he did not share a productive working relationship with Sitharaman, who had “some pre-conceived notions” about him. The ministry of finance did not respond to Garg’s blog, but two officials working under Sitharaman said, requesting anonymity, that secretaries had been transferred in a routine exercise, which is a prerogative of the government. “More than a dozen of secretaries have worked under Sitharaman in various ministries, including ministries of defence, commerce and corporate affairs. Even in the finance ministry, there are five secretaries. It, therefore, appears it was mainly Garg’s own personality issue,” one of them said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-govt-s-self-goal-subhash-chandra-garg/story-XFMSocw5k2MRbPYZzix0PK.html
02-11-2020||India||Haryana planning law on interfaith marriages||Haryana is exploring the need for a law against interfaith relationships involving Hindu women and Muslim men in the wake of a stalker shooting dead a 21-year-old woman outside her college in Faridabad last week, the state’s home minister said on Sunday. The comment by Anil Vij, also a senior member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came a day after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath promised to bring a law to regulate such relationships. “Haryana is thinking of bringing a law against love jihad,” tweeted Vij. Love jihad is a term used by Hindu activists to describe relationships between Hindu women and Muslim men. Vij said the state government was very concerned after a 20-year-old final-year-commerce student, Nikita Tomar, was shot dead last Monday by her stalker, Touseef Ahmad, after a botched abduction attempt outside her college in Ballabhgarh. Images of the two suspects — Ahmad and his friend Rehaan -- were caught in CCTV footage and the duo was arrested from Nuh a day later amid widespread protests. Ahmad and Rehaan arrived in a Hyundai i20 and tried to force Tomar into the car as she came out of Aggarwal College after writing an exam, police said. “In the Faridabad case also the family members of the deceased have alleged that the accused had mounted pressure for religious conversion. This is not acceptable and therefore we will have to think about it,” Vij said in a tweet. Vij said “love jihad attempts” were being made across the country. “We will discuss this issue with all the political parties as well as people as the issue requires a detailed discussion on various points after which a decision will be taken,” he said. Vij said a special investigation team set up to investigate the murder will also probe if there were attempts at religious conversion and if a conspiracy was afoot on “love jihad” in Haryana. Interfaith relationships have become a hot-button issue in several states, where Hindu activists allege that Muslim men “lure” gullible women for conversion. Many experts reject these allegations and say that adult men and women are free to convert under the constitutional right to freedom of religion. In February, the central government told Parliament that there was no definition of the term and no such cases were reported by agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-planning-law-on-interfaith-marriages/story-hmuMeFG8vlZRZkTzYLBdkL.html
02-11-2020||India||J&K govt move: Land deals under Roshni Act void||The Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to annul all land dealings under the Roshni Act, three weeks after the Jammu and Kashmir high court declared it unconstitutional and unsustainable. The principal secretary, revenue, was on Saturday asked to retrieve all such land and remove encroachments within six months. The Jammu and Kashmir State Lands (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act was enacted in 2001 with the twin objective of generating resources for financing power projects and conferment of proprietary rights to the occupants of the state land. The scheme initially envisaged conferment of proprietary rights of about 20.55 lakh kanals to the occupants of which only 15.85% land was approved for vesting of ownership rights. Against the anticipated revenue from such occupants, the revenue actually generated was meagre. Besides, there were allegations of the legislation being misused by influential persons, leading to its being challenged before the high court. “It is hereby ordered that the principal secretary to government, revenue department, shall pass an order declaring all actions taken under the Jammu and Kashmir State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001, as amended from time to time, and rules made there under as void ab-initio,” stated an order issued by the Jammu and Kashmir department of law, justice and parliamentary affairs, with the lieutenant governor’s approval. “The principal secretary, revenue, shall work out a plan to retrieve large tracts of state land in a time-bound manner and work out modalities to evict encroachers from such state land within six months besides planning the handling of money received for these lands after annulment,” an official spokesman said in the statement. The spokesman said that the principal secretary, revenue, shall ensure information regarding district-wise state land as on January 1, 2001, are compiled and posted on the official website and the NIC website with details of the state land that was in illegal and unauthorised occupation of person(s)/entities with full identity of encroachers and particulars of the land. He said that complete identities of all influential persons, including ministers, legislators, bureaucrats, government officials, police officers, businessmen, their relatives or persons holding benami for them, who have derived benefit under the Roshni Act, 2001, or Roshni Rules, 2007, will be revealed. “The action shall be completed within a month,” the spokesman said.The Jammu and Kashmir State Lands (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, popularly known as the Roshni Act, was implemented in 2001 by the then J&K chief minister and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-govt-move-land-deals-under-roshni-act-void/story-Xt0aFrQzVHxU1dSNTMDajO.html
02-11-2020||India||India rejects Pak’s province status for Gilgit-Baltistan||India on Sunday rejected the Pakistan government’s decision to give “provisional provincial status” to Gilgit-Baltistan, saying Islamabad has no locus standi on Indian territory under its illegal and forcible occupation. New Delhi’s response came hours after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced the decision during a visit to Gilgit-Baltistan, giving another twist to the controversy over the region claimed by India as part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. While addressing a gathering in Gilgit to mark the so-called “independence day” of Gilgit-Baltistan, Khan also accused the Indian government of trying to foment unrest in Pakistan and creating a divide between the Shia and Sunni communities. “I want to greet the people of Gilgit-Baltistan today because we have decided that Gilgit-Baltistan will be given provisional provincial status, which was their demand for long,” Khan said, speaking in Urdu. “We have made this decision while keeping in mind the UN Security Council resolutions. We made the decision in between the UN Security Council resolutions,” he said. He did not give further details or say when Gilgit-Baltistan would become Pakistan’s fifth province. Khan also said his government had a development package in mind for the region but that he couldn’t announce details because of polls to be held on November 15. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava responded to the announcement by saying: “The government of India firmly rejects the attempt by Pakistan to bring material changes to a part of Indian territory under its illegal and forcible occupation.”The union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, “including the area of so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’, are an integral part of India by virtue of the legal, complete and irrevocable accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Union of India in 1947”, Srivastava said. “The government of Pakistan has no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it,” he said. Srivastava further said attempts by Pakistan to “camouflage its illegal occupation cannot hide the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom for over seven decades to the people residing in these Pakistan-occupied territories”. He added, “Instead of seeking to alter the status of these Indian territories, we call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation.” The Pakistan government intends to make Gilgit-Baltistan a full-fledged province with constitutional rights such as representation in both houses of Parliament. The plan has the backing of Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, and Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party is banking on the move to boost its chances in the elections in the region.Two years ago, the powers of the Islamabad-controlled council for Gilgit-Baltistan were transferred to a local assembly. In 2009, the Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order renamed the Northern Areas as Gilgit-Baltistan and the region was given province-like status but without representation in Parliament. During his speech, Khan highlighted the importance of a strong military in the face of what he described as a campaign by the Indian government to foment unrest across Pakistan and to create a split between the Sunni majority and Shia minority. He also said it was necessary for Pakistan to have a strong military in view of the oppression of the Kashmiri people by the Indian government following the scrapping of J&K’s special status on August 5 last year. He praised Pakistan’s intelligence agencies for foiling what he said were India’s moves to create unrest at a time when opposition parties were making plans to discredit the military and judiciary. Khan particularly defended army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed from attacks by the opposition parties. Referring to PML-N leader Ayaz Sadiq’s remarks that Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman – shot down in a dogfight during the military standoff triggered by the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019 – was freed by Pakistan because of fears of an impending attack by India, Khan said the opposition leaders were “speaking like [Indian Prime Minister] Narendra Modi”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-pak-s-province-status-for-gilgit-baltistan/story-L5VG1Vf2NcY0wcZBJPXX5J.html
02-11-2020||India||Hindu Sena defaces Islamic Centre signage, case lodged||Alleged members of the Hindu Sena defaced the signage outside the India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC) at Lodhi Road on Sunday, police said, adding an FIR has been registered suo-motu. Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said an FIR was registered at the Tughlaq Road police station against unknown persons under Section 3 of the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 2007. “A police team spotted the defaced signage while patrolling the neighbourhood on Sunday morning. There is no CCTV camera installed around the board. The name of a right-wing organisation is mentioned on the objectionable poster pasted on the signage. We will probe the involvement of its members,” said the officer.Earlier in the day, Hindu Sena released a statement owning up the responsibility for the act. Photographs of the defaced board went viral on social media on Sunday. Hindu Sena chief Vishnu Gupta said that in the morning he learnt that some members of their organisation had defaced the signage during a protest at the India Islamic Cultural Centre on Sunday morning. “Muslims in cities like Bhopal and Mumbai have been protesting against the France government’s response to Islamic terrorism. This has been happening despite our Prime Minister and our people extending support to France at this hour. We believe that members of the IICC should have come out with a statement condemning the protests in India. Since they did not, it is clear that they too were supporting the protest,” he said. Referring to the defacement, SM Khan, vice president of IICC, said the incident was unfortunate. “It was an unfortunate incident and we brought it to the notice of local authorities. Our board will meet to decide on the course of legal action. IICC is a place which believes in inter-faith dialogue, deliberation and promotes national integrity. To say we support any act of terror is ridiculous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindu-sena-defaces-islamic-centre-signage-case-lodged/story-jRbSxqA91bRJdcpG9CjwQP.html

This is significant because the reduction in deaths has occurred despite the majority of people infected with Covid-19 being treated in home isolation, unlike in March when everyone who tested positive was being admitted for treatment in designated hospitals.More people are getting tested today than ever before, with states like Kerala conducting 3,258 tests per million people per day, followed by Delhi with 3,225, which is well above the minimum of 140 tests per million people per day recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).Where India must focus its energy next is containing the spread of infection, which can be done only with active public participation.Respiratory viruses are transmitted when people inhale infected droplets expelled by infected persons coughing, sneezing, speaking or breathing. This means infection occurs through direct contact with an infected person, from touching a surface contaminated with droplets, through inhalation of respiratory droplets that contain the virus around a sick person, and through the airborne transmission of small droplets with the virus that remain suspended in the air for longer and travel further than heavy droplets.New research has found that virus transmission through contaminated surfaces is rare even though the Covid-19 virus survives on surfaces for days. “Attempts to culture the positive swabs on Vero E6 cells were unsuccessful, suggesting that patient fomites and surfaces are not contaminated with viable virus. Our findings suggest that environmental contamination leading to SARS-CoV-2 transmission is unlikely to occur in real-life conditions, provided that standard cleaning procedures and precautions are enforced,” reported scientists in the journal, The Lancet, on September 29.It was initially thought that droplet transmission was the main method of transmission, but now there is conclusive evidence of that the virus can stay suspended in tiny droplets called aerosols, which can disperse beyond 2 metres from an infected person under certain conditions.Several outbreak investigation reports have confirmed cases of transmission from people more than 2m apart in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. The chances of infection are higher in cases of extended exposure to an infected person for more than 30 minutes.Covid-19 virus transmission is particularly efficient in crowded, confined indoor spaces such as workplaces, restaurants, parties, shopping centres, dorms, cruise ships and transport, according to the European Centre of Disease Control (ECDC) guidance on ventilation of indoor spaces. In a study of 318 outbreaks in China, transmission in all cases except one occurred in indoor spaces, with the only case of outdoor transmission identified in this study involving two people.On July 9, WHO said airborne transmission of the coronavirus is possible indoors, especially when people spend extended periods in crowded and poorly ventilated rooms. On October 5, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines to say Covid-19 can occur from airborne transmission under certain circumstances, but it is not the primary route of spread of the disease.With lockdown fatigue setting in and people stepping out to work, socialise and celebrate their renewed freedom, new waves of infection are inundating several countries in Europe and Americas. In India, too, Covid-19 is surging in pockets. Delhi, for example, has registered a steady increase in new cases.How protected we are as we navigate public spaces over the next couple of weeks will decide whether Covid-19 will wax or wane by December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-participation-a-mustto-contain-infection-spread/story-lgwvE1M3BuTAw5CmusnDZP.html

The situation is very worrying. So, it is necessary that an all-party meeting should be called and the government should tell what preparations it has made to prevent the spread of the disease.”He also suggested that the government should use the existing sports facilities to meet the requirement for beds for patients. “The government should construct temporary hospitals at Chhatrasal Stadium, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Shivaji Stadium, Ambedkar Stadium, Indira Gandhi Stadium and the vacant land at Burari where Nirankari Sant Samagam is held without any delay. This way a large number of Covid patients can be treated,” he wrote.

02-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Is the coronavirus disease seasonal? I remember suggesting earlier this year that it may be and that the Indian summer would prove the country’s most powerful weapon against the virus — I was wrong, of course — but it’s a question I was reminded of when, in response to a discussion on Twitter about Europe’s ongoing and India’s imminent second wave, a doctor mentioned the Hope-Simpson curve.Robert Edgar Hope-Simpson — his father served in India till 1916 and he was born in 1908, so it is likely there’s an India connection there, although I can’t find any documentation of it — is the author of a book called The Transmission of Epidemic Influenza, published in 1992 after nearly six decades spent studying the disease. The book builds on an earlier paper by him in the Journal of Hygiene in 1981, The Role of Season in the Epidemiology of Influenza. Hope-Simpson was convinced that human or community transmission alone couldn’t explain the trajectory of influenza infections.He was able to show, using years of data, that there was a correlation between influenza and season. He initially put this down to an unknown seasonal variable but later narrowed down on the identify of the variable — Vitamin D.Covid-19 isn’t influenza — indeed, the two viruses aren’t even from the same family — but for some time earlier this year, it definitely looked as if the pandemic’s trajectory was following the famous Hope-Simpson curve — “a sinuous curve that runs parallel to the midsummer curve of vertical solar radiation, but lags about six months behind it”. (This is from the 1981 paper).It is likely some of you have seen the same posts I have online — showing a perfect match between the coronavirus pandemic’s trajectory in some countries from the northern hemisphere, others from the southern hemisphere and their respective Hope-Simpson curves. Some experts even used this to criticise lockdowns — these didn’t matter, was the argument; season was the primary driving force behind infections.IS COVID-19 SEASONAL?Robert Edgar Hope-Simpson, after studying years of data, was able to show that there was a correlation between influenza and season. But Covid-19 isn’t influenza and this pandemic has been unpredictable. Sure, its trajectory in some countries matched Hope-Simpson’s sinusoidal curve, but that in some other countries did not.But Covid-19 has been unpredictable. Sure, its trajectory in some countries matched Hope-Simpson’s sinusoidal curve, but that in some other countries did not.India is a case in point. Infections in the country rose through the summer months. As in the US. Infections there rose through late winter, dipped a bit in spring, then gathered momentum again in one part of summer before dipping again in another, and are now rising again through autumn. Both India and the US are in the northern hemisphere.But across most European countries (all in the northern hemisphere), the fall in cases coincided with the coming of warmer weather, and the current rise comes even as winter sets in.And in South Africa, Argentina and Chile (all three countries in the southern hemisphere), Covid-19 did peak in the winter months.It is likely that there are other factors at play as well.TOO SOON TO KNOWApart from seasonality, other factors are likely to be at play. One factor could be size and population, given that the two countries that are both exhibits in the case against seasonality (India and the US) are both large and populous. Another factor could be exposure to other viruses and lower levels of hygiene. I believe it is too soon to decide and this is something that can be established after years of study. One factor could be size and population, given that the two countries that are both exhibits in the case against seasonality (India and the US) are both large and populous, and many that are exhibits in the case for, (European countries) are neither large nor populous.The Covid-19 numbers of Brazil (another large country and third in overall number of cases after the US and India) presents a challenge, although cases there did peak during the colder months.Another factor could be exposure to other viruses, and lower levels of hygiene — things that some experts believe can explain Africa’s numbers (and perhaps that of some Indian states). Countries on the continent (with the exception of South Africa) have surprisingly few cases, and not many deaths.I believe it is too soon to decide one way or the other. It’s possible that seasonality emerges as one factor driving Covid-19 infections, but this is something that can be established after years (perhaps even decades) of study. Remember Hope-Simpson and his obsession with influenza for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-rTk7VOXzuK7dCYqb3iD1IO.html
02-11-2020||India||In Bihar, contradictions of aspiration, representation||More than two-thirds of the assembly constituencies (ACs) in Bihar are still to vote after the first phase of voting on October 28. If the first-phase figures are any indication, the pandemic has not had much of an impact on voter turnout except in urban constituencies. The voter turnout in the first phase was 55.69%, higher than the turnout in the corresponding constituencies in the 2015 assembly elections at 54.94%.The broad political narrative of the campaign has fallen into place by now. The main opposition, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led alliance, is targeting the Nitish Kumar government primarily on the question of jobs and economic well-being. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which has been in power in the state from 2005 to 2013 and from 2017 until now, is evoking memories of the RJD’s past stint in power to seek support for itself. This, in a way, suggests that it is advancing a lesser evil theory. To be sure, the NDA, especially Nitish Kumar himself, is also harping on its own past record. That the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) has not been thrown out of the NDA at the Centre despite making vicious attacks on Nitish Kumar, suggests that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would like the chief minister and his party, the Janata Dal (United), or JD (U), to face a bulk of the anti-incumbency flack. The centrality of the development narrative notwithstanding, identity-based contradictions, especially around caste, will continue to matter in the elections. It is the intersection of these two processes, which makes Bihar an interesting contest from a political economy perspective.How is Tejashwi Yadav being able to sell an aspirational agenda?Bihar reversed its economic decline after Nitish Kumar assumed officeThat Bihar went from bad to worse during the decade and a half long regime of Lalu Prasad Yadav is an objective fact. This is borne out by a comparison of Bihar’s per capita income with all-India figures. The ratio of Bihar’s per capita Gross State Domestic Product and India’s per capita GDP fell from around 0.4 to 0.3 during the period when Lalu Yadav or his wife Rabri Debi held power in the state. This trend reversed almost immediately after the JD(U)-BJP alliance got power in 2005. While this ratio has been improving continuously, Bihar continues to be among the worst performing states in terms of per capita GSDP. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();It is this persisting backwardness inter-state backwardness, which is giving the RJD led opposition an opportunity to undermine the NDA’s claim of having brought historical improvement from where the state was a decade and a half ago. The prolonged economic slowdown in the Indian economy and Covid-19’s economic disruption, especially due to reverse migration, might have increased the economic pain, and helped the opposition in targeting the current NDA government. Whether or not the RJD’s aspiration plank under Tejashwi Yadav’s leadership can overcome NDA’s attempts to evoke memories of poor governance during his father’s term, will be an important factor in these elections.The BJP has a problem in launching a full-scale attack on the RJD’s Yadav baseThe RJD did not win even one Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 elections in Bihar. Yet, it has managed to forge a coalition with majority of ACs for itself and is claiming to be the natural challenger to the incumbent NDA. One of the biggest reasons for this is the fact that the RJD is seen as the primary beneficiary of the more than 30% Muslim and Yadav voters in the state. The Muslim support comes from the fact that it has never done business with the BJP. While the BJP, as of now, is not interested in courting Muslim voters, it does want to attract the Yadavs in the state, who are perhaps the single largest caste group in Bihar. Narendra Modi in his Hoonkar Rally (at 2:02 hours) before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections evoked his Dwarka (a Hindu pilgrimage spot in Gujarat associated with Lord Krishna, who Modi described as the king of Yaduvansh; or the Yadav clan) credentials to express affinity with Lalu Prasad Yadav’s social roots and portray himself as a well wisher of the Yadavs. The BJP has been successfully fielding Ram Kripal Yadav, against Lalu Prasad Yadav’s daughter Misa Bharti from the Pataliputra constituency in both 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP’s aggressive pursuit of the RJD’s Yadav base hurt the latter, which, according to the CSDS-Lokniti post-poll survey, could only manage 55% of Yadav votes, its worst performance, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();According to an Indian Express report, both the BJP and the JD(U) have given around 15% of their tickets to Yadav candidates. This, although significantly lower than the share of Yadav candidates fielded by the RJD (40%), is not an insignificant number. It is entirely possible that a large number of Yadav voters who supported the NDA might be willing to vote for the RJD in these elections. At the state level, it is the RJD which promises them greater share in exploits of power. There is not much the BJP can do to prevent this political promiscuity by the Yadavs, lest they are antagonised during the Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, portraying a Yadav as its main leader in Bihar, which could help it attract an even bigger chunk of RJD’s Yadav votes, could trigger a backlash from the upper caste voters for the BJP, who although overwhelmingly behind the BJP, have had an antagonistic outlook vis-a-vis Yadavs. That the RJD is keeping its attack focused on Nitish Kumar rather than the BJP or Narendra Modi, suggests that it has understood the merits of exploiting a split-ticket behaviour among the Yadavs in the assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-contradictions-of-aspiration-representation/story-fZgKjoFxEst37c9qVBE92K.html
02-11-2020||India||Global study sees India having edge in Covid-19 vaccines||India has used its manufacturing capability to pre-order 600 million doses of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine and is negotiating for another billion doses, enough to vaccinate at least half the population, according to a new global analysis of advance market commitments (AMCs) for experimental vaccines till October 8. Most experimental Covid-19 vaccines require two doses.The figures are second only to the US, which has pre-ordered 810 million confirmed doses and has another 1.6 billion under negotiation.It will likely take three to four years to manufacture enough vaccines to cover the world’s population, but high-income countries and a few middle-income countries with manufacturing capacity such as India, have already purchased nearly 3.8 billion doses, with options for another five billion, showed an analysis of purchasing agreements for Covid-19 vaccines by the US-based Duke Global Health Innovation Center.“In terms of numbers of confirmed doses, the USA has pre-ordered the largest number (810 million confirmed, another 1.6 billion doses under negotiation), followed by India (600 million doses confirmed, with another 1 billion doses under negotiation), and the EU (400 million doses confirmed, another 1.565 billion doses under negotiation). But in terms of percent of population covered by confirmed purchases, Canada has pre-purchased enough vaccine to cover 527% of their population, followed by the UK at 277% of their population,” said Andrea D Taylor, assistant director of programmes at the Duke Global Health Innovation Center, who led the analysis. “Of course, it is important to remember that most likely only some of the vaccine purchases will come through, depending on regulatory approval,” said Taylor.Also read | Covid-19 vaccine predictions of pharma companies that didn’t come true“India is producing vaccines to protect the world against Covid-19, why shouldn’t it ensure its own citizens are protected as well? The government is committed to protecting the health of its citizens, so all measures have been taken to ensure we get adequate doses of the vaccines when they are available,” said a senior Union health ministry official, requesting anonymity. Since none of the experimental vaccines yet have regulatory approval, countries are hedging bets by purchasing multiple candidates and some part of these doses may never materialise. The UK, for example, has made AMCs with five different vaccine candidates, using four different vaccine technologies. Future agreements under discussion by the EU raise that number of vaccine doses to almost two billion, while the US, which has pre-ordered doses to cover 230% of its population, could eventually control 1.8 billion doses — about a quarter of the world’s near-term supply — according to the analysis. This “vaccinationalism” will lead to some countries being able to vaccinate their entire populations — and some many times over — which is likely to deny low-resource regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, access to Covid-19 protection until 2024.Only enough doses to cover 250 million people have been confirmed as purchased thus far by Covax, a global effort involving both wealthy and poor countries that has promised equal access to Covid-19 vaccines globally. To meet its goal of vaccinating at least 20% of member countries, COVAX would need at least 1.14 billion doses of a single-dose vaccine and twice that amount for a two-dose regimen.Covax signatories, which include the UK, the EU and Canada but not the US, are effectively undermining the pact by negotiating “side deals” for vaccines that will affect equitable access, said the study.“An ambitious effort to create a global system of vaccine equity is being undermined as a handful of countries, including those who made a commitment to equality, secure as many doses as they possibly can,” said Elina Urli Hodges, MSPH, who leads the Launch and Scale Speedometer, an initiative that identifies impediments to delivering health innovations to low-income countries. No low-income country has made a direct agreement to purchase, suggesting that they will be limited to the Covax pact to secure vaccines. AMCs are being secured by countries through investment of large amounts of public funds into research and development of Covid-19 vaccines, national public and private vaccine development capacity, both public and private, and purchasing power and volume to make large-scale deals.Other countries such as Brazil are also using their manufacturing capability to negotiate large AMCs with leading experimental vaccine candidates, while countries such as Peru are participating in phase 3 clinical trials to get leverage to negotiate AMCs, found the analysis, which used available evidence from public sources until October 8 combined with interviews with global and regional vaccine experts, as well as ministry of health officials in select countries.“It is understandable that countries are acting in their national interest; they are incentivised to focus first on the safety of their populations. But globally, this will deepen existing inequities, and prolong the pandemic. Our research points to the need for countries and multilateral funders to unlock additional manufacturing capacity (particularly in the Global South) and invest in preparing countries for effective distribution of vaccines. High-income countries should also work with COVAX, as a global coordinator, to ensure that, once their populations are covered, excess doses are redeployed where they are needed most around the world,” said Taylor, in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-study-sees-india-having-edge-in-covid-19-vaccines/story-3Hh2hC3SGaadpX3LVG9hDL.html

02-11-2020||Editorials||Stop attacking interfaith marriages | HT Editorial||The idea of “love jihad” — where Muslim men ostensibly entrap Hindu women (sometimes by masking their own religion) and lure them into marriage (and then force them to convert), with the objective of changing the demography — has been a part of the vocabulary of Hindutva politics. From the fringe, this idea has got increasing mainstream acceptance within the political system. Now, Uttar Pradesh chief minister (CM) Yogi Adityanath has threatened death for those supposedly engaged in it, while Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar has spoken of bringing a law against “love jihad”. This is surprising because as recently as February, the home ministry told Parliament that the term isn’t defined in law and that no such cases were reported by central agencies.The use of such vocabulary to describe interfaith relationships is insidious. It is a reflection of bigotry and patriarchy and has tremendous inflammatory potential. Indian society must embrace relationships across class, caste, and yes, religion, for there is no more effective way to integrate communities, develop empathy and understanding, and deepen national unity. No relationship or marriage should of course be based on either coercion or deception — and if there are any such instances, irrespective of the gender or religion of the person, then there must be legal implications. But to bracket any relationship which may involve a Muslim man and Hindu woman as an instance of a conspiracy to undermine Hindus is outright false. It is based on treating women as the property of others and denies them their agency; it is also based on manufactured fears and false stereotypes about Muslims. If a couple wants to get married, it is the State’s duty to enable them to exercise their right. Instead, the political regime appears to be enabling a climate of fear, distrust and violence and reinforcing the paranoia around interfaith marriages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/stop-attacking-interfaith-marriages-ht-editorial/story-2dnF1CV4iGTA3l3l2mq0xM.html
02-11-2020||Editorials||A moment of reckoning | HT Editorial||The United States (US) presidential election is a fork in the road for the future of the world’s most powerful nation and, therefore, the international system as a whole. This is reflected in the contrasting personalities of the candidates. Donald Trump personifies almost everything deemed fatal to the electoral chances of a US presidential candidate, with his not-so-subtle racism, erratic and almost absurd public pronouncements, and absence of leadership skills. Joe Biden, on the other hand, is cut from the same establishment cloth that has determined Washington’s values and worldview for decades.Mr Trump’s rise reflects a deeper failure in the US system to address the growing immiseration of its working class. He is a beneficiary of this inequality and, ironically, given his background, the political voice of the anger stemming from it. Mr Biden’s weakness is that he is part of the system that is seen as having failed by about half the US population. Fortunately for him, Covid-19 and Mr Trump’s toxic character have made this an election about opposing the president rather than favouring Mr Biden.A second Trump administration will see a continuing erosion of the US’s public institutions. It will also see socially conservative views, drawn from extreme religious views, make inroads into the American system. On the other hand, the Trump administration has shown a greater willingness to call a spade a spade in the international sphere than it was thought possible by a US government. A disinterest in US interventions in West Asia and a willingness to directly confront China are two manifestations — and both have worked in favour of Indian interests. A Biden administration would see some effort to address the social issues that led to Mr Trump’s rise. Many of its solutions would mirror those of the present administration, including backtracking from free trade and a renewed support for State-funded industrial policies. There are a number of urgent issues on which a President Biden would be a major improvement, most notably the climate crisis. Given India’s overall interests, the real expectation from a Biden administration would be the restoration of legitimacy at home so that the US can maintain pre-eminence overseas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-moment-of-reckoning-ht-editorial/story-utbc6I55CyM38DaMFb23nK.html
02-11-2020||Editorials||Commission for Air Quality Management: The potential and the pitfalls||Last week, the Centre issued an ordinance to put in place a new anti-pollution agency to tackle the crisis in the Delhi-National Capital Region area. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) will have the power to formulate rules, set emission standards and impose fines up to ₹1 crore or send violators to prison for up to five years. CAQM will have members from the Centre, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and non-governmental organisations. By setting up CAQM, the Centre has acknowledged that air pollution is indeed a major challenge; it has health, economic and political implications; and the problem of multiplicity of authorities was a key reason why it could not be tackled effectively. Many have raised questions — rightly so — about the way the ordinance was passed with no consultation, and the possible overriding powers the Centre may have; whether a top-down implementation approach (without third-party monitoring and citizen-driven enforcement) will work; and the lack of a time-bound commitment to clean the air. The Centre could also have come up with the framework before this year’s pollution season began rather than wait for judicial prodding. While CAQM is welcome, it alone cannot clean the air. Its success will depend on how it tackles different interest groups; outlines a time-bound commitment to achieving the set standards; ensures adequate personnel and funds for pollution control bodies, and stricter monitoring systems. All of this will require tremendous political will and support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/commission-for-air-quality-management-the-potential-and-the-pitfalls/story-0Iy8UzYrvvzZJ7jA49LfxM.html
