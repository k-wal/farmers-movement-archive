26-11-2020||News||Banks: Governance, not ownership, is key||One sentence from a recent internal committee report of Reserve Bank of India — “large corporate/industrial houses may be allowed as promoters of banks” — has generated an intense debate. To put it a little simplistically, those in favour of the suggestion argue that this will bring much-needed capital and competition while those against it claim this will lead to promoters lending bank funds to themselves and create further problems for the ailing Indian banking industry.India’s banking history explains this divided response, with many episodes of industry-promoted banks lending to themselves. One major reason for India’s bank nationalisation in 1969 was industry’s control over banks. The then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi listed “the removal of control by a few” as one of the major reasons for nationalisation. She further added that by “severing the link between the major banks and the bigger industrial groups which have so far controlled them”, the government will be able to professionalise the banking sector. Ever since then, we have been uncomfortable with corporates owning banks.However, history is also replete with banks promoted by professionals lending irresponsibly to bring ruin. Let us review private bank licences since 1994. We choose 1994 since after bank nationalisation, no new private banks were licensed and new private banks were allowed only post-1991 reforms. Fourteen new banks have been licensed in three stages since 1990s. Of the 14, financial institutions and professionals have promoted five banks each. Two banks were promoted by corporates and two others were set up with the conversion of non-banking financial company (NBFC) and Cooperative Bank. RBI has clearly preferred professionals and institutions for new banks.Of the 14 banks, four have been merged and two were in financial trouble but were bailed out by financial institutions. Amid the banks which have avoided trouble, those promoted by financial institutions have been stable. Out of the six failed/merged/troubled banks, four were run by professionals, one by a financial institution and one by a corporate. Clearly, professionals have not fared on expected lines.Those in favour of corporate-promoted banks will point to case of Indusind Bank which has been promoted by the Hindujas. Those against will point to case of Times Bank. But more than the nature of ownership, this shows that it boils down to the kind of corporate governance the promoters have established with checks and balances in place.In this backdrop, how does one assess the new recommendation? To be fair, the report has added riders before allowing corporates as promoters. First, the Banking Regulation Act (1949) has to be amended so that such banks can avoid connected lending and exposures between the banks and other financial and non-financial group entities. Second, it will require strengthening of the supervisory mechanism for large conglomerates, including consolidated supervision.Thus, it is hardly a blanket case where any industrialist applying to be a promoter will be allowed. Moreover, RBI has a very stringent “fit and proper criteria” which makes it very difficult for anyone to get a bank licence. Even in 2013, several top corporates had bid for universal bank licence but only IDFC and Bandhan were given the licence. Having said that, corporates were allowed to start payment banks which mainly facilitate payments and not give loans. But it was then treated as a reform despite critics pointing that payment banks could give a backdoor entry for corporates. Former RBI officials themselves point out that payment banks can tie up with other banks to provide loans. However, they see it as a reason for corporates to not be considered for a bank licence. But why would you be comfortable with indirect lending and not direct lending?To sum up, there are reasons to be divided on the issue. While the criticism against corporates as promoters has merit, the argument that they will lend funds to themselves is rather naïve. RBI gets regular reports on bank lending and this can be ruled out as must be the case with Indusind bank. A corporate-promoted bank will be worried about its reputation and think very hard before flouting the law.A bigger risk is this policy could lead to concentration of a few large players dominating banking as well, leading to lower competition and not higher competition as is desired by the policy. But then where and how does India get funds for new and large banks? The report also pointed out how India lags behind others in terms of credit as a percentage of GDP and has only one bank in the top global 100 banks. One way out could be opening up more space for foreign banks, but partly due to the lessons of 2008 crisis, there has been caution in doing so. There is, however, a tiny step forward in allowing Singapore based DBS India to take up Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB).It may be prudent to moderate expectations from our banks and banking policy. India should relax some of the constraints. This will allow larger, sustainable banks — for will a Tata Bank be such a bad idea? Or there has to be a conscious decision to allow the mushrooming of smaller banks across the country, which comes with its own risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/banks-governance-not-ownership-is-key/story-FG4cw88t3IlOkNus0dWJtI.html
26-11-2020||News||Charting a reformed future for the police||Addressing the first three-day conference of police chiefs in Independent India on January 12, 1950, Sardar Patel, the then deputy prime minister and home minister, expressed hope that the provincial police would handle law and order on their own, and not depend on the military as an aid to civil power. He also expected better results in criminal investigation with greater coordination between the states. Both issues remain relevant today. The central police forces are fully stretched, aiding various states to combat law and order problems, while states governed by non-Bharatiya Janata Party formations are withdrawing general consent to Central Bureau of Investigation, one by one.The recommendations of the annual conference, in the early years, led to a great boost to police infrastructure, induction of human resources and technological upgradation. Communal violence, crimes against women, vehicle-theft and a range of other issues reflected the concerns of the prevailing times. Terrorism in Punjab and the insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir became dominant themes in the 1980s and 90s. Even today, Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, Maoism and insurgencies in the Northeast figure prominently.However, important pronouncements by home ministers, during conferences in the past, have been largely ignored. In 1962, Lal Bahadur Shastri called for the introduction of the police commissioner system in cities with more than 500,000 people. He felt that to handle crimes and law and order, the police should have all powers, even if it meant withdrawing some from the deputy commissioner, revenue. Today, more than half of the one-million-plus towns are still without the police commissioner system.In 1964, the idea of an All India Police Commission was strongly mooted. In 1981, home minister Giani Zail Singh stressed on the need to post an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer as the home secretary or joint secretary in view of the specialised demands of the ministry. The home ministry shelved the proposal. Further, recommendations of Commissions under Dharamvira (1977), Ribeiro (1998), Padmanabhaiya (2000), Malimath (2000) lie buried as archival material. The home ministry does not brief police chiefs on their status and the public, too, is unaware. Police reforms directed by the Supreme Court are languishing for the last 15 years, in the absence of the home ministry coordinating with the states for their implementation. In 2005, Prime Minister (PM) Manmohan Singh announced a police mission and, in 2014, PM Narendra Modi called for a SMART Police. Both are still works-in-progress.PM Modi has attempted to inject life into the otherwise staid Director General of Police (DGP) conferences. He is the first PM to sit through all sessions, taking great interest with meaningful interventions. This has led to more relevant police issues being presented by police chiefs. At his behest, younger IPS officers are also invited to the conference. The PM has called for strengthening the police station and suggested third-party audit of police performance. However, some key issues have still escaped the attention of the conference. Police reforms, the police commissioner system, police autonomy, management of police cadre and the role of the home ministry are surprisingly never discussed. If police stations are to deliver, then posting of SHOs has to be done by superintendents of police and not on secretarial files. The police should be declared a professional organisation where the CEO, here, the director-general of police (DGP), has unfettered right over transfers of his field commanders and is held accountable for his actions. The reason cited for not discussing these issues is that police is a state subject. But if it is so, why does the Centre not introduce a model police Act in Union Territories and install the police commissioner system in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, where the BJP is in power, to show its intent? The public airing of DGPs’ resolutions would enlighten citizens and exert moral pressure on chief ministers (CMs) to implement them. A few CMs could also be invited to speak at this forum and exchange ideas with the police chiefs.Some critical events drawing nationwide attention to the role and functioning of the police must figure on the agenda of conference this year — scheduled for early December — such as the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act agitations, Delhi riots, the Vikas Dubey encounter, the Hathras incident, the deaths in Tuticorin police station and the Sushant Singh Rajput case. DGPs must discuss and assess handling of agitations and riots this year, while suggesting a road map for the future. Poor response to cases of atrocities against women needs to be discussed threadbare. Lack of critical forensic support at police stations has to be taken up. Handling mafia dons and treatment of persons in police stations are issues that need to be taken up earnestly.It is time for the DGPs to decide that sedition laws, defamation and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or National Security Act, are resorted to only in exceptional cases. Ineffective prosecution is the bane of the criminal justice system. While prosecution-guided investigation exists in other countries, there is no coordination between the two in India. The conference must pitch strongly for a system with better coordination and for hiring prosecutors of quality and experience. And finally, police leaders should resolve not to cede space to the political leadership or bureaucracy on professional matters and cooperate with each other, adhering to the spirit of the law of land. In a democracy, the police is the cornerstone for good governance and should not be taken for granted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/charting-a-reformed-future-for-the-police/story-PpRjRwZ8WrwIAV5sjvMkfO.html
26-11-2020||News||India must engage with Taiwan, and not just because of China | Opinion||Taiwan is celebrating India, and making an effort to win the hearts of the Indian community. This was manifested in Taiwan’s ministry of foreign affairs’ first-ever public celebration of Diwali at the Taipei Guest House on November 13. This was in response to the appreciation Taiwan has got from India over the last couple of months. Its Covid-19 success has generated curiosity about Taiwan in India. The India-China standoff and China’s disregard for India’s territorial sovereignty and integrity has also contributed to this mutual appreciation and realisation of the need to urgently step up bilateral relations.This realisation is, however, more at the level of civil society than the State on the Indian side. Considering several diplomatic and strategic constraints, the scope for elevation in India-Taiwan ties has remained limited. The China factor has loomed large. Even though India has stopped mentioning its adherence to OneChina policy in joint statements and official documents since 2010, its engagement with Taiwan is still restricted due to the framework of ties with China. Foregoing relations with Taiwan for the hope of managing tensions with China has yielded little result. China’s aggression at the border front, its decades-old “all-weather friendship” with Pakistan including the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and denying New Delhi entry at the international platforms are examples of its uncompromising stance towards India. It is not surprising that China has not respected India’s clearly articulated sensitivities on these issues.India is an important part of the Indo-Pacific region, and it is natural for India to collaborate with like-minded countries to pursue common interests. On the one hand, China has emerged as a security concern for India, and, on the other, Taiwan is willing to partner with major stakeholders in the Indo-Pacific to ensure regional stability and peace. Taiwan’s inclusion and participation in the Indo-Pacific is significant, and should be promoted by all major stakeholders. It is a fallacy to assume that the Indo-Pacific is solely designed to contain China. This notion of Taiwan versus China should be changed and Taiwan’s participation should be seen as a stabilising factor. While a concerted policy is required for ensuring Taiwan’s inclusion in the Indo-Pacific, India should be more forthcoming towards Taiwan. China has clearly violated the Panchsheel Agreement by repeatedly raising the issue of India’s Jammu and Kashmir. It is interfering in India’s domestic politics, and dictating how India should handle its foreign relations. China cannot have a say in how India wishes to engage with other partners such as Taiwan.Taiwan’s growing popularity in India is unprecedented. The Indian government should sense the popular sentiment, and consider a shift in its Taiwan policy. Several steps may be taken. First, initiating trade talks would be a welcome step. Singapore and New Zealand already have Free Trade Agreements with Taiwan. Taiwan is an integral part of the regional supply chain mechanism, and a trade agreement with Taiwan will help India remain connected to the regional economic dynamism, amidst its attempts to de-couple from China.Second, parliamentary visits should be restored between Taiwan and India. The two countries are vibrant democracies, and parliamentary interactions and visits will strengthen their commitment towards the rule of law and good governance. Third, to have a long-term perspective on the virtues of engaging each other, a policy planning dialogue at the mid-official level may be initiated primarily for information-sharing and dealing with the non-traditional security threats. Fourth, an active exchange of ideas in the health sector will prove beneficial for learning from Taiwan’s Covid-19 experience.The objective of this deepening engagement is not to field ties with Taiwan as a countermeasure to growing animosity with China, but to de-hyphenate India-Taiwan ties from India-China relations. Taiwan is reaching out to India; India too should reciprocate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-must-engage-with-taiwan-and-not-just-because-of-china/story-rxKdf4jtfgsMmgqe82XshK.html

26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Powermen’s strike leaves parts of Chandigarh powerless for up to 14 hours||Chandigarh residents faced the brunt of the one-day strike called by the electricity department employees as major power supply disruptions were reported from across the city on Thursday. The administration’s Tuesday warning to employees against going on strike went largely unheeded with department officials stating that more than 90% of the field staff didn’t report for duty. Unions claimed nearly 100% employees took part in the strike from 11pm on Wednesday to 11pm on Thursday. Employees are up in arms against the administration’s decision to privatise power distribution in the city. Already, nine companies have expressed interest in participating in the bidding process. Employees contend that the department is in profit and should not be privatised.“In the absence of field staff, we faced severe problem in rectifying even routine issues in the power distribution system,” said an electricity department official, requesting anonymity. The department received more than 400 complaints of supply disruption from across the city. “Though the exact number is still to be calculated, it was between 400 and 500, which is multiple times complaints received on a normal day,” said the official. Major disruptions to supplyAreas that reported major disruptions to power supply were Sectors 8, 9, 18, 21, 28, 37, 38, 39, 43 and 45 besides the Industrial Area and Manimajra. In some areas, power cuts lasted for up to 14 hours. Kuldeep Singh Gill, president, Sector 21B Resident Welfare Association (RWA), said power in the sector went around midnight and didn’t come back till 1pm. “Power boxes and transformers of the electricity department aren’t guarded. Any of the powermen on strike could have sabotaged the units. Also if powermen were on strike, couldn’t junior engineers or subdivisional engineers repair the fault?” he said.In Sector 39, electricity remained suspended in many areas for more than nine hours. Devinder Singh Benipal, general secretary, Sector 39D RWA, said: “Power went around 11am, and till 8 in the evening, there was no respite. When we complained to the electricity department, we were told that the problem can’t get fixed till the strike gets over around midnight.” Business owners also faced problems in the city. Hot Millions proprietor Captain Mohanbir Singh said: “At our Sector-17 eatery, there was no power since 10am. Businesses are already struggling due to the pandemic. If powermen were on strike, alternative arrangements should have been made.”Admn’s warning goes unheededThe Chandigarh administration had on Tuesday warned the employees of strict disciplinary action if they join the strike. It had also said that the principle of ‘no work no pay’ will be implemented against the erring employees. UT adviser Manoj Parida reiterated on Thursday that no pay will be given for the day in cases where employees abstained from work. On the allegations of possible sabotage, he said: “If such cases are detected, strict action will be taken.” However, denying the role of union members in large-scale power disruptions in the city, Gopal Joshi, general secretary, UT Powermen Union, said: “Overnight rains led to faults at several places. With our members on strike from 11pm on Wednesday, these faults couldn’t be rectified. Hence, power supply was affected in many places.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/powermen-s-strike-leaves-parts-of-chandigarh-powerless-for-up-to-14-hours/story-9krrjIsmTHyEoB6vPykQ8I.html
26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Now, pay up ₹1,000 for not wearing mask in Chandigarh||Not wearing a face mask in public places in Chandigarh will now invite a fine of ₹1,000. Even as the UT administration on Thursday ruled out night curfew in the city and decided against rolling back relaxations announced recently, it doubled the fine for not wearing mask from ₹500. The decision was taken in the Covid-19 review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore. Even the Punjab government on Wednesday had increased the fine to ₹1,000, while in the neighbouring Panchkula, it is still ₹500. “In our city, Covid-19 is thankfully under control. We do not want to disrupt normal life unless it becomes unavoidable. The economy too needs to be brought back on track. Our decision is dynamic. We take timely decisions depending on developments,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida, even as the city has witnessed a spike in cases in the last couple of weeks. Coaching institutes to open from December 1While in the neighbouring states of Himachal Pradesh and Haryana, schools have been shut after reopening to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the administration on Thursday decided to even allow the opening of coaching institutes. Closed since March, they can resume classes and even open their hostels from December 1, subject to strict observance of Covid protocols. However, they have been directed to concentrate on online teaching instead of physical classes. GMCH to resume classes from December 1Classroom teaching at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, will also resume from December 1.Dr Jasbinder Kaur, officiating director-cum-principal, GMCH, confirmed it. According to a recent directive from the Centre, states and UTs were asked to begin classes based on the advice of the National Medical Commission, which suggested that from the point of view of standardisation, all medical colleges should reopen at the same time across the country. Review of closing time of eateries on cardsIn contrast to the Punjab government’s decision to impose night curfew in the state from December 1, the UT administration instead has decided to review just the closing time of restaurants, bars and nightclubs in the next meeting, in case there is a surge in Covid cases.Currently, these establishments close at 1am. The administration had allowed restaurants and hotels to reopen in June, while serving of liquor was allowed from September 1. Badnore stresses on strict implementation of normsThe administrator directed officials to ensure that Covid protocols are followed in public gatherings, such as weddings and social events, and go for stricter enforcement in places where crowding takes place, including the Sector-26 mandi and other markers, ISBT, railway station, parks, Sukhna Lake and Rock Garden. Violations of preventive norms, such as social distancing and wearing of masks, have been rampant in these places. Badnore also directed health officials to intensify mobile Covid testing at such places, while appealing to the citizens to follow norms and take precautions. Badnore also directed officials to be ready for storage, transportation, distribution and planned vaccination of people, once the corona vaccine is made available. The Centre on November 24 directed the administration to augment the cold chain and transport mechanism for the Covid vaccine. The UT adviser will chair a meeting on the issue on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-pay-up-1-000-for-not-wearing-mask-in-chandigarh/story-pE6YBDIvZTTY8acKuTf1eJ.html

26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Happy to have met Navjot Singh Sidhu, says Amarinder Singh after luncheon||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday said he and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had some “simple talks”, a day after both leaders met over lunch. Singh on Wednesday met Sidhu at the former’s residence, triggering speculation that the cricketer-turned-politician may be re-inducted into the state cabinet. The chief minister on Thursday expressed hope that he and Sidhu will continue to have cordial meetings like the one they had on Wednesday, where they spoke a lot about cricket, apart from a host of other things. Both were in a good mood during the one-hour luncheon, to which Singh had invited the former cricketer after he expressed an interest in meeting him, Singh said in a statement here. “I was satisfied and happy with the meeting, and so was Sidhu,” he said. “We did not make any plans for Punjab or India or the world. We just had some simple talks, during which Sidhu shared a lot of his cricketing experience,” Singh said, adding that unfortunately, the media was making a mountain out of a molehill. Taking a dig at the Shiromani Akali Dal’s remark on him hosting a banquet for Sidhu, the chief minister said that his former cabinet colleague had boiled vegetables, while he himself partook a ‘missi roti with dahi’ during the lunch. “Does that look like a banquet to the Akalis,” he asked. SAD leader Daljit Singh Cheema on Wednesday had said that farmers were facing water cannons on their way to Delhi but the chief minister was holding a “royal banquet” for Sidhu.  Sidhu and Singh have not been on best of terms since May last year when the chief minister accused the former cricketer of the “inept handling” of the Local Government Department, claiming it resulted in “poor performance” of the Congress in urban areas during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Sidhu was stripped of key portfolios in a cabinet reshuffle, after which he resigned from the state cabinet and stayed away from all Congress activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/happy-to-have-met-navjot-singh-sidhu-says-amarinder-singh-after-luncheon/story-LbHDqe8alXz92HwTh3TauI.html
26-11-2020||Kolkata||Bengal Guv hits back after TMC MP accuses him of trying to influence police investigation||Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee accused West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar of trying to influence and obstruct the investigation of a case in which an IRS officer’s name has cropped up, who has connections with top BJP leaders.“Tweeting is not a statutory function of the Governor but he has tweeted in a bid to influence and obstruct police investigation. He is trying to save the accused persons and speaking on their behalf,” said Banerjee while requesting the police to prosecute Dhankhar.Dhankhar, however, hit back saying that he would continue to discharge his constitutional obligations as he cannot fiddle in Raj Bhavan when political violence is going on in the state. “My assurance to the people of the state is that in the coming days there would be more such packing of vilification campaign so that there may be a diversion from the burning issues,” the Governor said in a statement issued by Raj Bhavan. Also read: ‘Remember what you taught us’ - Bhupesh Baghel politely stings Sibal, AzadThe Kolkata Police, while investigating a case dating back to 2017 had arrested an accounting firm owner. The name of some chartered accountants and an IRS officer had also surfaced during probe. “There is another IRS officer. He is a relative of many high-ranking BJP men,” he said without divulging further. A day after Kolkata Police arrested financial consultant Govind Agarwal, Dhankhar on November 22 tweeted alleging that the arrests were politically motivated.

Why forget ‘Be ye never so high, the law is above you’,” Dhankhar had tweeted on November 22. The MP accused the Governor of having links with BJP-backed goons and alleged that Dhankar was targeting the chief minister. The MP said that he would shed more light in another press conference later. “I as Constitutional head cannot countenance public servants acting as political workers. This is too serious to be ignored. This would be dangerous to democracy,” the Governor was quoted in the Raj Bhavan statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-governor-hits-back-after-tmc-mp-accuses-him-of-trying-to-influence-police-investigation/story-lIn3e1xKbWKsZHSMtwJUAK.html
26-11-2020||Chandigarh||High court notice to Haryana on plea challenging bond policy for MBBS students||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday put Haryana government on notice on a plea seeking quashing of bond policy notified on November 6 by the state government for MBBS students.The petitioner, Harlove Singh Rajput, sought reconsideration of policy by the state or stay on the same, pending petition in high court. Besides, seeking quashing of the policy. The state’s response has been sought by February 11.The fee in public medical colleges has been raised to ₹10 lakh per year from around ₹50,000 per year. With this, a student seeking admission in an MBBS course will have to pay ₹40 lakh for the four-year course. In order to incentivise doctors to opt for Haryana government medical service, the state government on November 6 came out with a policy which states that candidates selected for MBBS degree course in government medical colleges need to execute an annual bond for ₹10 lakh minus the fee at the start of every academic year. The candidate can pay the entire bond amount without recourse to the loan or the state government will facilitate them for availing an education loan for this amount. As per the policy, the government will repay annual installments of the loan if the candidate obtains employment with the state government. The public interest litigation says the policy is not in commensurate with the spirit of the constitution.It was argued that that state says it would not be under obligation to provide employment. The policy has neglected the objective of providing subsidized education to meritorious students whereby money is being preferred over merit. By this way, the noble profession will be available only for the rich and irrespective of the merit/ rank / score secured by a candidate in NEET, it was argued.

26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Hooch deaths: High court seeks reply on plea from Haryana, Punjab, CBI||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday asked Punjab, Haryana and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to respond to a plea by an NGO seeking probe in deaths due to consumption of illicit liquor in both the states. The petition has been filed by a Haryana-based NGO Sabka Mangal Ho. The high court bench of justice SN Satyanarayana and justice Archna Puri has sought a response by January 10. The petitioner has also demanded a probe by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).The petition mainly talks about instances of alleged illicit liquor business in Haryana but says it has inter-state ramifications. The Haryana government had assured a probe by the State Vigilance Bureau in each district on the basis of recommendations given by a Special Enquiry Team (SET). However, not even a single FIR has been registered, the court was told. “The offences of institutionalised form of corruption and money laundering have inter-state ramifications. Repeated complaints and reminders to the ED and Vigilance Bureau but no action was taken,” their counsel Pardeep Rapria said, adding that the SET probe had raised several questions on the conduct of officials of the excise department as well as police officers.The plea claims the SET report said “huge unauthorised movement of liquor stocks across the state during Covid-19 lockdown period”. “Recently, several people had died in Sonepat and Panipat. Failure of the state government to take criminal action on SET Report encouraged anti-social elements to supply illicit liquor resulting into more than 30 deaths recently,” Rapria had alleged before the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hooch-deaths-high-court-seeks-reply-on-plea-from-haryana-punjab-cbi/story-TH9uDaRiQpsWzmLQa4qW4I.html

On November 24, the employees in a letter to the UT adviser rejected the two fresh proposals of the administration for two housing proposals – a seven-storey project and another seven and 11-storey project – which were discussed in a meeting chaired by UT adviser Manoj Parida with employees’ representatives on November 17. Around 4,000 flats were to be built in Sectors 52, 53 and 56 by the Chandigarh Housing Board for government employees as part of a scheme launched in 2008. The project comprised 252 three BHK apartments with servant quarters, 168 two BHK with servant quarters, 3,066 oneBHK and 444 single-room flats. A draw of lots was held in 2010, in which 3,930 employees among 7,827 applicants were selected. They had then deposited around ₹57 crore with the Chandigarh Housing Board under the scheme. However, the project ran into rough weather as UT could not make available requisite land for the purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mha-to-decide-on-ut-employees-housing-plan-giving-refund-admn-to-hc/story-5ganLbOViLTfJmI2B1bmrN.html
26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Police handled situation with great restraint: Haryana DGP||Director general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava on Thursday said farmers marching towards the Capital had resorted to stone pelting, damaged private and police vehicles and injured several police personnel.Yadava said field units had tried to prevent farmers coming from Punjab from entering Haryana in a restrained manner at the district border points and had set up barriers to stop movement. However, the agitating farmers damaged the police barricades and proceeded ahead. “Acting with restraint, the police did not use force on the agitating farmers. On the contrary, the farmers took an aggressive stand and tried to disturb the law and order by pelting stones at the police in many places. Not only were a number of police personnel injured but police and private vehicles were also damaged,” he said. In view of the ‘Delhi Chalo’ march call by the farmers’ organisations, Haryana Police advised citizens to avoid travelling to Delhi on National Highway No 10 (Hisar-Rohtak-Delhi) and National Highway 44 (Ambala-Panipat-Delhi). The DGP said that the general public will be inconvenienced on the routes leading to Delhi, especially between Panipat-Karnal, Karnal-Kurukshetra and Kurukshetra-Ambala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/police-handled-situation-with-great-restraint-haryana-dgp/story-P1PfjRlo7jfCjDd2534yvN.html
26-11-2020||City||Illegal construction: No notices issued against over 15,000 buildings, admit Ludhiana MC ATPs||At the time of uproar over illegal constructions in the city by councillors and other individuals, Ludhiana municipal corporation’s (MC’s) assistant town planners (ATPs) have admitted that there are 15,000 to 16,000 buildings in the city to which, the inspectors have failed to issue notices. This revelation came to the fore during the ongoing inquiry marked by the municipal commissioner to MC additional commissioner Rishipal Singh into the illegal buildings. In the month of July, Punjab local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra had directed the authorities to conduct a comparative inquiry to find out the illegal constructions by comparing the new connections issued by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) and the building plans sanctioned by the civic body during the period between 2016 and 2019.The inquiry was marked following a complaint submitted by RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal. Sabharal had alleged that the MC suffered a revenue loss of around ₹50 crore due to its failure to take against the illegal constructions. The building branch of the civic body has now submitted a report with Rishipal Singh wherein ATPs of all the four zones of MC have stated that there are at least 15,000 structures in the city against which, no notices have been issued by the building inspectors. A list of building inspectors who failed to perform their duty has also been attached.One of the officials, on the condition of anonymity, said there might be a bigger number of buildings with compoundable violations (which can be regularised). “But the MC still needs to issue notices/challans against them to recover composition fee,” he added. Municipal town planner Surinder Singh Bindra said, “The ATPs have mentioned that there are 15,000 to 16,000 buildings against which no notices/challans have been issued in the past. The report has now been sent to MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal and additional commissioner Rishipal Singh for further action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-construction-no-notices-issued-against-over-15-000-buildings-admit-ludhiana-mc-atps/story-FZsT6Kww0fFOPeFAVJZKGL.html
26-11-2020||City||Passengers bear the brunt of suspended bus services||As the Punjab Roadways and PRTC employees’ union went on a strike to extend their support to the farmers and trade unions, passengers at city’s Amar Shaheed Sukhdev Interstate Bus Terminal were left a harried lot on Thursday. While the bus stand wore a deserted look as it was closed by the protesting union members, chaos prevailed outside the ISBT from where private bus operators picked passengers. As per officials, at least 1,200 interstate and inter-district buses depart from the Ludhiana bus stand on a daily basis, of which more than 700 belong to PRTC and Punjab Roadways. Only eight PRTC and roadways buses departed from the stand on Thursday before the protest started at 9am. Many private bus operators also suspended the services due to low footfall in comparison to normal days as many people were aware of the strike by the roadways employees. A resident of Sirhind, Sunita, who had come to meet her relatives in Ludhiana on Wednesday, was stuck at the bus stand with her son as she could not find any bus for her journey back home. “We were not aware of the strike and reached the bus stand around noon. The staff here told us about the strike and asked us to board a private bus from outside. It has been two hours, but we have yet to find any bus for Sirhind. A private operator asked us to wait for another half an hour at the stand and here we are,” she added. A labourer from Pathankot, Harinder, said, “On our way to Bihar, I, along with my two brothers, reached here last evening and thought that we will get a bus in the morning. However, the union announced a strike. Private buses are also not available. We have been told that the bus services will start from Friday morning, so we are stuck at the bus stand.” ISBT supervisor Jasvir Singh Sahota said, “Only eight buses could depart from the bus stand on Thursday due to the strike. The roadways suffered a loss of around ₹8 lakh due to the strike. But the situation will return to normal Friday onwards.” Meanwhile, union members said the strike was part of the statewide protest in support of farmers and trade unions. District president of Punbus Contractual Employees’ Union, Shamsher Singh, said, “Apart from the strike which was observed on Thursday, the union will also launch an agitation against the private transport mafia on December 2 at the bus stand. A protest march will be held against the state government, transport mafia and corrupt officials of transport department.” Bikers extend support to farmers in Mandi AhmedgarhA group of 20 Ludhiana-based bikers also extended support to the protesting farmers by participating in their protest at Lehra toll Plaza in Mandi Ahmedgarh.One of the bikers, Sukhkaran Gill, said, “Our aim was to apprise the farmers that urban population of the state is standing by their side in this agitation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/passengers-bear-the-brunt-of-suspended-bus-services/story-3cjsSqGglj2Rqs7UohDCtN.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi man escapes ‘scolding’ of wife to work elsewhere as driver for 19 months||Afraid of his wife who often scolded him for drinking, a 35-year-old Delhi man left his job with a private firm and began working as a driver in Haryana’s Mewat at a much lesser salary for 19 months -- a period in which his wife knocked on the court’s doors and his friend was subjected to a polygraph test to know if he had anything to do with the disappearance.On Tuesday, the man who was reluctant to return home, was reunited with his wife by Delhi Police’s crime branch, which traced him. “Thursday happened to be his 10th marriage anniversary,” said Monika Bhardwaj, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch). “We have got the man and his wife counselled so that he doesn’t run away from home again,” Bhardwaj added. Until April last year, the man lived with his wife and a son who was eight months back then. He worked for a paint firm and drew a salary of Rs 25,000.On the morning of April 12 last year, he left his home for work in Noida but did not return. A missing complaint was filed in Noida, but no headway was made. The DCP said that the man’s wife suspected his close friend was behind his disappearance. As it turned out, one of the last calls made by the missing man was to this friend, asking him to hand over R10,000 to one of his relatives. “He had told the friend that he would return the money if he remained alive,” said the DCP. In any case, the missing man remained untraced and his wife knocked the doors of the Delhi High Court earlier this year. “She filed a writ petition to seek a habeas corpus for production of her husband,” the DCP said. On October 15, the court asked the Delhi Police’s crime branch to submit a status report on the investigation carried out so far. The police registered a first information report of kidnapping and then focused their attention to his friend who was accused of having a hand in his disappearance. “The friend was subjected to a polygraph test, which revealed he had nothing to do with the disappearance,” the DCP said. The police questioned his parents, relatives and friends and took their call detail records (CDRs) for an analysis. The missing man’s CDR too was collected, but the call records for the relevant time frame couldn’t be collected since more than a year had passed. “But Noida Police had taken out his CDR back then. We used that to make a shortlist and identify one person to whom he had made a call using his number,” said the DCP. Soon, the police team landed at a construction site in Mewat where the missing man was learnt to be working as a labourer. “It turned out that the man was mainly employed as a driver at the construction site, albeit at much lower pay. He just wanted to be away from his wife,” said the DCP. It took the Delhi Police a lot of convincing to bring him back to Delhi. “We have done our to ensure he doesn’t run away again,” Bhardwaj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-man-escapes-scolding-of-wife-to-work-elsewhere-as-driver-for-19-months/story-1YfHMAZWi3EG8BB9wbpw8O.html

26-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi assembly panel summons EDMC commissioner over Ghazipur landfill fire||A day after a major fire at Ghazipur landfill site in east Delhi raged for over 17 hours, the Delhi assembly’s environment committee summoned East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) commissioner to appear before it on Friday in order to ascertain the reasons for the “poor waste management by the EDMC; the continued garbage dumping at the landfill; and the cause of the fire”. The fire at Ghazipur landfill started around 9.55pm on Tuesday and raged for over 17 hours till the firefighters managed to douse the high-leaping flames completely.The committee, headed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Atishi, will hold a meeting on Friday to deliberate over the issue, followed by a visit to the landfill site to take stock of the situation. “The air quality in Delhi has improved over the past five or six days -- mainly because farm fires have reduced in neighbouring states. However, a dreadful fire broke out at the garbage mountain in Ghazipur, due to which the entire east Delhi and nearby places were engulfed in smoke,” Atishi said. She added, “The meeting on November 27, Friday, has been called to know the reason behind the poor waste management of the EDMC, why garbage continues to be dumped at the landfill site, and to ascertain the person(s) responsible for the fire at the site.” “It is important to answer these questions and stringent action must be taken against the authorities responsible,” Atishi said.  With adverse weather conditions -- low wind speed and falling temperature -- already at play, Delhi’s air quality on Tuesday plummeted to severe category once again on Thursday. The Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) was 413, on a scale of 0 to 500, on Thursday. Any reading between 400 and 500 is considered “severe” and such air is harmful to humans.Meanwhile, the AAP on Thursday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led EDMC of mismanagement of the Ghazipur landfill and demanded a probe by lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal into the fire incident. The BJP termed the accusations “frivolous”. “CM Arvind Kejriwal’s government and the AAP together are standing with the people of Delhi in reducing pollution, but the BJP is troubling residents by causing pollution. The BJP is responsible for the fire at Ghazipur landfill. A high-level investigation should be ordered and the municipal commissioner should elaborate on the cause of the fire. The AAP wants the L-G to intervene and order a probe,” said AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj on Thursday. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Fire at landfill sites is common and AAP is levelling frivolous charges. Ghazipur landfill site workers and the fire brigade worked hard to control the fire within two hours. Yesterday’s pollution in Delhi is the result of the overall poor performance of the Kejriwal government in controlling pollution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-assembly-panel-summons-edmc-commissioner-over-ghazipur-landfill-fire/story-tAv6famA2gsUCCqiQjeQvI.html
26-11-2020||Noida||Noida authority sets up night shelter with fewer beds to prevent spread of Covid-19||With the winter season setting in, the Noida authority has set up a night shelter at the Noida Stadium in Sector 21A. This time, however, the authority is taking extra precautions, keeping in mind Covid-19 protocols. Due to the pandemic, the holding capacity of the shelter has been reduced from 70 in 2019 to 37 this year in a bid to ensure social distancing among the inmates of the shelter, said officials. Every year, the solitary night shelter of the city is set up near gate number five of the Noida Stadium. Active from 7pm to 7am every day, and being operational for the past two days, the shelter will have all the usual facilities such as bedding, blankets, toilets and a fire, along with arrangements to prevent the spread of Covid-19. “There are 37 bedding facilities, separate for men and women, with separate toilets. What’s different this year is that the health department teams will sanitise the facility twice a day, including the blankets. Further, prior to the entrance, temperature will be checked and their hands and feet of those who seek shelter will be sanitised,” said Rahul Sharma, senior manager, Noida authority. He added that only a few occupants, all men, have started seeking shelter at the facility, since it opened in November 22. “There are a fewer number of occupants for night shelters in Noida this year. However, their numbers might increase as the winter progresses. Last year too, the average maximum capacity of the shelter reached nearly 18 inmates. The number would increase as the winter peaks or during fog. In many cases, the occupants are drunkards or addicts, who are picked up and dropped off by the police at the shelter,” said Sharma. According to the officials, the authority also sets up a small timber fire at the shelter every year to keep the inates warm. “Right now, we have not started the campfire here, but it will be started soon as the temperature drops,” added Sharma. According to the shelter’s entry register, only three people stayed at the camp on the first day of the opening of the shelter on November 22. This has increased to eight people by November 25. One such inmate named Muhammad Talib shared his experience. He said that many labourers are getting to know about the shelter from word-of-mouth publicity. “The stay was fine and social distancing protocols were followed. The caretaker of the shelter took our temperature using a thermal scanner and asked us to sanitise our hands. I have been staying at the facility for the past three days and have informed some of my friends, who joined me today,” said Muhammad Talib, a labourer from Hapur district. “The number of people have increased a little, but there is still ample space in the camp. So I am not worried to lose my spot at night, at least for now,” said Tarun Kumar, another labourer from Hapur. Asked what if the number of people who need shelter increases with a further drop in temperature, officials said that they have made alternate arrangements. “Another night shelter is being set up in Sector 135 and it will stay on the stand-by till required. It will be used in case the number of people increases. Social distancing will be maintained and clean blankets and bedding will be provided,” said a senior official, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-sets-up-night-shelter-with-fewer-beds-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-19/story-PK4Oa2XSN7a9jcpzqGrivO.html

It took me half an hour to cross the Chilla (Noida-Mayur Vihar) border. There were barricades set up on both Delhi and Noida side and there was a lot of policemen on the ground checking vehicles,” said Sadhna Gupta, a Noida resident, who was going to Mayur Vihar phase 3 for work around 11am.Noida police said they had also deployed PAC forces at border areas of DND and Chilla.“There wasn’t any major farmer movement in our district. However, we were on high alert and additional police force had been deployed at the border areas till evening as a precautionary measure. The traffic was slow due to vehicular checking, but there were no law and order concerns as such,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Rajesh S.A group of nearly 30 farmers from the Bhartiya Kisan Union was stopped at Pari Chowk, while they were trying to get to Delhi.“We assembled at the zero point and before we could start moving to Delhi, we were detained and taken to the DCP’s office. We were told that we will not be allowed to proceed and were asked to give a memorandum of our demands to the officials,” said Rajkumar Roopwas, tehsil president, BKU.Police personnel said that the farmers were not booked.“We did not permit the group to go to Delhi and police was on high alert during the day. We will also stay vigilant tomorrow,” said additional DCP, zone 3, Vishal Pandey.In additional to the farmer movement, a nationwide general strike had also been called for on Thursday by trade unions. Banks in the district remained closed but there were no rallies or unlawful gatherings in the city.“It was peaceful. A group of nearly 20-25 people came to the sector 6 office to hand over a memorandum of demands. But there were no protests or rallies leading to any law and order situation. There was extensive patrolling throughout the day and police teams remained on alert,” said Rajesh S.In Ghaziabad, the police had made elaborate arrangement and there was heavy presence of personnel and administration officers at UP-Gate border with Delhi, where commuters faced traffic snarls from about 11am till the traffic situation eased back to normal around 2.30pm. Commuters said that traffic police had allowed movement of vehicles through the Hindon river canal overbridge at NH-9, but no traffic was allowed to descend to the surface road below the UP-Gate area. “Many commuters used the overbridge to move to Delhi and similar traffic snarls were witnessed on the other side of the border due to barricading by the Delhi traffic police. Below the UP-Gate flyover, the Ghaziabad traffic police had put up barricades for checks, which resulted in delay of about 25-30 minutes ,” said Kuldeep Saxena, resident of Shakti Khand, Indirapuram. A group of about 25-30 farmers in the afternoon tried to move to UP Gate but were stopped by police at Mohan Nagar. The traffic police officials said that checking points were also setup on the Hindon elevated road to scan vehicles for movement of farmers. “There was no movement of farmers at UP Gate and proper checks and barricading were put in place. No traffic was allowed to come down below the UPGate flyover where barricading was put up. So, it resulted in traffic snarls. But traffic was regularised by 2.30pm. There was no untoward incidents reported,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/barricades-additional-checks-make-traffic-crawl-in-border-areas/story-H8dP21lu0Fg88iYELAYWgK.html
26-11-2020||Noida||Winds improve air quality, mercury set to fall in Noida, Ghaziabad||Noida, Ghaziabad managed to get out of ‘severe’ category of air, as winds picked up from Thursday afternoon and improved the air quality by dispersing much of the local pollutants. According to weather analysts, while the wind directions changed from easterly to north-westerly on Thursday, the air quality is expected to improve as instances of stubble burning in neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana had dropped. According to the IMD, the change in the winds direction will however lead to drop in temperature in the next two days. On Thursday, the air quality of Noida was ‘very poor’, while that of Ghaziabad and Greater Noida was poor. “The wind speed on Thursday increased a little and reached 10 kmph throughout the day. Since the number of stubble burning incidents have almost stopped in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, the winds are no longer carrying any pollutants along and the speed is enough to ventilate local emissions,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. He added that north-westerly winds, entering the region via Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, will however pull the mercury down by two to three degrees Celsius over the next two days. According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Thursday was 301 against 414 a day earlier and 301 on Monday. The AQI of Greater Noida was 296 against 394 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 289 against 444 on Wednesday. An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered ‘poor’, that between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very poor’ and anything above 400 is considered ‘severe’. The major pollutant PM2.5 also dropped drastically. PM2.5 level for past 24-hours in Noida was recorded at 170.20 microgrammes per cubic metre, against 243.94 microgrammes per cubic metre a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 164.01 microgrammes per cubic metre against 250.9 microgrammes per cubic metre a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Ghaziabad was 178.85 microgrammes per cubic metre against 331.23 microgrammes per cubic metre a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 microgrammes per cubic metre. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI is likely to improve in coming days. “Winds are forecasted to pick up and improve the ventilation condition for the next two days. The AQI is forecasted to improve,” SAFAR said in a statement on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/winds-improve-air-quality-mercury-set-to-fall-in-noida-ghaziabad/story-nCqOJnUCBdyJe6K4tijGVL.html
26-11-2020||Noida||About 22.1% found positive for antibodies in UP’s sero survey||Ghaziabad: Around 22.1% of the 16,000-odd people tested in 11 districts of the state during September’s serological survey showed prevalence of antibodies against the Sars-Cov-2 virus, UP government officials said on Thursday. The 11 districts where the survey was conducted included Ghaziabad, from where blood samples of about 1,440 persons was taken. The five-day drive to collect the blood samples as part of the sero survey was initiated on September 4 and samples from 45 different areas was collected in Ghaziabad. The samples were sent to Lucknow for testing. “The survey in 11 districts of the state was carried out and about 16,000 samples were taken and tested at King George’s Medical University for detection of antibodies. These were the districts that had a high number of cases. The results revealed that about 22.1% of the samples were having presence of antibodies,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). The officials, however, did not reveal the district-wise percentage.This was the first sero survey in Ghaziabad, which has an officially estimated population of about 44 lakh. A serological survey checks for an immune response against the coronavirus in the form of antibodies in the blood of a random sample of the population. It can help establish how far the disease had spread and how many people fought the virus without showing symptoms. District health department officials said if the results are extrapolated over a population of about 44 lakh, it would mean that about 972,400 persons were exposed to Covid-19 infection in Ghaziabad. “If the 22.1% results are extrapolated over the entire population of the district, the results would mean about every fifth person got exposed to infection some way or the other and remained asymptomatic. Besides, they got recovered on their own and were not aware of the infection,” said an officer from the district health department. The experts said the results would mean that the remaining 77.9% of the sample size is yet to be exposed to the virus. “The 22.1% positive rate of the sample would mean that the rest of the persons are still not exposed. In case of any second wave, it would mean that the rest can still contract infection. So, utmost precautions are needed. If for instance, we assume that 22.1% of population got exposed, then we arrive at a figure of 9.72 lakh (in case of Ghaziabad). If the total present cases are less than this figure, it would mean that the remaining are still not under the net,” said Dr Lalit Kant, the former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). Dr VB Jindal, former president of the Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad chapter, said if a large number of people are still not under the net of testing, it is time that utmost precaution is observed. “If the total testing is about 5.3 lakh at present, and the district has about 22,000 cases so far, the sero survey results would indicate that we have large number of people who remained asymptomatic and are yet to be tested. It is a good sign. But such people can pass on the infection to others. So, it is of utmost importance that all precautions are strictly observed,” he, added. Dr Vikasendu Agarwal, the state surveillance officer, said they would not extrapolate the result over the entire population of the state as people only in 11 districts were sampled. “These 11 districts were those which had a high rate of infection. So, the results of the sero survey are on expected lines and only indicative. The results are an indication of the prevalence of antibodies but it is good sign that it has not spread largely. Also, we have not seen any indication of a second wave so far in the state as our daily cases are still in range of about 2,000-3,000 per day and testing has not gone down,” he, said. “We were expecting a surge in cases during the festival season but at present we do not have large clusters where infection is prevalent. We conducted targeted sampling before and after festivals but the positivity is very less. However, we are mapping localities that have high number of cases and targeted sampling will be taken up,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/about-22-1-found-positive-for-antibodies-in-up-s-sero-survey/story-pirjTbKgKYyI65hRon3Y5K.html
26-11-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad municipal corporation chalks 10 revised routes for e-bus project||The Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation has finalised 10 new routes for the intracity travel as part of its e-bus project, under which the city has been approved a fleet of 50 low-floor and air-conditioned electric buses. The officials said that the new routes will also connect the neighbouring city of Noida and will prove to be beneficial for the commuters of Ghaziabad and its neighbourhood. The proposal for the new routes has now been sent to the traffic police department for feedback. The officials privy to the matter said the suggestions forwarded by the traffic police will be incorporated and the proposal will be sent to the state government for approval. The e-bus project was given clearance by the UP state cabinet in October last year. At that time, the state cabinet approved the operation of about 700 e-buses in 14 cities, including Ghaziabad. “We have finalised 10 new routes and the proposal for the same will be forwarded to the traffic police for inputs. Once their inputs are incorporated, we will send the proposal to the state officials. The earlier routes had connecting points to Dadri and Pilkhuwa, which we have not been included now, as we want to cater to as many routes in the city as possible,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. The corporation in December last year chalked out six new routes, which have now been revised to 10 new routes. “We have already provided land for the depot. Once the routes are finalised, we will chalk out the points for charging stations. These will be allotted at the roadside while keeping in mind that regular traffic is not hampered. One e-bus has the capacity to travel about 200 kilometres once fully charged,” he added. The proposal includes routes from Surya Nagar to Indirapuram and further to Noida City Centre, Govindpuram to UP-Gate on NH-9, Shalimar Garden to Ghaziabad Railway Station, Vijay Nagar to Noida City Centre, Anand Vihar border to Mohan Nagar and further up to ALT Centre, Raj Nagar and Dilshad Garden to Mohan Nagar and further to Old Bus Stand and Govindpuram, and Mohan Nagar to Raj Nagar Extension, which will extend to NH-9. The maintenance depot for the e-bus project is proposed to be developed over an area of about 25,000 square metres for which land has been provided in Akbarpur-Behrampur located near the Ghaziabad-Greater Noida Link Road. “The depot is scheduled for completion by March 31. We issued a tender but only one bidder responded. So, we are in process of issuing fresh tenders. Once the bids arrive, our headquarters will take a call,” said Umesh Shukla, project manager from the Construction & Design Services, a unit of UP Jal Nigam, which has been given the task to develop the depot. The entire project of the construction of the charging station/maintenance depot is estimated at ₹10 crore. The project was scheduled to be completed by October but got delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier in August 2019, the department of heavy industries had sanctioned 5,595 e-buses across 64 cities while 600 of these were approved for 11 cities of Uttar Pradesh, including 50 buses for Ghaziabad. The approval was made under the Phase 2 of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India scheme in order to push for cleaner mobility in public transportation. The buses have been proposed to ply for about 4 billion kilometres during their contract period and are expected to cumulatively save about 1.2 billion litres of fuel over the contract period, which will, in turn, save approximately 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-municipal-corporation-chalks-10-revised-routes-for-e-bus-project/story-jZeEWVyjMfBtzCpS4pEWsO.html

Noida chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari, who was present in the meeting, assured the company of taking up all these issues in its upcoming board meeting to find out a solution so that IKEA can start work on the project that is expected to attract total investment of Rs 5,000 crore. The project is planned to be set up in Sector 51 along the Aqua Line and Delhi Metro’s Blue Line. The authority had in October, 2019, allotted 40,000 square metres of commercial land at a cost of Rs 700 crore.“IKEA paid Rs 350 crore land cost so far and delayed the remaining payment, inviting a penalty of at least Rs 30 crore as per rules. The IKEA put forth their issues during the meeting in Lucknow and we assured them of addressing their grievances. We will take up the matter in our upcoming board meeting and do the needful as per rules,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority.According to the authority, IKEA had stopped the remaining payment because a 300-metre walkway connecting Delhi Metro’s Blue Line with Noida Metro’s Aqua Line’s sector 51 Metro station was constructed on parts of the land allotted for its project. Now the authority has agreed to shift the walkway and provide the entire land to IKEA. After allotment, the authority and IKEA did not execute the sub-lease deed of the land. The land is located at the Sector 71/51 Metro interchange along the 30km Noida-Greater Noida Metro link. “Now after the board meeting, the authority will ask IKEA to start payment and get the lease-deed done to start work at the site. IKEA will invest Rs 5,000 crore in this project and generate jobs. Therefore, the authority will help them as per rules,” Maheshwari said. IKEA, a Swedish company founded in 1943, is a global design and lifestyle brand leader with a secretive business model that could transform India’s home décor market with its contemporary product lineup.“IKEA has long term commitment for India. Delhi/NCR is one of our biggest and most important markets. We are in talks with the government and relevant authorities for purchasing land in Noida. It is a big project with large investments, and we are still in the process to resolve all aspects to conclude the transaction. As a responsible company, it is important for us to do things the right way for which we are prepared to invest more time if required,” said IKEA’s spokesperson.He added, “It is IKEA’s vision to meet 100 million people in India in the coming years. We are entering the markets with an omnichannel approach to be more affordable, accessible and sustainable for the many customers. As a modern home furnishings retailer, IKEA will bring best practices from our 75+ years of experience, create employment opportunities, provide skill & competence and increase manufacturing, thereby creating a positive impact on the State, society and the many people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ikea-may-soon-start-work-on-noida-project-as-land-issues-resolved/story-9vBfYB62MUKE0vdIgFlLLM.html

26-11-2020||City||Ludhiana: Anganwadi workers launch Jail Bharo Andolan to protest pre-primary classes in govt schools||Up in arms against pre-primary classes started in state-run schools, over 250 Anganwadi workers and helpers from different blocks of the district staged a Jail Bharo Andolan outside the mini secretariat on Thursday to register their strong protest against the Centre.The members of the Anganwadi Mulazam Union (CITU), marched towards the deputy commissioner’s office at 1.30 pm and sloganeered against the Centre.Workers have been demanding that the government should start pre-primary classes in anganwadis as there is already an existing setup there.The workers raised slogans against the government by holding placards and demanded to stop enrolling children in pre-primary classes in government schools.While the cops refused to arrest them and asked the protesters to lift the protest, to which the workers moved towards Bharat Nagar chowk to join the ongoing agitation by the trade unions.Punjab Anganwadi Mulazam Union general secretary Subhash Rani said, “Our main demand is that the children between 3-6 years should be sent to Anganwadi centers and not to government schools for pre-primary classes. The workers and helpers can take better care of these children.” Cornering the state government, Rani alleged that it has not included its 40% share in the wages which were to be increased as per the announcement made by the Centre in September 2018. The union members also demanded that a helper be deployed to support the worker deployed at every mini-Anganwadi centre. In 2018, the central government had announced to increase Rs 1,500, Rs 1,250 and Rs 750 in the salaries of workers, mini workers, and helpers, respectively. The wages were increased from October 2018 with 60:40 share of the central and the state government in the hike, she said. “But the notification that we received stated that the state government has increased only Rs 900 for workers by not contributing its share. The mini workers and helpers are also getting lesser money compared to the amount announced by the Centre,” she said, adding that there are 54,000 Anganwadi workers in the state and all of them are staging protests in their respective districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-anganwadi-workers-launch-jail-bharo-andolan-to-protest-pre-primary-classes-in-govt-schools/story-HPSLmulA6V5h4Zudk6POtK.html
26-11-2020||Noida||Shahberi land case: Allahabad high court directs state government to refund stamp duty paid by developer||After the quashing of land acquisition of Shahberi and the adjoining villages, the Allahabad high court has now directed the state government to refund the stamp duty money paid by the builder, instead of asking it to approach the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) for the same. Earlier, although the state government had accepted the request to refund stamp duty, it had directed the builder to approach GNIDA for the refund. The high court has directed the state government to reconsider its order as the stamp duty money was deposited in the government’s account and not that of the authority. The petitioner, SJP Infracon Limited, was allotted a plot in Sector 16B in Greater Noida West, measuring 1.98 lakh square metres. A registered lease deed was executed and the stamp duty amounting to ₹12.70 crore was paid on the registration of the lease deed.On May 12, 2011, the Allahabad high court quashed the land acquisition proceedings with respect to village Shahberi and other adjoining areas.The petitioner relinquished that portion of plot, which stood reverted to the tenure holders.Thereafter the petitioner requested the authorities to return such stamp duty, which was paid by it for the execution of lease of the land.On February 28, 2019, state government accepted petitioner’s claim for a refund of stamp duty after a deduction of 10%. On May 28, 201, the petitioner was directed to approach GNIDA for a refund of the amount.The counsel for the petitioner stated the stamp duty was paid to the state government and, once the authorities have accepted the petitioner’s claim for a refund under the Indian Stamp Act, the consequential action of the refund of the stamp duty would be warranted at the level of the state government and not at the level of the Greater Noida Authority.The high court observed that the amount received against stamp duty has been credited to the account of state and the claim for a refund of the same would, therefore, be required to be addressed by the state and not by the development authority. The order of the state government directing the petitioner to approach Greater Noida Development Authority is prima facie not found to be in accordance with law.“The Allahabad High Court bench comprising justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra has directed the principal secretary of the stamps and registration department concerned to revisit the issue in light of the above observation and to file his personal affidavit justifying his order. The order was passed a fortnight ago,” advocate for the petitioner RA Aggarwal said on Thursday. Dr SK Tripathi, assistant inspector general (stamps),said, “The order of the high court order will be implemented, and a decision will be taken at the state level.” He admitted that amount is paid in state government’s account. He also said as per registration act, stamp duty once paid cannot be refunded. The state government can take a policy decision for refund on an individual case-to-case basis. The state government has to decide from where refund amount has to be given.Greater Nodia authority official, on condition of anonymity, said that the stamp duty amount was deposited to the state government’s account and authority has no role in this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/shahberi-land-case-allahabad-high-court-directs-state-government-to-refund-stamp-duty-paid-by-developer/story-plxL2veU7gKdrKtZ81TTcJ.html

As per the officials of the city railway station, around 243 migrants left the city on Thursday in Amritsar-Jaynagar Express, known as Shaheed Express at 3.30 pm. On Wednesday, around 112 passengers had boarded the train for Bihar and other parts of Uttar Pradesh from the city station. Neha, who along with her family was going to attend the marriage function of her cousin in Gorakhpur, said that due to farmers’ agitation, she had cancelled her plan to attend the event. However, with trains resuming after nearly two months, she would be able to attend the event on November 30. Sanjeev Kumar, 38, from Chappra in Bihar, who works as a construction contractor here, said that his family in Bihar is organising a religious event and he was not sure whether he would be able to attend it. He said that he could not visit his hometown Sapra during the Chhath festival on November 20.

26-11-2020||Gurugram||City air improves marginally thanks to westerly winds||The air quality in the city marginally improved on Thursday, recording 286 (poor) on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This was down from Wednesday’s reading of 299, which was just short of “very poor” air quality. While wind speeds throughout the day remained slow, the direction of the wind was favourable in preventing pollutants from accumulating. The reduction in farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, too, have helped keeping pollution levels down, experts said. “On Thursday afternoon, we were receiving westerly winds with speeds of about 8kmph. There had been some accumulation of pollutants during the night and morning. However, they were dispersed again by the afternoon. The number of farm fires has also reduced considerably this past week and the amount of smog being blown into Delhi-NCR from the west has reduced, helping the situation,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist.Officials also attributed the improvement in air quality to a reduction in farm fires. “There have been hardly any images of stubble burning detected over the past day. The impact is quite noticeable. In fact, across other cities, the improvement in air quality has been even clearer as they are more impacted by the wind direction,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, pointing out that air quality in neighbouring Delhi improved from 413 (severe) to 302 (very poor) on Thursday. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “The air quality is likely to remain in the poor category on 27.11.2020... The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from Northwest direction of Delhi with wind speed up to 08-14 kmph, mainly clear sky and mist in the morning.” The minimum temperature of Gurugram settled at 11 degrees Celsius on Thursday — same as the previous day. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 24 degrees Celsius on Thursday, two degrees higher than Wednesday’s reading. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature will hover around 24 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature is expected to stay at 13 degrees on Friday. As per the weekly forecast, clear skies will prevail on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-air-improves-marginally-thanks-to-westerly-winds/story-1rrqfpvevtZkMc2QU8diTO.html
26-11-2020||Gurugram||Residents of 14 villages petition NHAI for access to Delhi-Vadodara expressway||Residents of nearly 14 villages from Palwal, Nuh and Sohna have petitioned the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), requesting the authority to grant them access to the DND-Delhi Vadodara Expressway (NH148NA) through the creation of a cloverleaf interchange.Local residents said, despite over 3,00,000 people living in the vicinity, they have not been given any access to the under-construction DND-Delhi Vadodara Exressway. Residents allege that the access will give them an easy access to commute easily towards Delhi and Jaipur and will boost the economic activity of the region, thereby generating employment. Sarpanches of around 14 villages, including Hajipur, Manuwad, Dehlaka, Bilhaka, Johlaka, Paroli, Kiranki Khedli, Khuntpuri, Chandpur and Dilani, said that they have written to union transport ministry and the NHAI, for giving them access to the expressway. Prem Mohan Gaur, a resident of village Hajipur, who is spearheading the demand for the interchange, said that access to highway will help the farmers commute easily and also help them to take their produce to different markets in the neighbouring states. “The people can go to urban areas for jobs. It is a travesty that on a highway, which is built on their land, the farmers don’t have access. We have approached the ministry, local leaders and apprised them of the issue,” said Gaur, adding that they are planning to file a writ petition in the Supreme Court to get relief in the matter. Locals also said that they will launch a protest movement and hold demonstrations and, if the need arises, hold sit-ins at the site if the interchange was not created to give access to locals. Villagers also pointed out that a railway station is also coming up at Silani as per the orbital railway plan of the Haryana government and the interchange at the highway will boost access to both road and rail infrastructure. “Although the government talks of multimodal transport but when things happen on the ground, the plans are never implemented,” said a local resident on the condition of anonymity. NHAI officials said that work on this stretch has already been awarded and work shall start from March. Manoj Bansal, project director, Faridabad, said that the decision to provide an interchange has to be taken by the headquarters. “The proposal will be considered on the basis of cost, technical feasibility, and the decision has to be taken by NHAI headquarters. The cost of the interchange would be minimum ₹20 to ₹25 crore,” said Bansal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-of-14-villages-petition-nhai-for-access-to-delhi-vadodara-expressway/story-ZxVokessohjag171e5XLqN.html
26-11-2020||Gurugram||Biodiversity registers to be completed by March 2021||Delayed on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, the finalisation of the people’s biodiversity registers (PBRs) in Haryana is now expected to be completed by March next year, officials said on Thursday. While initial drafts of at least 6,400 registers — at a panchayat, zila parishad and municipal corporation levels — have already been prepared, the drafts lacked quality and will need to be improved through more fieldwork, current and former officials of the Haryana State Biodiversity Board said.PBRs are techno-legal documents that will serve as a repository of information on plants, animals and crops, along with traditional knowledge of their place in local ecosystems. Earlier this year, prior to the coronavirus outbreak, Gurugram had constituted an expert committee to oversee the creation of PBRs across the district, in compliance with the Biodiversity Act, 2002. This committee was to train and supervise the work of 203 biodiversity management committees (BMCs) that have been formed at the panchayat level, as well as one that has been constituted by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). A total of 6,437 such BMCs have been formed across various urban local bodies in Haryana.“All the BMCs, including those in Gurugram, have submitted preliminary drafts of their PBRs. However, we found that the information contained in most of these registers is what was already in the public domain. Our technical support groups, which include NGOs and advocacy organisations who have been engaged to assist local bodies, were unable to properly train the local BMCs or do any extensive fieldwork due to the Covid-19 lockdown,” said Gulshan Ahuja, former chairman of the state biodiversity board.Corroborating this development, VS Tanwar, secretary, Haryana State Biodiversity Board, said, “Covid has made it hard for the TSGs to really do their work on ground, so naturally, the preliminary drafts of the biodiversity registers are also lacking in quality and rigour. The state biodiversity board has also undergone an administrative reshuffling in June, in light of Covid, and work had been halted. But we have now taken up the work again earlier this month and the TSGs and BMCs are expected to finalise their PBRs within the ongoing financial year.” PRBs are meant to rely on field inspections, as well as secondary data to be obtained from ‘line departments’, including the forest and wildlife, agriculture, fisheries, horticulture and animal husbandry departments.A forest department official, who was involved in the creation of Gururgam’s PBR, said on the condition of anonymity, “The draft PBR mainly consisted of data from earlier wildlife and cattle censuses, forest surveys and so on. But the main goal of the PBR is to work with locals and understand their relationship with their biodiversity. Those surveys are yet to be completed. A third-party has been tasked with conducting the research, which will be taken up this winter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/biodiversity-registers-to-be-completed-by-march-2021/story-15A1Nrbo6usGBxAGbKqByO.html
26-11-2020||Gurugram||Health department banking on mass testing to contain Covid-19 spread||The district health department, in an effort to bring down the positivity rate and flatten the curve, has planned to conduct more than 10,000 tests on Saturday. Complying with the Haryana health department directive to conduct mass testing across the state, to control the active transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus, health officials have decided to go for aggressive-targeted testing in hot spots having a test positivity rate between 6% and 10% or higher. The plan is to hold about 50 testing camps in a single day across the district, health department officials said. On November 21, the department had administered 10,200 Covid-19 tests, the highest number of tests done in a single day so far. Considering the district’s capacity to test 16,000 samples in a day, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that testing will be more than 10,000 this time. The department is likely to hold a meeting with private labs and hospitals on Friday.The state health department on Wednesday announced that more than 50,000 samples will be collected across 22 districts, almost 30% more than their daily sample collection, on November 28. Districts have been told to coordinate with the state health authorities and private labs to conduct mass testing, which will comprise 80% of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, to gauge the exact prevalence of infection. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, state health department, on Wednesday said that sampling would be targeted as well as random to detect new cases, while ensuring their timely isolation. HOT SPOTS WITH HIGH TEST POSITIVITY RATEFor targeted testing, the Gurugram health department has identified some of the critical areas having test positivity rate — total positives out of the samples collected — higher than 10%. This includes five urban areas – Patel Nagar, Laxman Vihar, Om Nagar, Feroz Gandhi Colony and two rural blocks — Sohna and Daulatabad. The ideal positivity rate should be less than 5%, as per the World Health Organisation guidelines.“About 50 testing camps are likely to take place on Saturday, including over 15 routine camps that are conducted every day under different UPHCs. On the mass testing day, camps will be held in all 33 UPHCs and rural PHCs along with 16 additional camps in critical areas,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Other areas having heavy footfall, like Sadar Bazar and wholesale grain and vegetable market at Khandsa will also be covered. In these areas, the test positivity rate is higher than 6%, with high chances of having super-spreaders of the virus. Yadav, on Thursday, held a meeting with the Gurugram Police, seeking assistance to carry out Covid-19 tests at Khandsa and the entry/exit points of Sadar Bazar. Testing in these areas will start from 6am. A senior official of the Gurugram Police, who attended the meeting, said, “The department has directed local teams to encourage shopkeepers in every nook and corner of the market to get tested. With the help of the market association and councillors, we have floated the idea that if all shopkeepers get tested, the market can claim to establish a benchmark in Covid-19 testing.” USE OF DRONESOfficials are also planning to use drones to create awareness about the testing camps and to keep an eye on the congested lanes. The plan is, however, yet to be approved by the Gurugram Police, said Yadav. Random testing will also be held at border areas, keeping in mind farmers’ movement.Officials are, however, still working on the availability of manpower and the timely delivery of test results to make mass testing a fruitful exercise in controlling the transmission. Mass testing is helpful if test results are delivered within 48-72 hours to control the spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-banking-on-mass-testing-to-contain-covid-19-spread/story-H6Cm0F4EwwJdvO7aQnS4uN.html
26-11-2020||Gurugram||Activists stopped from entering city, protests low key||The protest against farm laws remained low-key in the district in comparison to areas bordering Punjab, as a majority of the protesters mobilised by farmers’ unions in south Haryana were prevented from reaching Panchgaon and Gurugram by the police. Activists, including Swaraj India conveyor Yogendra Yadav, and farm leaders were detained at Panchgaon, Nuh and Palwal by the police on Thursday morning, while they tried to move towards Delhi to participate in the ‘Dilli Chalo’ protest. The protesters are demanding that the Central government revert the implementation of three agriculture sector laws, which, they allege, will harm the interests of farmers across the country. Around 800 police personnel were deployed by the district police to keep the protest under control and prevent any untoward incident. Yadav, who has been spearheading the farmers’ movement in south Haryana, was detained along with 20 persons, including farm leaders and protesters at Rathiwas village — about 40 kilometres from Delhi-Gurugram border on the expressway — where the protesters were slated to gather for their march to the capital. Yadav said farmers were stopped from moving at Kapriwas, Panchgaon, Sohna, Sirhaul, Bargujar and Iffco Chowk. Addressing the media at Rathiwas, Yadav said that it was ironic that farmers in the country were being stopped from going to Delhi on Constitution Day to protest against the farm laws brought in by the Central government. “Farmers across the country are united and they stand with protesters from Punjab who are spearheading the movement to save agriculture. Repressive measures are being taken in Punjab, Uttarakhand and particularly Haryana to deprive farmers of their constitutional rights,” said Yadav. Yadav also alleged that many farm leaders and protesters who were on their way to Delhi from Rewari, Narnaul, Mewat and Rajasthan were prevented from entering the district.Meanwhile, in Gurugram, a large number of trade unions and worker organisations carried out a protest march in support of farmers. The workers gathered at Civil Lines in the morning and marched up to Mahavir Chowk, near Sadar Bazar. Trade union leaders have alleged that the farm laws passed by government are “anti-farmer” and demanded that they be rolled back. They also said that it was imperative for the government to stop privatisation of public sector units, ensure minimum wages are given to workers and relief is given to construction workers. The union leaders said that preventing farmers from reaching Delhi was wrong on the part of the government and they should have been allowed to protest peacefully. Apart from trade unions of private companies, several organisations of government employees, including the Haryana Karamchari Mahasangh and Haryana PWD mechanical workers’ union, carried out a symbolic protest in support of farmers and workers. Raj Singh Baghel, a union leader, said that farm laws and those pertaining to labour passed by Central government were against the interest of the public and would harm them in future as they were pro-business. Most of the stakeholders and farm leaders said that they would continue the protest till these laws are rolled back. “These protests can continue indefinitely if the Central government does not relent,” said Yadav. Subash Boken, public relations officer, Gurugram Police, said that situation remained peaceful across the district and police was deployed at all borders to maintain normalcy. “The situation was normal and few persons including Yogendra Yadav were detained for sometime and released later,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/activists-stopped-from-entering-city-protests-low-key/story-TEgoy3wIfwTvuRGs1EGgHN.html
26-11-2020||Gurugram||Border sealing rumours cause border rush, jam||Rumours that the borders with Delhi are set to be sealed off caused a traffic jam at the Delhi-Gurugram border on the expressway around 2pm on Thursday, as Delhi residents working in the city rushed to their residences. Heavy barricading by the Delhi Police to check entry of visitors led to a long wait for commuters, with traffic remaining stuck for over an hour and a half.Heavy police deployment was visible in Gurugram along the highway, up to Bilaspur and at all border points, and major crossings in the city. Traffic movement was slowed down across the city due to checks and barricades set up at major points places. The traffic situation is likely to remain the same on Friday as police officials said that deployment and barricading at the border will continue.Jayant Baruah, who works in Gurugram, said that he rushed back after hearing news reports that borders of Delhi with other states will be sealed in the afternoon. “Not only me, but many colleagues also rushed back, but were caught at the Sirhaul toll plaza due to traffic jam. I spent around an hour to enter Delhi as a barricade set up on Delhi side held up vehicular movement,” said Baruah.Due to the traffic jam at the border point, many commuters decided to turn back near Udyog Vihar and exit the highway, but this compounded the problems on arterial roads and several vehicles got stuck. The situation eased only around 5pm, said police.Dipen Sharma, a commuter travelling to Delhi, said that the police should have a look at the vehicles at Sirhaul border and also use CCTV cameras to verify if they were local commuters or protesters. “The police officials just have to walk through the traffic to know that there are no protesters,” said Sharma.Traffic flow was at Sirhaul toll plaza was affected earlier in the day, especially on the carriageway leading to Delhi, as Delhi Police carried out a strict checking to prevent movement of farmers, who are protesting against the three farm laws passed by Central government.Traffic movement remained slow in other parts of the city as well due to barricading and checks set up by Gurugram police.A senior police official said that four deputy commissioners of police, nine assistant commissioners of police and 18 inspectors were deployed along with 800 police personnel at Kapriwas, Panchgaon, Sirhaul, Sohna, Bargujar, KMP Expressway and other strategic points to ensure normalcy in the city. “The deployment will remain the same on Friday to keep the situation under control. Congestion at Sirhaul toll plaza was witnessed for some time due to checking at border, but the situation became normal after some time,” said Subash Boken, public relations officer, Gurugram Police.Boken said that commuters should plan their travel as per the advisory issued by the district administration to ensure they do not face problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/border-sealing-rumours-cause-border-rush-jam/story-VN25sWFsR2dVdjmHSYxThJ.html

26-11-2020||Delhi||Woman accidentally shot in foot by beat constable intervening in parking dispute||A woman was shot in her foot when a beat constable, trying to settle a parking dispute in outer Delhi’s Rohini, fired four rounds to the ground, one of which ricochetted off and hit her.Police said the constable had fired under duress as he was being manhandled by the family that was involved in a parking dispute with an elderly couple late Wednesday. The woman got hit in her toe and had to undergo a surgery, but she is out of danger, said PK Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini). “The injured woman was one of the persons who had attacked the policeman,” said the DCP. Mishra said it all began around 11.45pm on Wednesday when the daughter of a senior citizen couple -- a 73-year-old advocate and his 70-year-old wife -- made a distress call to the police control room as well as to the local beat constable, Punit Sharma, saying her parents’ neighbours were threatening them over a parking dispute. “Their daughter told us that the neighbour had parked his motorcycle in front of their house because of which they could not open their gate. She alleged that the other family was threatening her parents when they were asked to remove the motorcycle,” the DCP said.When Sharma reached the spot, the other family began arguing with him, accused him of being drunk and manhandled him, Mishra said. “They slapped him, caught him by his collar, and tried to snatch his service revolver, mobile phone and car key,” he said. A partial video clip of the incident, recorded by the accused family, purportedly showed them in a heated argument with the policeman and them accusing him of being drunk. The policeman can be seen and heard telling them that he was not drunk and was ready to undergo a medical examination. The video further showed him getting into his car and the family accusing him of pointing a loaded pistol at them -- they can be heard challenging him to shoot.The DCP said when the family continued to manhandle him, he took out his service revolver, kept his hand behind his back and fired four rounds into the ground. “One bullet ricochetted and hit the women in her foot,” Mishra said. The officer said that the woman was rushed to Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital and later to RML Hospital for a surgery. “We have registered a case against the attackers under Indian Penal Code sections pertaining to assault on a public servant, preventing a public servant from performing his duty, causing hurt, theft (of the pistol and other items) and causing hurt during theft,” Mishra said. No case has been registered against the police constable for opening fire. “He was responding to a distress call by senior citizens and was only performing his duty,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-accidentally-shot-in-foot-by-beat-constable-intervening-in-parking-dispute/story-NWK8QZToK1VxoCoPfSFYYN.html
26-11-2020||City||Trade unions’ protest makes Bharat Nagar Chowk out of bounds for commuters||As a part of the nationwide strike announced against the BJP-led central government, various trade unions organised a protest march outside the mini secretariat on Thursday and blocked the Bharat Nagar Chowk — one of the prime intersections of the city — for over two hours. Heavy police force was deployed at the spot.Traffic jams were witnessed on Ferozepur Road, bus stand road and adjoining areas despite diversion of vehicles through internal lanes. Raising slogans in support of farmers and labourers, the protesters slammed the central government for “moving against the constitution by bringing in anti-farmer and anti-labour laws”. Union leaders said they stood united with farmers in this fight against the Centre and would continue the agitation till the time the central government does not roll back the “anti-labour and anti-farmer laws”.Swaran Singh from INTUC, Ramesh Ratan from AITUC, Paramjeet Singh from CTU, and Sukhwinder Singh Lotey from CITU said that government was working to benefit the corporate houses. In that course, they said, “anti-farmer and anti-labour bills” have been approved in the parliament without any debate. Their other demands included cash transfer of ₹7,500 to all non-income tax paying families, 10kg free ration per person per month to all needy people, expansion of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to provide 200 days of work in a year in rural areas at enhanced wages, withdrawal of the “draconian circular” on “forced” premature retirement of government and PSU employees and provision of pension to all. The protesters rued that the BJP-ruled states, including UP, Karnataka and Gujarat, have made “draconian” changes in the labour laws which will make the workers “slaves”.Members of different labour unions also held a protest at Samrala chowk. Commuters a harried lotThough the police channelised the traffic movement from Bharat Nagar Chowk through slip roads, big rush was witnessed on Ferozepur Road, bus stand road, Fountain Chowk, railway station road and areas in and around.Commuters raised hue and cry over the traffic jams and lamented the detours they had to take for reaching their destination. One such commuter, Girish Verma, said, “I was on my way to Jawahar Nagar camp from Mall Road, but the police stopped me at the Bharat Nagar Chowk due to the protest. I had to take a detour to reach at bus stand road and it took me 20 minutes to reach the other side of Bharat Nagar Chowk. The protesters should not block the roads as it results in public harassment. The protests should be done in a peaceful manner.”Another commuter, Harpreet Singh, said, “These protesters enjoy the support of the state government, but the public is bearing the brunt of their actions. Blocking the movement of traffic is not a solution for any problem and the protesters should understand this. It is always the public which suffers in the end.” Members of Punjab Bank Employees’ Federation also observed a strike and staged a protest against the Centre.They stated that all public-sector banks were closed on Thursday and banking transactions of around ₹500 crore were hit in Ludhiana only.Federation’s Ludhiana secretary Naresh Gaur said that the Union government was working to privatise the public banks and they will not allow this. “Any process of merger, consolidation or amalgamation results in reduction of staff. In fact, it is one of the purpose of mergers to ensure a lean organisation and achieve reduction in labour cost to show more profit,” he claimed. Some of their major demands included strict action against loan defaulters and recovery of NPAs.“We are also against the anti-labour and anti-farmer laws passed by the Union government,” Gaur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trade-unions-protest-makes-bharat-nagar-chowk-out-of-bounds-for-commuters/story-jKrS6ktXf402uvuFJVlRqN.html

26-11-2020||Jaipur||‘Rajasthan man buys, worships banned notes to improve luck on tantric’s advice’: Police||A man arrested by Rajasthan’s Nagaur police with demonetised currency notes revealed during interrogation that a tantric had told him that his financial condition will improve if he worships the banned notes before selling them, officials said on Thursday. Hanuman Singh, 35, was arrested with demonetised notes of Rs 5.20 lakh under section 151 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), said Devi Lal Bishnoi, station house officer of Kuchera police station in Nagaur. “Acting on a tip-off, Singh, a native of Huanumagarh district, was arrested with banned notes of Rs 5.20 lakh, all with face value of Rs 500, on Tuesday night. During questioning, Singh confessed that he had purchased the old currency from a man, Nain Singh Rajpurohit, on Tuesday morning by paying him Rs 1 lakh,” said a police official from Nagaur who didn’t want to be named. The accused told the police that Rajpurohit was also under financial crisis since the demonetisation announced in 2016. “Prima facie investigation reveals that the banned currency was unaccounted that’s why Rajpuorhit had possessed them. After buying the banned notes, the accused was planning to sell them to his relatives in Punjab at Rs 1.50 lakh,” the official said. “Before selling them to relatives at Rs 1.50 lakh, Singh, on the advice of a tantric, was supposed to worship the old notes, so that his financial condition improves. For that Singh had come to a holy place in Nagaur,” the police official added.

They have started a probe,” Bishnoi said. The central government had rendered Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes invalid on the midnight of November 8-9 in 2016. The government called the decision a crackdown on black money, terror financing and counterfeit currency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-man-buys-worships-banned-notes-to-improve-luck-on-tantric-s-advice-police/story-j7z8CuNNDmq0qQ7je1XTbI.html
26-11-2020||Chandigarh||PU to admit NET, JRF, SLET and GATE qualified candidates for MPhil, PhD||With the scrapping of the entrance examination for MPhil and PhD admissions this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Panjab University (PU) will only enrol those candidates who have cleared the UGC National Eligibility Test (NET) including the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF), State Level Eligibility Test (SLET) and the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE).Besides this, candidates qualifying other recognised tests for national level scholarship or fellowship conducted at all India level on behalf of national institutions will also be considered.

26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana Cong slams CM for using water cannons, tear gas to stop farmers march||Haryana Congress leaders on Thursday slammed the Manohar Lal Khattar government for using water cannons and tear gas on farmers moving towards Delhi against the Centre’s farm laws, saying the BJP-led dispensation should exercise restraint and hold talks with the protesters.Senior Congress leader and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the farmers have the right to protest peacefully and by using water cannons and tear gas to stop their march, the state government is trying to muzzle their voice. Speaking to reporters in Rohtak, Hooda said the government should not try to suppress the voice of the farmers. “Water cannons were used against the farmers... The government should exercise restraint and hold talks with the agitating farmers and try to find a solution,” Hooda, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly, said. When the three farm laws were being framed, I had said that the Centre should bring a fourth law making it a punishable offence if anyone makes a crop purchase below the Minimum Support Price (MSP), he said. Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja alleged that the Centre has tried to break the backbone of the farmers by enacting the three “anti-agriculture black laws”. “Now, when the farmers are peacefully protesting against these laws, they are not being allowed to do that either. The government has always tricked the farmers and today the government is not even giving them a chance to speak,” she said. “On the contrary, they are putting them in jails, using water cannons and tear gas on them,” she added. In a statement, Selja, a former Union Minister, also said the government should rollback the “black farm laws” and frame a law guaranteeing MSP for farmers. Congress chief spokesperson and former Haryana Minister Randeep Singh Surjewala said the farmers had “full support” of the party. Earlier, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had lashed out at the BJP-led government in Haryana, saying the use of “brute force” against the farmers is “totally undemocratic and unconstitutional”.Haryana had earlier announced to completely seal its borders with Punjab to prevent farmers from entering the state for their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march against the Centre’s farm laws on November 26-27. The Haryana Police on Thursday used water cannons and tear gas to disperse farmers from Punjab at the Shambhu inter-state border who allegedly broke through police barricades to enter Haryana. Protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre’s farm laws would pave the way for dismantling of the MSP, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates. The government has maintained that farm laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-cong-slams-cm-for-using-water-cannons-tear-gas-to-stop-farmers-march/story-NwF563r6cV1CH5GeMpUfkO.html

Had I been aware that the situation is so bad, I wouldn’t have come. Even cab drivers are apprehensive in crossing the border because of the heavy police presence,” he said.Likewise, Sanjeev Kumar Jha, 49, a visiting faculty and industrial consultant, who travels everyday for work from Dwarka, Sector 9, to Noida, Sector 15, by Delhi Metro, said, “Today, I had to get down at New Ashok Nagar and then take an e-rickshaw to reach my office in Sector 5. Initially, when we boarded the train, it was supposed to go till Noida, Sector 16, but on the way, the operators announced that it will terminate at New Ashok Nagar only.”Another passenger who had to reach Noida, Sector 168, said when he got off at Mayur Vihar Extension Metro station, he booked two cabs but both cancelled the rides as no one wanted to cross border. “It was only after being stranded for almost an hour that I managed to persuade a cab driver to drop me,” said the commuter who said he works at the UNICEF, but did not wish to be named.E-rickshaw drivers and auto drivers plying near Metro stations, however, got lucky as they had plenty of passengers willing to go to Noida, many of these getting off at New Ashok Nagar and Mayur Vihar Metro stations. Ratan Singh , a 40-year-old auto driver, said the first drop he got in the morning was at Noida, Sector 18. “We don’t get such passengers because Metro has direct connectivity. Some even got far off drops. There’s a lot of police at the border. They stop us, look inside before letting us go. Some vehicles are stopped to enquire where they’re going and who are they ferrying,” Singh added.“From 2 pm onwards, Metro services were available from Delhi towards the NCR sections.

26-11-2020||Pune||Number of prisoners released on parole in Maha falls, furlough figure rises||The latest Maharashtra state prisons department annual report shows that that the number of convicts let off on parole has gone down by almost half the number released in 2016-2017. In 2018-2019, only 520 inmates were released on parole compared to 719 in 2017-2018 and 1,028 in 2018-2019. The Yerawada Central Jail houses 5,563 prisoners, the highest number of inmates in state prisons. The occupancy rate in state prisons has surged to 148% as compared to previous year. The jail report states that the number of prisoners released on parole has dived post strengthening of rules. It states that 20 prisoners released on furlough have not returned during the past one year. The convicts are given two types of leaves — parole and furlough. Furlough is a right of the prisoner. On completion of a requisite tenure in the jail, a prisoner is entitled to be released on furlough subject to condition of demonstrated good behaviour before the prison authorities. However, granting parole is within the powers of the divisional commissioner of the region where the jail is located. During the last three years, the number of prisoners released on parole has dwindled. During 2015-2016, 1,502 convicts were granted parole while in 2018-2019, only 502 prisoners were released on parole. During the current year, five prisoners released on parole escaped, while in 2015, the figure was 84. Out of 1,757 prisoners released on furlough during 2017-2018, 21 escaped. During 2018-2019, 2,707 prisoners were released on furlough and 15 of them had escaped. The observation of director general (prisons department) mentioned in the report states: “The prisons and corrections department is playing an important role in rehabilitation of a convict by inculcating good habits through corrective measures. The department through its officers is taking collective efforts in ensuring that a conducive environment for the welfare and growth of prisoners is created inside the prisons across the state. At the same time, professional work is being done to main the highest jail standards as mandated by the government”.

26-11-2020||Pune||Central and state properties in city owe Rs 91 crore in taxes to Pune civic body||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) which has been under severe cash crunch due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is now urging citizens to pay up their pending property tax. The civic body has also offered lucrative schemes of up to 80 per cent off on the penalty on pending property tax under the ‘Abhay Yojana’. However, this scheme is not applicable to government institutes which owe about Rs 91 crore in property tax to the civic body. As per the PMC’s property tax department, the central government has about 92 properties in the city for which it pays taxes to the civic body and these properties owe about 23.85 crore. Of these for the current year 2020-2021, the PMC received about 2.44 crore from 47 properties while about 60 properties still owe Rs 21.41 crore in property tax to the civic body. However, the state government owes Rs 76.32 crores in property tax from its 330 properties. Of them, only 180 properties have paid a total of Rs 6 crore in taxes and Rs 70.32 crore is pending from over 200 properties for the ongoing year. According to Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner in charge of the department, the PMC property tax department has been asked to take action even against government departments who have defaulted on the property tax. “We have even asked them to take action including sealing the properties but only depending on the department. However, due to ongoing elections we will be taking decisions based on the department for example if it is a law enforcement department then we would probably give more extension,” Khemnar said. Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the PMC is considering the situation of the finances of a department and then taking necessary action. “Similarly ,for private properties too if a firm has been a regular tax payer but could not pay taxes this year due to the pandmice then we would be considerate about that too,” Khemnar said. The civic body has sealed about 55 properties for defaulting property tax payment as the due tax amount surpassed more than Rs 50 lakh. Most of the properties sealed are commercial properties from across the city. The PMC collected Rs 1077.82 crore in property tax from over 6.70 lakh taxpayers in Pune from April 1, 2020. Last year, the PMC managed to collect only Rs 976 crore in the same duration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/central-and-state-properties-in-city-owe-rs-91-crore-in-taxes-to-pune-civic-body/story-ZWoEfpTNoKWp3QmT7ivcEN.html

Traffic was diverted on the Ramba-Indri-Karnal link road. “We have been stuck for the past 15 hours and don’t know how long will it take for us to get moving,” said Satpal Singh, a truck driver headed for Ludhiana. Heavy vehicles, including army convoys, were stuck on the highway near Ambala Cantonment. The vehicles were seen lined up for several kilometres. Ambala superintendent of police Rajesh Kalia said that diversion of heavy vehicles could have led to traffic jams in towns, hence they were lined up along the highway. PROTEST COINCIDES WITH CONSTITUTION DAY Farmers have given the Delhi Chalo call to coincide with Constitution Day to protest the Centre’s new farm laws. While the government says the three laws will do away with middlemen, enabling farmers to sell their produce in the commercial markets, protesters fear that this could lead to the government not buying produce at guaranteed prices, thereby disrupting their timely payments.

The group wrote to environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday, pointing out that the community had lost its age-old source of income due to projects by JNPT that had destroyed their livelihood.“Such plans cannot be tolerated,” said Dilip Koli, a fisherman leader, adding that they had been fishing in inter-tidal waters for decades but instead of protecting the community’s rights, state agencies such as JNPT had put a stop to fishing within their jurisdiction owing to reclamation of natural areas.Also Read: Maharashtra:131 bird nests removed before tree transplantation for Metro Line 4, 4A“This led to a substantial drop in even our fish catch, rendering many fishers penniless even during this difficult pandemic phase,” said Tukaram Koli, another fisher, calling it a violation of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.In October 2013, fisherman Ramdas Koli had moved the National Green Tribunal (NGT), western bench, against development projects by JNPT that affected the livelihood of residents of Uran, Hanuman Koliwada, Gavhan, and Belpada, with 1,630 families in the area dependent on fishing. In March 2015, in a landmark order, NGT directed JNPT, City Industrial Development Corporation and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation to pay Rs95.19 crore to the 1,630 families within three months. However, the order was stayed by the Supreme Court after state agencies challenged it.“Even the National Human Rights Commission had ruled in our favour after NGT did, yet we continue to suffer,” said Koli.The memorandum to Thackeray further said that while farmers were given titles under 7/12 extract (land extract maintained by the revenue department), fishermen do not get any such title. “Thus we do not get any compensation and lose our source of income when the government acquires land,” said Koli.According to the Raigad district administration, several cases of mangrove destruction were reported between November 2019 and January 2020 from areas under JNPT’s jurisdiction. Around 7,000 mangrove trees (across a 6ha patch with approximately 5,500 trees and a 1.2ha patch with 1,500 trees) were found dried up and destroyed for JNPT’s 4th container terminal project. In November 2019, contractors appointed by JNPT paid a fine of Rs1 lakh to the district administration for destroying 4,550 mangrove trees across 4.5ha for the same project, followed by a case filed before the Panvel court. Subsequently, another 4,000-odd mangrove trees were found destroyed during the expansion of a road leading up to the terminal.Panvel district officer Dattatreya Navale said, “This year we have not received such serious complaints. Complaints received are either false or repetitive from previous years. The plan for the mangrove park is a welcome idea as it will provide security to eco-sensitive zones.”JNPT said they were not aware of the fishing community’s submissions. “The park is purely for the purpose of mangrove protection, safety, and citizen awareness. We remain a socially conscious organisation, committed to the environment, community, stakeholders, employees and the industry,” said a JNPT official, requesting anonymity.Environment group NatConnect Foundation, which had campaigned for the mangrove park, said restoration was key. “JNPT should open blockages, restore tidal water flow, and remove illegally dumped debris at natural areas. They must start respecting mangroves and wetlands and pay for losses so far,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation.“The mangrove park is reprehensible since it is planned on illegally landfilled coastal regulation zone (CRZ-I) areas,” said Nandkumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishthan, the environment group highlighting the fishing community’s demand. “The mangrove ecosystem is unique and it doesn’t require any human intervention. It can protect itself if just left alone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-uran-fishermen-allege-indiscriminate-destruction-of-mangroves-oppose-jnpt-s-park-proposal/story-bxwKyEpe0U4L9qyzKskSnO.html

Haryana has sealed its borders with Punjab to prevent farmers from entering the state for their Delhi Chalo march against the Centre’s farm laws. “Why is @mlkhattar govt in Haryana stopping the farmers from moving to Delhi? The tyrannical use of brute force against peacefully protesting farmers is totally undemocratic & unconstitutional,” said Singh in a tweet. He said farmers have been peacefully protesting in Punjab against the farm laws for two months. “Why is Haryana govt provoking them by resorting to force? Don’t the farmers have the right to pass peacefully through a public highway?” Singh asked.

Let them pass @mlkhattar ji, don’t push them to the brink. Let them take their voice to Delhi peacefully,” Singh said. He appealed to the BJP to direct the Manohar Lal Khattar led government not to indulge in “strong arm tactics” against the farmers. “Urge @BJP4India to direct their state governments not to indulge in such strong-arm tactics against the farmers. The hands that feed the nation deserve to be held, not pushed aside,” he said. Protesting farmers have expressed fear that the Centre’s farm laws would pave the way for dismantling the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The government has maintained that farm laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amarinder-slams-khattar-for-using-brute-force-against-farmers-marching-towards-delhi/story-jD7MMv0gszcDTNg9HZ1T4I.html

26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana Police use tear gas, water cannons but fail to stop Punjab farmers from entering state||Punjab farmers braved tear gas and water cannons to break through multi-layered barricades put up by Haryana Police at Shambu barrier, bordering Ambala and Patiala districts, on Thursday afternoon and proceeded on their Delhi Chalo march to protest the Centre’s farm laws. The Haryana Police used water cannons to disperse the farmers, who had gathered in large numbers in tractor-trolleys, when they started removing the concrete barricades. But when that did not deter the defiant farmers, they used tear gas. Though it delayed the crossing over, the farmers were determined to continue their march to the national capital. Amid the tension on the inter-state border, the elderly farmers stayed put in the tractor-trolleys, while youngsters bore the brunt of the police action. HARYANA ACTING AT CENTRE’S BEHEST: FARMERS “We are going for a peaceful protest but the police are not allowing us to reach Delhi. The Haryana government must understand that this is not a protest against them but against the central government. The Haryana Government is stopping us at the behest of the Centre,” farmer leader Baldev Singh Nihalgarh said. “We are not opting for only the Shambu barrier, but are targeting all entry points. Some farmers have already entered Haryana by foot. Our aim is to reach Delhi,” he said. The Haryana Police sealed all entry points from Punjab to stop the entry of farmers, who have announced the protest march against the Centre on November 26 and 27. Earlier, farmers at Ajimgarh village on the Kaithal border broke the police barricading and managed to enter Haryana to reach Delhi. Police barricading was in place at Ramnagar on the Gulha-Cheeka border and on the Patiala-Pehowa road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-police-use-tear-gas-water-cannons-but-fail-to-stop-punjab-farmers-from-entering-state/story-5qDxkJ5U0NWZTFIUvX0UfO.html

All she has got all these years are assurances from successive state governments.Rotawan, who has recently taken admission to BA in Chetana College, Bandra, and who wants to join the civil services eventually, was barely nine at the time of the attacks. During the attack at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, a bullet passed through her right thigh when two Laskar-e-Taiba operatives from Pakistan opened indiscriminate fire on passengers and also hurled grenades. Rotawan, who was to travel with her parents to Pune to see, fell unconscious shortly after receiving the gunshot. She was taken to Saint Georges Hospital where she was operated upon six times over one-and-half months, and was bed-ridden for about six months thereafter. She said several representatives of the central and state government have visited their room and have assured them of residential accommodation under economically weaker section quota but nothing came of it, forcing the now 21-year-old to move Bombay high court recently, stating that her family could no longer afford to pay rent of room in chawl at Subash Nagar in Bandra (East). In her petition, she claimed that government officials had also assured her financial assistance for her education and medical treatment. A division bench of the court directed the Maharashtra government to consider Rotawan’s plea for a home but the family is yet to hear from the government. “I am glad we won in the high court but it has been over one month and we have not heard from the government,” said Rotawan who was her way to her native place in Pune with her father and elder brother. “In the first hearing itself, the high court passed the order for a flat for Rotawan,” said Utsav Bains, Rotawan’s lawyer. According to Bains, after the order, they have sent the concerned documents to the office of chief secretary of Maharashtra, Sanjay Kumar however they are still waiting to hear from the government. When contacted Sanjay Kumar asked HT to contact the relief and rehabilitation department.

26-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Glistening ‘blue tide’ along Mumbai, Sindhudurg coasts||The tide that produces a fluorescent blue hue—bioluminescence—made an appearance on Tuesday night on Juhu beach in Mumbai and Devgad beach in Sindhudurg along Maharashtra’s coastline. Bioluminescence has been an annual occurrence along the west coast since 2016 during the months of November and December. The natural phenomenon is characterised by the emission of light produced by phytoplanktons (microscopic marine plants), commonly known as dinoflagellates. The light is produced through a series of chemical reactions due to luciferase (oxidative enzymes) protein, according to E Vivekanandan, consultant and scientist, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. “This occurrence could be taking place along several areas on the west coast during this time of the year,” he said.Also Read: Maharashtra: Panje tidal water blockade lifted, strengthens demand for bird sanctuary Marine scientists said one of the main factors for its occurrence could be eutrophication – the reduction of oxygen in the water – which makes the phytoplanktons very dominant. Marine researcher Shaunak Modi, director, Coastal Conservation Foundation spotted the occurrence at 11.45pm Tuesday at Juhu Koliwada, where locals are known to describe the fluorescent occurrence as ‘neeli machli’ (blue fish). The occurrence was spotted off Devgad beach by one Sanit Acharekar. “This is a recurring phenomenon which is caused by a bioluminescent plankton called Noctiluca scintillans, commonly known as sea sparkle. While smaller blooms may be harmless, slow moving larger blooms may cause severe hypoxic conditions that result in fish die-offs in an area,” said Modi. Bioluminescence has been observed across India’s coast as well as the coastline of many beaches in the world such as Maldives, Vietnam, Indonesia, USA, Australia and many other countries. Similar to the blue tide, there exists another such phenomenon called red tide or harmful algal blooms that emits red light. It is rare occurrence caused when colonies of algae—simple plants that live in the sea and freshwater—grow out of control while producing toxic or harmful effects on people, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, and birds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-glistening-blue-tide-along-mumbai-sindhudurg-coasts/story-3FbyACRgFuLcsubcG1rkbI.html
26-11-2020||Kolkata||Bengal govt makes attendance must in offices to oppose Bharat Bandh||The Mamata Banerjee administration in West Bengal has made it mandatory for government officials to attend office on Thursday to foil the Bharat Bandh called by trade unions. The government has warned that if any official is absent from office, it would be treated as dies non or break in service. This is, however, not the first time that the government has taken such a stand since the Trinamool Congress-led government came to power in 2011. The nationwide strike has been jointly called by various central unions protesting against various policies of the government. More than 250 million workers from across the country are expected to participate in the Bandh. Also Read: Bharat Bandh today: Transport, banking services likely to be affected“The Bengal government has its own views on some of the issues for which the strike has been called. The government is also against the Bandh culture. Hence it has been decided that all government offices will remain open and attendance of employees will be mandatory,” said a top official in the government. The strike began at 6am Thursday. Railway services in both Howrah and Sealdah divisions were disrupted as Bandh supporters blocked trains at multiple places and stations across the state. Banana leaves were hurled on overheard wires to disrupt power so that trains couldn’t operate. There were very few taxis at the pre-paid taxis stands and passengers had to wait to get one. In some places, such as Garia in south Kolkata, there were reports that protesters hurled bricks at government buses, breaking the windshields, in a bid to stop them. In some places, bus passengers were forced to get down by Bandh supporters. “The bus passengers were never forced. We urged them to get down. This is a people’s Bandh,” said a Bandh supporter, requesting anonymity. In the morning, Left and Congress supporters took to the streets in Kolkata to back the all-India strike call and blocked arterial roads and busy intersections. There was heavy police deployment to maintain law and order. Heated altercations also broke out between the police and Bandh supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-government-makes-attendance-must-in-offices-to-oppose-bharat-bandh/story-rxGRt9OGoOYEtT79Lf7p7O.html

A police officer said that dumpers loaded with mud and sand have been stationed at Singhu border along with barricades so that no vehicle can barge in forcefully. In September, a group of farmers had managed to reach India Gate with a tractor inside a truck, which they had set afire at Rajpath in protest.On Wednesday, the Delhi Police had turned down all requests by farmer groups and organisations to stage protests in Delhi against the central government’s new farm laws. Singhal had said on Wednesday that various farmer organisations had requested for permission to protest in Delhi on November 26 and 27. Singhal said they had conveyed to the farmers in writing and through various media that the protest is not permitted in view of the latest Delhi Disaster Management Authority guidelines due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.“If despite our appeal they turn up in Delhi, then the required legal action will be taken against them,” the DCP said.Delhi Police even took to social media to make farmers aware of the restrictions and refusal to their requests.In a tweet, Delhi Police said, “Please co-operate with Delhi Police in ensuring no gathering in Delhi amid coronavirus, failing which legal action will be initiated as per law.”In the past, the police have registered hundreds of cases against protesters who took to the streets without permission during the pandemic. They were booked under the Indian Penal Code sections pertaining to disobedience of an order by a public servant, as well as under the Epidemic Diseases Act.Haryana has already sealed its borders with Punjab to prevent farmers from entering the state in response to the march against the centre’s new farm laws that liberalise the agriculture sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dilli-chalo-tight-security-at-delhi-s-borders-after-refusal-of-permission-for-march/story-HXc4Ugxf6MAG7zFLxCv1iK.html

26-11-2020||Chandigarh||On Delhi Chalo call, Haryana farmers set for faceoff with police at Karnal||A day after breaking past police barricades in Ambala and Kurukshetra, Haryana farmers, led by state Bharatiya Kisan Union chief Gurnam Singh Charuni, will resume their Delhi Chalo march against the Centre’s farm laws after a night halt at Samana Bahu village, 25km from Karnal, on Thursday morning. “We will resume the march to Delhi around 10am after breakfast,” BKU media incharge Rakesh Bains said even as farmers geared up in tractor-trolleys and cars with arrangements for food and shelter. He said the farmers were getting support from villagers and nearby gurdwaras were serving langar (at the community kitchen). WILL NOT ALLOW FARMERS TO PROCEED: KARNAL SP The Haryana Police have put up barricades at Karan Lake, 5km from Karnal town, to stop the farmers from proceeding. Karnal superintendent of police Ganga Ram Punia said, “We have put up barricades and will ensure that the farmers don’t cross the barricades.” Police personnel from nearby districts have also been deployed at Karnal. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said that the farmers will not be allowed to cross the barricades.

26-11-2020||Mumbai||12 years since 26/11: Indian Coast Guard set to become 200-vessel strong force||Twelve years since 26/11 terror attacks of 2008, Mumbai’s security apparatus has seen a sea change with Indian Coast Guard standing out as one of the key maritime security agencies. From a meagre 74 vessel to patrol the 7,500 kilometre coastline of India, the force is on its way to become a 200-vessel strong force. In 2017, the Centre approved a Rs31,748-crore, five-year programme to add to the Coast Guard’s resources. “This has seen the Coast Guard fleet of vessels grow 134 ships which are operational. Fifty seven ships are at various stages of construction at different Indian shipyards. The air wing too has increased from 44 aircraft in 2008 to 58,” said a spokesperson from Indian Coast Guard. It has also added another air station at Ratnagiri to effectively patrol the sea. “The air station at Ratnagiri is operational and is likely to be commissioned soon,” said the spokesperson. With a mandate to patrol the sea between 12 nautical miles and 22 nautical miles from the coast, the force has augmented its air and surface fleet to a large extent. From a small posse of 5,000-odd personnel, the strength of the force stands at 12,000 and it plans to add another 8,000 personnel. After 26/11, the Navy was made the nodal agency for 15 central, and state agencies to coordinate coastal security. Four joint operation centres were set up at Mumbai, Visakhapatnam, Kochi and Port Blair. The Navy now forms the first line of defence and is on constant alert monitoring the sea through aerial surveillance and patrol. Sagar Prahari Bal, an agency dedicated to coastal security, has been formed comprising personnel drawn from the Navy. The Sagar Prahari Bal and CISF personnel have undergone training at INS Chilka in Odisha, a premier establishment for the Indian Navy sailors. The Navy has commissioned an unmanned aerial vehicle squadron at Porbandar in Gujarat which monitors infiltration on the western coast. Apart from this, at least one aircraft at each of the Naval air stations remains on alert mode to take off within four minutes and at least one battleship is in alert mode, ready to respond to any situation within 30 minutes. Meanwhile, Mumbai’s internal security too has seen a much-needed upgrade in the form of hi-tech Close Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras being set up and the Mumbai Police getting a state-of-the-art control room. “The monitoring is either general or incident-based, depending on the type of activities. The network of CCTV cameras has also helped in bringing down petty crimes,” said a senior IPS officer. A proposal has also been mooted to set up special target rooms at 35 locations along the coast which will house specially trained marine paramilitary force personnel. “The force will be equipped with night vision, thermal cameras, satellite phones. Also, we have sought a hovercraft, a few rubberised boats for faster movement and additional boats,” said a police office, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/12-years-since-26-11-indian-coast-guard-set-to-become-200-vessel-strong-force/story-P5bASBse6f5trJlTpAhMqN.html
26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers modify plan, to march to Delhi via alternative routes besides Haryana highways||After their Delhi Chalo march to protest the Centre’s farm laws came a cropper due to heavy barricading by Haryana Police on Wednesday, Punjab’s farmer unions have changed their strategy of taking only the highways to the national capital. They plan to enter Haryana through other routes on Thursday morning. While activists of the Bharti Kisan Union Ekta-Ugrahan and Sidhupur factions have been camping on the Punjab-Haryana border at Khanauri and Moonak, respectively, in Sangrur district since Wednesday evening, other farmer unions have changed their plans and decided to head for Delhi from other entry points. Members of the Kirti Kisan Union, BKU Kadian and Rajewal factions plan to assemble at Mastuana Sahib in Sangrur and head for Shambhu border at 11am. “Members of the BKU Ekta-Ugrahan and Sidhupur have already occupied borders in Sangrur so we have decided to march to the Shambhu border in neighbouring Patiala,” said Bhupinder Singh Longowal, a state committee member of the Kirti Kisan Union. Gurmeet Singh Bhattiwal, the district chief of BKU Dakaunda, said that their cadre and other farmer outfits will march to Haryana on the Samana-Chika route from Patiala district. Gobinder Singh, the Sangrur block chief of BKU Ugrahan, said 80 tractor-trailers and 10 buses will head for Khanauri border where farmers will make a determined bid to enter Haryana en route to the national capital.

26-11-2020||Mumbai||Money laundering case: ED arrests Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik’s close aide||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials late on Wednesday night arrested Amit Chandole, a relative and close business associate of Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik, in a money laundering case related to TOPSGRUP, a security service giant owned by Rahul Nanda. This is the first arrest in the case. While ED sources confirmed Chandole’s arrest, the charges on him are still not clear. He will be produced in court on Thursday so that the Central agency can seek his custody for further investigation. Sarnaik, whose promises were raided by the ED on Tuesday, is into real estate and hospitality businesses. ED officials from Delhi and Mumbai had also raided Chandole’s premises in Thane the same day. ED is also likely to question Sarnaik’s son Vihang for a second time on Thursday. Other people linked to Sarnaik’s businesses would also be soon asked to join the probe, ED sources said.Also read | ED raids Shiv Sena MLA’s properties, questions son in money-laundering probe against security firmED had interrogated Vihang for five hours on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Sarnaik had termed ED’s actions as vendetta politics. “The day I moved a privilege motion against Kangana Ranaut and Arnab Goswami, and demanded reopening of the Anvay Naik case, I knew what would happen. I am a Shiv Sainik and a fighter who has reached this far. Uddhavsaheb has made me the spokesperson to put forward the party’s views. Today, they told him [Vihang] your father speaks a lot on Kangana Ranaut and Arnab Goswami. I will continue to speak wherever Mumbai, Maharashtra or its police are maligned. I have done nothing wrong in my business,” he had said, while speaking to a news channel.The central agency suspects that the Sena MLA illegally pumped money into Nanda’s business ventures to move money abroad.TOPSGRUP group chairman and founder Rahul Nanda has denied the allegations and said, “Pratap is an old friend and has not invested a single penny in my business or company ever! He or Sena has nothing to do with Tops! This is absolutely absurd.”ED sources said they suspect there is an illegitimate flow of funds among the companies linked to Sarnaik, his family members and Nanda’s companies and that they want to investigate possible money laundering.ED sources said their probe is based on a complaint registered against TOPS Security, Rahul Nanda and family, at police station on court directions. Company’s former managing director Ramesh Ramkrishna Iyer had approached the court alleging Nanda’s involvement in unlawful activities, massive irregularities in the company, misappropriation of funds to the tune of Rs175 crore and cheating company’s employees, share holders, other government and private organisations with forged documents. The case was recently transferred to the Mumbai police economic offences wing for further investigation.Iyer, who had been the managing director of TOPSGRUP since 2006, said he discovered diversion and misappropriation of funds by Nanda in 2009. Iyer alleged in the complaint (a copy of which is with HT) that in 2008, Nanda bought 51% of London-based The Shield Guarding Company Limited’s shares, for around Rs130 crore. This amount was allegedly taken from ICICI Ventures Limited and private share investors of Everstone Capital. Nanda allegedly inflated the total worth of his net assets since funds worth four times the value of one’s net assets may be sent abroad legally. “The investment companies, despite knowing this, invested in TOPSGRUP,” said Iyer’s complaint, adding that Nanda diverted funds from The Shield and bought properties in London.Iyer also alleged Nanda took loans against subsidiary companies of TOPSGRUP— including Tops Securities UK Limited and Topsgrup Holding BV in the Netherlands — and used the money to buy property in London, which is in violation of loan statutory rules. Nanda did not show the income earned from these properties in his income tax returns in India, said Iyer in his complaint.Iyer also alleged that while providing state government agency MMRDA security services, Nanda cheated the department by not providing them security personnel as decided in the contract, but charging them the full amount. ED suspects that Nanda had political help in grabbing the contract from MMRDA.Another allegation is that Nanda made a bogus balance sheet for the financial year of 2018-19 to use overdraft and cash credit facilities from Allahabad Bank (Prabhadevi branch) and Corporate Bank (Kalina branch). For this, he allegedly changed the statutory auditors, without the approval of shareholders.Iyer also alleged that in 2017, Nanda and his family transferred 66% of their shares in TOPSGRUP to a Mauritius-based Nanda family trust, which is in violation of the Private Securities Agencies (Regulations) Act.Commenting on the ED’s action and the allegations levelled against him Nanda said, “The ED had questioned us about our UK acquisition in 2009 and we have given them proof that everything was done 100% legally. They also questioned me about our trust in Mauritius which again we have answered and told them that this was created legally by lawyers and that there is zero money that is in the Mauritius trust. This was all the mischief played by Ramesh (Iyer), Amar (both top executives of his companies) and the coterie, who complained to the ED and have sent them on a wild goose chase.”Iyer denied Nanda’s counter allegations by saying that his complaint was registered after due verification of facts. Nanda too has made a police complaint against Iyer at the Khar police station some months back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/money-laundering-case-ed-arrests-shiv-sena-mla-pratap-sarnaik-s-close-aide/story-Pd1MgsbhRtzUENbTPFt7WI.html

26-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Simran, the female flâneur||This is how it is. Simran feels most alive when she’s walking on the streets, perhaps somewhere around the historic Jama Masjid in Old Delhi, with her hefty DSLR camera hanging around her neck. There, she looks out for sights that will touch her heart so intensely that she’ll immediately want to capture them in her lens. Very often, clicking is not enough, and she also types down raw thoughts on her phone’s notes. And then she moves on, prepared to embrace more sights, containing more wonders.Simran is a flâneur. And if a female flâneur — a flâneuse, the French say — is not something unusual to come across in the alleys of New York or Paris, this gender specification makes a big difference in a place as hostile to women as Delhi.“The fact that Delhi is unsafe for girls does pop up in my head, but once I’m transported to a place the thought disappears,” says the 20-year old fashion technology student. She’s chatting on WhatsApp video from west Delhi’s Janakpuri, where she lives with her sister and parents. Confined these days mostly within the walls of the apartment, Simran hasn’t been able to hit the streets since the first coronavirus-triggered lockdown began in late March. Until then, she had regularly been going for explorations—sometimes with heritage groups or friends, but mostly alone. Indeed, like most flâneurs, Simran wants the street she is walking to be her only friend as she walks it. When she is by herself, strolling in — say — Matia Mahal Bazar, “I like to click pictures of the place and immediately write what I feel about its vibes, before the moment goes.” Her current camera was a gift to herself, from savings she made on the pocket money her parents would give her. It wasn’t a vanity purchase—the camera is necessary to her, she insists. “The moments I encounter might never have existed before, and the places I capture might not always stay the same.”Simran has been maintaining an Instagram account in which she puts up these pictures, but is reluctant to share it with readers “because I haven’t told Mummy Papa yet of the work I do.” (Oops, by now they will get some idea of their daughter’s pursuits!)Simran’s Janakpuri is far from the Delhi places she loves the most, but “free rides for women in the DTC buses are a perk.”Alas, all that travelling seems like another life. Hopefully, one day soon, the pandemic will fade away and Simran will again be sighted sauntering about the streets of her city, holding her camera. Meanwhile, she agrees to pose with it in her home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-simran-the-female-flaneur/story-tAqvu6YKEnkFcZavBoq7VL.html
26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Boost for DSP as CAT directs Chandigarh admn to consider his case for promotion||The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)’s Chandigarh bench has directed the UT administration to consider DSP Ram Gopal’s case and promote him to a higher post, if found fit.The petitioner, who is currently posted as the deputy superintendent of police (DSP) in the CID wing at Sector 17, had sought promotion to the post of superintendent of police.In the petition, he had prayed for the quashing of the order, dated September 16, 2017, issued by the director general of police (DGP) to the UT Home secretary. It had been stated in the order that there was no vacancy in the rank of SP (non-IPS) in Chandigarh police, meant for promotion from the rank of DSP, and relevant Punjab police rules governing promotion from rank of DSP to SP are pending for adoption.He prayed that he should be promoted from post of DSP to SP against the existing vacancy in the Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB).Ram Gopal’s counsel argued that he is the seniormost DSP in the cadre and being eligible in terms of 1959 Rules as SP/Deputy Commandant in IRB, Chandigarh, has a right of consideration for such promotion from due date and denial of such right is illegal, arbitrary, discriminatory and cannot be sustained in the eyes of law.However, in its reply the UT administration argued that Ram Gopal does not even fulfill all the conditions for promotion. It was submitted that the post of deputy commandant in IRB is not governed by Rules of 1959 as no decision in that connection has yet been taken and the matter is pending for consideration with the competent authority. The applicant has no right of promotion but only consideration if he is eligible therefore.After hearing the arguments, the Tribunal ordered: “This original application merits acceptance and as such is allowed. The impugned order is quashed and set aside.”The Tribunal directed the respondents to consider the applicant’s case for promotion to the higher post in terms of above observations and “if found fit, promote him from due date with all the consequential benefits of arrears of pay and allowance and seniority, within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order,” the order mentioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/boost-for-dsp-as-cat-directs-chandigarh-admn-to-consider-his-case-for-promotion/story-jA4ZbmbGxYzBJc2tLbGwCJ.html

26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC mulls generating funds on its own for renovation of public toilets||The Chandigarh municipal corporation’s ambitious plans of constructing new public toilets and renovating the old ones have hit a roadblock with the UT administration turning down its request for additional dedicated funds.The municipal corporation (MC) is now mulling over generating its own funds for the project, which is estimated to cost the civic body around ₹19.18 crore. This even as it is already struggling to pay the salaries of its employees. In the General House meeting held in June 2019, the MC had decided to construct 27 new public toilets and renovate 236 existing ones. The new toilets are to cost around ₹2 crore, while the cost of renovation of the existing ones is estimated to be around ₹17 crore. Along with providing better utilities to the public, the aim of the project is to create maximum advertisement area on the existing renovated toilets and the new ones so that maximum revenue can be generated. The architectural plans are to be formulated in consultation with the UT urban planning department.“The matter of releasing dedicated funds was taken up with the Chandigarh administration as per the decision of the House but the administration refused, stating paucity of funds,” said an MC official. In a letter to the MC on the issue, the finance and planning officer of the UT administration responded, “The finance department is not in a position to provide additional funds to the tune of ₹19.18 crore for construction of 29 toilets in green belts and renovation of existing 236 toilets in various markets due to the ceiling fixed by the Government of India vide letter dated April 8, 2020.” Now, the MC has mooted the proposal to generate finance required for the project from the municipal funds in place of arranging additional dedicated funds from Chandigarh. The MC General House meet, scheduled for November 27, will take a call on the proposal. Tapping SHGs in villages for running public toiletsFor better operation and maintenance of public toilets in villages, the MC will be roping in self-help groups (SHG) after nod from the MC General House.“Public toilet blocks exist in villages and colonies but these are not being properly maintained. This is due to the reason that the operation, running, and maintenance of existing public toilets in villages and some colonies are not covered under any contractual agreement with any association or SHG. This is resulting in public facing inconvenience,” said a MC official. As per the policy decision in the General House meet of June 2019, the operation and maintenance of public toilet blocks in markets are entrusted with the market welfare associations (MWA) while in green belts, the responsibility lies with the resident welfare associations (RWA). “As in villages and colonies, there are no MWA or RWA, therefore to avoid any further deterioration of public toilets, these will be given to the SHG registered by the National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM) for operation and maintenance. The terms and conditions will be the same as approved for MWA,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-mulls-generating-funds-on-its-own-for-renovation-of-public-toilets/story-tdOoYqWE1sbPR7TvLi6YHJ.html

The agency had seized fours grams of hashish and 17 grams of marijuana and ₹5.50 lakh cash from Anand who is allegedly known as KJ in the drug syndicate. The agency claimed that Anand is a key person and had a network through which he supplied narcotics substance in the film industry. Apart from the seized contraband, NCB had relied on the statement of other accused who confessed that contraband came through Anand. The court, after considering all the aspects, granted bail to Anand on Wednesday. The special court had on Tuesday granted bail to two peddlers Ankush Arneja and Suryadeep Malhotra, who are alleged to be part of the syndicate and are also peddlers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-court-grants-bail-to-accused-held-in-drugs-case/story-tDtaGMr7rChae1eFcjqwXL.html

We will now hold a joint meeting of all the stakeholders of the University, including political parties, PU teachers and syndicate members, in the first week of December to decide the future course of action.”Malwinder Kang, former PUCSC president, who also attended the meeting said that V-C failed to address their concerns.Last week, the leaders had organised a protest march demanding the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-assurance-from-panjab-university-v-c-over-senate-polls-say-former-student-leaders/story-34PTCRY96FIzEjYObEOmqK.html
26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Kotkhai custodial killing: HC grants bail to 6 accused||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday granted bail to six accused in the 2017 Kotkhai custodial killing case.The custodial killing case is an offshoot of the rape and murder of a 16-year-old schoolgirl in Kotkhai area of Shimla district. Initially, the Himachal Police arrested six men in the case, one of whom was later found dead at the Kotkhai Police Station in July 2017. Subsequently, a case of custodial killing was lodged against the cops.After widespread criticism of the police’s handling of the case, it was handed over to the CBI and transferred to Chandigarh in May 2019.Those granted bail are former Kotkhai station house officer (SHO) Rajinder Singh and other former cops Surat Singh, Mohan Lal, Rafiq Ali, Ranjit Streta and Deep Chand. They all are lodged in Model Jail, Chandigarh.They had sought bail on grounds that they had been in custody for more than three years and they were in no position to influence witnesses.It was also argued that then Shimla SSP DW Negi and then DSP Manoj Joshi were already on bail. Former inspector general of police ZH Zaidi was granted bail by the Supreme Court in April 2019. However, the trial court had cancelled the bail in January 2020 after prosecution witness and SP-rank officer Soumya Sambasivan’s statement that she had been pressured by the accused in an attempt to influence the trial.CBI had opposed the bail plea claiming that witness examination was pending and the cops could influence the trial. However, the bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh on Wednesday decided to grant all six persons bail.“The six persons have been given bail by the high court. Certain conditions have been imposed on them so that they are not able to influence the witnesses. Detailed order is awaited,” said CBI’s counsel Sumeet Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kotkhai-custodial-killing-hc-grants-bail-to-6-accused/story-FgiayvP7CMMVZOsoIJDFxJ.html
26-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: ₹2,350-crore GST frauds unearthed, three arrested||The Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (DGGSTI) in three separate operations unearthed fake input tax credit (ITC) frauds amounting to around ₹2,350 crore and arrested three businessmen.ITC is an option that allows taxpayers to claim credit for taxes paid on purchases. Issuance of an invoice without supply of goods or services and wrongfully availing or utilising ITC on a bill/invoice without any supply of goods or services are cognizable and non-bailable offences. A senior DGGSTI official confirmed that the accused were involved in wrongfully availing and utilising, as well as passing on, ITC based on bogus invoices. All three were arrested on Wednesday and have been sent to judicial custody by a city court.In the first operation, GST department officials arrested Sachin Bhoruka, director several firms such as Erman Metals Pvt Ltd, Pioneer Trading Co, Marshal Multiventures (I) Pvt Ltd, Aikya Infraprojects Pvt Ltd, Sanmukh Fab Industries Pvt Ltd and Flyhigh Infraprojects Pvt Ltd. He allegedly availed and utilised bogus ITC amounting to around ₹485 crore as well as having passed on fake ITC amounting to ₹485 Crore.In a parallel investigation, Mahesh Kinger, who is authorised signatory of Blue Sea Commodities Pvt Ltd (now Curzen Infraprojects Pvt Ltd), Blue Sea Commodities and director of Theme Lights Pvt Ltd, was also found to be involved in the fraudulent practice. These firms had availed ineligible ITC amounting to ₹580 crore and had passed on ineligible ITC amounting to ₹579 Crore.In the third operation, officials arrested Deepak Kumar Prajapati, director of Udyog Kiran Ltd. He allegedly had setup an intricate web of over 22 firms that indulged in circular trading for the purpose of artificially inflating their turnover to avail higher bank loans and credit facilities. Probe has revealed that the firms operated by Prajapati have passed on bogus ITC amounting to around ₹126 crore and availed ITC amounting to ₹94 crore, a statement released by DGGSTI stated.Advocate Ravi Hirani, who represented accused Bhoruka and Kinger, said his clients have been made director on paper on remuneration of ₹20,000 per month. “They had no knowledge about availing ITC as it was done by others on their name. They have been used by people for their own gain. They are poor people and are cooperating with the officers by disclosing all facts known to them,” Hirani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-2-350-crore-gst-frauds-unearthed-three-arrested/story-XiQT5d8aaoW3yM0qQZLeZM.html

Decisions regarding the same were taken during a Cabinet meet on November 23. Shimla additional deputy commissioner Apoorv Devgan on Wednesday ordered a weekly closing day for all markets and shops barring grocery stores, shops selling milk, bread, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish and other uncooked food items, chemists, hotels and newspaper vendors.People will no longer be able to eat outside restaurants.

26-11-2020||Mumbai||In the biggest seizure at Mumbai airport this year, DRI nabs foreigner with ₹18-crore cocaine||In the biggest seizure of cocaine this year at the city airport, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) officials have arrested Republic of Guinea national at Mumbai airport while he was smuggling in cocaine worth around ₹18 crore. The accused had concealed the drugs in a false cavity made in the trolley bag. The arrested accused has been identified as Moussa Camara, 34. According to DRI officials, they had received specific intelligence about Camara, who was travelling from Addis Ababa to Mumbai via Dubai, smuggling drugs into the country. Acting on the information, Camara was detained at the airport on Tuesday afternoon when he arrived at the airport.He was frisked and his luggage was examined. While checking his trolley bag, officials discovered a false cavity at the bottom where a packet containing around 3kg white powder was found. With the help of field test kit, DRI officials ascertained that the substance is cocaine. The same was seized and Camara was placed under arrest under relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.Sustained interrogation of the accused revealed that he belongs to a poor family and has six brothers. A DRI official said Camara used to drive a taxi in his country, but as he was suffering from a medical condition he was in need of money. A local point person of the racket offered him job as a drug mule in exchange for taking care of his medical expenses and his family.“It becomes easy for drug rackets to use people looking for medical tourism as mules as the chances of them getting caught are lesser because of their genuine medical history,” a DRI officer said.Analysis of previous seizures of cocaine and arrests of foreigners have revealed that in Mumbai cocaine is ferried mostly by the persons of African origin who are hired by Colombian and other South American drug cartels. Most cocaine peddlers and smugglers who have been arrested in Mumbai by anti-drug agencies belong to African countries, especially Nigeria which known to be a key transit point for Colombian drug cartels, said a senior police officer. DRI officials said drug traffickers have changed their modus operandi. Earlier, drug mules would conceal the drugs in their body. Last year dozens of foreigners were arrested by agencies at the airport while smuggling drugs in capsules inside their body. Now rackets are concealing drugs in cavities made in bags or trolleys, DRI officials said. Tuesday’s seizure is the second cocaine seizure carried out by DRI within two days. On Monday, DRI arrested a national of Malawi, an east African country, while she was smuggling in cocaine worth ₹6 crore via a similar air route — from Addis Ababa to Mumbai via Dubai.Last week, DRI had arrested four people, including two Nigerian nationals, in a case involving seizure of 502 gram cocaine. The total quantity of cocaine seized by DRI in the past 10 days is around 4.5 kg worth around ₹27 crore.The frequent seizures of cocaine in Mumbai are indicative of a high demand of the substance even though it is one of the expensive narcotic drugs, DRI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-the-biggest-seizure-at-mumbai-airport-this-year-dri-nabs-foreigner-with-18-crore-cocaine/story-VpmiiQjniEOrPkdUb6wnDN.html

26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Night curfew not likely in Chandigarh||Even as the Chandigarh administration is planning to roll back some of the relaxations allowed in Covid-19 restrictions recently, it is unlikely to impose night curfew in the city. The administration on Wednesday adopted the fresh guidelines issued by the ministry of home affairs (MHA). To come into force from December 1, it empowers the administration to impose local restrictions after assessing the situation. These include imposition of night curfew, though for wider lockdown restrictions the administration will have to take the Centre’s prior approval. Stating that the Covid-19 situation in the city, at present, doesn’t warrant a night curfew, UT adviser Manoj Parida, who issued the orders adopting the MHA guidelines, said: “UT administrator VP Singh Badnore will take a final call on the issue in the review meeting scheduled on Thursday.” In the meeting, officials will also consider an increase in fine for not wearing mask or flouting social distancing norms. Also on agenda will be the review of the decisions to open schools, coaching centres and public places, such as Rock Garden and Sukhna Lake.While neighbouring states of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh have shut down schools after opening them, parents’ associations in Chandigarh are also demanding the same in view of the rise in infection.The MHA guidelines put stress on effective enforcement of social distancing in offices. If the weekly positivity rate is more than 10%, the administration can implement staggered office timings. Meanwhile, under the guidelines, no restriction can be imposed on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/night-curfew-not-likely-in-chandigarh/story-7SLZx7liVOTtrVf68ks1nI.html

He has previously been involved in public health, policy, medicine and consulting in New Zealand, Spain, the US, Nepal, Vietnam, Mongolia, Switzerland and India.Replying to a Twitter user who asked why he didn’t take oath in Hindi, Sharma said it is hard to keep everyone happy so he decided Sanskrit as it pays homage to all the Indian languages.“To be honest I did think of that, but then there was the question of doing it in Pahari (my first language) or Punjabi. Hard to keep everyone happy. Sanskrit made sense as it pays homage to all the Indian languages (including the many I can’t speak),” he said in a tweet.Sharma, who had unsuccessfully fought elections in 2017, defeated Tim Macindoe of the National Party this year.Earlier this month, Priyanca Radhakrishnan became New Zealand’s first-ever Indian-origin minister after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern inducted five new ministers into her executive. Born in India, Radhakrishnan, 41, went to school in Singapore before moving to New Zealand to further her education.

26-11-2020||Chandigarh||UGC’s reply to PU on governance reforms brings another twist to senate issue||With the University Grants Commission (UGC) informing Panjab University (PU) that it may initiate governance reforms in accordance with its existing provisions and regulations, the matter has become even more complicated for the varsity. The UGC’s response had come on November 10 after the varsity wrote to the statutory body seeking a plan on the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP-2020). As no fresh elections to the PU senate have been held so far, the former senators were apprehensive that the governing structure of the university may change due to the NEP-2020, which has recommended that a Board of Governors (BoG) be appointed as the governing body in higher educational institutions. Now after the UGC’s reply, many senators and syndics are of the view that as per the regulations of the University, PU has to elect a senate to be able to modify or amend the regulations of the University. The elections to the PU senate, which is the supreme governing body of the University, were postponed by the vice-chancellor for the second time on October 15, citing the pandemic. The polls were earlier scheduled to start from August 24.Syndicate member Ashok Goyal said, “The reply from UGC clearly states that the University has to act in accordance with the statutes of the University calendar. The reforms have to be done by the governing body, so the first step is to bring in the governing body of PU.”As per the PU calendar, the framing and amending of regulations of the University has to be done by the regulations committee. Section 24 of Volume I, Chapter II (A) of PU Calendar states that in making Regulations under Section 31 of the Panjab University Act, 1947, the Syndicate shall consider all amendments and draft regulations as recommended by the Regulations committee and after making such alterations as it considers fit, shall submit the same to the Senate. It further states that the decision of the Senate along with the proposed amendments and regulations shall be forwarded to the government for sanction.However, the Act can be amended in the Parliament too. Former V-C Arun Kumar Grover said, “In 2018, I had placed the reports of the committees for governance reforms of the University in syndicate but that was not considered.”Ever since the PU senate elections have been postponed, there have been a series of protests on the campus demanding immediate polls. Besides syndicate members, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Sukhbir Singh Badal have also written to the Vice-President of India, Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the Chancellor of PU, asking him to direct the varsity to conduct senate polls immediately.PU’s registrar, Vikram Nayyar, said, “We will proceed under the provisions of the PU act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ugc-letter-adds-another-twist-to-pu-senate-issue/story-dz1UKJDeg4ACDRZzCKa6zL.html
26-11-2020||Chandigarh||HC notice to Nayagaon SHO, two others on contempt plea||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday issued a notice to Nayagaon station house officer Jagjeet Singh and two other cops on a contempt plea alleging custodial torture. Two other cops named are Sudagar Din, an ASI, and Ajay Kumar, a constable. The high court acted on the plea of Dev Raj, who had approached the court on Wednesday. The response has been sought by December 16. The court was told that the petitioner, on October 22 evening, was on his way to Nayagaon riding his two-wheeler when he was stopped at a naka and asked by the cops to show his driving licence and registration certificate. Later, the cops abused him and, when he confronted them, he was beaten and taken to the local police station. He was beaten mercilessly by five-seven cops including, the three, and was also slapped with an FIR for obstructing the duty of government employees, the court was told.When the petitioner was produced before a magistrate, the officer found that he had been given a beating therefore, he ordered a medical examination. His counsel Mohinder Singh told the court that a medical examination report proves the extent of beatings, and a video shot at the naka shows how he was abused by the police. It was further stated that the petitioner met the senior superintendent of police on October 27 to complain against the cops but no action was taken against them. The court was told that there are clear directions from the high court to cops to ensure that no third-degree methods are adopted in the police custody. The apex court has directed all the states to ensure that detainees are not tortured as well. But these cops acted in violation of court orders. Hence, contempt of court proceedings should be initiated against them..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-nayagaon-sho-two-others-on-contempt-plea/story-fTRcaygXg7ZwnFLk1nMUuI.html
26-11-2020||Chandigarh||Covid fatalities dip even as cases rise in Chandigarh||Even though the weekly number of coronavirus cases have seen nearly a twofold rise since mid-October, the number of fatalities reported in Chandigarh has seen a marginal dip. The average number of deaths reported every two days in October was four, which has dropped below three in November. However, the cumulative fatality rate has been fluctuating between 1.5% and 1.6%.Professor Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, said the number of fatalities depends on the profile of patients and the degree of severity among the reported cases.“In September, when Covid cases were rising exponentially, the severity of the disease was also alarming. It is not the case this time,” he said. “Similarly, the impact of the huge number of positive cases on deaths in September may have lingered on to October, but the number decreased in November. The impact of the recent increase in cases, if the situation remains the same, can be expected hereafter, but it won’t be that big.”Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, director, UT health department, said it has been observed across the globe that the number of fatalities in the second surge has decreased after reaching a peak once. “The number of fatalities is stable even though the number of cases has increased in Chandigarh. This could be due to better management of severe cases, more evidence-based drugs being administered and awareness regarding reporting to hospitals even when minor symptoms are felt,” she said. Locally, the department has laid emphasis on the vulnerable sections and strengthened home isolation management of positive cases, said Dr Kaur.Throwing more light on it, joint director Dr VK Nagpal said: “Doctors and staff posted in dispensaries have been tasked with looking after patients in home isolation under their zones. They have to contact the patients regularly and keep a track of their vitals. Oximeters are provided to patients having underlying diseases, which makes a difference by preventing their condition from worsening during home isolation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-fatalities-dip-even-as-cases-rise-in-chandigarh/story-fucLTJmENm3FjXUYlyBlXP.html
26-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra grants exemption to cabin, cockpit crew from mandatory Covid-19 test||The Maharashtra government has granted special exemption to cabin and cockpit crew of all airlines at all airports in the state from undergoing the mandatory reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for Covid-19 detection. The decision comes after national carrier Air India wrote to the state government seeking exemption from the tests as they operate daily passenger and cargo flights to and from the state. Air India spokesperson confirmed that the airline had requested Maharashtra government to exempt their crew members from RT-PCR tests. The notice issued to all the municipal collectors by the state government on Wednesday read, “The state government has received requests from Air India stating that it is operating Vande Bharat flights and various cargo flights in and out of Maharashtra on daily basis.”The state government observed that RT-PCR test, which has been made compulsory for all persons arriving at the airports, leads to delay in scheduling of flights. The government, hence, decided to exempt all the crew from this test. The national carrier is currently operating around 42 daily flights to and from Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA).“All on-duty cockpit and cabin crew of all the airlines carrying valid identity cards be exempted from RT-PCR test at all airports in Maharashtra subject to following of all necessary Covid-related protocols by the respective airlines in the said regard,” read the government’s notice. Passengers arriving in to Mumbai and other cities in the state, however, were confused about the new state norms on RT-PCR tests. Twitter was flooded with passengers’ doubts to CSMIA officials and airlines. While some enquired if the test could be done on arrival at Mumbai, others asked if passengers booked on connecting flights from Mumbai also needed to undergo the Covid-19 test.Airport sources said that few arriving passengers faced issues after landing in Mumbai. However, despite repeated attempts, CSMIA officials did not gave details of number of passengers screened or the issues faced by them during the RT-PCR process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-grants-exemption-to-cabin-cockpit-crew-from-mandatory-covid-19-test/story-vioM8mLx9LXiQprOvjuIAM.html
26-11-2020||City||Gang busted: Conmen targeted banks, travel & food delivery chains, say Ludhiana police||With the arrest of seven persons, Ludhiana police on Wednesday claimed to have busted a pan-India network of cyber criminals, who had been fleecing corporate houses, financial institutions, online travel and food-delivery chains besides poor individuals. The gang was committing crime on the lines of the notorious Jamtara gang of Jharkhand. As per police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal, the gang was in touch with other white-collar criminals operating in different parts of the country. “They had supplied bank accounts to fraudsters in West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh (UP),” he added.The accused have been identified as Vijay Kumar alias Bittu, Anshuman Singh alias Anshu, Sushil Kumar Patel, Suraj Kumar, Sanjay Kumar, Rohit and Ram Narain alias Dablu, all residents of Uttar Pradesh.“Interestingly, no one has studied beyond high school but they could put a tech graduate or a banker to shame when it comes to fudging with records,” said one of the officials probing the case.Vijay Kumar is the kingpin of the gang. According to the police, he was working for a cellular company and used to collect Aadhaar and PAN cards of customers. Later, he learnt how to use the crucial documents for committing cyber frauds.“They were doing petty cyber crimes for the past five years, but their activities intensified during the Covid-induced lockdown when most of the businesses shifted online,” commissioner Agrawal said. The gang was operating from a small house in Giaspura area. The police commissioner has not ruled out the involvement of more people, including women, in the gang.The accused were using fake identity proofs such as Aadhaar and PAN cards for creating instant bank accounts, mostly of ICICI Bank, the police said.They were selling these bank account details for about ₹1,500 to ₹3,000 besides selling debit cards to other fraudsters for ₹3,000 to ₹4,000. On the basis of bank accounts, the gang operating in other parts of the country were applying for loan and after availing it, they would withdraw the amount using a debit card. “We have also arrested Rohit, an employee of a courier company, who was actively involved with the gang and provided fake bank account details to Vijay and his accomplices,” the police chief said. They also used to procure SIM cards on the basis of fake documents and sell them for ₹200 to ₹400.“They made full use of these fake documents and availed online loan from mobile apps like Dhani and Red Carpet and then transfer the amount to their personal bank accounts via online wallets. The accused, who were arrested on Tuesday, have confessed to committing a fraud of ₹25 lakh with Dhani and Red Carpet apps,” said Agarwal.They also duped OLA cab drivers by getting IDs and OTPs in the name of verification by posing as company employees and then opened online bank accounts on the credentials of drivers. Then they would sell these accounts on Whatsapp/FB groups to the avail the refunds disbursed by the company, the police said. “Not only this, they took refund from food delivery apps such as Zomato and Swiggy in the name and bank details of innocent people and used the refund coupons for online shopping,” Agarwal added. The commissioner said that ₹5.45 lakh, 11 mobiles, three credit cards, 17 SIM cards, two laptops, a scanner, a coloured printer, 45 PAN cards, six memory cards and 11 ATM cards have been recovered from the possession of the accused.How to avoid falling prey to cyber fraudstersPublic– Must not share Aadhaar/Pan card images on Whatsapp and/or Facebook or with unauthorised individuals– Must not share OTP and bank account details with anyone– Must only get Aadhaar card made only from authorised shops/individualsCourier companies– Should ensure that delivery person delivers the debit/credit card to the actual account holder after checking necessary ID proofs– Should ensure debit/credit card is delivered at the exact mentioned address. Can use GPS to get exact coordinates of the delivery site– Should sensitise and create awareness among delivery boys to identify and report suspicious addresses where multiple credit/debit cards are being deliveredBanks– Should conduct physical KYC verification of new accounts within 1 month from account opening date– Should ensure communication address in KYC forms is precise and detailedTelecom companies– Should obtain complete address and clear identity proofs while issuing new SIM cards– Should flag individuals collecting multiple SIM cards on same address and ID proofs Cab aggregators– Should motivate drivers against sharing Aadhaar/Pan card details or OTP with any caller||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gang-busted-conmen-targeted-banks-travel-food-delivery-chains-say-ludhiana-police/story-vf0JZZD557kSiEG00eq3qL.html

26-11-2020||Mumbai||Fire safety norms flouted, BMC standing committee raps Mumbai Fire Brigade||After the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) sent notices to 29 malls in Mumbai in the past one month for non-compliance of fire safety norms, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) standing committee on Wednesday questioned as to why these malls are still open to public despite show-cause notices from MFB. The committee also raised questions about corruption in MFB.The committee demanded that malls, which received MFB notice, be shut for the period granted by MFB to ensure compliance to the norms. If a fire incident takes place during this time, the officer signing off on the notice should be charged for culpable homicide under section 304(a) of the Indian Penal Code, the committee demanded. This comes in the aftermath of the massive fire that gutted City Centre mall on October 22. MFB took more than 56 hours to douse the fire after it was declared a brigade call (highest level of fire according to the fire brigade’s standard operating procedure). Subsequently, the standing committee had alleged irregularities in the mall. While BMC’s approved plan showed only 344 shops in the mall, the fire brigade’s preliminary report on the fire had recorded 1,344 shops. MFB then sent notices to 29 other malls over the past month and the list was submitted by the fire brigade to the standing committee on Wednesday. Leader of the opposition Ravi Raja said, “If a notice has been served to a mall, it means the mall is fire non-compliant. During this time, the fire brigade should ensure the mall remains closed to public.”The committee also alleged corruption in MFB for using its authority to vacate tenants of buildings (citing fire non-compliance) for the benefit of private builders. Standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav, corporator from Byculla, said, “On Tuesday midnight, I received a call from tenants of a private building in my area that MFB, the Mumbai Police and BEST employees were forcefully vacating the building citing non-compliance to fire safety norms and that the building was dilapidated. When I asked for papers, it turned out that these reasons were not true.” He added, “BMC machinery is being used to suit the whims of private builders who want the building to be vacated. I have directed the fire brigade to inquire against the officer present during this incident and submit a report in two days.”When HT spoke to chief fire officer (CFO) Shashikant Kale on Wednesday evening, he did not give a comment on these issues.BMC demotes CFO Shashikant KaleBMC on Wednesday demoted CFO Shashikant Kale to the position of deputy CFO, and set up an inquiry against him for concealing information in an application for Presidential medal for firemen. Deputy CFO KV Hivrale has been given the charge of CFO until the inquiry against Kale is completed. Confirming the update, a senior civic official said, “It came to light that during Kale’s tenure as DCFO in MFB, he was awarded a punishment. He concealed this information while making his application for the Presidential medal last week. The CFO charge has been taken away from him temporarily until the inquiry into this incident is complete.” Kale was suspended from the MFB in 2014 regarding issuance of a no-objection certificate for a new construction project, and an inquiry was set up against him. After serving four years in Thane Fire Brigade, Kale was made CFO of MFB in August 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fire-safety-norms-flouted-bmc-standing-committee-raps-mumbai-fire-brigade/story-XyGAURotariy4s0bf1P4iK.html

Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agrawal formed the 15 ward level teams. With a central team that visited Pune last month warning of a possible second wave of the deadly virus in December-January, PMC has taken various measures to control the spread of Covid. The civic administration received complaints of bars and hotels not adhering to the Covid guildelines with many running on full capacity and customers not wearing mask and following social distancing norms. Agrawal said, “The police is requested to provide cover when the teams visit hotels and bars to do inspection. These teams would enforce fines on violators.” The teams will also visit other commercial establishments and malls in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-forms-15-teams-to-check-covid-violations-at-hotels-bars-and-malls/story-Vq1bU4mSuDprb1Tw1j9CWN.html
26-11-2020||Pune||Despite thin traffic during lockdown, fatalities on Pune-Mumbai e-way close to last year||Pune: Travelling on the Pune-Mumbai expressway has been risky this year as per the accidents data shared by the state highway police as empty road during lockdown prompted motorists to cross the speed limit. At least 58 persons have lost their lives on the e-way between January and October this year as compared to 65 deaths during the same period last year. Despite lockdown for around four months and less number of vehicles on the e-way, fatal accidents on the stretch are close to the last year’s figure. In 2019, between January and October, 56 fatal accidents claimed 65 lives while this year during the same time span, 53 fatal accidents happened with 58 deaths on the e-way. While the total number of accidents is comparatively less than last year — in 2019, 255 accidents happened from January to October and 121 accidents happened on the e-way in 2020 during the same period. The number of fatal deaths on the e-way despite the lockdown is attributed to behavioural change in drivers. “It was expected that there would be less number of fatal accidents and even deaths on the e-way this year. But, the data shows a rise, and the major reason behind it is behavioural change among drivers. Many motorists tend to speeding when they find the e-way empty or with less traffic during the lockdown period. As there was a lockdown in the country for almost four months and only emergency vehicles were allowed to travel, still accident figure did not reduce,” said Tanmay Pendse, an activist working for the safety of motorists using the expressway. “It is necessary to follow all the rules and regulations while travelling on the expressway. The tendency to speeding on empty roads or highways is very risky for drivers and co-passengers. It has caused fatalities on the e-way. I appeal to drivers using the e-way to strictly follow the speed limits and other rules.” he said. Talking about the accidents on the e-way, Sanjay Jadhav, superintendent of police, state highway police (HSP), Pune said, “We have worked on several things to improve the vehicular movement and safety on the e-way. Our highway police team is continuously taking action on speeding vehicles, placing reflectors and, during the lockdown period, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) carried out several infrastructure works. And as there was fewer numbers of vehicles on the e-way during the lockdown months, there was some behavioural change noticed amongst drivers, including speeding. So, we mainly focused on our speed gun and seat belt action on the e-way to curb accidents. Also, the response time of our team to reach the accident spot has increased during this period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-thin-traffic-fatalities-on-e-way-close-to-last-year-as-empty-roads-often-prompted-motorists-to-cross-speed-limit/story-jjImjiyMvIoUJ2JugMRIUO.html
26-11-2020||Pune||Covid test: Confusion at Pune rly station and airport on first day||Pune: Passengers coming to the Pune railway station on Wednesday from state of Rajasthan and Delhi were worried and confused, as they were demanded to produce Covid “negative” certificate by the state health department officials. Only two trains came to Pune railway station from the listed states, one from Ajmer (Rajasthan) and another from Hazrat Nizamuddin (Delhi). As it was the first day of the rule to be implemented, most of the passengers travelling from railway and airways were unaware about the rule to show Covid negative report. “We were prepared for checking of the passengers who arrived at Pune railway station from Delhi and Rajasthan today. Our RPF policemen along with other railway officials and state health officials were checking each and every passenger arrived from this train. Their Covid reports were checked and also thermal scanning was done. But as it was the first day most of them were unaware about this decision and no one was found Covid positive today,” said Subhash Kamble, RPF police inspector at Pune railway station. On Monday the state government issued a circular regarding travelling of people to Maharashtra state from these four states, it is now compulsory to do Covid test before entering Maharashtra by any modes of travel – road, railways or airways. As the number of Covid positive patients is increasing in these states as a precautionary measure this decision has been taken. Explaining the process for testing, Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh said, “Our team in Airports Authority of India (AAI) will contact the passenger who will be taken to the sample collection centre if they do not have a Covid report. There they have to register themselves by filling up blank handout form and make the required payment. The sample will be collected by the lab technician.” Following the process, the passenger can leave for their homes and the report will be delivered by email. If positive, the passenger will be reported to PMC for further action Shravan Mutha, Covid-19 manager at the airport kiosk of Krsnaa Diagnostic said, “We took about 100 samples from flight passengers who did not have the mandatory RT-PCR (reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction) report, the gold standard for diagnosing Covid-19, along with them. Out of that 60 are under process as they were sent before 4 pm, rest were sent later. Today was the first day of testing for passengers coming from Delhi, Rajasthan and Goa. Most of the passengers did carry a report while others who did not were asked to undergo the test. However, we did see a few people resisting the test.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/passengers-coming-from-railway-and-airport-checked-for-covid-in-pune/story-LrUP3u2dzxFOtlNq2dY8OO.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi: 0.24% of 5.73 million screened during survey had Covid-19 symptoms||A total of 13,516 persons (0.24%) of the 5.73 million screened as part of the Delhi government’s ongoing door-to-door survey, were found to have symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) till Tuesday, while 1,178 persons have tested positive for the disease. The survey was launched on November 20 and will likely conclude on Thursday.Around 6.42% -- both symptomatic persons and contacts of Covid-19 patients in high-risk areas who have undergone tests under the survey till Tuesday -- have tested positive for the virus, according to the government data accessed by HT.The survey, which was launched on the directions of Union home minister Amit Shah in light of the sharp increase in Covid-19 cases and deaths in the national capital, was supposed to cover around 5.8 million people – more than one-fourth of Delhi’s total population of around 20 million – mainly residing in the over 4,500 containment zones and other areas assessed as hot spots in the 11 revenue districts.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageAccording to the data compiled till Tuesday night, the government had surveyed 5.73 million individuals (residing in 1.35 million households) in certain identified areas. Of the 5.73 million, 13,516 (0.24%) were found symptomatic of the disease. Of these 13, 516 symptomatic individuals, the data shows that 11,790 were sent for testing. Similarly, of the 8,413 persons who were identified as contacts of Covid-19 cases, 6,546 were sent for testing.Of the total 18,336 people tested, 1,178 persons came positive for Covid-19 -- a positivity rate of around 6.42%. Around 9,000 teams of three people each – comprising government officials and employees with the civic agencies – were engaged in the survey that covered all 11 revenue districts of the city.“Once the final report is prepared, we shall analyse trends and ensure that they help in strengthening the strategy to fight Covid-19,” said Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot.Of the 11 revenue districts in Delhi, the central district reported the highest positivity rate of 37.26% -- of the 773 symptomatic individuals and contacts of Covid-19 patients who were tested, 288 had Covid-19.Shahdara district had zero positivity rate, as none of the 901 persons who were tested had Covid-19. A senior official with the revenue department, on condition of anonymity, said the test results are awaited in most other districts.Also Read | In fresh Covid-19 guidelines, home ministry empowers states to impose local restrictions like night curfewAmong the 11 revenue districts, the maximum number of people -- 1,046,727 -- were surveyed in south-west district of whom 3,796 were found to be symptomatic of Covid-19.The highest number of Covid-19 patient contacts --2,475 -- were identified and tested in the west district.A second senior official of the revenue department, which is heading the survey, said all symptomatic people and contacts of Covid-19 patients were tested with RT-PCR kits, which are considered to be more accurate compared to rapid antigen tests that, though quicker, often throw up false negatives. The survey would most likely be completed by Thursday morning, the official said, requesting anonymity.“The scale of the exercise was huge, so we needed a lot of people. Each team was given thermal scanners and oximeters to screen residents,” said the second official.The official continued, “Those who have tested positive have been isolated and are under treatment. These symptomatic people were otherwise not getting tested. This exercise has also helped us in creating awareness about the disease and telling people that they should not take Covid/flu symptoms lightly. It is important to get tested if you have any symptoms.”Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said the number of symptomatic patients identified during the survey is very less, especially during this time of the year. “Cough, cold and other influenza-like symptoms are very common during winter. Usually, there is a spike in such cases. With Covid-19, the numbers should have been much more.”Analysing the government data, Dr Kishore said, “The fact that 6.42% symptomatic individuals and patient contacts have tested positive shows that a large number of people in these surveyed areas have been exposed to the virus.” Dr Jacob John, former head of clinical virology, Christian Medical College in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, said, “The survey was necessary in Delhi in light of the severe spike in Covid-19 cases of late. Even though the survey has identified only around 13,500 symptomatic people, about 8,500 patient contacts and about 1,200 Covid-19 positive individuals so far, despite covering a significant chunk of the population, the exercise has helped in assessing the scenario in the city. The government should isolate all these identified persons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/13-516-of-5-73-million-screened-in-door-to-door-survey-had-covid-symptoms-1-178-positive/story-v7XbYqL4mGwtVfuDWNwSZK.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 positivity rate dips below 10% for first time in November in Delhi||The daily positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among those tested –dipped below 10% for the first time in November on Wednesday. On Wednesday, the positivity rate stood at 8.49%, lowest since October 27 when the positivity rate stood at 8.48%. Experts said that the spread of the infection can be deemed to be in control, if the positivity rate remains dips to 5% or lower for around two weeks. Delhi on Wednesday also reported fewer than 6,000 new cases of Covid-19 , with more than 50,000 tests being conducted, for the first time since October-end. On Wednesday, the city saw 5,246 Covid-19 cases with 61,778 tests having been done in the city. Also Read | Hospitalisation delays, pollution fuelling Covid deaths in Delhi, say doctorsThere had been dips in the number of cases during Diwali, Bhai Duj, Chatt, and the weekends when fewer tests had been conducted. On average, Delhi has been conducting about 60,000 tests a day. The Delhi government is currently working on increasing the number of tests to between 100,000 to 120,000 a day. Delhi had also seen an increase in the number of deaths over the fortnight, with 106 deaths reported each day on average. In comparison, 59 deaths had been reported each day on average the fortnight before, data shared by the Delhi government showed. Dr Vivek Nangia, head of the department of pulmonology at Max hospital, Saket said, “People have started taking Covid-19 very lightly, they have let their guards down because of which we are seeing higher number of cases. This is usually the time when people get common cold and seasonal flu as well so they are ignoring the symptoms. Everyone must get tested two to three days after they see any symptom. And, they should rush to a hospital if their oxygen saturation drops, they feel breathless, have fingers turning blue, or are disoriented.” He suggested that those diagnosed with Covid-19 regularly check their oxygen saturation before and after walking for 6 minutes and rush to a hospital if the saturation dips below 95%. The normal oxygen saturation is between 95 and 100%. “Another major problem is that people are returning to the circulation too soon. They should remain in isolation ideally for 21 days, and not 14 days, to ensure that there is no chance of infecting others,” he said. Meanwhile, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain visited the Covid-19 wards in the newly constructed Burari hospital, which was made operational to treat patients with the viral infection. The hospital, which so far had only 20 non-ventilator ICU beds, added 20 ventilator beds on Wednesday, with 30 more to be added by Saturday. In the four months since its operationalization, the hospital has treated 1,000 Covid-19 patients, according to the health minister. Jain on Wednesdayalso inaugurated the biomedical waste disposal unit at the hospital. “Ventilator is an important facility, as patients feel that ventilator is a prerequisite, if need be. Burari Hospital is now fully equipped to treat patients. There will not be a need to shift patients and neither will patients have to look for other options for treatment,” Jain said at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/positivity-rate-dips-below-10-for-first-time-in-november-in-delhi/story-9ws8REpDlcho6kBrYXHoNP.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||Hospitalisation delays, pollution fuelling Covid-19 deaths in Delhi, say doctors||Delay in admissions, pollution-induced respiratory illnesses, and a surge in number of cases of Covid-19 — coupled with the pressure on hospitals — has led to a higher number of deaths that the capital has been reporting currently, city doctors said. Delhi has reported over 100 deaths a day for the last five days due to the viral infection, increasing the seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive — to 1.7% from 0.8% at the beginning of November. On an average, 115 people died each day in the last seven days as compared to just over 95 the week before, and 70 patients the week before that. People delaying hospital visits has also added to the current increase in mortality.  “The problem is that people have started taking the disease lightly. This is also the time when they have common cold, flare-ups of allergies, and seasonal flu. People attribute their symptoms to these conditions and do not get tested till late. Covid-19 being a viral illness, early treatment is of utmost importance,” said Dr Vivek Nangia, head of the department of pulmonary medicine at Max hospital, Saket. He says that some patients have bought oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators and use them at home to ease symptoms and report to hospitals only when the disease becomes severe. “So, they come in late; about 10 to 15% of the patients are now reaching hospitals when their oxygen saturation has already dropped quite a lot. These measures should be a stop-gap till they get a hospital bed and not be used as a therapy that can be continued at home,” said Dr Nangia. Even people in their 30s and 40s without comorbidities are getting the disease, the doctor cautioned. “We have seen a very high number of Covid-19 cases from September through November and the number of deaths reflect that. The number of deaths are likely to remain high for a couple of weeks because there is always a lag in the increase in cases and the increase in deaths – patients go to the hospitals, remain under treatment for weeks, and then succumb. The high number of cases is also the reason that hospitals are seeing an increase in the serious patients who are more likely to die,” said Dr Naresh Gupta, professor of medicine at Lok Nayak hospital, Delhi’s biggest Covid-19 treatment facility. The hospital has also seen an increase in the number of patients coming in with very low oxygen saturation during the November surge in cases, according to another doctor at the hospital. “We get about 60 new admissions a day, of which around 15 to 20 patients come in a severe condition. These patients are often those who have been referred from private hospitals in the city,” the doctor said. Patients referred from other states have also contributed to the number of severe cases in government hospitals. “It is difficult to say what percentage, but we certainly get many Covid-19 patients from other states coming to Delhi for treatment. And, these patients are usually in a critical condition by the time they reach our hospital,” said Dr BK Tripathi, professor of medicine at Safdarjung hospital. In a recent interview, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan pointed out that the Centre had to intervene twice in Delhi as Covid-19 situation was going out of hand. “Delhi is paying the price of casual behaviour of people as you find a majority of them not following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour especially at crowded public spaces. Testing is being doubled in Delhi, and mobile labs are being launched that would go to different locations to collect samples. Contact tracing is another key area. Also, pollution ails Delhi NCR around October, November and December, in turn aggravating the Covid-19 situation,” he added. The levels of pollution leads to more serious cases and higher number of deaths, doctors said. “The number of serious cases has increased of the total number of cases in Delhi. This is not unexpected because the respiratory infections become severe during winter season, when the air quality is poor. There is evidence from across the world – from Italy, US, and Germany -- that shows severity of Covid-19 cases goes up with increase in pollution levels. In addition, pollution regulates a person’s immune system making them more susceptible to the virus,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). “There is also a shortage of beds in Delhi, which means people go from hospital to hospital in search of beds, which delays their treatment and adds to the Covid-19 morbidity and mortality,” he said. The Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday had said that Delhi had one of the lowest case fatality ratios among India’s major cities. “Delhi has least fatality ratio amongst all major cities in India. Rapid addition of ICU beds and other medical facilities have helped us achieve this. We are doing our best to save each and every life,” he said in a tweet. The data attached in the tweet mentions that Delhi’s case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – stood at 1.6%, comparing it to states with the highest CFR -- Ahmedabad’s 4.2%, Ludhiana’s 4%, Mumbai’s 3.9%. As per the data shared by the minister, Delhi was on the 15th place in the list of the cities with highest mortality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hospitalisation-delays-pollution-fuelling-covid-deaths-in-delhi-say-doctors/story-xgXSeBIrOpyJ0bVau3irIO.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||Two brothers held for killing scrap dealer, son; police claim business rivalry led to the double murder||Police on Wednesday said they had arrested two brothers and claimed to have cracked the double murders of a scrap dealer and his son, who were killed while returning from a mosque in north-east Delhi earlier this week.Police claimed that the scrap dealer Zulfiqar Qureshi — who was also a member of the BJP’s local unit — and his son Janbaz were killed over a business rivalry.Though investigators had to conduct multiple raids before they could nab the suspects, identified as Khalid and Tariq Ali, they had received crucial leads from 20-year-old Janbaz, who had named the assailants before succumbing to his injuries.Armed with the identities of the suspects, the police had analysed their phone call records and location before arresting them from Nand Nagri on Tuesday evening. Janbaz’s father, Zulfiqar, was a scrap dealer who was an active member of the BJP and also ran an NGO, besides filing right to information (RTI) applications against businesses and builders in and around his neighbourhood. According to the police, Zulfiqar had a host of criminal cases registered against him, even though he had been staying clean for the last few years. His slain son too had criminal cases, including one arrest in a motor theft case just two months ago, said Ved Prakash Surya, deputy commissioner of police (north-east).Surya said that the arrested suspects had so far told their interrogators that they had murdered the father-son duo as they were “fed up” of Zulfiqar’s habit of filing “fake complaints” against them and harming their businesses.This is contrary to the claims of the Qureshi family which insisted that Zulfiqar’s activism was against scrap dealers involved in sale and purchase of stolen vehicles.Zulfiqar was shot dead by four men on Monday morning, as he was stepping out of a mosque near his home after offering morning prayers. Janbaz had tried to save him, but he too was stabbed.The DCP said that Janbaz had named four suspects— which included another scrap dealer Naasir, who is the brother of the arrested men, Khalid and Tariq Ali.“Their father, Rasheed, owns a scrap shop right next to Zulfiqar’s shop. They had a business rivalry. Zulfiqar would file false complaints against Rasheed, which would force him to shut his shop for prolonged periods,” said the DCP.“Rasheed and his family tried to resolve the matter with Zulfiqar on a couple of occasions, but to no avail. Fed up with his attitude, Rasheed’s three sons and an aide carried out the double murders,” said the DCP.While Naasir remains on the run, the police refused to identify the fourth suspect, who too is absconding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-brothers-held-for-killing-scrap-dealer-son-police-claim-business-rivalry-led-to-the-double-murder/story-pgpGKk6oLXgoGo35Ez3zHI.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots planners ran a well-oiled, sustained campaign: Police||The Delhi Police have alleged that the conspirators in the north east Delhi communal riots ran a “sustained and well-oiled” campaign to create an acute sense of fear and insecurity in the minds of the minority community and while they remained safe in their homes, the brunt of their actions were borne by those who have to struggle daily for their sustenance.In the supplementary charge sheet filed in the conspiracy leading to the riots in February, the special cell of the Delhi Police have detailed the role of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and Faizan Khan. The charge sheet was filed on Sunday and the court took cognizance on Tuesday. Earlier, in the main charge sheet filed in September, the police had named 15 accused, including former councillors Tahir Hussain and Ishrat Jahan, Pinjra Tod members Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita and student-activists such as Asif Iqbal Tanha and Gulfisha Khatoon among others.As many as 53 people were killed and over 400 others injured in the riots that took place between February 23 and 26 in different parts of north east Delhi. The police claims that the accused had conspired with each other to orchestrate riots during the visit of the US President Donald Trump in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).The police alleged that the offences committed by Khalid and Imam were “extremely brutal”, “grotesque”, and were a “crime against humanity”.The police said that Khalid did not take the personal security officers, who were assigned to him after an attack at the Constitution Club in 2018, to the conspiratorial meetings, which according to the charge sheet shows “a totally depraved, brutal and scheming mind”.Umar Khalid’ counsel Trideep Pais had earlier said that though his client was against the idea of the new Citizenship law; and that he (Khalid) was not ashamed of it, Khalid was not involved in any violence of the conspiracy of the riots. Ahmad Ibrahim, Sharjeel’s lawyer, said even before the counsels have not got the charge sheet and would be supplied on December 2, it’s already out in the media. He said that he is yet to read the charge sheet and would be able to comment on the allegations only when he has read the document. “Innocent victims and helpless were targeted of this ghastly, horrendous and horrifying crime. Precious lives were lost. Accused persons are charge-sheeted for commission of grave, serious and heinous offences,” the charge sheet read.“It is pertinent to mention here that their acts and commissions have shocked the collective conscience of the society,” it read. Faizan Khan has been accused of supplying SIM card to co-accused Asif Iqbal Tanha. The police have said that the same SIM was later used by student activist Safoora Zargar.“Accused Faizan Khan and Asif Iqbal Tanha were actively involved in executing the preparatory work for commission of the unlawful and terrorist act executed by co-accused persons,” the police claimed. The court will hear the case next on December 22 after the trial in the case was stayed by the Delhi high court on an appeal by the police challenging an earlier order of the trial court directing them to supply physical copies of the charge sheet. The police alleged that Imam was “baptized” a day before the preparatory meeting which laid the foundation of Delhi Protest Support Group (DPSG). The charge sheet says that Imam then embarked on a journey across states and subsequently six FIRs were registered against him, primarily for sedition and inciting communal hatred.The charge sheet stated all efforts of the conspirators were geared towards giving the anti-CAA/NRC protests a profound communal colour.It further said that the criminal conspiracy was continuing and has suffered setbacks with the exposure and arrest of the accused persons but it was neither aborted nor abandoned. Highlighting the role of Jamia Millia Islamia student and co-accused Meeran Haider, the police said that he was one of the top conspirators and created a ruse to malign Sharjeel Imam so as to convey that DPSG had parted ways with the “rabid, communal Sharjeel Imam”.“Haider, as the faithful deputy of Umar Khalid, knew very well in his heart that Sharjeel Imam was nowhere returning to Shaheen Bagh and was faithfully executing his task and role in the conspiracy as assigned by the principal conspirators.However, as soon as the news of the arrest of Imam became public, the key conspirators returned to their true colours and started “massive mobilisation to press for his release”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-planners-ran-a-well-oiled-sustained-campaign-police/story-31ESFJL5NomiirtAcjTdsM.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||Ensure timely hospitalisation of Covid-19 patients in home isolation: L-G||Delhi lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal on Wednesday directed Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) officials to ensure timely hospitalisation of Covid-19 patients in home isolation in case of emergency to reduce the mortality rate in the city, which recorded more than 100 daily deaths in seven of the last 14 days, a senior official said.In a DDMA meeting on Wednesday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal requested for a team of experts to audit recent cases of Covid-19 deaths in Delhi and suggest measures that could help reduce fatalities, the official said.The DDMA is chaired by Baijal and its vice-chairperson is Kejriwal.Delhi, on Wednesday, recorded 5,246 new Covid-19 cases and 99 more deaths, taking the death toll to 8,720. The positivity rate was recorded at 8.49%, the government’s health bulletin said.So far, the highest number of deaths in a single day was recorded at 131 on November 18.“Reviewed Covid-19 situation and implementation status of decisions taken during the meeting held under the Union Home Minister on 15 Nov, 2020, with special reference to scaling up testing, augmenting hospital capacities, conduct of house-to-house survey & review of home care. Emphasised enhanced IEC outreach, strict enforcement of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and continued and coordinated action to contain positivity and mortality,” Baijal said in a series of tweets after the meeting.The chief minister’s office did not comment on the developments in the meeting.A senior government official privy to the developments said Kejriwal urged the L-G to help assess the steep rise in deaths, which Delhi has witnessed in November, and suggest ways to reduce them.An expert committee the L-G had set up to advise DDMA on Covid-19 include Dr V K Paul, member of the NITI Aayog, and Dr Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS. The committee helps DDMA in all aspects of Covid-19 management, but for death audits on a routine basis, a separate committee was set up by the Delhi government.The death audit committee would continue to function, the official said.The CM’s request for an audit by experts comes against the backdrop of the civic agencies, which are entrusted with cremations and burials, alleging discrepancies in data related to Covid-19 deaths.In Wednesday’s DDMA meeting, another senior official said, the L-G reviewed the ICU bed shortage in Delhi. The CM told the L-G that the Delhi government recently added 232 ICU beds in GTB Hospital and 200 in Lok Nayak, and that he is personally monitoring the progress on a round-the-clock basis, the official said.The official said DDMA was supposed to discuss strategies for vaccine distribution but that did not happen on Wednesday. Last week, in an interview to HT, Kejriwal had said calls on vaccine distribution would be taken by the central government and the state government’s role would come only after that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ensure-timely-hospitalisation-of-covid-19-patients-in-home-isolation-l-g/story-VcvmGp7RuS0vygkUBRHAMJ.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||Working on long-term solution to stubble burning: Air commission||Instead of a piecemeal approach, the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) is consulting north-western states to find out a workable, long-term solution to the problem of stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and other places, which leads to an air emergency in Delhi-NCR every year, MM Kutty, chairperson of the newly formed body has said.A combination of extremely high number of stubble fires in Punjab, low to calm winds in the region and subsidence of air had led to Delhi recording “severe” air quality for six days consecutively since November 5 this month. At present, the contribution of stubble fires to Delhi’s PM 2.5 load is negligible but the commission has started preparing for next year, which is also a pre-election year for Punjab.“We have a forward-looking approach. We are working on identifying long-term solutions to this problem (stubble burning). A workable solution will be attempted by the commission in consultation with all stakeholders so that the problem does not arise in future,” Kutty said. “Now, stubble burning is over but a mechanism is needed to ensure it doesn’t happen next year. We are also trying to establish the wherewithal to implement various measures to control the spike in winter pollution. CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) should continue to do its job,” he said.Kutty said the commission will try to avoid temporary fixes and presently does not have the staff and infrastructure to do large scale monitoring, which is being worked on. The commission has recently got an office in Yusuf Sarai from where its four full-time members are working.Stubble fires in Punjab increased by 46.5% this year compared to last year while they reduced by 28.6% in Haryana, according to an assessment note released by CPCB on Tuesday.In Punjab, the total count of active fire events reported in the year 2020 was 76,537 while in 2019, it was 52,225 (September 21 to November 22). Sangrur, Bathinda and Firozpur continued to record the highest fire counts and reported an increase of 45.7%, 35% and 40.5% respectively, compared to last year. Moga, Amritsar, Fazilka, Ludhiana have shown more than 75% increase in fire counts in comparison to 2019.In 2020, all the districts of Punjab, except SBS Nagar, have shown an upward trend in fire counts and have witnessed the lack of ground level implementation of the centrally supported in-situ mechanisation scheme for crop stubble management. The average contribution of stubble burning to PM 2.5 load in Delhi has increased from 10% (October 11 – December 10, 2019) to 15.63% (October 10 – November 22, 2020). In 2020, Delhi’s PM2.5 load was more than 10% on 26 days between October 10 and November 22 and on 21 days in the same period in 2019.In Haryana, the total fire counts this year was 4,675 compared to 6,551 last year (September 25 - November 22). Fatehabad, Kaithal and Karnal continued to record highest fire counts but recorded a reduction by 40% compared to last year. Fire counts in Palwal and Kurushetra reduced by 50-60%.“This year, fires have been higher than last year because farmers haven’t used the straw management machinery subsidised by the Centre. They were protesting against three farm bills. Many of the fires were to register their protest. Large-scale protests are still underway. Lakhs of farmers are demanding withdrawal of the laws. Harvest of paddy and fires are now over,” said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/working-on-long-term-solution-to-stubble-burning-air-commission/story-bbCiKWOowzN3pikP5e6YzL.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||Eight JNU professors write to President, allege “misconduct” in faculty appointments||Eight professors from Jawaharlal Nehru University’s (JNU) School of Physical Sciences have written to the President of India flagging “malfeasance” in recent faculty appointments in their school. They urged the President to intervene, in his capacity as visitor of the University, and keep all appointments in question in “abeyance”.In their letter dated November 23, addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind — which was also marked to JNU vice chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar— the eight faculty members said, “We bring to your kind attention the gross violation of ethics and procedures that have occurred during the recent round of recruitments related to the School of Physical Sciences, JNU, New Delhi.”In their letter, the professors have listed several violations in recruitments done by the university earlier this month. For instance, a candidate selected for the position of professor does not have the required experience, they alleged. In another case, a person selected for the position of the associate professor was not short-listed by the selection committee. Requesting the President to intervene, the professors said, “We pray that the appointments mentioned be kept in abeyance until all aspects of the conduct and outcome of the selection process (Including whether the best available candidates were selected and whether the external subject experts on the selection committee were qualified to meaningfully judge the quality of research in the relevant areas of specialisation) are scrutinised by a committee of leading physicists and astrophysicists...”The letter was sent ahead of the university’s 290th Executive Council (EC) meeting held on Wednesday. One of the signatory professors, who wished not to be named, said, “Some of the recent recruitments are former JNU students who support a certain ideology and have affiliation to some organisations. They do not have the required experience and proper research work on the subject.”Contacted, JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said, “The faculty members have sent the letter to the visitor. We will look into this, if the visitor asks us to. We have nothing to say about it.” JNU V-C did not respond to calls and texts sent seeking comments on the issue. Earlier in September, HT had reported that an inquiry committee had been set up to review the four appointments of faculty members, after several members of the EC — the highest decision-making body — objected to their candidatures and alleged discrepancies in the recruitment process. Moushumi Basu, secretary of JNU teachers Association (JNUTA), said, “The allegations reiterate the long-standing demand for a public inquiry into all the appointments made by the current vice chancellor so far.”Meanwhile, the JNU administration also issued a statement saying that it has decided to celebrate Swami Vivekanada youth festival every year. The decision was taken during the EC meeting. The EC also passed a resolution to constitute a committee to develop academic/research programmes on Swami Vivekananda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/eight-jnu-professors-write-to-president-allege-misconduct-in-faculty-appointments/story-p4FA11WYOEJSXD8ZWzBjGJ.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||Fire erupts at Ghazipur landfill||Even as the national capital gasped for breath, with its overall air quality slipping into the severe category, a fire broke out at Delhi’s largest landfill at Ghazipur on Tuesday. According to fire officials, efforts to completely douse the blaze were on till late evening. Delhi Fire Services (DFS) officials said the fire was reported at 9.56pm on Tuesday, but because of the intensity and the large area it took longer for the firemen to douse the blaze. “Initially, nine fire tenders were pressed into action, but by afternoon, two more tenders were sent. Unlike a regular blaze, fires in garbage piles react in a different way because of the variety of waste dumped there. The chemicals that are released by the decomposition of garbage also aggravate the blaze,” a senior fire official said. The official said that by 3pm, the fire was contained but smoke continued rise from the landfill. DFS teams were present at the landfill site till at least 7pm to check if the fire begins again and to initiate the cooling process. An East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) spokesperson said that the fire broke out from the outer edge of the landfill, where fresh garbage was being dumped on the Tuesday night. “Soon the fire spread towards the outer periphery of the garbage, in front of waste-to-energy plant. All EDMC field officials are present at site and trying to control the situation. The fire has been controlled with the help of available machines and fire tenders. However, smoke is still rising at site and small fires are erupting. We are keeping an eye on that,” said the spokesperson. Meanwhile the Aam Aadmi Party alleged that the BJP-ruled EDMC had started the fire deliberately to malign the party’s government in Delhi. AAP in-charge of the municipal corporations, Durgesh Pathak on Wednesday alleged that “the BJP had lighted a fire on the Ghazipur landfill to defame Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal”. “People and choking on the smoke from the fire and the BJP leaders are playing with the lives of people by burning the garbage mountain. AAP demands a fair investigation into the incident and strict action should be taken against the culprits,” Pathak said. Responding to Pathak’s allegations, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said that AAP leaders are known for the “politics of accusations”. “The Aam Aadmi Party leaders cannot tolerate the well being of Delhiites, so the party has set fire to the Ghazipur landfill and put the lives of people at risk, nothing can be more shameful than this. In the last six years, CM (Arvind) Kejriwal has not visited Ghazipur landfill even once and when BJP MP Gautam Gambhir is working on the ground, Kejriwal and his ministers are doing nothing more than creating chaos and fear among the public,” Gupta alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fire-erupts-at-ghazipur-landfill/story-l8RPfWRWKmM2U1nmYSPMUM.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||Brace for cold wave conditions from Saturday, warns IMD||If you thought it was unusually chilly in Delhi already, wait till the weekend. The temperature is likely to dip further from Saturday, says the India Meteorological Department (IMD), and the city would most likely experience cold-wave like conditions. On Wednesday, owing to the impact of a western disturbance over the western Himalayan region, the minimum temperature in Delhi was 10.4 degrees Celsius. While this was one degree lower than the season’s normal, it was a considerable increase from Tuesday, when the minimum temperature was 6.7 degrees Celsius. On Monday, it was 6.3 degrees Celsius, the lowest November temperature in Delhi since 2003. A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. For smaller states such as Delhi, however, a cold wave can be declared in case the criterion is met even for a day.“Due to the likely fall in minimum temperature over north-west India, cold wave conditions are expected to prevail in isolated places in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, north Rajasthan and west Uttar Pradesh between November 27 and November 29,” the IMD said. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said under the influence of the western disturbance, the temperatures mostly tend to spike. However, in this instance, the wind direction will change from easterly to north-westerly from Thursday, bringing in cold winds from the hilly regions of Jammu and Kashmir, and Himachal Pradesh “ Due to the influence of a western disturbance over Afghanistan and neighbouring areas, fairly widespread rainfall, isolated heavy rainfall and snowfall, and isolated hailstorms are likely over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and Himachal Pradesh from November 25, which will result in low temperatures in Delhi as well, he said. The IMD said the minimum temperature in Delhi is expected to remain between 6 and 7 degrees Celsius till November-end.“The skies will be clear again, and this will also cool the surface down faster and reduce the temperature by the end of the week,” Srivastava said. Delhi has been experiencing an unusually cold October and November this year. The month of October had recorded the lowest temperatures in 58 years, with the mean minimum temperature being just 17.2 degrees Celsius. This is the lowest since 1962 when it had been 16.2 degrees Celsius..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/brace-for-cold-wave-conditions-from-saturday/story-t6U2xg0oYRQgkTr3vSivUJ.html
26-11-2020||Delhi||AAP alleges corruption in hospital, BJP hits back||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday alleged corruption in the construction of a hospital by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), a claim denied by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the civic bodies . AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said an “extra payment” was made to the contractor by the civic authorities.Addressing a press conference, Bharadwaj said SDMC had issued a tender of Rs 9.88 crore in 2010 to build the Poornima Sethi Super-Speciality Hospital in Kalkaji but later changed the terms and gave a contract of Rs 30.96 crore to the same contractor.“This 100-bed hospital was supposed to become fully functional by 2012, but could not be built to date. SDMC did not impose a penalty against the contractor despite the delay in construction work. On the contrary, it paid the contractor over Rs 35 crore instead of the fixed cost of Rs 30.96 crore,” Bharadwaj alleged.Bharadwaj said when AAP asked the civic body, it falsely claimed it had paid Rs 28.53 crore against the fixed amount of Rs 30.95 crore. He said that an internal audit report of SDMC indicated the civic body had paid more than Rs 35 crore. He said SDMC did not give any answer to the auditor when asked about the delay in construction.Responding to the allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said no extra payment had been made to contractor. “The work order cost was Rs 30.95 crore and the amount paid is little less than Rs 30 crore. The contractor is demanding additional Rs 2 crore and has gone to court. Had he been paid all the amount, why would he go to the court?” Kapoor asked.Kapoor said the delay in the hospital’s operation was due to SDMC’s financial crunch, caused by the non-release of municipal funds by the Delhi government for several years.He said Poornima Sethi Hospital was envisioned in 2005 with a cost approval of Rs 20.17 crore but due to financial crunch, a small work order of Rs 9.87 crore was issued in 2007. “Later in 2010, additional floors and construction of service flats were added as visioned under MPD 2021 and the cost was revised to Rs 30.95 crore. The hospital work stands almost complete and is awaiting fire clearance from the Delhi government,” he said.The BJP leader said the OPD is already working from the ground and first floors and a 50-bed Covid-19 isolation ward is completed and awaiting the Delhi government’s clearance.He said a dialysis centre will start working on the second floor, followed by a maternity centre on the third floor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-alleges-corruption-in-hospital-bjp-hits-back/story-dcDtIvPC8H0OiPi60diAvK.html

26-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports over 6,000 Covid-19 infections after a gap of 26 days||Maharashtra on Wednesday reported over 6,000 Covid-19 infections after a gap of 26 days (October 30) as 6,159 fresh cases pushed the tally to 1,795,959, amid an upward trend in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune district’s share of active cases.The active caseload in the state stood at 84,464, of which 51,121 cases or 60.52% of the cases were from MMR and Pune district. An analysis of the week-on-week data from September 11, when Maharashtra achieved its peak with 24,886 cases in a day, showed that the share of active cases from these two regions dipped to 48.14% on September 25, but since then it has been on an upward trend even as the daily caseload stabilised.Maharashtra also reported 65 fatalities on Wednesday, of which nine occurred in the past week, to take the death toll to 46,748. Health department officials said Covid-19 had spread in the semi-urban and rural part of the state between June and September, which has gradually stabilised and tapered down in many districts.Also read: Mumbai mayor’s warning: ‘Follow Covid safety norms or we will have no choice but to impose lockdown’“Mumbai, its surrounding cities, and Pune district are densely populated areas. They would naturally have more cases and therefore active cases are higher. The testing in these areas is also higher given more population. Having said that, the festive season resulted in an increased movement of people, coupled with the careless behaviour of people not wearing masks, among others. The result is a gradual increase in cases from these areas,” a state health department official said, requesting anonymity.The state government and the administration have projected that cases would go up post-Diwali and the state would hit its second peak by December-end of in January-February 2021. Since November 16 (a day after Diwali weekend), Maharashtra has added 46,182 cases. Of these, 22,497 cases or 48.71% have come from MMR and Pune district.MMR and Pune district were one of the hotspots during the first peak in the state. Health department officials said that the two regions could become hotspots once again if Covid-appropriate behaviour is not followed by people.Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health expert, said, “People in the slum pockets of Mumbai have developed some antibodies, so people living in the buildings and high-rises are now more susceptible to catching the infection. Similarly for Thane, Navi Mumbai and Pune district, these are densely populated areas. With increased movement of people, work-travel in public transport, cases are expected to rise.” He said that people need to take masking and hand sanitisation even more seriously if another surge in cases is to be prevented.Also read: Maharashtra in safe zone compared to other states for Covid-19, says state health ministerMeanwhile, Mumbai on Wednesday reported 1,144 fresh cases, taking the city’s tally to 278,597.

26-11-2020||Gurugram||Farm bill stir checks hold up traffic on Delhi to Gurugram stretch of expressway||Traffic movement into the city slowed down on the Delhi to Gurugram carriageway of the expressway on Wednesday evening, as the police intensified checking of commuters ahead of the ‘Dilli Chalo’ protest march call given by farmers for Thursday and Friday.The traffic jam started around 3.30pm and was resolved only around 6.30pm, said Gurugram police officers. Movement of vehicles at other borders points with Delhi, however, remained smooth.Ashtha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said, “There was a jam at the border on the Delhi to Gurugram side of the expressway and we coordinated with the Delhi Police to streamline vehicular movement.”Commuters travelling from Delhi to Gurugram on Wednesday evening also said that they faced a long wait to enter the city.Amitabh Singh, an executive working with a multinational electrical company, said it took him half an hour to travel from Mahipalpur in Delhi to Cyber City as he was stopped twice by the Delhi Police. “I had no idea that entering Gurugram is a problem. No advisory was issued on any social media platform. It was said that going to Delhi will be an issue,” he said. However, officials of the Delhi Police denied that there was a jam on the expressway.Ingit Pratap Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (south-west), Delhi Police, said that pickets have been set up on both carriageways at the Rajokri border, near the defunct Sirhaul toll plaza. “The checks were mainly of vehicles entering Delhi, to ensure that protesting farmers do not enter the capital. The picket on the carriageway leading to Gurugram was just set up to check criminal elements, but the checking was not as intense as on the other carriageway, where vehicles were entering Delhi.”Another deputy commissioner of Delhi Police, of a district that has a border in its jurisdiction, said that they are keeping a watch on large vehicles entering the city. “If people are coming in mass in a vehicle, they are being stopped and their identities ascertained. If they are not travelling with families, they are being stopped and checked,” said the DCP, who didn’t want to be identified. The Gurugram Police has deployed 900 personnel at the 13 borders connecting the city with Delhi, Rajasthan, Nuh, Rewari, Sohna and Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway. The police said they have set up 123 barricades in these locations and strict instructions have been given to check all the vehicles.The police said they would check all vehicles and commuters’ identity cards to ensure farmers don’t cross the border. Also, strict checking to ensure no one is moving without a face mask and are adhering to rules and regulation of Covid-19 guidelines will be in place, they said. If there is more than one person in a vehicle, a mask is be compulsory and police teams will fine violators on the spot, said officials. Modi said that the teams were deployed around 4pm at the Sirhaul border. “The traffic movement slowed down due to the checking and people should avoid travelling to Delhi unnecessarily on these two days,” she said. The state government had issued a comprehensive travel advisory on Tuesday that mentioned that commuters are likely to face congestion on the borders connecting to Delhi. Police teams have been instructed not to allow any tractor-trolley or heavy vehicles ferrying farmers. The police said that all large vehicles will be checked on Thursday and Friday. However, farmers marching to Delhi to press the Central government to scrap the farm laws alleged that they would block the roads leading to Delhi if they are not allowed to enter the capital. Nikita Gehlot, the deputy commissioner of police (Manesar), said that the primary objective of the arrangements is to maintain law and order to prevent any violence. The instructions in force due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation have also been kept in mind. “We have received secret information that a large number of protesters are likely to enter Gurugram from different stretches, including KMP Expressway, to reach Delhi. We have intensified night patrolling in all the suspected areas,” she said. Gehlot said they have prepared a strategy to divert traffic if congestion is reported on Thursday and Friday. “During checking on Wednesday, it was observed that people were moving in groups, just to check the ground situation after hearing of strict checking at the borders. We have informed people through social media and other media about these arrangements in advance so that they can plan and modify their journey accordingly, to avoid any inconvenience,” she said.

Within no time nearly 500 National Conference (NC) workers and locals assembled there and started marching towards the BJYM workers. However, a strong posse of police personnel averted the possible clash and cane-charged the NC workers, who outnumbered the BJYM workers. Some BJYM workers ran to safety and hid themselves in some houses while others were taken away by the police. Later, some BJYM workers also alleged that their vehicles were damaged by the NC workers and locals. The NC workers also resorted to intense sloganeering. A NC worker requested lieutenant governer Manoj Sinha and Jammu SSP Shridhar Patil to ensure law and order in Jammu and check divisive forces. “The BJP has failed on all fronts and hence has been raking up such issues. BJYM workers could have staged the protest somewhere else. Why did they chose to protest outside our houses in Bhatindi. I appeal the Jammu deputy commissioner to take cognizance of it. This could have led to communal tension,” he said. Bhatindi under village Sunjwan is a Muslim-dominated area. Another NC worker said that it was a deliberate attempt to create communal tension and vitiate atmosphere ahead of the district development council (DDC) polls. Another NC worker said, “How could the protesters reach outside Farooq’s residence? The administration is hand in glove with the BJP. Nationalism is not the prerogative of BJP alone. The Tricolour is in our hearts but the BJP is hell-bent on vitiating communal harmony ahead of the polls.” Under encroached state land (physically encroached but not shown in revenue record)-other than Roshni, figured names of Farooq and Omar wherein it has been mentioned that under Khasra number 4,5 and 6 in Bahu Tehsil, Village Sunjwan, they have encroached upon seven Kanals and seven marlas of state land (once a forest land). Similarly, figured name of prominent Kashmir hotelier Mushtaq Chaya under Bahu Tehsil, Village Sunjwan in Khasra number 16 with one kanal and five marlas and of Ashraf Mir under Khasra number 17 with one kanal of land under their illegal occupation.

26-11-2020||World||Top UK scientific adviser says AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19 works||The British government’s Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said on Thursday the main point about the AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19 was that it worked, when asked about doubts that have been raised about the vaccine.“The headline result is the vaccine works and that’s very exciting,” Vallance said during a news conference with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Chief Medical Adviser Chris Whitty, answering the same question, said there was always scientific debate about virtually everything.“The key thing from our point of view is to leave this in the hands of the regulator ... They will make an assessment with lots of data that is not currently in the public domain on efficacy and on safety,” Whitty said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-uk-scientific-adviser-says-astrazeneca-vaccine-against-covid-19-works/story-BGBuZR0c5ST7RDqu27Z4aI.html
26-11-2020||World||Astrazeneca likely to run additional global vaccine test, CEO says||AstraZeneca Plc is likely to conduct an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its Covid-19 vaccine, according to the company’s chief executive officer, after current studies raised questions over its level of protection.The new trial would be run instead of adding an arm to an ongoing U.S. trial and would evaluate a lower dosage that performed better than a full amount in Astra’s studies. The company’s acknowledgment that the lower level was given in error fueled concerns, and the new trial would be used to confirm whether or not the higher 90% efficacy rate stands.“Now that we’ve found what looks like a better efficacy we have to validate this, so we need to do an additional study,” CEO Pascal Soriot said in his first interview since the data were released. It will probably be another “international study, but this one could be faster because we know the efficacy is high so we need a smaller number of patients.”Soriot said he didn’t expect the additional trial to hold up regulatory approvals in the U.K. and European Union. Clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may take longer because the regulator is unlikely to approve the vaccine on the basis of studies conducted elsewhere, especially given the questions over the results, he said. Authorization in some countries is still expected before the end of the year, he said.“The question for us was, will we need the U.S. data to get approval in the U.S. or can we get approval in the U.S. with international data, and it was never clear,” said Soriot, who is in quarantine after arriving in Australia. “Now with those results it’s more likely that we will need the U.S. data.”Astra and its CEO are facing scrutiny as the drugmaker responds to growing confusion over the vaccine. The company’s late-stage data initially increased confidence that the world would soon have multiple shots to combat the pathogen, following positive reports from front-runners Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. But scant disclosures and the manufacturing discrepancy have sparked doubts among scientists and investors.Different RatesAstra and its partner, the University of Oxford, reported Monday that a lower initial dose of the vaccine, followed by a full dose, produced a 90% efficacy rate in a smaller set of participants, compared with 62% for two full doses.A day after the data were unveiled the head of the U.S. vaccine program known as Operation Warp Speed said that the regimen showing the higher level of effectiveness was tested in a younger population. He also said that the half-dose was given to some people because of an error in the quantity of vaccine put into some vials. None of those details were disclosed in Astra or Oxford’s original statements.Astra May Need New Covid-19 Vaccine Trial Beyond the U.S.: ReactSoriot disputed the idea that the half-dose regimen was an error, saying that after researchers realized the dosing error they formally changed the trial protocol with the blessing of regulators.“I won’t tell you we expected the efficacy to be higher,” said Soriot. “People call it a mistake -- it’s not a mistake.”Astra shares closed 0.7% lower in London. They have declined about 7% this week amid questions about the trial results.The company has previously said it was considering adding a new arm to its U.S. trial to test the lower dosage.Astra and researchers have declined to provide more data ahead of a peer-reviewed analysis that is expected to be published in the coming weeks. Results have been submitted to an undisclosed journal, Astra said in a statement.Astra’s is one of three vaccines that could be approved before the end of the year. Pfizer and Moderna, which have both created vaccines using messenger RNA, published data earlier this month that showed their vaccines were about 95% effective, and Pfizer has applied to U.S. regulators for emergency approval.There’s added pressure on the Astra shot to succeed because it’s easier to store and the company is selling it at cost during the pandemic, which means many low- and middle-income countries are relying on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-likely-to-run-additional-global-vaccine-test-ceo-says/story-fxpfgx9jJ5GyR62yyApq9L.html
26-11-2020||World||In Georgia, Republicans juggle Biden win and Trump loyalties||Twin Georgia Senate runoffs have Republicans in a quandary. They could admit President Donald Trump lost his re-election bid and turn all attention to salvaging a Senate majority to counter President-elect Joe Biden. Or they could march lockstep alongside Trump and his unfounded assertions of a stolen election.So far, Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, along with a gaggle of GOP power players right up to Vice President Mike Pence, seem to want it both ways. Some Trump loyalists insist that’s not enough.This tightrope act threatens party unity as Loeffler and Perdue try to beat back strong Democratic challenges from Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, respectively, in Jan. 5 contests that will determine which party controls the Senate at the outset of a Biden administration. The worrisome reality for Republicans is that it wouldn’t take much splintering to tilt the contests in Democrats’ favor in a newfound battleground where Biden outpaced Trump by just 12,000 votes out of about 5 million cast in the general election.“If they want to excite Trump supporters to turn out to vote in the Senate runoff, candidates need to be supportive of what the Trump campaign is doing in the regard to challenging the election,” said Debbie Dooley, a national tea party organizer in Georgia and an early supporter of Trump’s 2016 campaign.After Georgia’s Republican secretary of state and Republican governor certified the state’s vote totals in Biden’s favor, Dooley said, the sentiment among the president’s strongest supporters crystallized. They “question why they should support candidates that aren’t fully supporting Trump,” she said.To be sure, Perdue and Loeffler have made considerable efforts to align themselves with Trump throughout their Senate tenures — nearly six years for the first-term Perdue, less than a year for the appointed Loeffler now seeking her first election. Since Election Day, the senators have called for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s resignation. They’ve echoed nebulous claims about irregularities in Georgia’s voting process and tabulation and have yet to publicly acknowledge Biden as the president-elect.Yet the campaign on the ground offers a different story, with the senators and their top supporters stressing an argument that admits, without saying as much, that Biden has been duly elected and will take office on Jan. 20.Perdue calls a Republican Senate “the last line of defense” as he campaigns on a bus emblazoned with a clear message: “Win Georgia. Save America.”On stage recently with Pence in Canton, Georgia, the senator got even more direct, cautioning that if he and Loeffler lose, Democrats will “have the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives. They’ll do anything they want.”Indeed, Democrats are maintaining their House majority and Republicans must win at least one of the Georgia seats for a Senate majority. A Democratic sweep would yield a 50-50 Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking the tie as presiding officer.Loeffler avoids explicit acknowledgements of Trump’s defeat, but her message isn’t subtle. “We are the firewall to socialism in America,” she roared at one of the rallies with Pence.Neither Ossoff nor Warnock is a socialist, but Loeffler’s hyperbole acknowledges that there’ll be Democratic veto pen in the Oval Office. So, Loeffler said, “We are going to hold the line right here in Georgia.”The balancing act extends through Trump’s Cabinet. “I’m here because I stand with President Donald Trump,” Pence declared in Gainesville, Georgia.The vice president, almost certainly a future presidential candidate himself, carefully parsed his words, declaring that a GOP Senate majority “could be” Republicans’ last tool to protect “all that we’ve accomplished.” Pence said nothing to counter the passions of crowds that erupted into chants of “Stop the steal!”Sonny Perdue, Trump’s agriculture secretary and the senator’s cousin, covered every base, perhaps clumsily. The former Georgia governor called Biden’s name, unlike Pence, and warned against giving him “a blank check on America’s values.” Yet in the same speech, the secretary insisted “we’re not going to give up on President Trump.”The circumstances are precarious enough that many establishment Republicans, including Loeffler and Perdue confidants, decline to speak openly about it. The senators have not taken questions at their joint runoff campaign events, and neither campaign responded to an Associated Press inquiry on whether they recognize Biden as the incoming president.Trump is doing little to make his fellow Republicans’ course any easier.The president has chastised Raffensperger, the Georgia elections chief, and Gov. Brian Kemp, himself a former Georgia secretary of state, on social media. Raffensperger has taken to the editorial pages of The Washington Post to defend his job performance and his conservative credentials. When Kemp announced his certification of the 16 Democrats who’ll cast Georgia’s electoral votes for Biden, the governor took pains to make clear it was a purely ministerial act required by law.Trump remains defiant even after losing round after round of court disputes and after the General Services Administration finally acknowledged Biden as president-elect, the legal step required for the federal government to begin the customary transfer of power.As recently as Wednesday, Trump retweeted hollow claims of a fraudulent election, and, in Georgia, his team’s top lawyer, Lin Wood, fanned the flames.Wood tweeted that Loeffler and Perdue should demand that Georgia hold a special legislative session to review ballots and conduct a “legitimate” recount, despite the thorough one that was held, as a condition for getting the votes of Georgians in the run-off.Voters like Shaun Tracy are the targets of the muddled messaging.The 60-year-old came to see Pence, Loeffler and both Perdues, but made clear she was there because of her loyalties to the president. “There’s just been too many irregularities and discrepancies going on,” Tracy said, repeating the baseless assertion that Biden’s victory is due to fraudulent absentee ballots, among other things. “They’re trying to take our freedom away.”Days later, David Perdue heard that refrain more directly.Standing in front of his campaign bus, the senator launched into his usual entreaty about the runoffs’ importance. As Perdue spoke, a man in the audience cried out: “What are you doing to help Donald Trump?”___Associated Press writer Jeff Amy contributed from Canton, Georgia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-georgia-republicans-juggle-biden-win-and-trump-loyalties/story-t5IMpSQLBf8iZ58WLMeFLO.html
26-11-2020||World||‘Why now?’ Dismay as US considers troop pullout from Somalia||No country has been involved in Somalia’s future as much as the United States. Now the Trump administration is thinking of withdrawing the several hundred US military troops from the Horn of Africa nation at what some experts call the worst possible time.Three decades of chaos, from warlords to al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab to the emergence of an Islamic State-linked group, have ripped apart the country that only in the past few years has begun to find its footing. The US Embassy returned to Somalia just last year, 28 years after diplomats and staffers fled.Somalia faces a tense election season that begins in the next few weeks to decide the presidency and parliament. United Nations experts say al-Shabab, supporting its 5,000 to 10,000 fighters on a rich diet of extorting businesses and civilians, is improving its bomb-making skills. And an ever bigger military force, the African Union’s 19,000-strong AMISOM, has begun its own withdrawal from a country whose forces are widely considered unready to assume full responsibility for security.It is not clear whether President Donald Trump will order the withdrawal of the some 700 US military forces from Somalia, following his orders for Afghanistan and Iraq, or whether the reported urge will pass before he leaves office in January. But the idea is taken seriously, even as US drone strikes are expected to continue in Somalia against al-Shabab and IS fighters from neighboring Djibouti and Kenya — where al-Shabab carried out a deadly attack against US forces early this year.The US Africa Command has seen a “definitive shift” this year in al-Shabab’s focus to attack US interests in the region, a new report by the Department of Defense inspector general said Wednesday — and the command says al-Shabab is Africa’s most “dangerous” and “imminent” threat.Here’s what’s at stake:COUNTERTERRORISM“The first thing ... it’s disastrous for Somalia’s security sector, it just causes that first panic reaction: You know, why now?” said Samira Gaid, a Somali national security specialist who served as senior security adviser to the prime minister and special adviser to the head of AMISOM. “Especially since over the past three and half years in particular the security sector really improved, and we tried to work closely with” the US, she told The Associated Press.Recent progress includes a “war council” between the US and Somali governments, she said, where the US helps to draw up military plans. “We call them Somali-led operations, but really the US is hand-holding us through it.”The US military also trains Somalia’s elite Danab special forces that now number around 1,000, and is providing Danab with air cover and intelligence, Gaid said.“Danab was expanding, that’s why this is so shocking,” she said. “Is it possible to move forward with that plan now?”Danab units are now operational in four of Somalia’s five member states, the US military says, and they conducted about 80% of the Somali national army’s offensive forces in the quarter ending Sept. 30 and “nearly all” operations against al-Shabab.The Danab forces also serve as a model for how the rest of Somali military forces can develop to be “more meritocracy and less clan-focused,” said Omar Mahmood, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.The loss of US forces is widely seen as a gain for al-Shabab, and for the far smaller presence of hundreds of IS-affiliated fighters in Somalia’s north. “From the al-Shabab perspective, they just need to hold out,” Mahmood said, and they might even ask themselves what need there is for any potential Taliban-style negotiations.Al-Shabab’s messaging has always stressed the extremist group’s staying power, national security specialist Gaid said: “These external forces will always leave.” A US withdrawal will play into that narrative.Gaid said she doesn’t see any other country stepping into the US military’s role, though a withdrawal would open space for powers like Russia and China. Somalia also has some 1,500 special forces that have been trained by Turkish troops, she said, but “they don’t benefit from Turkish advisers on the ground.”SECURITYWithout US forces, al-Shabab “will find it easier to overrun AMISOM, let alone the Somali national army,” Vanda Felbab-Brown, co-director of the African Security Initiative at the Brookings Institution, told an online event this week. And with neighboring Ethiopia’s conflict increasing pressure to withdraw more Ethiopian forces from Somalia, a US troop withdrawal “is really just the worst time.”The support that US forces give AMISOM is “huge,” Gaid said, including as a key interlocutor with Somali forces. And with AMISOM also drawing down by the end of next year, “it’s a tricky time.”The US has said implementation of the plan for Somali forces to take over the country’s security next year is “badly off track,” said the new report by the Department of Defense inspector general.Somali forces cannot contain the al-Shabab threat on its own, the report said. They still rely on the international community for financial support, and yet they “sometimes go unpaid for months.”Maybe a US withdrawal would lead the AMISOM force to adjust its own withdrawal timeline “more realistically,” Mahmood said.The US has been the most engaged security partner in Somalia “willing to get down and dirty,” he added. But no other country appears to have the willingness to replace what US forces are doing on the groundAnd a withdrawal of both the US and AMISOM would risk leaving the impression that “Somalia increasingly can rely less and less on external security partners,” Mahmood said.POLITICAL STABILITYSomalia is on the brink of elections, with the parliamentary vote scheduled in December and the presidential one in February. What had meant to be the country’s first one-person-one-vote election in decades instead remains limited by disputes between the federal government and regional ones — which the US has said also weakens command and control of Somali forces.At least keep US forces in Somalia until after the elections, Felbab-Brown wrote this week, warning of possible post-election violence or al-Shabab taking advantage of any chaos.Even though US forces don’t provide election security, “our problem is, with the US focused on a drawdown of troops, it would not be focused on how the elections are going politically,” Gaid said.The US has been one of the most vocal actors on Somalia’s election process, she said. “We were all expecting after November that the US would be clear on a lot of stuff. Now it seems we have to wait.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-now-dismay-as-us-considers-troop-pullout-from-somalia/story-tZSDO8L2ZCEzLmFTzV5qFP.html

Curbs across the European Union and elsewhere also impacted travel to the UK.UK granted 917,683 visitor visas granted in the year ending September 2020, a 61% fall due to the pandemic, as against the general upward trend over the last 10 years. Chinese (171,610) and Indian (156,725) nationals together accounted for 36% of all visitor visas granted.Indian professionals accounted for almost half (45%) of all Tier 2 visas granted, but their number of grants fell by 36% to 36,219 in the year ending September 2020. In the year ending September 2019, 56,164 such visas were granted to Indians.The top non-EU nationality granted British citizenship during the year was Indian (11,801). The citizenship is granted after a period of mandatory stay in the UK, usually five years in the case of professionals.There was a “notable increase” in the number of Tier 4 (student) visas granted to Indians: an increase of 48% compared to the year ending September 2019, and continuing an increase seen since 2016.However, how many of them actually arrived to begin their courses at UK universities and higher education institutions from September will not be clear until early 2021 when new student enrolment figures are released.The number of student visas to Indians was up 14,496 or 48% to 44,992. India was the only nationality to see a large increase and now account for 26% of all Tier 4 visas in the year ending September 2020, up from 11% a year earlier, the Home Office said.While Tier 4 visas to Indian nationals decreased by 6,444 or 48% from April-August 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to Covid-19, the significant increase in other months of the year ending September 2020 sustained a notable increase compared to 2019.Those arriving in the UK on student visas bring relatively few dependants. In the year ending September 2020 the top three nationalities accounted for more than two thirds (68%) of Tier 4 dependants: India (40%), Nigeria (15%), and Saudi Arabia (14%).On grants related to family visas, officials said there was a fall for most nationalities as a result of the pandemic, but there were particular falls for the top two nationalities: Pakistan (down 2,588 or 28%), India (down 778 or 19%),Indian nationals in the UK were granted the highest number of all work-related extensions during the year (41% of the total, which reflects the higher proportion of successful applications for Tier 2 visas issued to Indian professionals).Up to the end of September 2020, 14,612 Indians who were unable to travel home at the end of their current visa were given visa extensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-hit-uk-immigration-but-indians-among-top-to-get-visas/story-Prkq4A3fDYtoNjCL9x6pcI.html
26-11-2020||World||Joe Biden could soon reveal his stance on ‘court-packing’. Here’s why||President-elect Joe Biden has been dodging the question around “packing” the Supreme Court, but the recent ruling to block the enforcement of Covid-19 restrictions on religious congregations could prompt the Democrat to reveal his stance. Before the US elections, President Donald Trump announced the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the top court seat, replacing liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg who died in September. Later, Senate confirmed the nomination of Barrett, which gave the Supreme Court a 6-3 conservative majority. On the night before Thanksgiving, newly-inducted Barrett sided with her conservative colleagues to block New York Governor Andrew Cuomo from enforcing Covid-19 restrictions, which limited the number of people attending religious services. While Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberal justices in dissent, the 5-4 ruling highlighted Barrett’s impact on the court.Also Read | How Trump compares to other US presidents on pardons and commutationsWhat is ‘court-packing’?‘Court-packing’ means adding seats to the bench of the US Supreme Court by passing a law. The strength of the bench has remained at nine for 151 years and there is no term limit on the top court justices. In such a scenario, a judge can serve in the apex court for decades, which makes an appointment highly consequential on contentious matters.Barrett is popular among the religious conservatives and anti-abortion campaigners and it was expected that her appointment would impact some of the most partisan issues. During the first presidential debate, Fox News moderator had asked Biden on his thought over packing the Supreme Court. “Whatever position I take, it will become an issue,” said Biden, refusing to share his stance on the matter.At a campaign rally in Arizona, Biden reiterated that he would not discuss court-packing till the presidential elections, arguing that his comment would divert the attention from other burning issues. While Biden’s comment indicated that the issue was not central to the Democratic campaign, it has been one of the most debated topics around the Supreme Court, and people of the United States could get their answer soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-could-soon-reveal-his-stance-on-court-packing-here-s-why/story-retpBjcwUiia6Ti8fKssQJ.html
26-11-2020||World||Joe Biden calls for unity against Covid-19; Donald Trump wants election loss overturned||US President-elect Joe Biden called for unity and hope in a Thanksgiving eve address to Americans, reminding them that the country was at “war with the virus, and not with each other” even as President Donald Trump railed against the election outcome, called for his defeat to be “turned around”, and pardoned a former top aide who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.The contrast between the two leaders, their priorities and their styles played out in full public view over the day on Wednesday. A sombre Biden spoke to Americans from an empty music hall about the need for “solutions, not shouting; reason, not hyper-partisanship; light, not heat”, and urged them not to despair in the face of the pandemic, which has killed more than 260,000 Americans. Speaking of the Covid-19 vaccines in the pipeline, he said, “Hang on, don’t let yourself surrender.”Trump stayed home at the White House, rage-tweeted - “RIGGED ELECTION” - about the polls, barely mentioned the pandemic or greeted the nation on Thanksgiving, phoned into a packed news conference held by his allies in Pennsylvania, and called for “this election to be turned around”.The White House issued a standard Thanksgiving proclamation signed by the president. But Trump sent his greetings only to former national security adviser Michael Flynn, while granting him full pardon. The Washington Post slammed the pardon as a “parting disgrace” from the outgoing president.President-elect Biden, who has sought to stay above Trump’s persisting attempts to challenge his election and obstruct smooth transfer of power, addressed the issue head on.“In America, we have full and fair and free elections, and then we honour the results,” he said without naming anyone. “The people of this nation and the laws of the land won’t stand for anything else.”Biden said he understood the task of unifying the country is not be easy, but he insisted he was determined to bring together Democrats, Republicans and Independents. He added, “Americans dream big. And, as hard as it may seem this Thanksgiving, we are going to dream big again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-for-unity-against-covid-19-donald-trump-wants-election-loss-overturned/story-PJprAq2Dkm15UL2jQP5euN.html
26-11-2020||World||Corruption trial for France’s Nicolas Sarkozy to begin on Monday||A landmark trial involving allegations of corruption and influence-peddling by former French President Nicolas Sarkozy will begin in earnest Monday, after a Paris court rejected an appeal for a delay by an ailing co-defendant.After the co-defendant, 73-year-old magistrate Gilbert Azibert, was examined by a judicial expert at his Bordeaux home, the judges ruled Thursday that he was fit to appear in person in court.The trial was meant to begin earlier this week, but Azibert’s lawyer argued that his client’s poor health made it risky for him to travel and appear in court amid the coronavirus pandemic. Judges suspended the proceedings until Thursday pending the expert medical report.It’s the first time the 65-year-old Sarkozy is facing trial, though the conservative politician is the target of multiple investigations.In the current case, Sarkozy is accused of having tried to illegally obtain information from Azibert about a campaign finance investigation in 2014.Sarkozy, Azibert and Sarkozy’s former lawyer, Thierry Herzog, face prison sentences of up to 10 years and a maximum fine of 1 million euros ($1.2 million). They deny any wrongdoing.Azibert’s lawyer, Dominique Allegrini, disagreed with Thursday’s decision but said “what really matters now is seeing the debates continue in serene conditions so that we can, finally … present Gilbert Azibert’s defense and defend his honor after it was mistreated during the several years of the investigation.”Sarkozy was president from 2007 to 2012. He withdrew from active politics after failing to be chosen as his conservative party’s presidential candidate for France’s 2017 election, won by Emmanuel Macron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/corruption-trial-for-france-s-nicolas-sarkozy-to-begin-on-monday/story-PrwWtl51qaPqZRK5jQXadL.html
26-11-2020||World||Covid-19 in US: Schools struggle to stay open as quarantines sideline staff||The infection of a single cafeteria worker was all it took to close classrooms in the small Lowellville school district in northeastern Ohio, forcing at least two weeks of remote learning.Not only did the worker who tested positive for the coronavirus need to quarantine, but so did the entire cafeteria staff and most of the transportation crew, because some employees work on both. The district of about 500 students sharing one building had resumed in-person instruction with masks and social distancing and avoided any student infections. But without enough substitute workers, administrators had no choice but to temporarily abandon classroom operations and meal services.“It boils down to the staff,” Lowellville Superintendent Geno Thomas said. “If you can’t staff a school, you have to bring it to remote.”Around the country, contact tracing and isolation protocols are sidelining school employees and closing school buildings. The staffing challenges force students out of classrooms, even in districts where officials say the health risks of in-person learning are manageable. And the absences add to the strain from a wave of early retirements and leaves taken by employees worried about health risks.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIt’s another layer of the “tremendous stress” faced by administrators and educators navigating the pandemic, said Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA, the nation’s leading school superintendents association.The superintendent in Groton, Connecticut, recently announced the entire district would transition to distance learning for two weeks following Thanksgiving — a decision driven primarily by a staffing shortage.“When you have the wrong teacher, like an art teacher who over a two-day period sees as many as 80 children, you’ve got the possibility of a really significant number of contacts,” he said. “It’s not being transmitted in schools apparently, but we have lots of cases of children and staff members who are getting it very typically from a family member.”In Kansas, the 27,000-student Shawnee Mission School District announced recently that middle and high school students would return to remote learning until January because of difficulty keeping buildings staffed. Scores of employees are quarantined because of known or potential exposure.“It is important to emphasize that this decision is not being made because of Covid-19 transmission within our schools,” Superintendent Mike Fulton wrote to families. He said available substitute teachers would be shifted to elementary schools to keep up in-person learning for younger students.Social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands and completing daily Covid-19 assessments “seem to be working to keep transmission low within schools,” Fulton said.The effects of school staffing struggles have prompted some officials to suggest relaxing quarantine rules.On Monday, leaders of several Louisiana public school systems told the state House health committee that too many students are missing in-person classroom instruction because they have been sent home for 14 days to quarantine. The state health department said it would not recommend any changes to quarantine regulations.“We have a lot of healthy kids who are home when they don’t need to be,” West Baton Rouge Parish Superintendent Wesley Watts told lawmakers. “We’re not asking to do away with quarantine. We’re just asking for some modifications.”In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Parson took a different approach to trying to keep schools open. He announced new guidance this month that teachers and students exposed to an infected person no longer have to quarantine for two weeks as long as both people were wearing masks. He said quarantines had interrupted learning and created staff shortages.Also Read: One third of England face toughest Covid-19 curbs, London spared for nowShortages of substitute teachers have compounded the personnel problems.“I think everybody understands when you can’t have enough subs to fill the roles, it’s also a safety issue: You can’t have that many children without support from adults,” said Julie Mackett, a kindergarten teacher in Perrysburg, Ohio, who went through her own two-week quarantine early in the school year after a student tested positive.Staffing shortages in her district in mid-November moved up the start of a return to remote learning around Thanksgiving for Perrysburg’s high schoolers, and the district was closely monitoring elementary schools.Cincinnati’s public school system pointed to staffing concerns and surging virus cases in southwest Ohio when it decided to shift to distance learning until after winter break. It noted that community spread of the virus directly affects staff absences.“Teachers and staff must stay home when sick, when in quarantine as a result of a close contact or as needed to take care of family members,” the district said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-in-us-schools-struggle-to-stay-open-as-quarantines-sideline-staff/story-Lx2J6nJUOHgdhuvhCpnOvK.html

He also informed organisers of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) rally to be held in Multan that instead of appearing in person, he would give his speech via video link. The rally coincides with the PPP foundation day on November 30.Apart from his absence from the crucial Multan rally, Bilawal will also be missing the engagement of his sister, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, to a Dubai-based businessman which will take place over the weekend.Bilawal tweeted that he was currently experiencing mild symptoms. “I’ll continue working from home and will be addressing PPP foundation day via video link. Wear a mask everyone, see you on the other side.”A second and deadlier wave of the coronavirus has shown an increased rise in cases in Pakistan. Pakistan reported 3,306 infections on Thursday, a day after it confirmed more than 3,000 daily infections for the first time since July.Prime Minister Imran Khan had criticised the PDM for holding rallies at a time when the second wave of the pandemic hit Pakistan. Last week, the Pakistan PM warned that his government would be compelled to enforce complete lockdown if the opposition did not desist from holding public gatherings at a time when the country was reeling under the impact of Covid-19.Khan tweeted that the 11-party PDM would be responsible for the consequences if it continued with its rallies. “In (Pakistan), the PDM by continuing with jalsas (public gatherings) is deliberately endangering lives and livelihoods (because) if cases continue to rise at the rate we are seeing, we will be compelled to go into complete lockdown & PDM will be responsible for consequences,” Khan said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-politician-bilawal-bhutto-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-dgRlSTXSi75ytk4MTtTrVL.html
26-11-2020||World||One third of England face toughest Covid-19 curbs, London spared for now||More than 20 million people across large swathes of England will be forced to live under the toughest category of Covid-19 restrictions when a national lockdown ends on Dec. 2, while London was placed in the “high alert” second-toughest tier.Health minister Matt Hancock on Thursday announced final details of a regional system set to take effect when blanket restrictions on England’s 55 million population end after a month-long lockdown - dictating the terms of daily life for the country’s citizens and businesses.“Hope is on the horizon but we still have further to go so we must all dig deep. The end is in sight, we mustn’t give up now,” Hancock told parliament, alluding to growing prospects for a vaccine against the coronavirus in the coming months.Britain has Europe’s highest official death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic and has been hit hard by a second wave. The government’s response on lockdown rules, procurement and testing has been criticised as disjointed, expensive and slow.“We must follow these new rules and make sure that our actions today will save lives in future and help get our country through this,” Hancock said. Thursday’s decision had been keenly awaited by businesses across the country whose ability to trade in the critical pre-Christmas period will be affected. Hospitality is one of the large sectors that will suffer the most in higher tiers.Hancock said cases were rising in parts of the capital and needed to be brought under control.London will be in tier 2; it was also in tier 2 before the national lockdown was imposed, although a tighter set of rules for each tier was announced earlier this week.For London, this means no mixing of households indoors and a maximum of six people permitted to meet outdoors, hospitality venues can only offer alcohol alongside a substantial meal, and attendance will be tightly limited at sporting events.PRE-CHRISTMAS ‘SIGH OF RELIEF’“Many businesses across London and the Square Mile will be breathing a collective sigh of relief now that they will be able to trade in the run up to Christmas,” said City of London Corporation Policy Chairwoman Catherine McGuinness. However some large regions of England, including the northern city of Manchester and the prosperous southeastern county of Kent, were placed in tier 3, the most restrictive, where the rate of infection is highest.In tier 3, hospitality venues must remain closed, except for takeaway services.“This will cause real hardship for people whose jobs will be affected and risk the loss of many businesses,” Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said. The decisions have been made according to five criteria, including the pressure on health services in each region and the rate of change in positive coronavirus cases.The announcement angered some local and regional politicians in the hardest hit areas, goading a rebellious core within the ruling Conservative Party who feel the government is overreacting and unjustifiably restricting daily life.“The authoritarianism at work today is truly appalling. But is it necessary and proportionate to the threat from this disease?” Conservative lawmaker said on Twitter, demanding the government publish their evidence.Only three regions in England were placed in the lowest tier 1 category: the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly - all far removed from more heavily populated metropolitan areas of the country. Tiers will be reviewed on Dec. 16, making it possible for areas that slow the spread of the virus to be moved down a notch before Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-third-of-england-face-toughest-covid-19-curbs-london-spared-for-now/story-ZYi76QL5RcMby44SnulFTL.html
26-11-2020||World||Adults, children must move more to stay fit in Covid-19 pandemic era: WHO||All adults should do a minimum of 150 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week, even more vital for well-being and mental health in the Covid-19 era, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday in its first guidance in a decade.It recommended that children and adolescents have an average of one hour of daily physical exercise and limit time in front of electronic screens.And people of all ages must compensate for growing sedentary behaviour with physical activity to ward off disease and add years to their lives, the WHO said, launching its “Every Move Counts” campaign.“Increasing physical activity not only helps prevent and manage heart disease, type-2 diabetes and cancer, it also reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety, reduces cognitive decline including Alzheimer’s and improves memory,” Ruediger Krech, WHO director for health promotion, told a news briefing.Yet one in four adults and a “staggering” four out of five adolescents do not get enough physical activity, which can include walking, cycling, gardening and cleaning, the WHO said. “These guidelines emphasise what many are experiencing during the Covid restrictions that are applied all over the world. And that is that being active every day is good not only our bodies but also our mental health,” said Fiona Bull, head of WHO’s physical activity unit.“Phone a friend and do classes online together, help your family members, do it as a family. And when you can, get outside,” she said.Research into the ill-effects of sedentary behaviour has grown in the past decade, leading to the new advice, Bull said.“That is limit sedentary time, and do more activity to offset sedentary time, particularly for those who do long hours of sedentary, which includes a lot of people who have got office-based work environments,” she said. “For children we also recommend they limit sedentary time, particularly screen time.” Pregnant women and postpartum mothers are now included in the recommendations of 150 to 300 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week for adults.This brings health benefits for both the mother and baby, according to Juana Willumsen, a WHO technical officer. “For example there is a 30% reduction in gestational diabetes amongst women who are physically active during pregnancy,” she said.Adults above 65 are advised to add muscle strengthening and activities focusing on balance and coordination to help prevent falls later.Devices worn on the wrist or hip that track physical activity are helpful for all, Bull said. “Monitoring how active you are is very good feedback,” she said. “That is important because we tend to think we might be more active. We tend to underestimate how much time we spend sedentary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/adults-children-must-move-more-to-stay-fit-in-covid-10-pandemic-era-who/story-pcSe3SqtBm7LbStbBkgIQM.html

Turkey has relied on the good personal ties between Erdogan and US President Donald Trump to smooth over divisions, but Biden is expected to be tougher on Turkey over foreign and defence policies and Ankara’s human rights record.Ankara’s purchase last year of the S-400s, which are not compatible with NATO defences, raised the prospect of US sanctions early next year if Congress approves a defence spending bill which the House of Representatives has already voted to include language requiring the president to sanction Turkey. In an interview with Reuters, AK Party Deputy Chairman Numan Kurtulmus played down that prospect.“The US President will most likely watch the balance in the Middle East very carefully for US interests, and will not want to continue the tense ties with Turkey,” Kurtulmus said.“...I believe they will take positive steps in the future.”PROMISED REFORMSWashington says the S-400s pose a threat to the capabilities of its F-35 stealth fighter jets and has removed Turkey from the jet programme where it was a manufacturer and buyer. Ankara says the S-400s will not be integrated into NATO and has called for a joint working group to discuss US concerns. Kurtulmus repeated that Turkey would not bow to pressure to return the Russian systems, or leave them unused.“Sorry, but we didn’t procure these to hide them. We got them to meet Turkey’s security needs,” he said.While Erdogan has downplayed the possible fallout from these sanctions and vowed counter-sanctions, he has also promised economic and judicial reforms, following an overhaul of Turkey’s economic leadership amid a plunge in the lira.Asked if the reforms were aimed at easing tensions with the United States and the European Union, which will also evaluate possible sanctions against Ankara next month, Kurtulmus said the government would act only for Turkey’s interest.“We act by thinking about what reforms we need, what steps to democratization will benefit our people and move on that path, not by thinking what act or rhetoric would please them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-does-not-expect-us-sanctions-over-russian-s-400s-under-joe-biden/story-t4FrC9qKyeRVA5jltZkksJ.html
26-11-2020||World||Pakistan tries to brush off OIC snub on not discussing Kashmir issue||Pakistan on Thursday tried to brush aside reports that the Kashmir issue was not part of a foreign ministers’ meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), calling them “part of false Indian propaganda”.The OIC statements, both in English and Arabic, issued for Friday’s Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) meeting in Niamey, capital of Niger, made no mention of Kashmir in the agenda announced in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia which is currently leading the grouping. A report in Daily Dawn newspaper said the latest omission comes at a time when ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and UAE remain strained over what Pakistani diplomats say are “unfulfilled expectations”.But foreign office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri told a weekly press briefing that the Kashmir issue was a “permanent item” on the OIC agenda.He said Friday’s would be the first CFM meeting after India revoked Kashmir’s special status in August last year.“It is expected that the session would reiterate its strong support to the Kashmir cause. Let me confirm that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute continue (s) to be amongst the longest standing items on the OIC agenda,” he insisted.The spokesperson also said that OIC has been “unambiguously pronouncing itself on the issue for decades, through a succession of summit as well as CFM resolutions.”He insisted that the OIC had spoken on the Kashmir issue multiple times and has “called for a settlement [...] with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. The OIC Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir has met thrice in the past 15 months, Chaudhri said, adding that a meeting of the group with foreign ministers was held in June this year.“The final communique of that meeting called upon India to rescind its illegal actions and stop egregious human rights violations in the illegally occupied territory,” he said.Pakistan is being represented at the meeting by foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who left Islamabad on Wednesday for participating in the OIC meeting.Before leaving for Niger, Qureshi told journalists he would raise the Kashmir issue and Islamophobia at the two-day meeting.“I will focus on the Kashmir issue and Islamophobia at the meeting. We will discuss the issues faced by the Muslim Ummah (nation) at the meeting,” he said.The foreign minister said that on the sidelines of the meeting, he will also hold bilateral parleys with his counterparts from the Islamic countries. “The OIC members will give their positions on the international issues and efforts would be made to evolve a joint stand by the Muslim-majority countries,” he added.In August, Qureshi had asked the OIC to “stop dilly-dallying” on the convening of a meeting of its Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) on Kashmir, angering the grouping’s Saudi leadership.“If you cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris,” he had said at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-tries-to-brush-off-oic-snub-on-not-discussing-kashmir-issue/story-12Cn49kDWOvM1VsiX9E0bK.html
26-11-2020||World||Fast spreading bird flu puts European poultry industry on edge||A highly contagious and deadly form of avian influenza is spreading rapidly in Europe, putting the poultry industry on alert with previous outbreaks in mind that saw tens of millions of birds culled and significant economic losses.The disease, commonly called bird flu, has been found in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and, for the first time this week in Croatia, Slovenia and Poland, after severely hitting Russia, Kazakhstan and Israel.The vast majority of cases are in migrating wild birds but outbreaks have been reported on farms, leading to the death or culling of at least 1.6 million chickens and ducks so far around the region.In the Netherlands, Europe’s largest exporter of chicken meat and eggs, nearly 500,000 chickens died or were culled due to the virus this autumn, and over 900,000 hens died on one single farm in Poland this week, the countries’ ministries said.“The risk of a transfer in poultry farms and more cases among wild birds is higher than in the past two years because of the massive appearance of various bird flu viruses in Europe,” said a spokeswoman for the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute, Germany’s federal animal disease research agency.Russia’s poultry death toll reached 1.8 million by the end of October, with nearly 1.6 million of that on one farm near Kazakhstan, data by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) showed.The main strain found this year in Europe is H5N8, which decimated flocks in 2016/17 when the region recorded its largest outbreak in poultry and wild birds, but there were also reports of H5N5 and H5N1.Although the risk to humans is low, the European Food Safety Agency EFSA said this week that the virus’ evolution needed to be closely monitored. A strain of H5N1 has been known to spread to humans.EU poultry industry players said they were very concerned about the latest outbreak but were now experienced in dealing with them. “We have worked so hard to improve safety, to train breeders and improve traceability that we hope that if there are cases we will manage to contain them,” said Anne Richard, head of France’s poultry industry lobby ANVOL.Most counties have raised their alert status to “high”, implying that poultry and birds of all types be kept indoors or protected in order to avoid contact with wild birds.Bird flu outbreaks like other animal diseases often prompt importing countries to impose trade restrictions. That will add to coronavirus-related lockdowns threatening to curb year-end holiday sales.“It’s already difficult to export with the Covid, it would make it even worse,” Denis Lambert, chief executive of France’s largest poultry group LDC told reporters on Wednesday.However, importing countries’ approach to limit restrictions to regions affected by the virus should help soften the impact. China, for example, has suspended imports of poultry products from four regions in Russia due to bird flu, TASS news agency reported on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fast-spreading-bird-flu-puts-european-poultry-industry-on-edge/story-taAuTOm5VMJekfCk8ANHWO.html
26-11-2020||World||New counter-terror centre set up in Britain||A new London-based Counter Terrorism Operations Centre, manned by officers of Scotland Yard, intelligence agency MI5 and others, has been established to improve coordination and response to attacks in the capital and across the UK, officials said on Thursday.Funding for the centre was confirmed by chancellor Rishi Sunak in the House of Commons on Wednesday evening. The centre, which for the first time brings all London-based counter-terrorism institutions in one place, was planned since the terror attacks in London during 2017.The current UK threat level from international terrorism is ‘severe’, which means an attack is highly likely.Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police commissioner said: “Following the dreadful attacks of 2017, I, along with the Director General of MI5, committed both our organisations to identify exactly where we could learn from those events and continually improve the way we work together to protect the public from the terrorist threat; the concept of bringing police closer together with our national security partners into a joint operations centre came directly out of this learning”.“Since 2017 we have worked closely with the Mayor of London, our intelligence agency and security partners and the government to turn the concept into reality. The investment…will assist significantly in keeping London and the United Kingdom safe,” she said.Officials said the centre was developed following the series of attacks in 2017 which killed 36 people and caused injury and life-changing impacts to many others. The attacks and the subsequent operational improvement review highlighted the need to further develop counter-terrorism response to ensure it continues to adapt to an evolving threat.Basing the centre in London will enable co-location of the London-based elements of counter terrorism policing, the intelligence agencies, and the criminal justice system, as well as other agencies focused on tackling the threat from terrorism, they added.Neil Basu, head of Counter Terrorism Policing in Scotland Yard, said: “The creation of a world-leading, fully integrated counter terrorism operations centre is a genuinely historic milestone. Counter Terrorism Policing and our national security partners have always had a close and effective working relationship, but being co-located is an opportunity for us to take that one step further, and will only improve our ability to protect the UK and its citizens”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-counter-terror-centre-set-up-in-britain/story-lxK2FK6XfQQ39Yn2Jyc1DP.html

Austria is investigating 21 people and has remanded 10 in custody on suspicion of being connected to the attack.“The investigation’s findings currently show that it cannot be ruled out that the perpetrator also wanted to deliberately seek out victims in churches,” Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told a news conference.“There will therefore be a reinforced protection of church facilities as of today,” he said, adding that the aim was to guard against copycat attacks in the “sensitive phase” following the Nov. 2 attack and in the run-up to Christmas.Much about what happened before the attack, including how the gunman got to the scene of his rampage in the centre of the Austrian capital, remains unknown.Austrian authorities have admitted “intolerable mistakes” were made in the handling of intelligence on the attacker, which included an attempt to buy ammunition in Slovakia and a meeting in Vienna with known foreign Islamists. They say he could have been considered a greater threat and monitored more closely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-tightens-security-at-churches-citing-vienna-attack-inquiry/story-flJoQaJJEVA33ce76MmhLO.html
26-11-2020||World||EU nations on Mediterranean coast renew push for migrant quotas||The four European Union countries hardest hit by the arrival of hundreds of thousands of unauthorized migrants over the past five years said Thursday they fear that new proposals to revamp the EU’s asylum system will continue to leave them shouldering most of the burden.Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain said in a joint paper that mandatory quotas for sharing out people who qualify for refugee status among the 27 EU countries must be pursued, despite the outright rejection of such a move by Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and others.The four’s demands could be a major setback for the asylum reform plans.“The front-line member states cannot face the migratory pressure on the whole European Union,” said the text. It was sent to the president of the European Commission, which drew up the new asylum proposals, the EU Council representing member countries and Germany, which holds the bloc’s presidency.The entry in 2015 of well over 1 million migrants, mostly people fleeing conflict in Syria, sounded the death knell for the EU’s asylum system, and sparked a deep political crisis that continues to echo even though entries have dropped to a relative trickle.The row over who should take responsibility for people when they arrive and how much other EU countries should assist has helped fuel public support for far-right parties across the bloc. Populist governments in Hungary and Poland, notably, challenged a previous system of migrant quotas at Europe’s top court.In the text, seen by The Associated Press, Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain argue that their responsibilities as countries where most unauthorized migrants arrive across the Mediterranean Sea are strict and clear in the “New Pact for Migration and Asylum,” but that the duties of their EU partners are not.“The solidarity mechanism remains complex and vague,” the four countries said.“The notion of mandatory relocation should remain and be pursued as the main solidarity tool,” the text continued.Under the proposed reforms, migrants arriving at Europe’s outside borders without permission to enter would be screened within five days. They would then enter an asylum procedure or be deported, both within 12 weeks. People could be held in detention and would not be deemed to have officially entered the EU.EU countries would then face two choices: take in some of the refugees or provide other material and logistical support; or if they are not willing to do that, they could take charge of deporting people whose applications are refused. Mandatory refugee quotas have been abandoned.Broadly speaking, countries that agree to host refugees would receive 10,000 euros ($11,900) per person in assistance from the EU’s coffers. The others, dubbed “Europe’s bouncers,” would have up to eight months to deport people not allowed in or be forced to accept them.In recent years, only about a third of all people ordered to be sent home were actually deported.Germany has said it wants to reach a political agreement between EU countries and the European Parliament on the asylum reforms by the end of the year, in the hope that they could be officially endorsed early in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-nations-on-mediterranean-coast-renew-push-for-migrant-quotas/story-z127TqsPqq6NUKsaWx9uAN.html
26-11-2020||World||AstraZeneca faces more vaccine questions after manufacturing error||AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford, among the front-runners in the quest to deliver a Covid-19 vaccine, face mounting questions about their trial results after acknowledging a manufacturing error.While an announcement Monday by Astra and Oxford showed their shot was 70% effective on average in a late-stage study, the scant details released by the UK partners have sparked worries about whether regulators would clear it. In a later statement, Oxford said a difference in manufacturing processes led to some participants being given a half dose instead of a full one.Astra and Oxford said their vaccine was 90% effective when a half-dose was given before a full-dose booster, and that two full doses showed an efficacy of 62%. But the head of the US vaccine program known as Operation Warp Speed said the next day that the dose showing the higher level of effectiveness was tested in a younger population, and that the half-dose was given to some people because of an error in the quantity of vaccine put into some vials. None of this was disclosed in Astra’s original statement.The findings had fueled optimism that an end to the pandemic is in sight and that multiple vaccines to combat Covid-19 could be ready soon following positive results from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. Astra and Oxford remain near the front of the pack, although the way they have handled the large trial has rattled scientists and investors, raising the risk it could slow them down.“Any time you have confusion in trials it’s not a good thing because it effectively removes any kind of credibility you had,” said Ketan Patel, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management. “I think there will be a lot more scrutiny of Astra’s product due to the manufacturing issue.”In its statement, Oxford said that when it was apparent that a lower dose was used, it was discussed with regulators, and an agreement was reached to push ahead with the two regimens. “The methods for measuring the concentration are now established and we can ensure that all batches of vaccine are now equivalent,” according to the university.A spokesman for Astra said the trials were conducted “to the highest standards” and more analysis is being done to refine the efficacy reading.Astra shares were little changed Thursday after slumping 6.2% earlier in the week amid questions about the trial results.‘Unknown’ Efficacy“The most likely explanation for the divergent efficacy in its interim analysis is either chance or patient demographics,” Sam Fazeli, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, wrote in a note. “Either way, approval based on current data means people will be inoculated with a vaccine the true efficacy of which is unknown.”The battle against Covid-19 is at a turning point with encouraging vaccine trial findings coming this month. One vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech SE and another from Moderna Inc. were both about 95% effective in preliminary analyses of trials of tens of thousands of volunteers.Fazeli added: “We remain most convinced by the Moderna and Pfizer data for now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-faces-more-vaccine-questions-after-manufacturing-error/story-ZQIAWS3lkhr6vvmVK6pxFM.html

Asked about its co-operation with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it said in an email the agency may not be able to synchronise the decision making process with other international regulators.The EMA started a real-time review of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Oct. 6 to speed up the process of approving a successful vaccine in the bloc, by allowing researchers to submit findings in real time, without waiting for studies to conclude.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-drugs-watchdog-expects-first-application-for-covid-19-vaccine-in-days/story-12QGrSYrU23DsSCQNcp95N.html

Russia has experienced a surge in infections since September, but authorities have resisted imposing lockdowns, relying instead on targeted measures in certain regions. Speaking at the inauguration via video link, Putin said the plant would produce Covid-19 drugs, as well as medicine used to treat tuberculosis, diabetes, hepatitis and other diseases.“People need these drugs,” he said. “They need them literally every day.”Russia reported a record high of 25,487 new coronavirus infections on Thursday and 524 deaths in the last 24 hours, the highest numbers it has reported since the start of the pandemic. Roszdravnadzor, the healthcare watchdog, said on Thursday that some regions in the country of around 145 million were running out of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients, the TASS and RIA news agencies reported. Authorities in Moscow, which reported 6,075 new cases on Thursday, extended a recommended self-isolation period for residents over 65 and those in high-risk groups until Jan. 15.Companies that had been ordered to have at least 30% of their staff work remotely must continue doing so until mid-January, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.Sobyanin said the city’s healthcare system was under pressure but still able to sustain an influx of Covid-19 patients. “Experts believe that in these conditions there is no need to introduce additional restrictions, but lifting the ones that are already in place would be premature and a reckless decision,” Sobyanin wrote on his website. With 2,187,990 infections, Russia currently has the fourth-largest number of Covid-19 cases in the world behind the United States, India and Brazil. Russia said on Thursday it had recorded 38,062 deaths related to Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic.Russia says its Sputnik V vaccine is 92% effective at protecting people from Covid-19, according to interim trial results, as Moscow rushes to keep pace with Western drugmakers in the race for a shot.

We will be trying to coordinate in Europe whether we could close all ski resorts,” Merkel told parliament, adding that this might not be possible given resistance from Austria, but Germany would try again.In the first wave of the coronavirus at the start of the year, many Germans were infected at the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl. Germany last month issued travel warnings for popular ski regions in Austria, Italy and Switzerland. France, Italy, Austria and Germany have all ordered even the high-altitude lifts that could be running this early in the winter to remain closed for now in the hope that all resorts can benefit at peak-season, if and when the infection rate slows.Austria’s nationwide lockdown is due to be lifted on Dec. 7, but it is not clear what that will mean for the ski sector. Austria has been lukewarm about common European rules.Germany is Austria’s biggest source of foreign tourists.Earlier this week, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned people not to ski during the Christmas holidays to help curb a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.He also called on other European countries to agree on common rules for the sector to prevent cases being imported from abroad if Italy keeps its slopes closed.France says its ski slopes must stay off limits until 2021.If the European Union forces skiing areas to stay closed, it will mean losses of up to 2 billion euros, which the EU should cover, Austrian Finance Minister Gernot Bluemel said earlier this week.Switzerland, which is not part of the EU, is allowing near-normal operations at its ski resorts.Merkel agreed with leaders of Germany’s 16 federal states late on Wednesday to extend and tighten a coronavirus lockdown until Dec. 20, but ease rules over the Christmas holidays to let families and friends celebrate together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-wants-ski-resorts-closed-but-hard-to-get-deal-with-neighbour-austria/story-98Bw36m5PsS5L0oQIkOBQN.html
26-11-2020||World||How Trump compares to other US presidents on pardons and commutations||US President Donald Trump’s decision to grant a full pardon to former national security adviser Michael Flynn grabbed international headlines on Thursday. Trump is expected to use his clemency power to pardon or commute the sentences of his allies before leaving the office, however, the outgoing commander-in-chief has used the power less frequently than any other president in modern history.As of November 26, Trump has granted clemency 45 times, including 29 pardons and 16 commutations, which is the lowest of any US president since William McKinley. Trump has received at least 10,051 petitions for clemency but he has used the power for less than 0.5 per cent cases, according to the data from the US Department of Justice.Also Read | Apart from Flynn, here are some big names granted pardon or commutation by TrumpTrump’s predecessor, Barack Obama exercised his clemency power 1,927 times, including 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations. George W. Bush had granted clemency 200 times, while Bill Clinton used the power 459 times to pardon or commute sentences. In terms of percentage, Harry Truman, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson used their power more frequently than other modern presidents.“The Justice Department’s statistics...do not count clemency granted through proclamation or executive order, such as the actions taken by Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter to forgive thousands of Vietnam-era draft dodgers,” Pew Research Center noted in its report.The US-based think tank also observed that presidents have “generally become less forgiving over time” when looking at the proportion of clemency requests they have granted. While Trump has rarely used his clemency power, it has been controversial because of the nature of his pardons and commutations, given a personal or political connection in some of them. Trump used his power to commute the prison sentence of longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, who was convicted on the charges brought as part of Mueller’s report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-trump-compares-to-other-us-presidents-on-pardons-and-commutations/story-LlUPRznOVMz2DWC2Jfz7TJ.html

It’s currently at 140 per 100,000, with some regions far higher.The country hit the grim milestone Thursday of more than 15,000 deaths from the coronavirus and appeared likely to surpass 1 million infections on Friday, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute, the country’s disease control center.Germany, which has 83 million people, was credited with a relatively good performance in the first phase of the pandemic. It still has a lower death rate than several other European countries, and its current shutdown has been relatively mild.The current restrictions have managed to stop the exponential rise of new cases, but they have stabilized at a high level, which authorities now want to try and bring down.The government also agreed upon some additional restrictions Wednesday, including further limiting private gatherings, discouraging traditional New Year’s Eve fireworks and banning some events entirely, expanding mask requirements and reducing the number of customers allowed into larger stores.The government also plans around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) more in aid to compensate businesses hit by the shutdown, on top of 15 billion euros (around $17.9 billion) provided by federal authorities in November.Also Read: Germany extends Covid-19 lockdown until December 20, limitations of social contacts until JanuaryMerkel said with several promising vaccines nearing approval, possibly before Christmas, people had reason for optimism.“That won’t solve the problem immediately, but there is light at the end of the tunnel,” she said.Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told RTL television that it was likely that some restrictions were likely to remain in place through March, as the vaccine was rolled out.“The winter will be difficult,” Merkel told lawmakers. “But it will end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/there-is-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-merkel-urges-patience-as-covid-curbs-extend-in-germany/story-FW2zgx0kY57bPc7pVsuuWN.html
26-11-2020||World||Four more students charged in France over teacher’s beheading||Four teenage students have been charged in France over the killing of Samuel Paty, including three for allegedly pointing out the teacher to his murderer, a judical source said Thursday.Three other pupils were charged with complicity earlier this month over the beheading last month of Paty, who had shown his students cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed as part of a lesson on free speech.Three of the four students charged Thursday were suspected of identifying Paty to his killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, who then tracked him down and beheaded him in a street near his school.The three, who are between 13 and 14 years old, are being charged with “complicity in a terrorist murder,” the source said.The fourth is the daughter of Brahim Chnina, who launched a virulent online campaign against Paty denouncing the teacher’s use of the cartoons published by satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo.She has been charged with “slanderous denunciation” of Paty after relating her version of events in the classroom, though she did not actually attend his civics lesson.Paty’s murder sparked a torrent of outrage that prompted President Emmanuel Macron to crack down on Islamist extremism and violence in a country reeling from a wave of jihadist attacks since 2015 that have killed more than 250 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/four-more-students-charged-in-france-over-teacher-s-beheading/story-rPjMGBPfJPByLuD238XHAP.html
26-11-2020||World||Malaysian PM gains political lifeline with budget approval||Malaysia’s Parliament approved the government’s proposed 2021 budget on Thursday, throwing a political lifeline to embattled Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin amid strong resistance to his 9-month-old leadership.Opposition lawmakers as well as members of his governing coalition had warned during three weeks of debate that they would reject the budget, citing insufficient funding to fight a surge in coronavirus cases and help those hit by the pandemic.Finance Minister Zafrul Aziz made some minor revisions to the 322.5 billion ringgit ($79 billion) budget, the biggest ever, in his concluding speech Thursday in response to the complaints. He insisted that “this is a Covid-19 budget, a budget for survival and resilience.”In the end, the budget was approved despite the dissenting voices.“A budget vote has always been a de facto vote of confidence or no-confidence in the government,” said Ahmad Fauzi Abdul Hamid, a political science professor at Malaysia’s University of Science.Muhyiddin’s “government is temporarily secure but it will continue to have to fight from bill to bill as it survives on a slender majority and on the goodwill of bigger parties in the (governing) coalition,” he said.Had Muhyiddin failed to obtain Parliament’s support for the budget, it would have triggered new calls for him to resign or spur him to seek a general election, which is not favored during the surge in coronavirus cases. Malaysia’s cases have jumped fivefold in two months to nearly 60,000.Muhyiddin, 73, has only a slim two-seat majority in Parliament. He has been challenged by opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who last month said he has majority support to form a new government with defections from Muhyiddin’s coalition.The support reportedly comes from the United Malays National Organization, the biggest party in the unelected governing coalition, which was angry at being sidelined amid rivalry with Muhyiddin’s own Malay party.Lawmakers from both sides of the divide have also pushed for a vote of no-confidence in Muhyiddin, but the bids have been thwarted by the house speaker, appointed by the prime minister.Muhyiddin last month proposed a coronavirus emergency that would have suspended Parliament and given him uncontested powers, but it sparked widespread anger. The king rejected the proposal, saying that existing laws were sufficient to tackle the pandemic, but urged lawmakers to back the budget.“He got lucky again — until the next showdown, as his government remains a decidedly weak one,” said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.Muhyiddin took power in March after withdrawing his party from Anwar’s ruling reformist alliance that won 2018 polls. He tied up with the corruption-tainted UMNO and other opposition parties to form a Malay-centric government, but his administration has been riven by infighting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-pm-gains-political-lifeline-with-budget-approval/story-nHE8yJdYP6uzd98XHT5U6K.html

An EU diplomat said it was more likely to come next week.The European Commission - where Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is leading talks with Britain on behalf of the whole bloc - is due to update national envoys to Brussels on the latest in the trade talks at 0800 GMT on Friday. EU sources said Barnier himself may travel to London later on for more discussions with his British counterpart, David Frost, if there is a chance for a breakthrough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-says-brexit-trade-deal-can-be-reached-but-not-at-any-cost/story-7ZwiN6lx2mZXreOTkyImBM.html
26-11-2020||World||Turkish court issues life sentences in trial of 2016 coup leaders||A Turkish court handed down dozens of life sentences on Thursday for some of the nearly 500 defendants, including army commanders and pilots, accused of leading a 2016 coup attempt from an air base near the capital Ankara.More than 250 people were killed on July 15, 2016, when rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, helicopters and tanks and sought to take control of state institutions and overthrow the government of President Tayyip Erdogan. The trial was the highest profile of dozens of court cases targeting thousands of people accused of involvement in the coup attempt, which Ankara blamed on supporters of the US-based Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen.Former air force commander Akin Ozturk and others at the Akinci air base near Ankara were accused of directing the coup and bombing government buildings, including parliament, and attempting to kill Erdogan.Four ringleaders, dubbed “civilian imams” over ties to Gulen’s network, were given 79 aggravated life sentences for charges of attempting to assassinate the president, murder, and seeking to overthrow the constitutional order, state-owned Anadolu news agency said.F-16 warplane pilots were also among those given aggravated life sentences - the severest punishment in Turkish courts - meaning there is no possibility of parole. Turkey’s then-military chief and now defence minister Hulusi Akar and other commanders were held captive for several hours at the base on the night of the coup. A total of 475 people were on trial, 365 of them in custody.SUSTAINED CRACKDOWN The 79-year-old cleric Gulen, who was once an ally of Erdogan and has denied any role in the coup, was one of six defendants being tried in absentia. Their dossiers were separated from the main trial, media reports said.The government declared a state of emergency in Turkey - a NATO member and candidate for European Union membership - after the failed coup and carried out a large-scale crackdown which alarmed Ankara’s Western allies.Some 292,000 people have been detained over alleged links to Gulen, nearly 100,000 of them jailed pending trial, Anadolu cited Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu as saying. Some 150,000 civil servants were sacked or suspended after the coup, with some 20,000 expelled from the military. Courts have handed down more than 2,500 life sentences.Four years on, police operations targeting suspects accused of links to Gulen continue on a regular basis.The government has said the crackdown was needed given the security challenges which Turkey has faced to root out a network of Gulen supporters deeply embedded in the state apparatus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-court-issues-life-sentences-in-trial-of-2016-coup-leaders/story-5qBIAjgbNeuMZbA8kTvq9K.html

Flights that had been cancelled or rescheduled were reinstated, however, as air traffic controllers called off their strike after a court ruled their participation illegal.Greek journalists were also participating with a two-hour work stoppage between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., during which no news broadcasts will be aired.Civil servants’ unions called the strike on a variety of demands, including the increase of coronavirus-related protective measures in workplaces and in schools, mass hirings in the public transport and health sectors, and salary increases for civil servants.Public transport workers are also calling for workers to be allowed to undergo tests for Covid-19 at their companies’ expense.Greece has seen a significant surge in coronavirus cases and deaths that is straining the country’s health system.Although the government has carried out mass hirings of medical workers since the pandemic struck and has more than doubled the number of intensive care unit beds in the country since mid-2019, many ICUs, particularly in northern Greece where the outbreak has been most severe, are at or near their capacity. Health authorities have appropriated two private clinics in the northern city of Thessaloniki and their staff, to be used for coronavirus patients.Greece currently has more than 97,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and just over 1,900 deaths in this country of 11 million. Nearly 600 people are intubated in ICUs nationwide, according to figures released Wednesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greek-civil-servants-hold-strike-demands-include-better-workplace-protection-against-covid/story-Rgqq9UCfFH0uKjpW6jmN9N.html

Trump took to Twitter to announce the executive grant of clemency to Flynn, saying he “will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!” Calling Flynn “an innocent man”, the White House said in a statement that he should have never been prosecuted. It described the retired US Army three-star lieutenant general as the “victim of partisan government officials engaged in a coordinated attempt to subvert the election of 2016.” Trump is expected to use his presidential power to pardon or commute the sentences of his allies before leaving the office.Also Read | Trump pardons Michael Flynn, taking direct aim at Russia probeHere are some of the big names who were pardoned or their prison sentences commuted by Trump:Roger Stone: Trump used his presidential power to commute the prison sentence of longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, who was convicted on the charges brought as part of Mueller’s report. Stone had denied any wrongdoing and called all the charges politically motivated but his lawyers failed to call any witnesses in his defence.Joe Arpaio: The controversial former Arizona sheriff was convicted of criminal contempt after he defied court order to stop patrols targeting suspected undocumented immigrants. While announcing the pardon, Trump said, “Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life’s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration.”Susan B Anthony: The American social reformer and women’s rights activist played a key role in the women’s suffrage movement and was convicted of illegal voting and fined in 1873. In August 2020, Trump granted full pardon posthumously to Susan B Anthony for “a wrongful and unjust conviction stemming from the only vote she ever cast in an election.”Scooter Libby: The American lawyer and former vice-president Dick Cheney’s chief of staff was found guilty of lying about leaks to the media. President George W. Bush had commuted Libby’s sentence shortly after his conviction. The White House said that Libby’s record, since his conviction, is “unblemished, and he continues to be held in high regard by his colleagues and peers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apart-from-flynn-here-are-some-big-names-granted-pardon-or-commutation-by-trump/story-Zuzqvz8YHCWLSr166WFuYK.html
26-11-2020||World||China’s top diplomat touts South Korea ties amid row with US||China’s top diplomat on Thursday stressed the importance of bilateral relations while meeting senior officials in South Korea, where there’s growing concern the country is becoming squeezed between its biggest trading partner and military ally the United States.After meeting South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters that his visit amid a spreading coronavirus pandemic shows how much Beijing values its relations with Seoul. He called for stronger cooperation over anti-virus efforts, trade and finding a peaceful solution to a nuclear standoff with North Korea.When asked whether Beijing was pressing Seoul to choose a side amid rising US-China tensions over trade, security and other issues, Wang said “America is not the only nation in the world.” “There are 190 countries and each of them are sovereign nations,” he said. “They include China and South Korea, which are close neighbours and should visit each other more often like relatives.” Wang, who arrived in Seoul following a visit to Japan where he met Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, was expected to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in later Thursday.In Tokyo Wednesday, Wang told Suga that he wants the two Asian powers to have good relations and cooperate in fighting the coronavirus and reviving their pandemic-hit economies. But the two sides remain at odds over an island dispute.South Korea has been eager to repair its relations with China, its biggest trade partner that reacted furiously to Seoul’s decision to deploy an advanced US anti-missile system on its soil in 2016 to better cope with North Korean threats. There’s also concern in South Korea over a deepening row between Washington and Beijing over trade, security, human rights and other issues, which could force Seoul into a difficult balancing act.China, which has claimed that the US anti-missile system in South Korea could be reconfigured to peep into its territory, had been accused by Seoul of retaliating by limiting Chinese tour groups visits to South Korea. Beijing also destroyed South Korean supermarket giant Lotte’s business in China after the company sold a plot of land to the South Korean government where the anti-missile system was later installed.South Korea had hoped to secure a visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping this year in what Seoul officials describe as a key step in repairing relations, but the pandemic has complicated such plans.When asked about a possible visit by Xi, Wang pointed to the face masks worn by reporters, saying that the coronavirus situation must first be contained.South Korea earlier reported 583 new cases of the coronavirus, its biggest daily increase in about eight months, as a resurgence in the greater capital area threatens to erase hard-won gains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-top-diplomat-touts-south-korea-ties-amid-row-with-us/story-lSiICFihsjgWYRN8b5aLFJ.html

And more than 600,000 people who rely on monthly food rations haven’t received them this month.Travel blockages are so dire that even within the Tigray capital, Mekele, the UN World Food Programme cannot obtain access to transport food from its warehouses there.Communications and travel links remain severed with the Tigray region since the deadly conflict broke out on November 4, and now Human Rights Watch is warning that “actions that deliberately impede relief supplies” violate international humanitarian law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-of-very-critical-shortages-in-ethiopia-s-tigray/story-NUT9qlEAYXEz4DEJND4eZJ.html
26-11-2020||World||US will appeal order barring expulsions of migrant children||The US government on Wednesday appealed a judge’s order barring the expulsions of immigrant children who crossed the border alone, a policy enacted during the coronavirus pandemic to deny the children asylum protections.Judge Emmet Sullivan issued a preliminary injunction on Nov. 18 sought by advocates for immigrants that barred expulsions of unaccompanied children under public health laws.The Justice Department filed a notice of appeal Wednesday night to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It also asked Sullivan to issue a stay of the injunction pending appeal, a request he previously denied.Since March, border agents have expelled 200,000 immigrant adults and children citing the pandemic and a need to prevent the spread of the virus, even though Covid-19 is spreading broadly through border communities and the country at large.Sullivan’s order only covered children who cross the border without a parent and not adults or parents and children. At least 8,800 unaccompanied children have been expelled without having a chance to seek asylum protections or speak to a lawyer. Most people have been expelled within hours or days, though the Trump administration detained hundreds of children for weeks in hotels near the US-Mexico border for days or weeks at a time until another judge barred that practice.President-elect Joe Biden has said he will reverse several of President Donald Trump’s immigration programs when he takes office in January. Biden has not stated whether he will stop expulsions of immigrants.In its filing Wednesday night, the Justice Department cited the spread of the virus in border communities in Arizona and Texas. It warned that Sullivan’s order “likely will have an irreversible impact on public health” by straining hospital capacity and forcing the government to move “potentially infected” children and teenagers through airports.The Associated Press reported on Oct. 3 that top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resisted issuing an emergency declaration allowing immigrant expulsions because it lacked a public health basis, but that Vice President Mike Pence ordered the agency to move forward anyway.Immigration advocates who sought the injunction say the government has the ability to protect children and border agents simultaneously. They argue the Trump administration is using the pandemic as a pretext to crack down on immigrants.“There is no basis for allowing this cruel, unprecedented policy to take effect, given the harm that these young children would face if sent back and the readily available ways of safely housing the children,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-appeal-order-barring-expulsions-of-migrant-children/story-V605DvMCgSV7hyZM8tmjSO.html

Know why||Medical experts in the US had urged to cancel the Thanksgiving festivities in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, but it turns out that instead of junking the feast altogether, people are opting for a cheaper version which, in fact, will be the cheapest in a decade.As per the annual survey of the American Farm Bureau Foundation(AFBF), the mean cost of a 10-person Thanksgiving meal is projected to be 4 per cent cheaper as compared to last year, while it will be the cheapest since 2010 costing just $46.90.Turkey, the gem of the feast, will also be cheaper by seven per cent in comparison to its cost last year with an average cost of $19.39 for a 16-pound Turkey.Also Read |  Thanksgiving 2020: Cook turkey and cornbread like US Vice President elect Kamala HarrisThe grocers are slashing prices including that of the centrepiece of the dinner to entice shoppers, as there will be less of a celebration this year due to the virus that has killed more than 250,00 Americans this year. The US has reported more than 2,000 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours. “Pricing whole turkeys as ‘loss leaders’ to entice shoppers and move product is a strategy we’re seeing retailers use that’s increasingly common the closer we get to the holiday,” said John Newton, chief economist for the AFBF cited Bloomberg.In a Covid-19-ridden America where there is a huge paucity of essential supplies like that of toilet papers due to bulk hoarding by people, turkeys in grocery stores are abundant and available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/america-up-for-cheapest-thanksgiving-this-year-know-why/story-LBkmYRTtTVB8lkKKuBhRcI.html
26-11-2020||World||US Supreme Court rules against New York Covid-19 restrictions on houses of worship||As coronavirus cases surge again nationwide the Supreme Court late Wednesday temporarily barred New York from enforcing certain attendance limits at houses of worship in areas designated as hard hit by the virus.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The court’s action could push New York to reevaluate those restrictions. But the court’s action also won’t have any immediate impact since the two groups that sued as a result of the restrictions, the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Jewish synagogues in Brooklyn and Queens, are no longer subject to them.The groups sued to challenge attendance limits at houses of worship in areas designated red and orange zones, where New York had capped attendance at 10 and 25 people, respectively. But the groups are now subject to less-restrictive rules because they’re now in areas designated yellow zones.The justices split 5-4 to bar the state from enforcing the restrictions against the groups for now, with new Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the majority. It was the conservative’s first publicly discernible vote as a justice. The court’s three liberal justices and Chief Justice John Roberts dissented.The justices acted on an emergency basis while lawsuits challenging the restrictions continued. In an unsigned order, a majority of the court said the restrictions “single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment.”The move was a shift for the court. Earlier in this year, when Barrett’s liberal predecessor, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was on the court, the justices divided 5-4 to leave in place pandemic-related capacity restrictions affecting churches in California and Nevada.The court’s action was a victory for the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Jewish synagogues that had sued to challenge state restrictions announced by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Oct. 6.The Diocese of Brooklyn, which covers Brooklyn and Queens, argued houses of worship were being unfairly singled out by the governor’s executive order. It noted that in red zones, businesses deemed “essential,” from grocery stores to pet shops, can remain open without capacity limits, though “non-essential” businesses had to close. And in orange zones, most businesses can open without capacity restrictions.Also Read |  Disney to lay off about 32,000 workers in first half of 2021The diocese argued it had previously operated safely by capping attendance at 25 percent of a building’s capacity and taking other measures. Parts of Brooklyn and Queens are now in yellow zones where attendance at houses of worship is capped at 50 percent of a building’s capacity.Agudath Israel of America, an Orthodox Jewish organization with synagogues affected by the restrictions, also sued. The organization argued the governor’s restrictions targeted the Orthodox Jewish community in particular.New York, for its part, told the court that religious gatherings were being treated less restrictively than secular gatherings that carried the same infection risk, like concerts and theatrical performances, which were prohibited entirely.Two lower courts had sided with New York in allowing the restrictions on houses of worship to stand. There are currently several areas statewide designated orange zones but no red zones, according to the state’s website that tracks areas designated hot spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-rules-against-new-york-covid-19-restrictions-in-houses-of-worship/story-DHBC2K47H66SlPsCtDWcJL.html

Pakistan is being represented at the meeting by foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who left Islamabad on Wednesday for participating in the OIC meeting.Before leaving for Niger, however, Qureshi told journalists he would raise the Kashmir issue and Islamophobia at the two-day meeting. “I will focus on the Kashmir issue and Islamophobia at the meeting. We will discuss the issues faced by the Muslim Ummah (nation) at the meeting,” he said.The foreign minister said that on the sidelines of the meeting, he will also hold bilateral parleys with his counterparts from the Islamic countries. “The OIC members will give their positions on the international issues and efforts would be made to evolve a joint stand by the Muslim-majority countries,” he added.Qureshi said the OIC members already know about what he alleged was a “wave of terror” by India in Kashmir. “There is a need to press India to stop the bloodshed and implement the UN resolutions in the occupied territory,” he said.In August, Qureshi had asked the OIC to “stop dilly-dallying” on the convening of a meeting of its Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) on Kashmir, angering the grouping’s Saudi leadership.“If you cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris,” he had said at the time.In his statement, OIC Secretary-General Dr Yousef Al-Othaimeen has said that the Niamey meeting will discuss the Palestinian cause, the fight against violence, extremism and terrorism, Islamophobia and defamation of religion, Muslim minorities and communities in non-member states, fundraising for the Rohingya case at the International Court of Justice, as well as the promotion of dialogue among civilisations, cultures and religions, and other emerging matters.The agenda of the Niamey meeting also includes discussion on the political, humanitarian, economic, social and cultural and other issues related to science and technology, the media and the progress made in the implementation of the “OIC-2025: Plan of Action” document. It would also feature a brainstorming session on “Security and Humanitarian Challenges Confronting African Sahel States Members of the OIC”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kashmir-not-on-oic-meet-agenda-in-apparent-snub-to-pakistan/story-jwSq5WivVDD5BhCxUqNamM.html

Earlier this month, Disney said it was furloughing additional workers from its theme park in Southern California due to uncertainty over when the state would allow parks to reopen.Disney’s theme parks in Florida and those outside the United States reopened earlier this year without seeing new major coronavirus outbreaks but with strict social distancing, testing and mask use.Disneyland Paris was forced to close again late last month when France imposed a new lockdown to fight a second wave of the coronavirus cases. The company’s theme parks in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo remain open.Disney did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on whether the 28,000 layoffs announced earlier were included in the latest figure, but a spokesperson for the company confirmed to Variety that the figure includes the previously announced number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disney-to-lay-off-about-32-000-workers-in-first-half-of-2021/story-rl8p1Lj8qrCjOov6RjsRYJ.html
26-11-2020||World||Fears of booming black market rises amidst Covid-19 vaccine rush in China||Before a planned trip to the US, Cheng wanted to get vaccinated against Covid-19. To do so, he asked a friend working at a cold-chain logistics company in southeast China to pretend he was employed by the firm, allowing Cheng access to one of the country’s experimental shots.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Cheng, a business-owner from Beijing, now plans to fly to Guangdong province and pay as much as $91 to take two doses of what he believes is a vaccine being produced by a unit of Sinopharm, the state-backed Chinese developer at the front of the global Covid-19 vaccine race.“You just transfer him the money via Alipay, but he won’t tell you the details because apparently it’s black market,” said Cheng, referring to a digital payments platform that’s used widely in China. Cheng asked to only be identified by his last name as he fears reprisal for speaking publicly.As developers from AstraZeneca Plc to Pfizer Inc. near the finish line for their coronavirus vaccines, nations are preparing for the challenge of rolling them out, with inevitable supply shortages fueling concerns about inequitable distribution and even the emergence of illegal markets. One place where vaccine delivery is already being road-tested is China, which has allowed local developers’ shots for emergency use since mid-year.While that program is technically reserved for Chinese front-line workers, such as medical staff treating Covid patients and port employees, Bloomberg spoke to nearly a dozen people who have bent the rules, or know those who have, to get hold of the yet unproven Chinese vaccines. They asked not to be identified, or to just use their first names, so they could talk freely about their experiences, which point to a prevalent practice of working connections and officials to jump the queue.Unlike western frontrunners, the Chinese vaccine makers have yet to release any public data on the efficacy of their shots in Phase III trials, making it difficult to tell how successful their efforts have been. People are seeking them out nonetheless, particularly those headed outside of China, where the coronavirus has been all but eliminated.Also Read | Explained: When and how will Covid-19 vaccines become available around the world?Paying Bribes“There are substantial opportunities for the vaccine to be diverted to those with connections,” said Rachel Cooper, the London-based director of Transparency International’s health initiative. “Prior to the pandemic, citizens often used personal connections or had to pay bribes in order to access health-care services,” she said, citing research by the anti-graft group that found one in five people across Asia have called in favors to get care.Despite the fact that the vaccines haven’t received final regulatory approval, hundreds of thousands of people in China have been jabbed under the emergency-use program. That has heightened concern among scientists over potential safety risks.China National Biotec Group Co., the arm of Sinopharm developing two leading Covid vaccines, has said only that its final stage human trials -- involving more than 50,000 people in countries from Argentina to Egypt -- have been progressing smoothly, and it has not received any reports of serious adverse events in participants.On Wednesday, Xinhua Finance reported that the company applied for public use authorization for its shots, citing Sinopharm’s vice general manager Shi Shengyi. If approved, it would mean CNBG will be the first developer outside of Russia to reach the general market. Western developers like Pfizer and AstraZeneca are only at the stage of asking for emergency authorization.CNBG has also inked supply agreements with several countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, according to public reports compiled by Bloomberg.Though many are taking the vaccine in China, some remain skeptical.Jason’s family friends were vaccinated through work connections with officials in the provincial government of Hebei, in China’s north. Some have pressured his family to get inoculated, but he demurred as he doesn’t trust the safety and effectiveness of the Chinese vaccines.“They are proud that they took the shots,” Jason said. “They see it as a privilege, tout it around, lobbying me and my family to be vaccinated. It’s not hard to have the access if you have some connections in China.”Staff in government ministries and state-owned companies have found low barriers to access. One person employed at China’s foreign ministry said they were vaccinated with the CNBG shot two months ago because their job puts them into contact with foreigners, even though they don’t travel overseas for work. Many bureaucrats at the ministry have also been given doses, they said.Also Read | Drones, micro-chillers may be needed for last-mile delivery of Covid vaccinesAn employee at Bank of China Ltd. said many of their colleagues were vaccinated before traveling to an expo in Shanghai this month. Another at a state-owned technology company said dozens at the firm were inoculated before they hosted a big forum in September. The tech company’s employees signed non-disclosure agreements and were only offered jabs before the event.One person said they were able to get access to a vaccine because their parents worked at another state entity. A Bloomberg journalist was even offered CNBG’s shot in the course of reporting this story.‘Test Run’Some, like Cheng, simply want protection from Covid-19 -- proven or otherwise -- before they travel. One Chinese student who needs to return to France next month to complete her MBA found a CNBG booth at a Beijing expo in September offering vaccinations to students traveling overseas.“I was told this offer to students headed abroad was just a test run,” said the student, who added that the company made clear the vaccine hadn’t been fully approved. By mid-October, after presenting her student credentials, she received her first shot at the company’s factory in suburban Beijing. She was told not to talk about the inoculation on social media and she said students who did post pictures were asked to take them down.That this is happening in China, which has aggressively contained the spread of Covid-19 since its initial outbreak, may heighten concerns of misappropriation in countries with weak health systems battling higher rates of infection. The pressure on limited supply will likely be acute in neighboring India, which has enormous wealth disparities and the second-worst outbreak globally with more than 9 million infections.Despite tight travel restrictions, advertising for unverified vaccine tours to the US are popping up across Indian WhatsApp groups. Gem Tours & Travels Pvt. Ltd., a Mumbai-based company planning to run such trips for people to receive Pfizer’s mRNA shot, told Bloomberg they won’t be procuring doses themselves and have yet to nail down travel timings. However, while the firm isn’t collecting deposits yet, they are registering interested clients and collecting passport copies.Waiting GameVaccine producers in the country, including the Serum Institute of India Ltd. -- which is running human trials for AstraZeneca and will produce at least a billion doses if its candidate gets the green light -- have played down concerns that the wealthy will hive off scarce batches. They point to government intentions to ration the first set of jabs to front-line workers and the vulnerable before a private market develops.That hasn’t stopped some calling Serum’s Chief Executive Officer Adar Poonawalla and attempting to get first dibs on any vaccine it brings forward. “I’ve refused, whether you’re rich and powerful or a common friend, I think we all just have to wait,” he said in an interview earlier this month.“Of course, if there’s some friends and others we can always make a few hundred. It’s nothing, it’s not even a day’s production,” Poonawalla added. “But getting firstly access to all the vulnerable and elderly, the front line workers, is the key.”Also Read | What is Mission Covid Suraksha? All you need to knowGiven what’s happening in China, and the enormous logistical challenges of rolling out a vaccine to the entire world, others aren’t convinced it will work out so fairly.Anil Hebbar, who runs a medical equipment firm and volunteered for Astra’s Covid vaccine trial in Mumbai after a friend died from the disease, knows people who use forged documents to ride on the city’s trains reserved for medical workers. It’s not much of a leap for the 56-year-old to imagine that will also happen once vaccines are deployed across India.“Everybody will claim to be a nurse now, or a doctor or hospital worker,” Hebbar said. “Human beings will always circumvent things to their favor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fears-of-booming-black-market-rises-amidst-covid-19-vaccine-rush-in-china/story-pKtGpby7EXDOrUajKzsgsM.html
26-11-2020||World||Despite tensions, China buying computer chips made by Taiwan firms||Despite the growing disquiet in Taipei against Beijing, Chinese technology companies have increased orders for computer chips or semiconductors made in Taiwan. According to a report of VOA, Taiwan has reported a six per cent jump in export from July through September this year.Experts believe that the jump is most likely a result of increased orders from technology businesses in mainland China.Alicia Garcia Herrero is a chief Asia-Pacific economist with the French investment bank Natixis. Of Chinese companies, she said, “They know they’re not yet able to produce at least the highest-end semiconductors needed for 5G.” She added that Taiwan makes top-level semiconductors and is unlikely to give up as a leader in the field.Taiwan factories produce some of the world’s top computer chips. But during the past four years, Taiwan has pushed companies to depend less on the Chinese market.The two countries have been locked in a political dispute for over 70 years.China regards Taiwan as a “breakaway province” and has said that it wouldn’t mind using force to claim it. At the same time, Beijing has also accused Washington and Taipei of promoting independence.China wants to develop the latest telecommunications technology, known as 5G. It also wants to be a powerful force in the technology field worldwide.Technology equipment is Taiwan’s top export to China. Information and communication technology products make up half of Taiwan’s total exports. Between July and September, $27.2 billion of Taiwan’s USD 90 billion in exports went to China. Those numbers come from Taiwan’s Bureau of Foreign Trade.Chinese importers bought more than one-third of the USD 32.9 billion in exports from the grouping of products that include semiconductors.Brady Wang works in Taipei for the market intelligence business Counterpoint Research. He told VOA, “A lot of these goods are being sold in China because China is actually stockpiling inventory...”Wang said the reason for the move was the state of relations between China and the United States. The two sides have been involved in a trade dispute for more than three years. The US government also considers Huawei a security threat.“The reason for stockpiling is the recent state of Sino-US relations -- not just Huawei,” Wang said.Chinese businesses traditionally look to California’s Silicon Valley for the latest in technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-tensions-china-buying-computer-chips-made-by-taiwan-firms/story-HJPd72uPayDENizfzH6bZM.html
26-11-2020||World||Best EU economy in year of Covid was bloc’s worst-hit after 2008||The European Union’s worst-hit economy in the wake of the global financial crisis is looking like the bloc’s least affected during the coronavirus pandemic.Lithuania suffered the deepest recession in 2009 as it became a testing ground for the harsh austerity that later ravaged Greece. This time, the European Commission reckons it will notch the shallowest contraction of all, with forecasts this month pointing to a dip in gross domestic product of just 2.2%.In some ways, the Baltic country of 2.8 million people got lucky: its economy doesn’t rely on tourists, farmers enjoyed a bumper harvest and logistics companies benefited as shoppers across the continent ramped up online purchases. But the government and companies also learned lessons from the last crash, and were far more prudent in the runup to this one.What’s more, Lithuania was lightening quick to respond to the virus’s first wave, imposing a lockdown with only seven confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country to make it one Europe’s least-affected.“Victories on the health front helped the fast economic turnaround,” said Indre Genyte-Geciene, chief economist at INVL Asset Management in Vilnius. “Businesses had also had a string of successful years. They were at the peak of economic cycle, with large financial buffers that helped them survive.”That cushion was visible in state coffers too. Unlike the chaos after 2008, when Lithuania flirted with a bailout, saw workers flee westward and needed drastic spending cuts to stay afloat and adopt the euro, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis struck a reassuring tone when announcing March’s lockdown.“There’s no issue with finances -- the state has enough funds accumulated,” he said in a televised address. Consumers took heart: Retail sales returned to pre-lockdown levels after just two months.Indeed, years of budget surpluses saw Lithuania’s credit rating lifted to the same level as Japan’s. The government was able to provide a furlough program, delay corporate tax payments and subsidize self-employed workers. And without things like a national airline to rescue, expensive bailouts weren’t needed.Many industries, on the contrary, thrived. Lithuania has the EU’s fourth-smallest share of sectors at risk from pandemic-related pain, while good weather helped it export the bloc’s second-highest amount of wheat this year.A spike in demand for online services handed information and communications technology companies a second-quarter sales jump of almost 50%. Then there’s transportation.Girteka Logistics, which owns Europe’s largest fleet of trucks and does 98% of its business abroad, saw shipment volumes climb as e-commerce surged.“While Europeans stay at home to slow the coronavirus, Lithuanian trucking companies continue transporting essentials like consumer goods, food and pharmaceuticals for home consumption,” said Kristian Kaas Mortensen, Girteka’s director for strategic partnerships.Despite a second virus wave inflicting greater damage than the first, he says the country’s ready, having endured much worse a decade ago.“In Lithuania, we don’t cry,” Mortensen said. “Nobody’s afraid of a crisis. Everyone’s like, ‘yeah, we’ve been there, seen that. Whatever, let’s do it.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/best-eu-economy-in-year-of-covid-was-bloc-s-worst-hit-after-2008/story-JarJSNf5XeTKUUzt1RCiNI.html

They say they will not move until justice is delivered to them.While all elections in the illegally occupied regions are important to Islamabad, this year’s elections were of uncommon prominence and desperation for Pakistan.Pakistan’s all-weather friend China wants it to gain complete political control over the region for its strategic and ambitious China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).Under its growing pressure and demands only, Khan in the run-up to the polls had declared the status of a provisional province to Gilgit Baltistan (GB).It was reported that both Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslims League-Nawaz have levelled allegations of rigging in the recent GB elections. A winner is yet to be announced from the Pakistan-occupied region.The complete but unofficial results of all 23 constituencies, where polling was held on Sunday, indicate that the PTI has emerged as the single largest party with 10 seats, followed by seven independents.The PPP won three seats, the PML-N two and the Majlis Wahdatul Muslimeen, which had a seat adjustment arrangement with the PTI, got one seat, Dawn reported.

26-11-2020||World||Sudan’s former PM Sadiq al-Mahdi dies from Covid-19 in UAE||Leading Sudanese politician and former prime minister Sadiq al-Mahdi died from a coronavirus infection three weeks after being hospitalised in the United Arab Emirates, according to family sources and a party statement early on Thursday.Mahdi, 84, was Sudan’s last democratically elected prime minister and was overthrown in 1989 in the military coup that brought former president Omar al-Bashir to power. The moderate Umma Party was one of the largest opposition parties under Bashir, and Mahdi remained an influential figure even after Bashir was toppled in 1989.Last month, al-Mahdi’s family said he had tested positive for Covid-19, and was transferred to the UAE for treatment a few days later following a brief hospitalisation in Sudan.In a statement, the Umma Party said Mahdi would be buried on Friday morning in the city of Omdurman in Sudan. Mahdi had returned to Sudan in December 2018, following a year-long self-exile, just as protests over worsening economic conditions and Bashir’s rule gathered steam. His daughter Mariam Sadiq al-Mahdi, deputy leader of the Umma Party, was among those detained during the demonstrations. While a successor to the party head has not yet been announced, she has been the most visible party leader in political negotiations and the media in recent years.Opposition parties were weakened greatly under Bashir’s three-decade regime, and are jostling for power with the military during Sudan’s transition, making the Umma Party’s continued unity crucial to maintaining the balance of power.After the military forced Bashir out from power, Mahdi pushed for a transfer to civilian rule, warning in interviews with Reuters of the risks of a counter-coup and calling for the powerful, paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to be integrated.

An earlier Foreign Ministry statement sent congratulations and said China respected the American people’s choice.Trump has ratcheted up tensions with Beijing over the course of his administration, hitting China with tariffs in continuing trade disputes, blaming it for the coronavirus pandemic and condemning its treatment of ethnic Uighurs in the Xinjiang region and its crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong.As Biden prepares to take office, the world is watching to see how he handles the relationship between Washington and Beijing, after a campaign in which he faced few questions about how he would handle Beijing more effectively than Trump. Officials have suggested the president-elect would take a less confrontational approach to China than Trump, cooperating on issues such as arms control and climate change.Biden’s team has acknowledged that the Obama-era effort to work more closely with China -- and look past some of its violations of human rights, intellectual property threats and regional expansion -- is over.Trump’s RiftStill, the new administration will inherit -- and be forced to navigate -- the Trump-era rift between the U.S. and China. Trump is planning more hard-line moves against Beijing in the remaining weeks of his term, Bloomberg reported earlier this month, potentially escalating tensions as the Biden administration takes over.Actions being considered include countering illegal fishing and more sanctions against party officials or institutions causing harm in Hong Kong or Xinjiang, Bloomberg reported.The Trump administration is close to issuing a list of 89 Chinese aerospace and other firms that would be unable to access US technology exports because of military ties, Reuters reported this week, a move that could escalate tensions as the Biden administration prepares to take over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-seeks-to-manage-differences-as-he-congratulates-joe-biden/story-LgICfYtzbLmWmDhHtO6GDP.html
26-11-2020||World||US makes last-ditch bid to derail Donald Trump rape accuser case||The US government on Wednesday put forth a last-ditch attempt to derail a defamation lawsuit filed against President Donald Trump by a New York advice columnist who claims he raped her two decades go.The Justice Department is fighting to replace Trump as the defendant in the suit brought by E. Jean Carroll, who went public last year with her claim and sued Trump after he called her a politically motivated liar.US District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in Manhattan last month rejected the Justice Department’s argument that Trump’s statements were made as part of his presidential duties. On Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a notice that it’s appealing the decision.Had Kaplan allowed the substitution, the case would have been dismissed because the government can’t be sued for defamation.It’s unclear what President-elect Joe Biden’s Justice Department and a presumably very different attorney general will do with the legal action when his new administration gets underway in January.Roberta Kaplan, Carroll’s lawyer, said in a statement that she’s confident the US Court of Appeals in New York will uphold the decision so the case can move quickly to the exchange of evidence. The attorney has been pushing to depose Trump under oath and force him to submit a DNA sample to compare to a sample from the dress Carroll says she wore on the day of the attack.“From the very start of this case, Donald Trump’s number one goal has been to avoid discovery and cause delay,” Kaplan said. “It remains to be seen whether the new attorney general will agree that Trump was acting within the scope of his employment as President when he defamed our client.“In the lower court ruling, Kaplan held that Trump isn’t a federal “employee” under a law that allows the U.S. to replace government workers as defendants when they’re sued over actions taken as part of their job. The “undisputed facts” of the case show Trump’s comment about Carroll can’t be considered part of his presidential duties, the judge wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-makes-last-ditch-bid-to-derail-donald-trump-rape-accuser-case/story-Vz3IA0m3EtLuyZkB1LhhDK.html

26-11-2020||World||Rising US weekly jobless claims, Covid-19 cases point to slowing economic recovery||The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits increased further last week, suggesting that an explosion in new Covid-19 infections and business restrictions were boosting layoffs and undermining the labor market recovery.Still, the economy got off to a solid start in the fourth quarter, with consumer spending and business investment in equipment topping analysts’ expectations in October. Businesses also reported a sharp rebound in profits in the third quarter.That was, however, insufficient to lift the heavy cloud over the economy. Personal income dropped last month and could decline further with about 13.6 million Americans due to lose government-funded unemployment benefits a day after Christmas. The benefits, part of a more than $3 trillion government coronavirus relief package which has largely expired, contributed to record economic growth in the third quarter. Another package is expected only after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump is heavily focused on contesting his electoral loss to Biden.Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Nov. 4-5 meeting showed officials discussed how the US central bank’s asset purchases could be adjusted to provide additional support to the economy.“The question is no longer whether the recovery will slow, it will,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. “The real issue is by how much will it decelerate.”Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 30,000 to a seasonally adjusted 778,000 for the week ended Nov. 21, the Labor Department said. That was the second straight weekly increase in claims and exceeded economists’ expectations for 730,000 applications in a Reuters poll.The weekly claims report, the most timely data on the economy’s health, was published a day early because of Thursday’s Thanksgiving Day holiday. Unadjusted claims jumped 78,372 to 827,710 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number because of earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations due to the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.14 million people filed claims last week. There were at least 20.5 million people collecting unemployment benefits in early November.The United States has been slammed by a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, with daily cases exceeding 100,000 since early November. More than 12 million people have been infected in the country, according to a Reuters tally of official data.The respiratory illness has killed more than 259,000 Americans and hospitalizations are soaring, prompting state and local governments to reimpose a host of restrictions on social and economic life in recent weeks, which could keep claims above their 665,000 peak seen during the 2007-09 Great Recession.US stocks were mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices were lower.EXHAUSTING BENEFITSThough the claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 299,000 to 6.071 million in the week ending Nov. 14, that was because many have exhausted their eligibility, which is limited to six months in most states. A record 4.509 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 7, up 132,437 from the prior week. These benefits as well as those for gig workers and the self-employed will lapse on Dec. 26. That and the ebb in consumer confidence amid the raging pandemic cast doubts on the sustainability of strong spending.In second report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.5% last month after increasing 1.2% in September. But personal income fell 0.7%, reversing a 0.7% gain in September. Economists had forecast spending rising 0.4%.“Were it not for recent virus-related developments, it looks like GDP would be on track for a pretty robust fourth quarter,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “But given the recent surge in new Covid-19 cases, we think that the data will soften noticeably in November and December.” Solid consumer spending was accompanied by a rise in imports, which pushed the goods trade deficit up 1.2% to $80.3 billion in October, a third report from the department showed. Still, the economy is likely to remain afloat in the fourth quarter, though growing at a moderate pace. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans rose 0.7% in October, the Commerce Department said in a fourth report.A fifth report from the department showed after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, rebounded at a 36.6% annualized rate in the third quarter after two straight quarterly declines. The department also confirmed that the economy grew at a historic 33.1% pace in the July-September quarter. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% rate. Despite encouraging developments on vaccines, spiraling Covid-19 infections and expectations for a smaller stimulus package have prompted economists to slash their GDP growth forecasts for the first quarter of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rising-us-weekly-jobless-claims-covid-19-cases-point-to-slowing-economic-recovery/story-jKpXXLibInJE31cEWTVlFN.html
26-11-2020||World||Australia seeks to break China coal stalemate as tensions rise||Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he’s appointed his “best people” to work on breaking a stalemate that’s seen more than 50 ships laden with Australian coal stranded off Chinese ports, as tensions between the trading partners increase.More than $500 million worth of Australian coal and about 1,000 crew on the ships are stuck after China blacklisted a wide swathe of Australian commodities and foodstuffs, amid what Morrison described on Thursday as an “extraordinary period” in the relationship.“We will work the process through with the Chinese government to get the best possible outcome that we can,” Morrison said in an with Nine Network television. While he said “there are obviously tensions” in the relationship, they wouldn’t be “resolved by Australia surrendering its sovereignty.”Mending ties won’t be easy: Morrison’s ministers have had no direct contact with their counterparts in Beijing since at least April. That’s when Australia exacerbated existing grievances with China by calling for independent investigators to be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus.Also Read | ‘Whoever started the trouble should end it,’ says China amid worsening ties with AustraliaAs well as the deadlock over Australian coal, Beijing has placed crippling tariffs on Australia’s barley exports, halted beef imports from several large meat plants, warned its citizens against holidaying or studying in Australia and ordered traders to stop buying at least seven commodities including copper and wine.China, which said Wednesday that the coal shipments were delayed due to strengthening of examination and testing of the imports, has become increasingly vocal in recent weeks in saying Australia is to blame for strained ties.“The root cause of the deteriorating bilateral ties is Australia’s repeated wrong acts and remarks on issues concerning China’s core interests and major concerns as well as its provocative and confrontational actions,” China’s embassy in Canberra said in a statement posted on its website on Monday. “Those who have caused problems should be the ones to solve problems.”Beijing toned down that rhetoric somewhat this week after a speech by Morrison in which he said that Australia did not seek to contain China economically, and that China had pulled more people out of poverty than any other nation. A Chinese diplomat in Canberra last week gave a document to Australian media outlets outlining 14 grievances and accusing the nation of “poisoning bilateral relations.”“China noticed Prime Minister Morrison’s positive comments on the global influence of China’s economic growth and China’s poverty alleviation efforts,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Zhao Lijian said in Beijing Wednesday. “We hope Australia will make independent, objective, sensible choices that serve its own interests.”‘It Is Mistaken’Australia’s top diplomat Frances Adamson said in a speech in Canberra on Wednesday night that “China may have reached a point where it believes that it can largely set the terms of its future engagement with the world.”Also Read | Australia, Japan to bolster defense ties amid China’s rise“If it has, it is mistaken-- and that is because there is far more to be gained for China, and for everyone else, through working constructively and collaboratively within the international system, without resort to pressure or coercion,” said Adamson, who is secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Morrison is seeking to create a buffer against what his government sees as an increasingly assertive China under President Xi Jinping’s leadership by bolstering multilateral forums of “like-minded” liberal democracies in groupings such as the Quad and Five Eyes.“Of course we want happy co-existence and positive relationship with China,” Morrison said on Thursday, adding that it was “not simple” to walk a middle path between China and the US.“But we also have a wonderful alliance with the US and a friendship with them as like-minded countries with a similar outlook with liberal democratic values,” he said. “And then we have our core national interests as well. And we want to see all those managed together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-seeks-to-break-china-coal-stalemate-as-tensions-rise/story-frq7RHJX9UZ1Rsp0cBpF5K.html
26-11-2020||World||Germany extends partial shutdown to curb virus spread||German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the country’s 16 state governors on Wednesday agreed to extend a partial shutdown well into December in an effort to further reduce the rate of Covid-19 infections ahead of the Christmas period.Germany embarked on a so-called “wave-breaker” shutdown on Nov. 2, closing restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities but leaving schools, shops and hair salons open. It was initially slated to last four weeks.Merkel said the measures will now be extended until at least Dec. 20, with a goal of pushing the number of new coronavirus cases in each region below 50 per 100,000 inhabitants per week.“We have to continue to pursue this goal,” she told reporters in Berlin.Merkel said that while existing measures have succeeded in halting an surge in new coronavirus infections, they have stabilized at a high level.Germany’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute, reported 18,633 new cases over the past 24 hours — compared with 17,561 a week earlier.“We can’t be satisfied with this partial success,” she said, noting that health officials on Wednesday also reported 410 deaths linked to Covid-19, the highest single-day total yet.“(This) reminds us in the saddest way that behind the statistics are human fates,” Merkel said.During a seven-hour video call, federal and state officials also agreed on a number of new restrictions.These include:—Limiting private gatherings to five people from up to two households, not counting children under 14. Over the festive period that number will be increased to 10, to allow for small family gatherings.—Traditional New Year’s Eve fireworks will be discouraged, and banned entirely in some popular streets and squares.—Employers will be encouraged to let staff work from home Dec. 23 to Jan. 1.—Masks will be required in front of stores, in parking lots and in most secondary schools.—The number of customers allowed into larger stores will be reduced.The government also plans around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) more in aid to compensate businesses hit by the shutdown, on top of 15 billion euros provided by federal authorities in November.Germany, which has 83 million people, was credited with a relatively good performance in the first phase of the pandemic. It still has a lower death rate than several other European countries, and its current shutdown has been relatively mild.Germany has reported a total of 961,320 virus cases since the pandemic began, including 14,771 deaths.Merkel expressed hope that the arrival of the first vaccines in coming weeks would help turn the corner on the pandemic.“A lot indicates that 2021 will bring us relief,” she said.The country’s disease control agency released a new version of its contact tracing app Wednesday that includes reminders for people to share positive test results with people they were in close proximity to.The app had been downloaded 22.8 million times by Friday. Its decentralized, privacy-focused design has been copied by several other European countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-extends-partial-shutdown-to-curb-virus-spread/story-hN9UR50ixvJUGVx5L59AKJ.html
26-11-2020||World||Trump administration denies nod for planned mine near Alaska fishery||The Trump administration on Wednesday effectively killed a contentious proposed mine in Alaska, a gold and copper prospect once envisioned to be nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon and could produce enough waste to fill an NFL stadium nearly 3,900 times — all near the headwaters of the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery.The Army Corps of Engineers “concluded that the proposed project is contrary to the public interest” and denied a permit to build the Pebble Mine under both the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act, the agency said in a statement.The rejection was a surprise. It’s at odds with President Donald Trump’s efforts to encourage energy development in Alaska, including opening up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, and other moves nationwide to roll back environmental protections that would benefit oil and gas and other industries.The Corps of Engineers also seemed to signal just a few months ago that after almost two decades of political wrangling, Pebble Mine was on a fast track to approval, a reversal from what many had expected under the Obama administration.But unlike drilling elsewhere in Alaska, the mine proposed for the southwestern Bristol Bay region could have negatively affected the state’s billion-dollar fishing industry. Conservationists and even Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., sounded the alarm on the project before the administration changed course again.The CEO of the Pebble Limited Partnership, the mine’s developers, said he was dismayed by the decision, especially after the corps had indicated in an environmental impact statement in July that the mine and fishery could coexist.“One of the real tragedies of this decision is the loss of economic opportunities for people living in the area,” CEO John Shively said in a statement. The environmental review “clearly describes those benefits, and now a politically driven decision has taken away the hope that many had for a better life. This is also a lost opportunity for the state’s future economy.”He said they are considering their next steps, which could include an appeal of the corps’ decision.“Today Bristol Bay’s residents and fishermen celebrate the news that Pebble’s permit has been denied; tomorrow we get back to work,” said Katherine Carscallen, executive director of the group Commercial Fishermen for Bristol Bay.The group wants Congress to pass laws protecting the region. “We’ve learned the hard way over the last decade that Pebble is not truly dead until protections are finalized,” Carscallen said.In July, the Corps of Engineers released an environmental review that the mine developer saw as laying the groundwork for key federal approvals. The review said that under normal operations, Pebble Mine “would not be expected to have a measurable effect on fish numbers and result in long-term changes to the health of the commercial fisheries in Bristol Bay.”However, in August, the corps said it had determined that discharges at the mine site would cause “unavoidable adverse impacts to aquatic resources” and laid out required steps to reduce those effects.Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd., which owns Pebble Limited Partnership, said it had submitted a mitigation plan on Nov. 16.Even if the corps had approved the project, there was still no guarantee it would have been built. It would have needed state approval, and President-elect Joe Biden has expressed opposition to the project.Critics saw Pebble Mine as getting a lifeline under the Trump administration. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew restrictions on development that were proposed — but never finalized — under the Obama administration and said it planned to work with the corps to address concerns.However, Trump’s eldest son was among those who voiced opposition earlier this year. After senior Trump campaign adviser Nick Ayers tweeted in August that he hoped the president would direct the EPA to block Pebble Mine, Trump Jr. responded: “As a sportsman who has spent plenty of time in the area I agree 100%. The headwaters of Bristol Bay and the surrounding fishery are too unique and fragile to take any chances with.”The president later said he would “listen to both sides.”“The credit for this victory belongs not to any politician but to Alaskans and Bristol Bay’s Indigenous peoples, as well as to hunters, anglers and wildlife enthusiasts from all across the country who spoke out in opposition to this dangerous and ill-conceived project,” said Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League.Alaska’s two Republican U.S. senators, who support oil and gas development and mining, hailed the rejection of the Pebble Mine permit. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said the decision affirmed her position that it’s the wrong mine in the wrong place.“It will help ensure the continued protection of an irreplaceable resource — Bristol Bay’s world-class salmon fishery,” she said.Sen. Dan Sullivan said he would remain an advocate for good-paying jobs derived from resource development.“However, given the special nature of the Bristol Bay watershed and the fisheries and subsistence resources downstream, Pebble had to meet a high bar so that we do not trade one resource for another,” he said. “Pebble did not meet that bar.”___Associated Press journalist Becky Bohrer in Juneau contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-denies-nod-for-planned-mine-near-alaska-fishery/story-9D3tYZRFDqM9SOYpr2oiMJ.html
26-11-2020||World||AstraZeneca manufacturing error clouds vaccine study results||AstraZeneca and Oxford University on Wednesday acknowledged a manufacturing error that is raising questions about preliminary results of their experimental COVID-19 vaccine.A statement describing the error came days after the company and the university described the shots as “highly effective” and made no mention of why some study participants didn’t receive as much vaccine in the first of two shots as expected.In a surprise, the group of volunteers that got a lower dose seemed to be much better protected than the volunteers who got two full doses. In the low-dose group, AstraZeneca said, the vaccine appeared to be 90% effective. In the group that got two full doses, the vaccine appeared to be 62% effective. Combined, the drugmakers said the vaccine appeared to be 70% effective. But the way in which the results were arrived at and reported by the companies has led to pointed questions from experts.The partial results announced Monday are from large ongoing studies in the U.K. and Brazil designed to determine the optimal dose of vaccine, as well as examine safety and effectiveness. Multiple combinations and doses were tried in the volunteers. They were compared to others who were given a meningitis vaccine or a saline shot.DID RESEARCHERS MEAN TO GIVE A HALF DOSE?Before they begin their research, scientists spell out all the steps they are taking, and how they will analyze the results. Any deviation from that protocol can put the results in question.In a statement Wednesday, Oxford University said some of the vials used in the trial didn’t have the right concentration of vaccine so some volunteers got a half dose. The university said that it discussed the problem with regulators, and agreed to complete the late stage trial with two groups. The manufacturing problem has been corrected, according to the statement.WHAT ABOUT THE RESULTS THEMSELVES?Experts say the relatively small number of people in the low dose group makes it difficult to know if the effectiveness seen in the group is real or a statistical quirk. Some 2,741 people received a half dose of the vaccine followed by a full dose, AstraZeneca said. A total of 8,895 people received two full doses.Another factor: none of the people in the low-dose group were over 55 years old. Younger people tend to mount a stronger immune response than older people, so it could be that the youth of the participants in the low-dose group is why it looked more effective, not the size of the dose.Another point of confusion comes from a decision to pool results from two groups of participants who received different dosing levels to reach an average 70% effectiveness, said David Salisbury, and associate fellow of the global health program at the Chatham House think tank.“You’ve taken two studies for which different doses were used and come up with a composite that doesn’t represent either of the doses,″ he said of the figure. “I think many people are having trouble with that.″WHY WOULD A SMALLER FIRST DOSE BE MORE EFFECTIVE?Oxford researchers say they aren’t certain and they are working to uncover the reason.Sarah Gilbert, one of the Oxford scientists leading the research, said the answer is probably related to providing exactly the right amount of vaccine to trigger the best immune response.“It’s the Goldilocks amount that you want, I think, not too little and not too much. Too much could give you a poor quality response as well,’’ she said. “So you want just the right amount and it’s a bit hit and miss when you’re trying to go quickly to get that perfect first time.”WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS?Details of the trial results will be published in medical journals and provided to U.K. regulators so they can decide whether to authorize distribution of the vaccine. Those reports will include a detailed breakdown that includes demographic and other information about who got sick in each group, and give a more complete picture of how effective the vaccine is.Moncef Slaoui, who leads the U.S. coronavirus vaccine program Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday in a call with reporters that U.S. officials are trying to determine what immune response the vaccine produced, and may decide to modify the AstraZeneca study in the U.S. to include a half dose.“But we want it to be based on data and science,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-manufacturing-error-clouds-vaccine-study-results/story-F54zPoqITCtwb3VM4rWPAO.html
26-11-2020||World||White House considers lifting entry restrictions on Europeans||Several federal agencies have recommended that the White House lift an entry ban on non-US citizens arriving from Europe put in place to slow the spread of Covid-19.The organizations, which participate in the White House Coronavirus Task Force, have signed off on lifting the restrictions, said two people who were briefed on the discussions. The limits have helped lead to a more than 90% reduction in the lucrative trans-Atlantic flight market.The restrictions were imposed by the Homeland Security Department after a presidential proclamation on March 11. It applied to 28 European nations and was expanded to Brazil on May 25. The department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.It’s unclear whether White House officials, including President Donald Trump, will go along with lifting the ban or what the timing of a decision will be, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to discuss the issue. The nation is currently experiencing record high infection rates and growing deaths.The immediate impact of such an action on airlines is also not known. Most European nations have imposed quarantines on arriving passengers, which has severely limited those who want to travel to and from the region.The White House declined to comment. The Department of Transportation, which was said to have signed off on lifting the restrictions, didn’t respond to a request for comment on its position.“The Department stands ready to support the safe resumption of international flights to and from the US,” the DOT said in an emailed statement. “Conversations are ongoing between the federal government, international partners, and industry stakeholders on these matters.”Consideration of such a move was reported earlier by Reuters.Two other people briefed on the discussions, who also asked not to be named, said they were aware of attempts to lift the Homeland Security travel limitations as part of a broader effort to help revive the struggling airline industry.The justification for ending or limiting the restrictions is that infections are now so widespread that travel from one country to another isn’t considered a major source of spread, said one of the persons briefed on discussions.“We have been advocating for the federal government to set a national standard on testing in order to lift travel restrictions,” the trade group for large US carriers, Airlines for America, said in a statement.The airline industry in recent months has been proposing various methods to safely reopen travel markets. They include trials in which passengers would be tested for the coronavirus before boarding and using virus tests after arrival to lower or eliminate quarantines.Carriers have also insisted that it’s safe to fly during the pandemic as a result of aircraft disinfection, air conditioning that removes the virus and mask usage. Scientists caution that the data remains uncertain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-considers-lifting-entry-restrictions-on-europeans/story-bQClXkTQaUgrMdMZrPYn2L.html
26-11-2020||World||TikTok granted one-week extension of forced-sale deadline||UShe Trump administration has given TikTok’s Chinese owner another week to complete a sale of its popular video-sharing app in order to resolve US national security concerns.The new deadline, which had already been extended by 15 days, is Dec. 4, TikTok’s parent ByteDance Ltd. said in a court filing Wednesday.The fate of TikTok, an app that’s been downloaded more than 100 million times in the US, has been caught up for months in US President Donald Trump’s crackdown on Chinese technology companies. The administration has argued that American’s private data gathered through the app could be siphoned off to the authoritarian regime in China, something TikTok has said it would never do. Trump had ordered in August that the app be sold to an American firm or face a ban in the USTo assuage Trump’s concerns, ByteDance forged a deal in September to sell a stake of a spun out TikTok business to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. The deal was never finalized though, because the companies didn’t receive a sign-off from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, known as Cfius, a panel led by the Treasury Department.A Treasury spokesperson said it granted ByteDance a one-week extension to allow time to review a revised submission that Cfius recently received.TikTok has filed multiple challenges against the ban, which are winding their way through the court system, with deadlines in certain proceedings extending past January. Several judges have already blocked the ban from going into effect and the Commerce Department said it would comply with those court rulings as the government appeals.Those cases could lapse when President-Elect Joe Biden takes office in January, unless he decides to enforce the Trump ban and defend the previous administration’s orders in court.The penalties that ByteDance would face if it failed to sell TikTok to a US company by the deadline were never clearly spelled out, though the order said the Justice Department could take “any steps necessary” to enforce the sale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-granted-one-week-extension-of-forced-sale-deadline/story-zK9P72wRWdBfXnXVqoVCdN.html
26-11-2020||World||Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam vows to restore political order||Hong Kong’s leader vowed Wednesday to restore order to the city’s legislature and save its political system from “chaos”, in a key policy speech at a muted gathering of almost exclusively pro-Beijing lawmakers. Chief executive Carrie Lam’s annual policy address to the Legislative Council -- postponed for more than a month after she was ordered to travel to mainland China for meetings with central government officials -- outlines the administration’s plans for the city.Hong Kong is ruled under a “One Country, Two Systems” model that allows it to retain a degree of autonomy and some freedoms that are denied to citizens on the authoritarian mainland.But while last year saw months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests, a strict new national security law imposed by Beijing in June -- as well as anti-pandemic measures limiting public gatherings -- have meant Hong Kong’s streets have remained largely free from unrest.“One of our urgent priorities is to restore Hong Kong’s constitutional order and political system from chaos,” Lam told the legislature, which for the first time had almost no opposition presence after pro-democracy lawmakers were disqualified and supporters resigned en masse in protest.“Hong Kong has experienced multiple blows which are unprecedented,” she added, citing the social unrest, shrinking economy, pandemic and acts that “endangered national security”. Fifteen pro-democracy lawmakers quit earlier this month in protest at the ousting of four colleagues by the government, leaving the legislature a muted gathering of Beijing loyalists.During last year’s demonstrations, the handpicked leader declined to make the speech in the chamber, instead releasing a pre-recorded video after pro-democracy lawmakers heckled her and called for her resignation.This year’s speech went smoothly, with none of the protesting stunts usually seen from opposition lawmakers. Local media captured officials nodding and apparently snoozing during the lengthy speech, while some were seen checking stock prices and playing Sudoku on their phones.Lam said her government would introduce bills to “enhance the oath-taking” by civil servants and to “enhance the electoral system”, though details were unclear.Media reports had suggested that the government might expand voting for Hong Kongers in mainland China, a controversial move criticised by the opposition, although Lam did not offer details on the plans.The leader also said her administration would strengthen patriotic education in the city, part of efforts to foster a sense of greater national identity among youngsters.More than 10,000 people have been arrested during last year’s social unrest, among which 40 percent are students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-vows-to-restore-political-order/story-VWowmqDLO7z2XOGpzFJr8J.html
26-11-2020||World||Trump pardons Michael Flynn, taking direct aim at Russia probe||President Donald Trump pardoned former national security adviser Michael Flynn on Wednesday, taking direct aim in the final days of his administration at a Russia investigation that he has long insisted was motivated by political bias.“It is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon,” Trump tweeted. “Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!”Flynn is the second Trump associate convicted in the Russia probe to be granted clemency by the president. Trump commuted the sentence of longtime confidant Roger Stone just days before he was to report to prison. It is part of a broader effort to undo the results of an investigation that for years has shadowed his administration and yielded criminal charges against a half dozen associates.The action voids the criminal case against Flynn just as a federal judge was weighing, skeptically, whether to grant a Justice Department request to dismiss the prosecution despite Flynn’s own guilty plea to lying to the FBI about his Russia contacts.The move, coming as Trump winds down his single term, is likely to energize supporters who have taken up the case as a cause celebre and rallied around the retired Army lieutenant general as the victim of what they assert is an unfair prosecution. Trump himself has repeatedly spoken warmly about Flynn, even though special counsel Robert Mueller’s prosecutors once praised him as a model cooperator in their probe into ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign.The pardon is the final step in a case defined by twists and turns over the last year after the Justice Department abruptly move to dismiss the case, insisting that Flynn should have never been interviewed by the FBI in the first place, only to have U.S. District Justice Emmet Sullivan refuse the request and appoint a former judge to argue against the federal government’s position.In the months since, a three-judge panel’s decision ordering Sullivan to dismiss the case was overturned by the full appeals court, which sent the matter back to Sullivan. At a hearing in September, Flynn lawyer Sidney Powell told the judge that she had discussed the Flynn case with Trump but also said she did not want a pardon — presumably because she wanted him to be vindicated in the courts.Powell emerged separately in recent weeks as a public face of the Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden, but the Trump legal team ultimately distanced itself from her after she advanced a series of uncorroborated conspiracy claims.The pardon spares Flynn the possibility of any prison sentence, which Sullivan could potentially have imposed had he ultimately decided to reject the Justice Department’s dismissal request. That request was made in May after a review of the case by a federal prosecutor from St. Louis who had been specially appointed by Attorney General William Barr.Flynn acknowledged lying during the FBI interview by saying he had not discussed with the then-Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, sanctions that had just been imposed on Russia for election interference by the outgoing Obama administration. During that conversation, Flynn urged Kislyak for Russia to be “even-keeled” in response to the punitive measures, and assured him “we can have a better conversation” about relations between the two countries after Trump became president.The conversation alarmed the FBI, which at the time was investigating whether the Trump campaign and Russia had coordinated to sway the election’s outcome. In addition, White House officials were stating publicly that Flynn and Kislyak had not discussed sanctions.But last May, the Justice Department abruptly reversed its position in the case. It said the FBI had no basis to interview Flynn about Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, and that any statements he may have made were not relevant to the FBI’s broader counterintelligence probe. It cited internal FBI notes showing that agents had planned to close out their investigation into Flynn weeks earlier.Flynn was ousted from his position in February 2017 after news broke that he had indeed discussed sanctions with Kislyak, and that former Obama administration administration officials had warned the White House that he could be vulnerable to blackmail.Flynn was among the first of the president’s aides to admit guilt in Mueller’s investigation and cooperated extensively for months. He provided such extensive cooperation that prosecutors did not recommend any prison time and suggested that they would be fine with probation.But on the morning he was to have been sentenced, after a stern rebuke about his behavior from Sullivan, Flynn asked for the hearing to be cut short so that he could continue cooperating and earn credit toward a more lenient sentence.After that, though, he hired new attorneys — including Powell, a conservative commentator and outspoken critic of Mueller’s investigation — who took a far more confrontational stance to the government.The lawyers accused prosecutors of withholding documents and evidence they said was favorable to the case and repeatedly noted that one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn was fired from the FBI for having sent derogatory text messages about Trump during the 2016 campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-pardons-michael-flynn-taking-direct-aim-at-russia-probe/story-L5sCniJImhye2XX5pck5fL.html
26-11-2020||World||Joe Biden appeals for unity in Thanksgiving-eve address||In a time of plague and raw division, President-elect Joe Biden appealed for unity Wednesday in a Thanksgiving-eve address to the nation asking Americans to “steel our spines” for a fight against the coronavirus that he predicted would continue for months.But even as he implored Americans to join in healing and common purpose, President Donald Trump asserted that the election should be overturned, a futile call but one that stokes the divisions Biden is trying to overcome.With Covid-19 cases surging nationwide, Biden called on Americans to take precautions to try to stem the tide of the virus, by wearing masks and practicing social distancing. While he said the federal government has “vast powers” to combat the virus, “the federal government can’t do it alone.”“Each of us has a responsibility in our own lives to do what we can to slow the virus,” he said in remarks in Wilmington.Biden said that, until there’s a vaccine, wearing masks, social distancing and limiting the size of gatherings “are our most effective tools to combat the virus.” But he pledged that from the start of his presidency, “we will take steps that will change the course of the disease,” including increasing testing, providing more protective gear and clearer guidance for businesses and schools to reopen.And he said that he himself was taking precautions around Thanksgiving and eschewing his traditional large family gathering, instead spending the holiday with just his wife, daughter and son in law.“This is the moment when we need to steel our spines, redouble our efforts and recommit ourselves to this fight,” Biden said. “We’re all in this together.”But Trump stoked the embers of his flailing effort to upend the election results as his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and other members of his legal team met Pennsylvania Republican state senators in Gettysburg. There, they again aired grievances about the election and repeated allegations of Democratic malfeasance that have already disintegrated under examination by courts.Trump joined the meeting from the Oval Office, asserting: “This was an election that we won easily. We won it by a lot.” In fact the election gave Biden a clear mandate and no systemic fraud has been uncovered.In his remarks in Wilmington, Biden made passing reference to Trump’s refusal to concede, declaring “our democracy was tested this year” but “the people of this nation are up to the task.”“In America, we have full and fair and free elections, and then we honor the results,” he said. “The people of this nation and the laws of the land won’t stand for anything else.”He also offered an optimistic vision, calling on Americans to “dream again” and predicting that “the 21st century is going to be an American century.”Biden’s remarks came as Covid-19 cases are surging nationwide. Hospitalizations, deaths and the testing positivity rate were also up sharply as the nation approached Thanksgiving, and public health experts have warned that the large family gatherings expected for the holiday are likely to extend and exacerbate the surge.Biden has said turning the tide of the pandemic will be the top priority of his administration once he takes office in January, and he’s made multiple public remarks urging Americans to embrace mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines to combat the spread. The Democratic president-elect formed a coronavirus advisory board of scientists, doctors and public health experts, and he plans to establish a Covid-19 coordinator in the White House to lead his administration’s response.This week, however, Biden focused beyond the crisis stateside and unveiled his national security team on Tuesday, including his nominees for secretary of state, director of national intelligence and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Drawing implicit contrasts with President Donald Trump throughout the event, Biden said that the team “reflects the fact that America is back, ready to lead the world, not retreat from it.” He’s also expected to name Janet Yellen as treasury secretary in the coming weeks.The president-elect’s team has also begun the next phase of its transition preparations after the Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration declared Biden the “apparent winner” of the election, removing a major roadblock to cooperation between Biden’s staff and their counterparts in the Trump administration.Trump has refused to concede the election, and his campaign continues to pursue legal challenges to the vote in some states. But the GSA’s ascertainment of Biden’s win means the transition can proceed regardless of the Republican president’s resistance.For the next few days, Biden plans to spend some time focused on his family. He’s traveling with his wife, Jill, to Rehoboth Beach, the small Delaware beach town where the two have a vacation home. That’s where they’ll host their daughter and son-in-law for Thanksgiving dinner. Biden is expected to stay through the weekend in Rehoboth, before returning to Wilmington for further work on the transition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-appeals-for-unity-in-thanksgiving-eve-address/story-hkYa2fggDwH8pSe0LoqKfL.html
26-11-2020||World||Defying warnings, millions in US travel for Thanksgiving amid raging Covid-19||Millions of Americans took to the skies and hit the road ahead of Thanksgiving at the risk of pouring gasoline on the coronavirus fire, disregarding increasingly dire warnings that they stay home and limit their holiday gatherings to members of their own household.Those who are flying witnessed a distinctly 2020 landscape at the nation’s airports during what is traditionally one of the busiest travel periods of the year: plexiglass barriers in front of the ID stations, rapid virus testing sites inside terminals, and paperwork asking them to quarantine upon arrival at their destination.While the number of Americans traveling by air over the past several days was down dramatically from the same time last year, plenty of others pressed ahead with their holiday plans amid skyrocketing deaths, hospitalizations, and confirmed infections across the USMany were tired of more than eight months of social distancing and determined to spend time with loved ones.“I think with the holidays and everything, it’s so important right now, especially because people are so bummed out because of the whole pandemic,” said 25-year-old Cassidy Zerkle of Phoenix, who flew to Kansas City, Missouri, to visit family.She brought snacks and her own hand sanitizer and said the flight was half full. She had a row of seats to herself.“As long as you’re maintaining your distance, you’re not touching stuff and you’re sanitizing your hands, people should see their families right now,” she said.The coronavirus is blamed for more than 12.6 million confirmed infections and over 269,000 deaths in the USMore than 88,000 people in the US— an all-time high — were in the hospital with Covid-19 as of Tuesday, and new cases have soared to an average of over 174,000 per day, the highest level on record. Deaths have surged to more than 1,600 per day, a mark last seen in May, when the crisis in the New York City area was easing.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) and state and local authorities have begged people not to travel and urged them to keep their Thanksgiving celebrations small.“That’ll make sure that your extended family are around to celebrate Christmas and to celebrate the holidays next year,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said.About 1 million people per day passed through US airport checkpoints from Friday through Tuesday, a drop-off of around 60% from the same time a year ago. Still, those have been the biggest crowds since the Covid-19 crisis took hold in the US in March.Last year, a record 26 million passengers and crew passed through US airport screening in the 11-day period around Thanksgiving.People tend to drive rather than fly during the holiday, but AAA has projected those numbers also are likely to be lower this year. How much lower the auto club has not said.Many states and cities have adopted precautions. Travelers to Los Angeles — either by plane or train — are being required to fill out an online form acknowledging California’s request that people quarantine for two weeks after arrival in the state.The resurgence of the virus and the refusal of many people to wear masks or keep their distance from others have caused despair among health care officials and front-line workers.“I’ll just to confess to you guys, I’m exhausted trying to convince folks to do stuff. It’s just going nowhere,” said Dr. Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi’s state health officer.Anne Moore, a 60-year-old woman from Chicago, flew to Albany, New York, to be with her daughter for the holiday. Her daughter is a senior at Dartmouth University, and Moore and her husband were worried about her driving back to Illinois by herself.Before the spike, the family had planned to hold a Thanksgiving gathering of fewer than 10 people. But instead it will be just Moore, her husband and her daughter.“I have friends who are alone. And I’m not inviting them. And I feel badly about that,” she said. “We’ll take a walk or something instead. But yeah, the three of us are isolating.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defying-warnings-millions-in-us-travel-for-thanksgiving-amid-raging-covid-19/story-bNAJPMOsI9ggF6dPQK3auO.html
26-11-2020||World||Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulates Joe Biden on US election victory||Chinese President Xi Jinping finally joined a growing number of world leaders to congratulate US President-elect Joe Biden on his election victory.It came as Biden introduced members of his foreign policy and national security team on Tuesday with a sharp message for the world - the US was returning to reassert its global leadership to fight terrorism, control the pandemic, and deal with issues such as climate crisis, nuclear proliferation and cyber threats.In a message sent to Biden, Xi said, according to Chinese state news agency, “Promoting healthy and stable development of China-US relations not only serves the fundamental interests of the people in both countries, but also meets the common expectation of the international community.”Xinhua further reported that Xi “hopes that the two sides will uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, focus on cooperation, manage differences, advance the healthy and stable development of China-US ties, and join hands with other countries and the international community to promote the noble cause of world peace and development”.President-elect Biden inherits a tense and testy US-China relationship from President Donald Trump and he will be watched closely at home and abroad how he approaches it as he seeks to return America to playing a larger role on the global stage.“America is back,” Biden said in Wilmington, Delaware. “Ready to lead the world, not retreat from it. Ready to confront our adversaries, not reject our allies.” Biden’s nominee for ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, summed up the new team’s ethos with a similar sentiment, saying, “America is back. Multilateralism is back. Diplomacy is back.”It was a clear repudiation of Trump’s “America First” vision that, the Democrat has said several times before, left “America alone” on the global stage. Former Trump officials such as James Mattis, the defence secretary, have called for the incoming president to eliminate Trump’s “American First” policy.Biden and his team have begun getting access to intelligence and briefings as part of the transition process, but Trump has continued to contest the election outcome, citing polls that show 79% of his supporters believe the elections were rigged. He is expected join his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani in Pennsylvania as he briefs Republican lawmakers on election fraud allegations that have been dismissed by courts.The US president was also reported to be considering granting presidential pardon to Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser convicted of lying.Biden introduced his “incredible team” of incoming officials in both policy and personal terms, talking about his long years of association with them. He called secretary of state Antony Blinker one of “my closest and most trusted advisers”. On Avril Haines, his nominee for director of National Intelligence, he said, “Can talk literature and theoretical physics, fixing cars, flying planes, and running a bookstore cafe, in a single conversation - because she’s done all of that.” The country’s next top spy chief also took the opportunity to tell the president-elect she will not hesitate to tell him something he did not want to hear. “Mr. President-elect, you know that I have never shied away from speaking truth to power, and that will be my charge as director of National Intelligence,” she said.On John Kerry, the special presidential envoy on climate, Biden said he was “one of my closest friends”, and his appointment reflected the importance he accords to combating the climate crisis.On Jake Sullivan, who will be the youngest national security adviser in US history at 43, Biden said he “understands my vision that economic security is national security”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-president-xi-jinping-congratulates-joe-biden-on-us-election-victory/story-NMKKbOpuzEkKfTNFZy24MI.html
26-11-2020||India||BJP MP’s son’s wedding had more than 1000 guests, alleges Congress; seeks action for flouting norms||Two days after the Indore district administration capped the number of guests in marriage gatherings to 250, Bharatiya Janata Party’s Member of Parliament from Jhabua, Guman Singh Damor allegedly flouted Covid-19 norms by inviting more than 1,000 guests for a marriage reception of his son in Indore on Wednesday night, a Congress leader has alleged. According to the health department’s daily Covid-19 bulletin, Indore is one of the worst affected districts, where the positivity rate of Covid-19 cases is more than 11%, the highest for any district in Madhya Pradesh. Indore has more than 3,644 active cases and only 10% beds are available in private hospitals, according to a district health officer.“A large number of politicians and high profile people attended the marriage reception of MP Guman Singh Damor’s son but no one objected to the violation of guidelines. Hardly any person wore a mask and maintained social distancing in the function. They flouted the night curfew norm too as the function ended late on Wednesday night,” said Rakesh Yadav, a general secretary of MP Congress Committee, who lodged a complaint with the district administration with pictures of the crowd present at the wedding venue and tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a tweet. Yadav also circulated the pictures and videos of the reception on social media on Thursday morning in which hardly any guest seemed to wear a mask. HT could not verify the authenticity of the pictures and videos that went viral on social media.Health activists have also demanded action against Damor.“Even after 12 hours, no action was initiated by the district administration against Damor. The district administration should taken tough action against Damor to set an example for common people,” said Amulya Nidhi, a health activist. Member of Parliament from Indore and a member of the disaster management committee of Indore, Shankar Lalwani said, “When I reached the venue, there were less than 200 people. The venue had a huge space and people maintained social distancing. Congress leaders are unnecessarily making an issue.” MP Guman Singh Damor also refuted the allegations and said, “I invited only 250 people. The photos, which are being circulated in social media, don’t belong to the reception of my son.”Despite repeated attempts, Indore district collector Manish Singh and divisional commissioner Pawan Kumar Sharma couldn’t be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mp-s-son-s-wedding-had-more-than-1000-guests-alleges-congress-seeks-action-for-flouting-norms/story-XpN0S8JgRQQ5DKctpVDymO.html

Sahu said restrictions will be clamped on the stretch from Marichikot square in the city till the Singhadwar of the temple and around the temple.“Extensive security arrangements have been made for the special occasion with deployment of 25 platoons of police force. To monitor the arrangements, 2 additional SPs, 7 Deputy SPs, 19 sub-inspectors and 77 assistant SIs have also been positioned in Puri. They will guard the Nagabesha (Naga Attire) which will be brought from Harachandi Sahi to the main temple on late Thursday night.Nagarjuna Besha is observed during the month of Krtika when Panchuka (last five days of Kartika month) is observed as six days instead of five. The besha is celebrated in commemoration of the killing of Kartyavera Arjuna, one of the main kings slain by Parsuram. The besha was last observed in 1994, when six devotees were killed in the ensuing stampede.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puri-goes-under-section-144-to-prevent-crowds-during-nagarjuna-besha-held-after-26-years/story-pihELUE7bK2mssMH6S9VwM.html

26-11-2020||India||Former Assam CM Tarun Gogoi’s son seeks blessings to fulfil his father’s last wish||Veteran Congress leader and former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi’s son, Gaurav, a sitting Lok Sabha MP, has sought blessings from people of the state to fulfill his father’s last wishes. Speaking to journalists after performing the late leader’s last rites in Guwahati on Thursday at the Nabagraha crematorium, Gaurav thanked everyone for showering love, respect and prayers for the departed soul. The 84-year-old, three time chief-minister, passed away on Monday at the Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) after battling Covid-19 and complications related to the disease for nearly three months. “I have suffered a big loss, but I am not sad. I am at peace to see the love and respect and prayers of the people of Assam for him. According to doctors at GMCH, his last wish was to visit Titabar (the constituency Gogoi represented in Assam assembly),” Gaurav told journalists. Gogoi was reportedly unhappy that he had not been able to visit Titabar due to his illness. He also wanted to visit all parts of Assam and convey his last wishes and dreams for Assam to the public through the media. “The family has decided that we will take his ashes to Titabar and across Assam as per his wishes. Though he is not with us, his thoughts, teachings and ideas are with us,” said Gaurav. “As his son, I will try to fulfill his last wishes and seek the blessings of the people of Assam for that. I thank them for the immense outpouring of love and respect for my father,” he added. Gogoi’s last rites were conducted with full state honours including a 21-gun salute. Gogoi’s wife Dolly, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, several senior ministers, senior bureaucrats, police officers and Congress in-charge for Assam Jitendra Singh were present on the occasion. Earlier, on Thursday morning Gogoi’s body was taken from Srimanta Sankardeva Kalakshetra, where it had been kept for the public to pay respects, to his official residence for some rituals associated with the last rites. From there it was taken in a procession to a church, a ‘naam-ghar’ (prayer house), a mosque and two temples before the cortege proceeded to the Nabagraha crematorium for the last rites. Gogoi’s mortal remains were placed in a flower-decked vehicle where his son Gaurav, few family members and senior leaders of Congress including state unit president Ripun Bora were present. Hundreds of people lined the streets along which the procession passed to bid their final adieu to Gogoi-a scene not seen earlier in Guwahati for any political leader. Nine years ago, thousands had thronged the streets to pay their respects to one of Assam’s foremost cultural icons, Bharat Ratna Bhupen Hazarika. The Assam government had declared a half-day state holiday on Thursday as a mark of respect to Gogoi. A three-day state mourning had been declared on the day of his demise. Gogoi, who served as chief minister for three terms from 2001 to 2016 (Assam’s longest serving chief minister) is credited with ushering peace and stability to the state after two decades of insurgency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-assam-cm-tarun-gogoi-s-son-seeks-blessings-to-fulfil-his-father-s-last-wish/story-vrQanqJAZAP4cLFX3cKlAK.html

26-11-2020||India||Rajasthan CM asks Centre to hold talks with farmers, calls farm laws ‘anti-people’||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday called the three farm laws passed by Parliament “black laws” and pushed the Centre to immediately hold talks with farmers to resolve their issues.The Congress leader slammed the government for being “up in arms against its own people”.“NDA government’s anti-people policies have led to various sections of society coming out to oppose. Farmers are protesting too against black farm laws. Instead of resolving their woes, the government is up in arms against its own people,” the Rajasthan chief minister said on Twitter.Gehlot’s remarks come as tension between farmers and the Haryana Police continued on Thursday with the cops using water cannons and tear gas to stop thousands of protesters heading towards the national capital for ‘Delhi Chalo’ march to protest against the farm laws passed in September.“As all the farmer organizations in the country have come together for this movement, so understanding the sensitivity of this, the government of India should initiate a dialogue with them without any delay,” Gehlot further said.Earlier on Thursday, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar invited the farmers for talks on December 3 to resolves differences and issues regarding the new farm laws. He also appealed the farmers to not protest. “I want to appeal to our farmer brothers to not agitate. We are ready to talk about issues and resolve differences. I am sure that our dialogue will have a positive result,” Narendra Singh Tomar said, according to ANI. Tomar informed that the officials have already had a talk at the secretary level in Punjab. “The new farm laws were the need of the hour. In the coming time, it’s going to bring revolutionary changes. We have spoken at the secretary level in Punjab to dispel wrong notions of our farmer brothers there. We will talk on December 3,” he added.*Meanwhile, Defence minister Rajnath Singh, speaking on Hindustan Times Leadership Summit (HTLS), urged the farmers to end their protest. “I appeal to farmers to end their protest. We are not against them, and are open for talks. They should understand that the newly-passed farm bills will benefit small farmers,” he said.Singh also said that he himself comes from agriculture background and understands the importance of these laws for them.*||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-asks-centre-to-hold-talks-with-farmers-calls-farm-laws-anti-people/story-DJU3HuuFrmEXYoJaoKIIuK.html
26-11-2020||India||Supreme Court did not close even for a day during lockdown: CJI Bobde||Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde on Thursday said that the Supreme Court did not shut down even for a single day during the lockdown period, underscoring the resilience shown by the judiciary in preserving the vibrancy of the Constitution through the pandemic.“During the lockdown, the Supreme Court did not lock down even for a day as a huge percentage of matters involved fundamental rights of citizens, particularly old persons and victims of domestic violence,” CJI Bobde said on the occasion of the 71st Constitution Day.Speaking at two different occasions commemorating the event – one organised by the Supreme Court of India and the other by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), the CJI recalled the alarming situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic as the courts for the first time encountered a “sudden shock and interruption” that threatened access to justice.President Ram Nath Kovind presided over the event organised by the Supreme Court while the SCBA event was presided by CJI Bobde.Speaking at SCBA event, the CJI said, “The biggest and the highest challenge the courts faced was delivery of unhampered justice in the midst of lockdown as it gives a sense of security and well-being to citizens…Closing physical hearing in courts was the first step, as otherwise the disease would have spread like wildfire.”The CJI said the top court took suo moto note of the concerns of migrant workers, woefully inadequate treatment given to dying Covid patients, unaffordable cost of treatment in hospitals, and dead bodies not being cremated due to fear of the virus. “Our judiciary fared better than judiciaries of other countries,” remarked CJI Bobde, adding that during lockdown, the top court disposed of 14,849 cases, high courts about 1.5 lakh cases, and district courts close to 4.5 lakh cases. However, the pandemic gave rise to a new kind of inequality, as access to justice became dependable on access to technology. Lawyers and litigants in subordinate courts could not access justice on this count, CJI pointed out as he urged government’s help to remedy this technological gap even though it involved a huge cost.President Kovind said, “Justice can be secured to the extent it can be accessed. Access to justice has two major hurdles – cost of litigation and language.” He reiterated his passion for rendering pro bono services to poor litigants while as a lawyer and complemented the Supreme Court for arranging judgments in regional languages that kept citizens in the loop about the law proclaimed by the courts.Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad complemented the judiciary for administering justice despite all odds and said that the biggest asset about our judiciary is the public trust that has resolved conflicts of culture, religion, region, over the years to be resolved through judicial pronouncements. The law minister flagged the growing criticism against the judiciary. He observed an increasing trend of social media campaigns aimed at securing decisions in a particular way. “Justice delivery system should not play to the gallery. Judges must be left free to decide cases as per law,” Prasad said while taking exception to a recent article which referred to certain judicial decisions as acts of “judicial barbarism”. The Minister said, “Unleashing criticism that transgresses the boundary of propriety must be reflected upon….we need to be proud of our judiciary.”Attorney General KK Venugopal borrowed a saying by Roscoe Pound that courts ought to be swift and certain agents of justice. “If you have to wait for 20 to 30 years for justice, it’s a case where justice has failed to the poor and middle class citizens.” He believed that in the coming years, all subordinate courts and high courts will have the facility for live streaming and an intermediate Court of Appeal (between High Court and Supreme Court) can finally decide appeals arising from high courts leaving the Supreme Court to deal with issues of national and constitutional questions. This issue is already pending with a Constitution Bench of the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-did-not-close-even-for-a-day-during-lockdown-cji-bobde/story-z9YEUwyfHzEuj7EoIlHmQN.html
26-11-2020||India||‘Delhi Chalo’ march: Farmers 100 km away, police beef up security at border||The farmers from Haryana and Punjab, who have planned a ‘Delhi Chalo’ march against three farm laws passed by Centre, were involved in violent clashes with the police at the border as they tried to enter the national capital.The protesting farmers faced water cannons and broke police barricades at some places in Haryana. A large group of them reached the toll plaza in Panipat, about 100 km from Delhi, late on Thursday evening. The farmer bodies, which are spearheading the protests, said the protesters planned to spend the night there and will resume the march the next morning.Haryana Police chief Manoj Yadava said his force acted with “great restraint”.“In this entire episode, not only a number of police personnel were injured, but police and private vehicles were also damaged,” he said in a statement on Thursday. The DGP also said that the protesters hurled stones at many places.The reports of face-offs between the protesters and police came from Haryana’s Sirsa, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad and Jind districts.Police had placed cement and steel barricades and parked trucks on the road to stop the farmers’ tractor-trolleys, some of them laden with food for the planned two-day protest, which many felt could extend further. Police used water cannons also against protesters trying to enter Kaithal district, and at Khanauri border.Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal were among the opposition leaders who slammed the Haryana Police action.Punjab chief minister and Congress leader Amarinder Singh and his Haryana counterpart, Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Manohar Lal Khattar, traded barbs over Twitter.The Congress veteran asked Khattar why his government was stopping farmers, and the BJP leader told him to stop “inciting” them.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Sukhbir Singh Badal too criticised attempts to thwart the protest. “Today is Punjab’s 26/11. We are witnessing the end of the right to democratic protest,” he tweeted.Ahead of the protest, Haryana had announced sealing its borders with Punjab to prevent farmers from entering the state on their way to Delhi.The Delhi Police have denied permission to the farmer organisations planning to protest in the national capital. They have beefed up in border areas by deploying additional personnel and stationing sand-laden trucks and water cannons. A fence of barbed wire has also been set up at Singhu Border to prevent the protesters from entering Delhi.The police deployment has also been made at NH-24, DND, Chilla Border, Tigri border, Bahadurgarh border, Fridabad border and Kalindi Kunj border.There were traffic snarls during the day at Delhi’s border with police checking vehicles coming in from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Metro services between Delhi and NCR areas were restricted.The farmers’ bodies have, meanwhile, said that the protesters will hold a dharna wherever they are stopped from moving towards the national capital.These farmers are demanding the repeal of the new farm laws, which, they say should be replaced with another set of legislations framed after wider consultation with the stakeholders. They also want a guarantee on the minimum support prices (MSP). The Centre has, however, allayed all concerns over MSP and has even invited these farmers for talks.Speaking on Hindustan Times Leadership Summit (HTLS) on Thursday, defence minister Rajnath Singh appealed the farmers to end their protest.“I appeal to farmers to end their protest. We are not against them, and are open for talks. They should understand that the newly-passed farm bills will benefit small farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-chalo-march-farmers-100-km-away-police-beef-up-security-at-border/story-r798IYBy7GpMj1UyCCfU0K.html
26-11-2020||India||India, Nepal discuss boundary issue as foreign secretary meets top leadership in Kathmandu||India and Nepal on Thursday discussed ways to handle the boundary issue, which had recently hit bilateral ties, through existing mechanisms as foreign secretary Harsh Shringla met the country’s top leadership to bolster cooperation in key areas such as connectivity and infrastructure.Shringla met Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali and foreign secretary Bharat Raj Paudyal on the first day of his two-day visit aimed at putting the relationship on an even keel and enhancing joint efforts aimed at post-Covid-19 recovery.Ties took a hit when Nepal issued a new political map in May that laid claim to the Kalapani region, which is controlled by India, after New Delhi opened a new road to the strategic Lipulekh region. India rejected the map but said it was open to discussing the matter through appropriate mechanisms.A person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Shringla’s discussions with Oli included a “candid review of the state of the bilateral relationship”. The importance of respecting each other’s sensitivities was noted and both sides stressed on the positives in the special relationship, the person said.Also read: Pakistan tries to brush off IOC snub on not discussing KashmirDuring the various meetings, the two sides “shared their perspectives on boundary matters and discussed ways to take it forward under the appropriate bilateral mechanisms,” the person added.A statement issued by Nepal’s foreign ministry said Shringla and Paudyal “discussed the boundary matters and exchanged views on completing the boundary work in the remaining segments”.Almost 98 per cent of the 1,770-kilometre-long India-Nepal border is demarcated and the two sides only have differences in the Kalapani and Susta regions. Much of Shringla’s discussions focused on bilateral development projects, including key connectivity schemes and post-earthquake reconstruction work, and ways to expedite their implementation. At the meeting with Oli, discussions were held on specific steps that could help finalise important projects at the earliest, including the Pancheshwar multipurpose project and the launch of new economic initiatives.

He also did not rule out the possibility of the BJP coming to power in West Bengal in 2021 with a two-thirds majority.Responding to a question on whether it would be a Mamata Banerjee versus Modi fight in the Bengal assembly polls scheduled early next year, Singh said, “The possibility cannot be ruled out that the Bharatiya Janata Party may be in a position to form the government in West Bengal with a two-thirds majority.” The Bengal assembly polls are one of the most crucial elections coming up both for the BJP as well as the country. The BJP has pulled out all stops to prevent Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress from coming to power for a third straight term.In the Lok Sabha elections held in May 2019, the BJP had stunned political analysts and the Trinamool Congress alike by winning nearly half of the total number of seats that the state has in the Lok Sabha. The BJP won 18 of the 42 seats while the TMC won 22. The BJP had promised back then that it would wipe out CM Mamata Banerjee’s party in her home state in the next assembly elections.

Multi-level barricading has been put in many places.Tension spiralled at the Shambhu interstate border in Haryana on Thursday as police used water cannons and teargas to disperse hundreds of farmers from Punjab who broke barricades, throwing some into the river, determined to enter the state as part of their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march. Sharing a video of the incident, Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “The country’s farmers are standing resolutely in the face of Modi government’s cruelty against them.” He also shared a verse in Hindi lauding the courage of the farmers protesting the farm laws.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Twitter, “Instead of listening to the voice of farmers protesting against the laws that snatch the minimum support price from them, the BJP government attacks them with water in this cold.” “Everything is being taken away from farmers and banks, loan waivers, airports, railway stations are being distributed to the capitalists,” she alleged in her tweet in Hindi.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also hit out at the central and Haryana governments, asking what message does Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister M L Khattar want to give by pitting soldiers in front of farmers.“They are conspiring to push the country into civil war and that too on the occasion of Constitution Day,” Surjewala alleged in a tweet in Hindi.As farmers and police in Haryana faced off at a bridge with the Ghaggar river flowing below, tractors and trucks were lined up and people could be seen waving black flags and shouting slogans.The BJP government in Haryana had earlier said it will seal its borders with Punjab on November 26-27 in view of the farmers’ march to Delhi.Delhi Police on Wednesday said it had rejected requests from various farmer organisations to protest in the national capital on November 26 and 27. A day earlier, it had said that legal action would be taken against the protesting farmers if they come to the city for any gathering amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, have announced they will go to Delhi through several routes -- Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa.Punjab farmers are demanding the repeal of the new farm laws,, which they should be replaced with another set of laws framed after wider consultation with stakeholders. They also want a guarantee on the minimum support prices (MSP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-standing-resolutely-in-face-of-modi-govt-s-cruelty-says-rahul-gandhi/story-ROpM2TprASOvNwnFJn7nyK.html

The curbs, which came into effect with immediate effect Thursday, will be effective till December 3. The government will review the situation and decide on a possible extension of its order after that, said Amir Subhani, Bihar’s additional chief secretary, home, while addressing a presser Thursday evening. The government limited attendance in offices — both government and private —to half their manpower strength in Patna, Begusarai, Jamui, Vaishali, West Champaran and Saran. These districts, particularly Patna, had shown a “more than normal increase in the case positivity rate”. Those under essential services were, however, kept out of the purview of the order, said Subhani. He said staff at offices had been regulated in keeping with the guidelines of the ministry of home affairs (MHA) for cities having a case positivity rate of over 10. “Patna has a case positivity rate of around 18%, but the other five districts have it less than 5. However, they have shown a more than normal increase in the case positivity rate over the last 3-4 days, prompting us to take preemptive steps,” said Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s principal secretary health and disaster management department. The officers, however, did not share the district-wise positivity rate break-up. Subhani also advised devotees to avoid going to river banks for a holy dip on the occasion of the upcoming Kartik Purnima festival (November 30) as there was possibility of infection spreading through air and water. The state, he said, had also issued advisory urging people above 60 years of age and children under 10 years of age, pregnant women, those suffering from fever and other critical diseases from venturing out during the ensuing festival. People were also advised to avoid crowded buses and public transport. The number of guests for marriages had been restricted to 100, including waiters for serving food, said Subhani. Similarly, guests for “shradh” ceremony had been restricted to 25. The guests would have to wear face masks. Those hosting such functions will have to ensure thermal scanning of guests and make arrangements for sanitisers. Door handles, knobs, furniture and other surfaces, which were exposed, would have to be cleaned regularly and sanitised as far as possible. Guests having symptoms of Covid-19 will not be allowed to attend such functions. The government also banned any marriage procession and DJ on roads. These were, however, permitted at the marriage venue, keeping the cap on guests at 100. The number of passengers in public transport plying within Patna and those for inter-district travel from Patna had been limited to half their capacity. These steps, said officials, had been taken to contain the spread of the infection in the state. “We are keeping a close watch on the situation and taking every effort to contain the spread of infection,” Amrit signed off. Prabhat Kumar Jha, director, information and public relations department, was also present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curbs-back-in-bihar-as-covid-case-positivity-rate-goes-up/story-dWGqU6vnCon9YEKWqFJNSP.html

We are checking all the vehicles that are coming here to make sure no farmer enters the capital. Senior officials are also patrolling the area. The same information was shared by my counterparts also,” he said.Traffic was also heavy at Kalindi Kunj near Delhi-Noida border due to checking of vehicles.Delhi-Gurugram (Haryana) border also witnessed traffic congestion due to checking of vehicles.In view of farmers’ ‘Delhi Chalo’ protest march, heavy security has been deployed at Rohtak-Jhajjar border, Singhu border (Delhi-Haryana border), Delhi-Gurugram and Delhi-Jammu highway near Karna Lake in Karnal.Earlier today, security personnel had to use tear gas to disperse the protesting farmers at Shambhu border between Punjab and Haryana.The protestors were marching towards Delhi against new farm laws which they believe will reduce their earnings, making large retailers more powerful.Prior to that, police had used water cannon to disperse the crowd of angry farmers who pelted stones at security forces deployed to control the crowd at the Shambhu border.Farmers have given a call for “Delhi Chalo” protest march, to coincide with the Constitution Day celebrations, against new farm laws. While the government says the three laws will do away with middlemen, enabling farmers to sell their produce in the commercial markets, protestors fear that this could lead to the government not buying produce at guaranteed prices, thereby disrupting their timely payments.Farmers also gathered in Haryana’s Karnal to protest against farm laws near the Karna Lake area.Earlier in the day, Delhi-Jammu Highway also saw heavy traffic jam due to a strike called by farmers.Forces from at least two police stations, besides three Central Reserve Police Force battalions, have been deployed at the Delhi-Faridabad border.Barricading has been done at four to five places on the Delhi-Faridabad border and drone cameras are also being used for security surveillance.The Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 were passed by the Upper House in September through voice vote despite objection from opposition parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-delhi-borders-witness-traffic-congestion-due-to-security-checks/story-T9gu71uYYsn0Y61UgoPcvN.html

The contraction in Q1, earlier this year had been nearly 24 per cent.Indicating that the systematic unlocking of activities across India in a post-Covid-19 scenario had led to a revival of private investment, the veteran banker linked the slightly better performance of companies in the second quarter (Q2) to the Centre’s move to ‘Unlock’ after the lockdown imposed due to Covid-19. “Regulations and tighter corporate governance will take care of corporates in the banking sector. Post-Unlock, economic activity revival has given hope to many across sectors. The second quarter has seen an improvement in the activity level. Demand revival itself has kick-started the economy. I expect if the current trend of revival continues the year-end performance of corporates will look significantly better,” the SBI veteran who barely a month ago took charge of India’s largest bank said.ALSO READ | HTLS 2020: ‘Significant improvement in Q2,’ says SBI chairman, links it to ‘unlock situation’“In the post-Covid-19 world, a lot of things have changed. How companies perform does not always depend on their ownership structures. Much of ownership issues and their solutions depend on corporate governance. The ownership structure does not matter if corporate governance is tight and contemporary,” Khara said.There has been a significant demand for affordable housing and that in turn offers promise going forward. Maybe for deluxe real estate, the demand may not be as robust but in the affordable housing segment there is good demand, the SBI chairman said. “We at SBI think that there is a lot of capacity in the real estate sector year-on-year, and going forward we expect decent growth in the housing sector,” Khara elaborated.WATCH | How will the Indian economy fare? SBI chairman’s GDP prediction #HTLS2020Dinesh Kumar Khara’s rise to the top office of India’s largest bank is an inspiring journey of a probationary officer, who joined the banking profession in 1984. Before being appointed as chairman of SBI for a period of three years in October, earlier this year, he was already serving as managing director of the bank. But like he pointed out, although he had been part of the top management earlier as well at SBI, “currently the buck stops at me,” Khara said.One of the banker’s most recent accomplishments was the successful merger of SBI with its five associates and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank that put the country’s largest bank at par with top 50 banks globally.The SBI chairman was speaking at a virtual session held on the third day of the 18th edition of the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit 2020, in conversation with Shereen Bhan, managing editor, CNBC TV18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/regulations-tighter-corporate-governance-will-lead-to-better-performance-as-we-close-the-year-sbi-s-dinesh-kumar-khara-at-htls-2020/story-jz3qdjetZNIDutXXiwKdmL.html

If CM wants, he can resolve a lot of things. Captain Amarinder Singh should have put pressure by going to Delhi & holding a meeting with Centre.

Heavy security was seen at the Rohtak Jhajjar border, Delhi-Haryana border, Delhi-Gurugram and Delhi-Jammu highway.Though the Centre has maintained that the newly brought in farm reforms will eliminate middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce in commercial markets, protesters fear the new laws will allow big corporations to enter the agricultural sector and further end the system of minimum support price (MSP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-don-t-want-to-begin-campaign-under-any-political-flag-sad-chief/story-7jHzs2NGdFxJAh4tFp9GwL.html

On June 8, 2020, a special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court in Mumbai has ordered confiscation of Nirav Modi’s movable and immovable properties worth Rs1,396 crore.The order has come on an application filed by ED under provisions of the Fugitive Economic Offenders (FEO) Act, 2018, and the properties to be confiscated include Modi’s bank balances in India and England, as also his immovable properties in India, UAE and England.Rohin’s counsel, advocate Amit Sibal, submitted that the Samudra Mahal property did not belong to any individual, but to Rohin Trust. He added that provisions of the FEO Act require notices to be issued to every interested person before ordering confiscation of any property.But, no notice was issued to Robin, although he is the beneficiary of the Rohin Trust and the order was passed without granting him an opportunity of hearing.Sibal submitted that the Samudra Mahal property could not be labelled as “proceeds of crime” as it was bought in 2006 whereas the alleged crime -- the massive fraud at PNB -- was committed 2011 onwards.ED’s counsel, advocate Hiten Venegaonkar, said that Rohin is only 10℅ beneficiary of the Trust and its major beneficiaries were his parents, and one of them -- Nirav Modi -- was declared a fugitive offender by the special court in December 2019.Also, Venegaonkar said, the petitioner was minor at the relevant time and his father and natural guardian was represented before the special court, so Rohin cannot claim that he was not represented or heard before passing of the confiscation order.The ED’s lawyer then requested the court to defer the hearing till December 14. Venegaonkar then assured the court that “nothing will happen” as regards the property till December 14.On January 31, 2018, the Central Bureau of Investigation has registered an offence under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code against Modi and several others, including two officers of the PNB.According to the complaint lodged by PNB, between February and May 2017, Nirav Modi and his partnership firms got fraudulently issued 150 Letters of Undertaking (LOUs) from Brady House branch of PNB and duped the public sector bank to the tune of USD1,015.35 million, equivalent to Rs6,498.20 crore.A similar offence is registered against Mehul Choksi for duping PNB of crores of rupees by using the same modus operandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pnb-fraud-nirav-modi-s-mumbai-penthouse-won-t-be-auctioned-before-december-14-ed-tells-hc/story-p21DvtYqazrYSJjwsZFTBN.html
26-11-2020||India||Top BJP leaders including Nadda, Amit Shah and Yogi to campaign for GHMC polls||Leaving no stone unturned to capture power in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections scheduled to be held on December 1, the Bharatiya Janata Party of Telangana is roping in all its top leaders from different parts of the country for the election campaign. BJP national president J P Nadda will be taking part in a couple of road shows in the municipal divisions falling under Malkajgiri parliamentary constituency on Friday, apart from addressing youth and intellectuals in Hotel Mariotte, state BJP official spokesperson K Krishna Sagar Rao told Hindustan Times. On Saturday, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath will address a series of rallies in Rajendranagar and GHMC divisions falling under the Chevella parliamentary constituency. The biggest rally would be that of former BJP national president and Union home minister Amit Shah in Secunderabad on Sunday, the last day of the campaign for the GHMC elections. “We are yet to finalise his programme – whether it would be a public meeting or road shows in two or three divisions,” the BJP spokesperson said. Though there was a proposal initially to bring even Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address a rally in Hyderabad on Sunday, it might not happen due to paucity of time, Rao said. Senior BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was in Hyderabad on Thursday to release the party’s election manifesto for the GHMC. Among other things promised by the party for the people of Hyderabad are: free tabs to all children belonging to poor families with free Wi-Fi facility for online education, waiver of property tax in all SC colonies and slum areas, free travel facility for women in metro trains and city buses, free drinking water supply to all households and free power supply to those consuming less than 100 units of power. In the last two days, Union ministers Prakash Javdekar and Smriti Irani have also been to Hyderabad to take part in the BJP campaign. Javdekar also released a charge-sheet against the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government. TRS working president K T Rama Rao wondered why so many national leaders of the BJP were coming to campaign for the party in “gully elections.” He, however, said it would have been better had these leaders come to Hyderabad when the city was facing heavy rains and floods. “Instead of coming with empty hands, I request them to bring along the Rs 1,350 crore financial assistance for taking up relief measures in rain-affected colonies, as requested by our chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao,” KTR commented. The TRS, which has already been undertaking a high-decibel campaign in every nook and corner of the city, is also not taking any chances in its bid to retain power. The party is making arrangements for a mega public meeting at Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the heart of Hyderabad, to be addressed by the chief minister. “We are confident that KCR’s speech would be the last nail the opposition’s coffin in the GHMC elections,” a senior TRS leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-bjp-leaders-including-nadda-amit-shah-and-yogi-to-campaign-for-ghmc-polls/story-zR8NeOErzLjOrwii4WqFmJ.html
26-11-2020||India||Arrested activist Stan Swamy, 83, files fresh plea requesting straw again||The lawyer for father Stan Swamy on Thursday filed a fresh application seeking direction to the prison authorities to allow winter wear clothes and a straw and sipper for him in prison.Eighty-three-year-old Swamy, a Jesuit priest, was arrested on October 8 from his home in Ranchi for his alleged role in inciting mob violence in Bhima Koregaon near Pune in Maharashtra on January 1, 2018.He was remanded in judicial custody and has been lodged in Taloja jail since then.In early November, Swamy’s lawyer Sharif Shaikh had filed an application for giving direction to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to supply a straw and a sipper which were taken from him at the time of his arrest.The NIA special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty on Thursday told the court that they don’t have any of Swamy’s things with them.Following this, the defense lawyers moved an application seeking direction to the prison authorities to provide Swamy with the same at a cost. The defense has pleaded that he has been suffering from Parkinson’s disease and needs a straw as well as slippers for daily use. On the receipt of the fresh application, the court has now asked the prison authority to file a report by December.Swamy is known for fighting for tribals rights in the state of Jharkhand and was part of the Jharkhand Organisation against Uranium Radiation (JOAR), a campaign run against Uranium Corporation India Limited in 1996. He has been working for welfare and rights of displaced people of Bokaro, Santhal Parganas and Koderma.In a statement released just before he was arrested, Swamy said, “The nature of the present NIA investigation of me has nothing to do about Bhima-Koregaon case in which I have been booked as a ‘suspected-accused ’ and consequently raided twice (28 August 2018 and 12 June 2019). But it had everything to do to somehow establish (i) that I am personally linked to extremist leftist forces, (ii) that through me, Bagaicha is also related to some Maoists. I denied both these allegations in the strongest terms.”Bagaicha is a Jesuit-run social centre, where Swamy lived in a room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrested-activist-stan-swamy-83-files-fresh-plea-requesting-straw-again/story-rmDiZlNccvNgkCMHthSRuJ.html
26-11-2020||India||India sees highest drop in work, social, household travels due to Covid-19 pandemic: Survey||Amid the global wave of Covid-19 in the past nine months, India saw the highest drop in work, social and household travels among nine countries, including China and the US, reflecting the disruptive changes brought about by the pandemic in the patterns of mobility across the world, according to survey consultancy firm EY. The changing mobility pattern has further raised pertinent questions about the nature and shape of cities and transport networks. “Amid this health crisis, the consumer is heavily conflicted over mobility; not having to commute to work has given many a new sense of autonomy as well as a few hours of their time back every day,” EY said in a statement. As far as India is concerned, the survey found that the country “witnessed the highest drop in work travel of nearly 69 per cent, followed almost parallelly by social travel that declined by 59 per cent and household travel that fell by 58 per cent”. “The drops are substantial, as India which is the world’s biggest democracy with a population of 138 crore, parallels the levels of work-related decline of 70 per cent in a small country of Sweden with a population of only a crore,” it added. EY said the decline can be attributed to the strict lockdown measures in India to control the pandemic, resulting in steep declines across travel segments. “The survey results also indicate an overall reduction in average weekly travel time by 40 per cent from 6 hours to 3.7 hours per person,” it added. EY India Partner and Automotive Sector Leader Vinay Raghunath said, “The change in mobility industry dynamics and consumer behavior will push sector stakeholders to think through new operating models that leverage digital platforms and help ride the next wave of mobility growth.” EY had conducted a survey, as part of the Mobility Consumer Index, this month with 3,300 consumers across nine countries, including India, China, the US and the UK, to explore the impact of Covid-19 on consumer attitudes and behavior towards mobility. Five hundred respondents from India participated in the survey. Of the nine countries surveyed, EY said India and Singapore have witnessed the maximum decline in average weekly commute time. “India felt the steepest decline of more than 5 hours, from 81 per cent to just 27 per cent, while in Singapore, it fell from 61 per cent to 19 per cent,” it said. EY added that a long-term decline in commuting time could mean a lower peak demand and less strain on public transport systems and road networks. It also said, “This profuse reduction in use of public transport and road networks brings forth a challenging situation for the trains, buses and subway operators that find it difficult to generate enough revenue to meet their operational costs.” EY said one of the few positive impacts of the early days of the pandemic due to the lockdown was the sudden drop in air pollution in large cities. “Emissions fell drastically, skies cleared and the residents of New York, London, Shanghai, Mumbai and other major metro cities that are usually traffic-clogged global cities enjoyed clean air for the first time in decades,” it said. EY’s analysis indicates that monthly per-capita emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) fell globally across all three travel segments, broadly tracking the decline in journey numbers already noted. Emissions fell substantially, by 56 per cent for work travel, 58 per cent for social and household travel and 62 per cent for leisure and entertainment, the statement said. EY India Partner (Automotive Sector) Som Kapoor said the changed scenario with regard to reduced emissions points towards the need for newer non-polluting mobility avenues like electric vehicles. “Rightly directed efforts will certainly catapult the growth of this much-awaited mobility model,” Kapoor added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sees-highest-drop-in-work-social-household-travels-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-survey/story-HDO2VRoAi3ubCsBG456cVM.html
26-11-2020||India||‘Should have talked to them’: Amarinder Singh’s latest jab at Khattar over farmers’ agitation||As thousands of farmers from Punjab marched to Delhi to protest the Centre’s farm laws on Thursday, the state’s chief minister Amarinder Singh and his Haryana counterpart ML Khattar waged a war of words over the issue throughout the day. The latest jab was by Singh, who questioned Khattar over his charges as farmers are on the “Delhi Chalo” protest march against the new farm laws.The Centre has said the three laws will do away with middlemen, enabling farmers to sell their produce in the commercial markets but protesters fear that this could lead to the government not buying produce at guaranteed prices, thereby disrupting their timely payments. They are protesting against the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.“Shocked at your response ML Khattar Ji. It is the farmers who have to be convinced on MSP, not me. You should have tried to talk to them before their Dilli Chalo. And if you think I am inciting farmers then why are Haryana farmers also marching to Delhi?” Amarinder Singh asked, according to news agency ANI.Earlier in the day, Singh had hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Haryana government for stopping farmers on their way to Delhi, prompting Khattar to tell him to stop “inciting innocent farmers”. Singh questioned the need to stop them from proceeding, according to an official release by his office, and urged the Khattar government to allow the farmers to pass through the national highway.The Punjab chief minister also said that the constitutional right of farmers to protest was being suppressed. Singh also condemned the use of “brute” force by Haryana police, which had used water cannons and tear gas in a bid to stop the farmers from Punjab from marching through the state and had not allowed farmers from Haryana to move out of their villages in many places.On his part, Khattar asked Singh to desist from misleading farmers, pointing out to him that he has already pledged to quit politics if the minimum support price mechanism is ever dismantled. Khattar also accused the Punjab CM of “only tweeting and running away from talks” with him for the last three days on the issue. “@Capt Amarinder Ji, I’ve said it earlier and I’m saying it again, I’ll leave politics if there’ll be any trouble on the MSP -- therefore, please stop inciting innocent farmers,” Khattar tweeted.“I’ve been trying to reach out to you for the last 3 days but, sadly, you have decided to stay unreachable -- is this how serious you are for farmers’ issues? You’re only tweeting and running away from talks, why?” Khattar said in another tweet.The protesting farmers had also blocked the movement of trains in Punjab for the last two months, before yielding to public and government pressure and lifting the blockade.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-have-talked-to-them-amarinder-singh-s-latest-jab-at-khattar-over-farmers-agitation/story-BYArKn9gqzxHm6h4mAzUzH.html
26-11-2020||India||India needs ‘One Nation, One Election’, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi pitched hard for his plan for One Nation, One Election and told a conference here on Thursday that it is not just a matter of debate, but a requirement for India. He also spoke for a common voter list for all elections to prevent waste of resources. Virtually addressing legislative presiding officers from all across India here on Thursday, PM Modi maintained that simultaneous elections at every level —Lok Sabha, Vidhan Sabhas or local panchayats—should be held together using a common voter list. “Every few months, we see an election in some part of the country. You all know what the impact of these polls is on the development works. There is a need for a deeper study and discussion on the issue and I suggest presiding officers may lead such discussions,” Modi said. One Nation, One Election has been a key electoral reform pushed by the NDA government but has met stiff opposition from rival parties. Last year, the Congress skipped a meeting called by the PM on the issue and the Left parties dubbed the move as “backdoor way of replacing our parliamentary democracy”. Also read | India tackling terror with new policy and process: PM Narendra ModiDescribing the presiding officers as the bridge between public and the Constitution, Modi hit out indirectly at the Congress for imposing the Emergency. The PM said an attempt was made to dilute the separation of power of the three wings of the state in the 1970s but the Constitution provided the solution. “After the Emergency, the system of checks and balances kept getting stronger as legislature, executive and judiciary moved ahead, learning from the episode,” he said. Celebrating the Constitution Day, the PM said the Constitution also helped India face the challenged of Covid-19 as several laws could be enacted to help people. He praised Parliamentarians too for taking a pay cut and working more to increase the output of Parliament. The Prime Minister cautioned against the tendency of keeping projects pending. He gave the example of Sardar Sarovar Project which was stuck for years and kept the people of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan from the massive benefits which were accrued when the dam was finally constructed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-needs-one-nation-one-election-says-pm-modi/story-NkjlwfOTDYwqjXJ3zdINOK.html

The chief minister ordered the officials to support the family of the deceased. The district received an average rainfall of 7 cms in the last 12 hours. The officials told the chief minister that three farmers were stranded in a rivulet in Mallemadugu near Reningunta in Chittoor district. Teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) managed to rescue two of them, while another farmer was washed away and could not be traced.Nellore district, which is closer to Tamil Nadu, bore the maximum brunt of Cyclone Nivar. As many as 923 families had been shifted to 53 shelter homes in the district. Similarly, as many as 340 families in Satyavedu mandal of Chittoor district were shifted to relief centres. In Nellore town, heavy gales accompanied by rain uprooted trees and electric poles blocking traffic at several places, resulting in disruption of power supply. Several towns like Sullurpeta, Atmakur, Venkatagiri, and Kavali revenue divisions of the district received heavy rains with strong winds since last night. A bridge collapsed at Lingasamudram village between Venkatagiri and Rapuru towns. Traffic has been diverted in the area. The temple town of Tirumala also received heavy rainfall since Wednesday night. There were landslides and uprooting of trees on the Tirupati-Tirumala ghat road, leading to disruption of traffic. The wall of a community hall also collapsed, damaging two bikes. Flights to Tirupati are behind schedule. The airlines communicated information about the delayed flights to passengers through messages. Officials told the chief minister that because of heavy rains, there has been damage to crops at some places and damage assessment programs will be carried out as soon as the rains subside.

The BKS, which is an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), is not part of the ongoing protests, but has been critical of the new laws—the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020—that were passed in Parliament amid strong protest from the opposition. While the BKS blames the opposition for politicising the issue, it wants the government to end the stalemate by agreeing to their demand of ensuring sale at MSP.

As on date, farmers in various parts of the country including Punjab, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh are being forced to make distress sales,” Kulkarni said. On Thursday, hundreds of farmers on who are on their way to Delhi were stopped by the Haryana Police using water cannons and tear-gas shells, evoking strong reactions from the opposition. The Congress party, which has been opposed to the farm regulation, criticised the police action against the protesting farmers. “For nearly 2 months farmers have been protesting peacefully in Punjab without any problem. Why is Haryana govt provoking them by resorting to force? Don’t the farmers have the right to pass peacefully through a public highway? @mlkhattar,” Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh tweeted.

Don't the farmers have the right to pass peacefully through a public highway? @mlkhattar pic.twitter.com/NWyFwqOXEuThe BKS functionary said the central government needs to be proactive in reaching out to the farmers to initiate dialogue and also meet their demands. “There are three things we have demanded, first is ensuring that all produce that is sold fetches the MSP. Second, in the open markets there has to be a mechanism to register all the traders who will buy produce. And the third is that there should be dedicated court to take up agri-related disputes,” Kulkarni said. On the protests that have been going on for months, the BKS functionary said the farmers’ concerns are being hijacked for political gains. “The government has agreed to talk and there is a meeting on December 3; but these protests are politically engineered, which is why we are not part of them. The farmers should realise that the laws that were passed in Punjab and Rajasthan are also an eye-wash,” he said. States such as Punjab and Rajasthan had drafted their own laws to negate the central laws. “In Punjab, they have said purchase of wheat and paddy will not be allowed if the price is lower than the MSP. Do farmers grow only these crops in Punjab, what about the other crops? Similarly, in Rajasthan they have ensure MSP for contractual farming; do contractual farmers grow paddy and wheat? Non- contract farming is usually for high-value produce, so who is the government helping?” Kulkarni said. He also criticised the police action against farmers and said in a democracy, people have a right to voice their concerns. “It is fair that the government is worried about the rising cases of Covid-19; but what is happening is not good,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-govt-should-ensure-msp-says-sangh-body/story-7nXWXCDGrrzPKzMsc8LI5H.html
26-11-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee made Shah Rukh Khan brand ambassador as he’s a Khan: Bengal BJP chief||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee made Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan the state’s brand ambassador because he is a Khan, state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Dilip Ghosh said at a rally in Krishnagar in Nadia district on Thursday afternoon. The BJP won the Ranaghat Lok Sabha seat in Nadia district in 2019. Taking forward the tussle with the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) that has accused the BJP of being a party of “outsiders” that depends on Hindi-speaking leaders from Delhi and other states for the crucial assembly polls due in about five months, Ghosh singled out Banerjee in his speech. “The BJP is called outsiders here but if you (Banerjee) wanted a superstar as brand ambassador for West Bengal then you could have chosen Dev, a popular hero and Lok Sabha member. Alternatively, you could have made legendary actor Soumitra Chatterjee the brand ambassador. But you selected Shah Rukh Khan. Don’t we understand why? You need a Khan. Others will not do. We all know that you need a Khan for electoral politics,” said Ghosh. Actor Deepak Adhikari, popularly known as Dev, is the TMC Lok Sabha member from Ghatal in West Midnapore. Soumitra Chatterjee, an icon in Bengal, died recently in Kolkata at the age of 85. Muslims comprise around 30 % of Bengal’s population.This is not the first time the BJP has accused Banerjee of turning to minorities to secure her vote bank. The BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats last year and had campaigned against the CM along these lines. TMC’s senior Lok Sabha MP and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said, “Dilip Ghosh, who always wears his communal glasses, cannot see the reality or understand that the chief minister made Khan the brand ambassador of Bengal not because of his surname but because of the fact that he is extremely popular not just in India but beyond the borders.” “Ghosh is talking about [Soumitra] Chatterjee but neither he nor any of the state BJP leaders took part in his funeral procession and the last rites where the chief minister was present for hours. It was a state funeral. The actor was earlier honoured by her with the Banga Bibhushan award. Dev, because of his popularity, is a two-time MP and serves the people,” said Roy. In February 2012, Khan formally accepted Banerjee’s proposal to become the state’s brand ambassador. The acceptance came in the form of a letter to the chief minister. She had requested the movie icon during a chat after the inauguration of the 17th Kolkata film Festival in November 2011, months after ousting the 34-year-old Left Front government. Khan had initially verbally agreed to the chief minister’s appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-made-shah-rukh-khan-brand-ambassador-as-he-s-a-khan-bengal-bjp-chief/story-7PthkynE7uMLhZMBaf5ErK.html

They warned that if the dues are not cleared, they would boycott paddy procurement in the district.The memorandum said that the SFC has to pay Rs 12.41 crore for transportation cost of milled rice in addition to Rs 3.24 crore as managerial subsidy and over Rs 5.37 crore as cost of gunny bags. The SFC had to pay a total amount of over Rs 21 crore to 151 Kaimur PACS and five Vyapar Mandals for procurement years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20.The SFC owes Rs 23 cr to 243 PACS and 18 Vyapar Mandals in Rohtas district for the three consecutive procurement seasons. The situation is similar in almost all paddy growing districts in the state, Sanjay Singh, chairman, Rohtas PACS association said.The state government gives the procurement agencies the cost of transporting milled rice to SFC collection centres as well as Rs 10 per quintal managerial grant after milling one quintal of paddy and depositing the rice at collections centers. The government gives Rs 25 per quintal cost for gunny bags to the agency which is paid to farmers who brought paddy in gunny bags.“The cooperative banks give the agency cash credit for payment of paddy, gunny bags and transportation to farmers and transporters. The agencies return the money to cooperative banks after the amount is paid to them by SFC.“As the SFC did not pay our dues, the PACS and Vyapar Mandals have been declared defaulter by the banks. The interest on the credit is also increasing and PACS are running in loss”, Dwivedi said.Santosh Kumar, SFC district manager, Kaimur, said that he had informed state headquarters about the dues and problem of procurement agencies. The matter would be resolved and procurement would be started in time, he said.“in previous years, the government paddy procurement exercise used to start on November 15. But it was yet to begin for procurement season 2020-21. Is it not a gross negligence on the part of the government who did not solve the issues in time and left it for peak season”, Ravi Shankar Agrawal, a leading farmer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-paddy-procurement-in-bihar-agencies-threaten-to-stop-work-if-dues-not-cleared/story-JoEWsT0UiQXJsRMiGHfUbJ.html

In 2008, terrorists sent by Pakistan launched an attack on Mumbai that left many Indians and foreigners dead. I pay my tribute to all of them.”“Today’s India is fighting terror attacks with new policies and processes,” said Modi.Watch l ‘India can’t forget 26/11 wounds, fighting terrorism with new policy’: PM Modi Also Read: ‘Polls held every few months, impact on development works known to all’: PM Modi pitches for ‘One Nation, One Election’India’s hardened stand towards tackling terror has been a key feature of the Modi government’s security policy and the leadership of the current dispensation has often tried to play up the difference between the United Progressive Alliance era and the National Democratic Alliance regime’s approach towards terror.In 2016, the Modi government sent forces across the border for a surgical strike on Pakistani soil after the terror attack on Uri. While the Congress and several military experts claimed that such strikes were conducted earlier as well, the surgical strike of September 2016 was different because the political leadership took ownership of the action and announced India’s muscular military response to the world. The operation was in retaliation against an attack on an Indian Army camp in Uri, Kashmir, the same month that claimed the lives of 19 soldiers. The suicide attackers had come from Pakistan.Three years later, the decision to carry out air strikes was taken within 24 hours of the Pulwama attack, with the government giving the Indian Air Force two weeks to select terror targets and launch air strikes against them.The new security policy of the government has also been a talking point for the BJP in the polls.The Prime Minister also paid homage to the police personnel who died in the Mumbai terror attack and to all the security forces who have died fighting terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tackling-terror-with-new-policy-and-process-pm-narendra-modi/story-1u6ptO3rNxrCrtz2J5atBN.html
26-11-2020||India||Need strong police force to prevent terror attacks: Maha CM Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday paid tributes to the martyrs of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack on its 12th anniversary, and said the police force needs to be so strong that terrorists do not dare to attack the state or its capital city.Speaking at the Maharashtra Police headquarters here after paying floral tributes to the martyrs, Thackeray said though the state is facing a financial crisis, his government will take every step to strengthen the police force.Earlier, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray also paid respects to the martyrs, who died fighting terrorists during the attack on November 26, 2008, at the newly-built memorial at the police headquarters in south Mumbai.Wives of some of the personnel killed in the 26/11 attack inaugurated the martyrs’ gallery at the state police headquarters here.On the occasion, Thackeray released of coffee table book, titled ‘True Grit’ on the Maharashtra Police’s work during Covid-19 pandemic.“We should make our force so strong that the idea of attack on Maharashtra and Mumbai does not come into the mind of terrorists, they should not dare to attack the state and Mumbai. If any terrorist comes forward, he should be killed on the spot,” he said.“We woke up about strengthening the police force after the 26/11 terror attack. As we made necessary arrangements for health facilities after Covid-19 outbreak, we can also work to strengthen our police force,” he said.Thackeray remembered the day of the attack in 2008 when he was on a tour of Dhule and Nashik for poll rallies.“After getting information about the attack, I had called police inspector Vijay Salaskar and he said he had just reached home and was again rushing to the spot,” he recalled.“I then made two-three calls to him. When he picked up the call, Salaskar said he was in front of the Taj Mahal Hotel and that the police force will enter it after a survey,” the chief minister said.Salaskar was later killed while fighting with the terrorists.“Later, I made various calls to Salakar, and till this day, he hasn’t picked up the call,” the CM said on an emotional note.“When I reached Nashik, I got the shocking news, which I could not have imagined,” he said, adding that the scars of the deadly attack are “irreparable”.People should be aware of what conditions police personnel are working in, what is the meaning of police, what is their life, he said, adding the concept of martyrs gallery should also be extended to other major cities of the state.On the occasion, state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the 26/11 terror attack was a “national crisis”.“The black face of the neighboring country (Pakistan) came to light after the police caught one of the terrorists (Ajmal Kasab) alive,” he added.At least 797 Maharashtra Police personnel have died in various operations, including Naxal attacks, terror attacks, communal riots, and other official duties from 1965 to 2020, according to the state police.The 12th anniversary of the deadly terror attack was attended by a limited number of people in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.Family members of some of the martyred police personnel also paid tributes at the memorial.During the ceremony, the governor, chief minister and the home minister met family members of some martyrs.“Their sacrifice will never be erased from the memory of time and history. Today, we pay tribute to our saviours #2611Attack #2611Martyrs,” Mumbai Police tweeted.Remembering their personnel killed in the attack, the Maharashtra Police in a tweet said, “A tribute to the ones who sacrificed their lives to safeguard the rest!” “Saluting the bravehearts whose sacrifice still ignites the spirits of millions #2611Attack #2611Martyrs #SalutingMartyrs,” Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh tweeted.NCP chief Sharad Pawar also paid tributes to the policemen and other security personnel who laid their lives during the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, and called for a resolve to intensify the fight against terrorism.“Tributes to martyrs from the police and other security forces who laid their lives in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. As we condole with the families who lost their near ones in the attack, we should (also) resolve to intensify our fight against terrorism,” the former Union minister tweeted.On November 26, 2008, 10 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists from Pakistan arrived by sea route and opened fire, killing 166 people, including 18 security personnel, and injuring several others during the 60-hour siege in Mumbai.The then Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Hemant Karkare, Army Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, Mumbai’s Additional Police Commissioner Ashok Kamte, Senior Police Inspector Vijay Salaskar and Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Tukaram Omble were among those killed in the attack.The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, the Oberoi Trident, the Taj Mahal Hotel, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital and the Nariman House Jewish community centre, now renamed Nariman Light House, were some of the places targeted by terrorists.Nine terrorists were later killed by the security forces, including the NSG, the country’s elite commando force.Ajmal Kasab was the only terrorist who was captured alive. He was hanged four years later on November 21, 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-strong-police-force-to-prevent-terror-attacks-maha-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-tOiIqq9EOTwFdpbqn7zhAM.html
26-11-2020||India||Goa tourism stakeholders fume at Maharashtra’s Covid-19 SOPs||The Maharashtra government’s decision to include Goa among the places from which travellers entering the state will have to produce a Covid-19 negative certificate is a deliberate ploy to ruin Goa’s tourism, stakeholders have said.“Goa tourism is going to be doomed with the Maharashtra government asking all travelling from Goa to Mumbai to have a negative certificate. It takes 48 hours for the report to come so tourists who come to Goa and are travelling back to Mumbai will have to obtain one. Tourists will try to keep away from Goa. I think it’s a ploy to destroy Goa tourism,” John Lobo a shack owner from North Goa said. His view was echoed by the president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) Nilesh Shah who said that there was no ‘scientific reasoning’ to include Goa among the list of regions from which arrivals will be tested. “It appears that it is more of a political ploy rather than anything done with scientific reasoning. Goa is one of the safest places with regard to Covid-19 cases. No doubt safety is important and it would be OK if they had decided to test people coming in from Delhi or other hotspot places. Maybe they wish to promote their own tourist hotspots at the cost of Goa,” Shah said. “Besides these can easily be bypassed by those travelling from Goa to Maharashtra who can simply drive back via Belgaum in Karnataka or take a flight via Bangalore. These SOPs do not appear to be practical,” Shah said. Tourists from large cities like Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi have been visiting Goa with the airport now handling 48 flights and around 13,000 passengers per day. The number of flights is a little over half the number of flights being handled before the pandemic began.However, if the mandatory testing protocol continues, stakeholders, who have been hardest hit by the lockdown and travel restrictions believe the added inconvenience will further deter those willing to step out. Goa’s tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar said that the SOPs adopted by Maharashtra were “against MHA instructions”. Earlier Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant as well as health minister Vishwajit Rane had railed against the Maharashtra government after Goa was included in the list. “The Maharashtra SOPs say that even if the person is symptomatic, the person will be subjected to an antigen test. How can that work? If a person is symptomatic, the person will have to undergo an RT-PCR test. Only then can a person be successfully segregated or else it will be of no use,” Sawant told reporters.For his part, Rane has said that state government’s free Covid-19 testing services will not be extended to those people wishing to take the certificate for the purpose to travel to Maharashtra. “Goa Medical College and Directorate of Health Services has been directed not to carry out Covid test pertaining for travel purpose. The Health department is here to keep the people of Goa safe. People wishing to avail a Covid test for travel purposes should visit either the North Goa or South Goa District Hospitals. The RTPCR test will be conducted on a chargeable basis,” Rane said. “All tests pertaining to the safety of the citizens of Goa, which are recommended by the doctors of PHCs, CHCs and Flu OPDs will continue as before,” he added.Goa is recording between 100-200 cases daily while the number of deaths ranges between 0-5 over the past few weeks. However an increase in tourist numbers accompanied by social distancing norms being thrown to the winds in casinos, nightclubs and party hotspots has led to fears that the numbers could spike up once again over Christmas and the New Year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-tourism-stakeholders-fume-at-maharashtra-s-covid-19-sops/story-bDjJUpDLEW0I2sNrOxk69L.html

The situation at Haryana-Delhi border remains tense as thousands of farmers marched during the ‘Delhi Chalo’ protest against the Centre’s farm laws. Earlier this morning, Haryana police used water cannon and tear gas near Ambala to stop the farmers from reaching the national capital, an action that is being widely criticised as the force had resorted to the same measure on Wednesday evening during freezing cold weather.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday morning criticised the move and said that “peaceful protest is farmers’ constitutional right”. “The farmers are protesting against all three laws by the centre. Instead of taking this bill back, the farmers are being stopped from protesting peacefully. Water cannons are being used on them. Such kind of injustice on farmers is not fair. Peaceful protest is their constitutional right,” Kejriwal wrote on Twitter.Haryana has completely sealed off its border with Punjab and the security at Delhi-Haryana border was also tightened on Thursday morning to stop the protesting farmers from entering the national capital. Delhi Police on Wednesday had said that it has denied permission to several farmer organisations to protest in the city against the farm laws on November 26 and 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-resolve-differences-union-farm-minister-narendra-singh-tomar-invites-protesting-farmers-for-talks-on-december-3/story-NctQtvY7LhQcc7mEmBKe5L.html

26-11-2020||India||‘Will leave politics if there’s trouble on MSP’: Haryana CM Khattar asks Punjab’s Amarinder Singh to ‘stop inciting farmers’||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday urged his counterpart in Punjab to not “play with the lives of the people” and “avoid cheap politics during the time of pandemic” as thousands of farmers marched to Delhi to protest against recent agricultural reforms.Police used water cannons and tear gas shells to disperse protesting farmers headed to Delhi as they tried to break through barricades in Ambala. The farmers were seen resisting the police, trying to break and drag the barricades at the Sadopur border following which police had to use water cannons and tear gas shells to control the crowd.“Time for your Lies, Deception and Propaganda is over - let the people see your real face. Please stop putting the lives of people in danger during the Corona pandemic. I urge you to not play with the lives of the people - atleast avoid cheap politics during the time of pandemic,” Khattar said in a series of tweets.Also Read: Amarinder slams Khattar for using brute force against farmers marching towards Delhi“I’ve been trying to reach out to you for the last 3 days but sadly you decided to stay unreachable - is this how serious you are for farmer’s issues? You’re only tweeting and running away from talks, Why?” he asked. “@capt_amarinder ji, I’ve said it earlier and I’m saying it again, I’ll leave politics if there’ll be any trouble on the MSP - therefore, please stop inciting innocent farmers,” he added.Before this, Amarinder Singh had condemned the Haryana government’s “forcible” attempts to stop farmers from marching to Delhi. Singh questioned the need to stop them from proceeding, according to an official release by his office, and urged the Khattar government to allow the farmers to pass through the national highway. He also said that the constitutional right of farmers to protest was being suppressed.Watch: Police use water cannon, tear gas on agitating farmers near Delhi-Haryana border Singh also condemned the use of “brute” force by Haryana police, which had used water cannons and tear gas in a bid to stop the farmers from Punjab from marching through the state and had not allowed farmers from Haryana to move out of their villages in many places.“Why is ML Khattar government in Haryana stopping the farmers from moving to Delhi? The tyrannical use of brute force against peacefully protesting farmers is totally undemocratic and unconstitutional,” he said, asserting that “the hands that feed the nation deserve to be held, not pushed aside.” “For nearly 2 months farmers have been protesting peacefully in Punjab without any problem. Why is the Haryana government provoking them by resorting to force? Don’t the farmers have the right to pass peacefully through a public highway?” he asked.Singh urged the BJP central leadership to direct their state governments not to indulge in such “strong-arm” tactics against the farmers. “Let the farmers be heard by the central government, let their concerns be addressed,” he said, calling for peaceful resolution of the farmers’ concerns in the national interest.Also Read: Delhi Metro resumes services on Delhi to NCR routes, reverse route yet to reopenFarmers have given a call for “Delhi Chalo” protest march, to coincide with Constitution Day, against new farm laws.

They are protesting against the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Heavy security has been deployed at Rohtak-Jhajjar border, Singhu border (Delhi-Haryana border), Delhi-Gurugram and Delhi-Jammu highway near Karna Lake in Karnal.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-leave-politics-if-there-s-trouble-on-msp-haryana-cm-khattar-asks-punjab-s-amarinder-singh-to-stop-inciting-farmers/story-baPzUKALc9g3nc4LSKtxfM.html

Sadhvi Trikal Bhavanta, 50, a self-proclaimed female Shankaracharya of Akhada Pari, which was founded in 2014, on Thursday demanded from Kumbh mela administration facilities at par with those offered to all the thirteen major Akhadas falling under the umbrella of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad - the apex body of all the major recognised Akhadas. Citing some facilities offered during the previous year during the Prayagraj and Ujjain Kumbh, Sadhvi Trikal Bhavanta, in a memorandum to Haridwar Kumbh mela administration, has sought facilities and allocation of a time slot for Shahi Snaan as provided to all thirteen Akhadas. “I have been meditating for the past two decades. I am the head of the Gayatri Triveni Prayag Peeth. We had been given some facilities during the Ujjain Kumbh in 2016. We demand similar facilities from the mela administration during Haridwar Mahakumbh. We are raising voice for women seers and half of the population of the country,” said Sadhvi Bhavanta after meeting assistant Kumbh mela officer Harbeer Singh.

Just wearing saffron clothes and claiming to be a pontiff of a so-called Akhada doesn’t mean she can claim to be a recognised seer and get facilities for Mahakumbh,” he said. Mahant Narendra Giri alleged that misleading common people, mela administration and media won’t help her get any benefits or recognition from the Akhadas and the administration. Cautioning Kumbh mela administration against any such proposal and claims from such self-proclaimed head of all-female Akhada, general secretary Akhada Parishad Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj said that Trikal Bhavanta was not allocated any land by respective mela administration during Prayagraj-Nashik Kumbh fairs as Pari Akhada is in no way associated with Akhada Parishad. He further added that recognised female Sadhvis like Sadhvi Ritambhara, Uma Bharati, Lalita Jyoti and others are given due respect and even allowed to attend Peshwayis (Kumbh royal procession) and take sacred Ganga dip as well. Kumbh mela additional district magistrate Harbeer Singh said Sadhvi Trikal Bhavanta have submitted a memorandum listing facility they want during Kumbh at par with other Akhadas. “Any decision will be taken on this issue only after considering various aspects,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akhada-parishad-opposes-recognition-to-all-female-akhada-during-mahakumbh-2021/story-bR00Vgh7vb4ZWpUgJx07EJ.html

It must be noted that Bhasin and Singh were among the founding members of the PDP.They also said the PDP has abandoned Mufti Mohammed Sayeed’s vision and that “unscrupulous, communal elements with mysterious character” have taken over. “Putting our political career at stake, we joined PDP -- from the very first day of its formation -- with an aim to provide a secular alternative to corrupt and dynast NC as late Mufti Mohammed Sayeed had a vision to frustrate evil designs of communal and parochial elements but the party leadership has, unfortunately, abandoned Mufti Sahib’s agenda to become B team of NC,” the letter, signed the three, read. Also read | PDP youth wing leader Waheed Parra arrested by NIA in connection with terror case“The party leadership has recently given some highly provocative and controversial statements against the basic principles of the founder of the party. Keeping in view the prevailing situation, being disciples of late Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, it is difficult for us to work in the party which has become second fiddle to the NC,” it added.When contacted, Singh refused to identify said communal and parochial elements but maintained that the party has deviated from the vision of late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. When asked if they will also join Congress, like TS Bajwa, Ved Mahajan and Choudhary Hussain Ali Wafa, Singh said they haven’t decided yet.In October, former MP Bajwa, former MLC and general secretary Mahajan and Hussain A Wafa had submitted their resignation letters, saying that Mehbooba Mufti’s remarks had “hurt patriotic sentiments”. Lashing out at the Centre, Mufti, a former J&K chief minister, had said that she won’t raise any other flag till the flag of the erstwhile state was restored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-another-jolt-for-pdp-as-3-more-senior-leaders-quit-party/story-B8SJKtvMSjRo2nEw9augaJ.html
26-11-2020||India||‘Polls held every few months, impact on development works known to all’: PM Modi pitches for ‘One Nation, One Election’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday pitched for ‘One Nation, One Election’, saying it is the need of India as polls taking place every few months impact development works.Addressing the concluding session of the 80th All India Presiding Officers Conference via video conference, PM Modi also paid homage to the victims of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and asserted that India is fighting terrorism now with new policy and new process.“Elections are held at different places every few months, the impact it has on development works is known to all. Therefore, it is a must to have deep study and deliberation on ‘One Nation, One Election’,” PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also suggested a single voters’ list for Lok Sabha, assembly and panchayat polls, saying separate lists are a waste of resources.“We must remember that when politics take over people and nation-first policies, the nation has to pay adversely in such situations,” he said.In his address to the nation this Independence Day, PM Modi had focused on the government’s push for holding simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and assembly polls.Speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort, the Prime Minister had said, “GST [Goods and Services Tax] achieved the dream of ‘one nation, one tax’. We successfully attained ‘one nation, one grid’ in the power sector. We also developed ‘one nation, one mobility card’ system, and today there is a discussion in the country for ‘one nation, one poll’ and it should happen in a democratic manner.”The Prime Minister and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been speaking of “one nation, one poll” as a measure that will same resources and allow time for governance instead of forever being in election mode. The Opposition, however, has been vehemently opposed to the plan, describing it as a threat to India’s federal structure.PM Modi had pitched the idea of “one nation, one poll” during his first term too; a parliamentary standing committee, the Niti Aayog, and the Law Commission subsequently deliberated on the issue and submitted reports.The Law Commission recommended holding simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money; and the NITI Aayog suggested synchronised polling in phases for Lok Sabha and assembly polls from 2024.The Election Commission of India, for its part, has said the proposal can be taken up only after political parties reach a consensus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/polls-held-every-few-months-its-impact-on-development-known-to-all-pm-modi-pitches-for-one-nation-one-election/story-dw349lNQMbNykjsVd7dzQN.html

At some places, bandh supporters didn’t allow buses to ply and asked passengers to get off the public transport. Shops were damaged in central Kolkata when bandh supporters allegedly hurled bricks and used sticks to break windshields of buses in Cooch Behar. At Taratala in Kolkata, a scuffle broke out between the police and BJP workers as the latter took out a rally against the bandh. Later, police had to resort to lathi charge and a few people were arrested. Senior BJP leaders were supposed to attend the rally. In central Kolkata, passengers were asked to get off buses even as bandh supporters claimed no one was forced. Such incidents were also reported from districts like Barasat in North 24 Parganas. At Lenin Sarani in Kolkata, bandh supporters could be seen damaging shops. Protests were also stationed outside Metro stations. Many shops in Kolkata and other areas across the districts remained closed. “Some groups were protesting outside Dum Dum, Chandni Chowk and Central Metro stations. There were attempts to enter the Metro station but those failed. There was no disruption in Metro services,” said Kolkata Metro spokesperson. Protesters dumped objects such as banana leaves and tree branches on overhead wires and sat on railway tracks to block trains. Such incidents were reported from multiple places, including Canning and Jhargram. The Mamata Banerjee-administration in West Bengal has made it mandatory for government officials to attend office on Thursday to foil the Bharat Bandh called by trade unions. Passengers had a harrowing time in reaching their destinations. “I had to go to Kolkata but had to abandon the idea as train services were disrupted and bandh supporters were clashing with the police at many places,” said Arindam Das, a resident of Gosaba in South 24 Parganas. Bandh supporters also clashed with police in many places such as Barasat, Kamarhati and Durgapur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-supporters-block-trains-roads-clash-with-the-police-across-west-bengal/story-TZ0NGPjR6DZ8whqjMGEvJP.html

We are forced to take this difficult decision with heavy heart to leave the party which we were formed as disciples of late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed,” they added.In October, TS Bajwa, Ved Mahajan and Hussain A Waffa had quit the PDP, saying they are “feeling quite uncomfortable over some of her actions and undesirable utterances, especially which hurt patriotic sentiments” referring to party chief Mehbooba Mufti. “Instead of overcoming the challenges from within and outside by a process of broader consultations and trust, some elements within the party pulling the party and leadership in a particular direction, thus deviating from the basic principles, agenda and philosophy, making it difficult to face the saner voices in the society,” they had said.The resignations of Bajwa, Mahajan and Waffa had come after Mufti had said that her party’s members would not raise the tricolour unless they are allowed to raise the flag of Jammu and Kashmir, the right to which had been conferred on the erstwhile state by the now-defunct Article 370 of the Constitution.They had also come after Mehbooba Mufti joined the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, a grouping of seven political parties in Jammu and Kashmir. National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah has been chosen as its chairperson and Mufti his deputy, giving shape to an alliance that they have formed to demand the restoration of the erstwhile state’s special status.

26-11-2020||India||India’s bribery rate highest in Asia: Report||India has the highest bribery rate in Asia and the most number of people who use personal connections to access public services, according to a new report by corruption watchdog Transparency International.The Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Asia, found that nearly 50 per cent of those who paid bribes were asked to, while 32 per cent of those who used personal connections said they would not receive the service otherwise.The report is based upon the survey which was conducted between June 17 and July 17 this year in India with a sample size of 2,000.“With the highest bribery rate (39 per cent) in the region, India also has the highest rate of people using personal connections to access public services (46 per cent),” the report said.Also Read | AAP alleges corruption in hospital, BJP hits back Bribery in public services continues to plague India. Slow and complicated bureaucratic process, unnecessary red tape and unclear regulatory frameworks force citizens to seek out alternate solutions to access basic services through networks of familiarity and petty corruption, the report said.“Both national and state governments need to streamline administrative processes for public services, implement preventative measures to combat bribery and nepotism, and invest in user-friendly online platforms to deliver essential public services quickly and effectively,” the report said.Although reporting cases of corruption is critical to curbing the spread, a majority of citizens in India (63 per cent) think that if they report corruption, they will suffer retaliation, it said.In several countries including India, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, sexual extortion rates are also high and more must be done to prevent sextortion and address specific gendered forms of corruption, the report said.Sextortion is extorting money or sexual favours from someone by threatening to reveal evidence of their sexual activity through means like morphed images. In India, 89 per cent think government corruption is a big problem, 18 per cent offered bribes in exchange for votes and 11 per cent experienced sextortion or know someone who has.About 63 per cent of surveyed people think the government is doing well in tackling corruption while 73 per cent said their anti-corruption agency is doing well in the fight against corruption, it said.Based on fieldwork conducted in 17 countries, the GCB surveyed nearly 20,000 citizens in total.The report said the results showed that nearly three out of four people think corruption is a big problem in their country and the survey also found that nearly one in five people who accessed public services, such as health care and education, paid a bribe in the preceding year.This equates to approximately 836 million citizens in the 17 countries surveyed, it said. After India, Cambodia has the second highest bribery rate at 37 per cent, followed by Indonesia (30 per cent) while the Maldives and Japan maintain the lowest overall bribery rate (2 per cent), followed by South Korea (10 per cent) and Nepal (12 per cent). “However, even in these countries, governments could do more to stop bribes for public services,” the report said. The report concluded by noting that daily experience with corruption and bribery remains alarmingly high, with nearly one in five citizens paying a bribe to access key government services, such as health care or education, and one in seven being offered a bribe to vote one way or another at elections.Also Read | Amaravati land scam: SC makes FIR open for media to report“In several countries, including India, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, sexual extortion rates are also high and more must be done to prevent sextortion and address specific gendered forms of corruption,” it said.The report further said that to provide victims of corruption with channels for redress, governments must ensure that bribery is criminalised and actively investigated and prosecuted.“Citizens must have access to safe and confidential reporting mechanisms and governments must do more to ease citizens’ fear of retaliation in reporting corruption. Despite these challenges, citizens are largely optimistic about the future and believe that ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-highest-bribery-rate-in-asia-report/story-rTdEjIcMi0DLJeatOsTr3O.html

26-11-2020||India||India will never forget the wounds inflicted during 2008 Mumbai terror attacks: PM Modi||On the 12th anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India will never forget the wounds inflicted during the 2008 attacks and added the country is now combating terrorism with new policies. Modi also paid tribute to the policemen and all the citizens who lost their lives in the attacks. “Today is associated with the biggest terrorist attack on the country. In 2008, terrorists from Pakistan attacked Mumbai Many Indians died in this attack. People from many more countries were killed. I pay my respects to all those killed in the Mumbai attack,” he said.The Prime Minister also paid obeisance to the security forces who he said are trying to defend India and are thwarting conspiracies like Mumbai attacks.On November 26, 2008, terrorists of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) had carried out 12 coordinated shooting and bombing attacks lasting four days across Mumbai. At least 166 people, including six Americans and nine terrorists, were killed and more than 300 others were injured in the attacks. The Taj Mahal hotel, the Oberoi hotel, the Leopold Cafe, the Nariman (Chabad) House and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus train station were some of the locations targeted.The Prime Minister was addressing a conference of presiding officers of legislative bodies marking the celebrations of Constitution Day in Gujarat’s Kevadia. The Lok Sabha has organised the two-day conference at the banks of the Narmada River to celebrate the Constitution Day. The theme of the event is “Harmonious Coordination Between Legislature, Executive and Judiciary - Key to a Vibrant Democracy.”The Prime Minister said that right from the role of the judiciary, executive and legislature, rules about their decorum is defined in India’s Constitution. “In the 70s, we saw how there was an attempt to dissolve the dignity of separation of power, but the country got the answer only from the Constitution,” he said.“After that period of emergency, the system of checks and balances became stronger and stronger. The legislature, executive and judiciary all three learned a lot from that period and moved forward,” he added.Modi also spoke about the strength of the Constitution, which he said made it possible to conduct assembly elections in Bihar even during the coronavirus pandemic. “The world has also seen the strengthening of our electoral system at the same time in Covid-19. It is not so easy to have elections on such a large scale, results on time, the formation of a new government smoothly. The strength we have got from our constitution makes it easy for all such difficult tasks,” he said.President Ram Nath Kovind, vice president and Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani were among those who addressed the programme on Wednesday.Expressing happiness over the theme, the President said on Wednesday that all the three organs of state - the executive, the legislature and the judiciary - have been working in harmony and the tradition has taken strong roots here in India. He exuded confidence that India’s democratic system will be further strengthened by adopting the conclusions drawn from the deliberations during the conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-never-forget-the-wounds-inflicted-during-2008-mumbai-terror-attacks-says-pm-modi/story-JrU7k14uBf11Kem4aCqYqO.html
26-11-2020||India||Pak has quietly moved 26/11 attacks accused Hafiz Saeed out of jail. He is home: Intel||Hafiz Saeed, the Lashkar-e-Taiba founder sanctioned by the UN Security Council, is not serving time in jail but at his Johar Town house in Lahore from where he runs the terror group, according to people familiar with the matter.Saeed was formally placed under arrest in July 2019, months before he was sentenced to 10 years and six months in jail in a terror financing case in February this year that was described by the United States as an “important step forward”. Last week, Saeed was handed down another set of jail terms in two more cases of terror financing.Hafiz Saeed’s arrest and his subsequent conviction have been seen as an effort by the Imran Khan government to stay off the Financial Action Task Force ‘black list’ that could potentially entail extensive economic sanctions and as Prime Minister Imran Khan once put it, destroy Pakistan’s economy.But an Indian intelligence input accessed by Hindustan Times indicates that Hafiz Saeed is not in Lahore’s high-security Kot Lakhpat jail as had been widely publicised. “He is mostly at home… ostensibly in protective custody that even lets him receive guests,” an intelligence official said.Also Read: Pak rubs it in, lets Lashkar front sked prayer meeting for 10 terroristsLast month, according to the intelligence input, Saeed’s visitor at home was Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the chief operational commander and the head of the LeT’s jihad wing. The meeting is learnt to have centered around some steps that they needed to take to collect funds for jihad.Also Watch l ‘India can’t forget 26/11 wounds, fighting terrorism with new policy’: PM Modi Like Saeed, Lakhvi is also a UNSC designated terrorist and is the lead plotter of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. He has been arrested more than once by Pakistani security forces for terror in face of international pressure but like his boss Hafiz Saeed, has always been let off due to lack of evidence. Indian officials said it was Lakhvi who persuaded, guided and handled Pakistan-born US citizen David Headley for reconnaissance missions in India prior to the 26/11 attacks.Pakistan watchers in New Delhi said intelligence inputs that Hafiz Saeed was not being held in prison were in line with a pattern about Islamabad’s track record in dealing with terrorists. One of them conceded that they were initially surprised when Hafiz Saeed was convicted for the first time for 10 years and six months and had tentatively interpreted it to indicate that Saeed had outlived his utility for the Pakistani deep state. Saeed had been arrested several times since the 9/11 attacks but was always set free after the pressure eased.Indian officials said they were still not clear how Pakistan had dealt with the paperwork around Hafiz Saeed’s judicial custody.“Our understanding on the basis of the available information is that this may be an informal arrangement. We are not aware if there is a formal order notifying Hafiz Saeed’s house as a prison,” the intelligence official cited above said.Also Read: ‘We spent millions on JuD,’ Pak minister admits funding banned terror organisationIn the 12 years after 10 heavily-armed terrorists reached Mumbai from Pakistan and opened fire at multiple locations on 26 November, Islamabad, despite its many promises, has not investigated or taken any real action against the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists who plotted the attacks along with serving military officers at Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence.In all, 170 people - apart from the 4 sailors of a trawler ‘MV Kuber’ hijacked by the terrorists - were killed and 304 injured in the simultaneous attacks by the terrorists at Mumbai’s Taj Mahal Hotel, Oberoi Trident Hotel, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Cama Hospital, Chabad House, Albless Hospital, near Metro Cinema area and Leopold Cafe.Ajmal Kasab, the only terrorist to be caught alive, faced trial and was sentenced to death in May 2010. He was finally executed at Pune’s Yerwada Jail on 21 November 2012.Also Read: For global terrorist Hafiz Saeed’s ‘living expenses’, Pak goes to UNSC with a requestBut the terrorists such as Hafiz Saeed and Lakhvi who plotted and coordinated the attacks along with Pakistan military officers have gone unpunished.It was this confidence in the Pakistan deep state, Pakistan watchers said, that Saeed had mocked the United States when it first announced the $ 10 million bounty for his whereabouts in 2012. “I am ready to send information about my location on a daily basis,” a brazen Hafiz Saeed told a news conference soon after, asking the United States to send him the money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lashkar-boss-hafiz-saeed-is-serving-time-at-home-imran-khan-govt-calls-it-a-jail/story-7EQLfCNVd7kt677zSB17yI.html
26-11-2020||India||Will keep spotlight on epicentre of global terrorism: Jaishankar on 26/11 anniversary||India will keep the world community’s focus on Pakistan’s role in cross-border terrorism, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on the 12th anniversary of the Mumbai attacks even as the US reaffirmed its commitment to hold responsible the perpetrators of the carnage in India’s financial hub. A 10-member group of terrorists from the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) had launched attacks in Mumbai on November 26, 2008. A total of 166 people, including six American nationals, were killed as the terrorists rampaged through parts of the city for almost three days. “Will keep the global spotlight firmly on the menace of cross-border terrorism against India. And on the epicentre of global terrorism,” Jaishankar, currently on a three-nation tour of Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Seychelles, said in a tweet without naming Pakistan. The US state department’s bureau of South and Central Asian affairs tweeted, “On the 12th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai attack, the US reaffirms its commitment to holding the perpetrators accountable and ensuring justice for the victims, including six Americans.” The tweet added, “Standing alongside our Indian partners, we remain resolute in the fight against terrorism.” Indian officials often use the term “epicentre of terrorism” to refer to Pakistan, which arrested seven men, including LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, weeks after the attacks in Mumbai. Though the men were put on trial and dozens of prosecution witnesses testified about their involvement in planning, funding and supporting the attacks, little headway has been made in their prosecution. Lakhvi was freed on bail more than five years ago and his current whereabouts are unknown. Reports from Pakistan have suggested that he has resumed an active role in the operations of the UN-designated LeT at a time when several of the group’s top leadership, including founder Hafiz Saeed, are in jail after being convicted of terror financing. State department spokesperson Cale Brown, in a separate tweet, referred to the reward of up to $5 million offered through the US Rewards for Justice programme for information about individuals responsible for these attacks, and said Washington seeks to “ensure that all those responsible for this heinous attack face justice”. According to the Rewards for Justice website, key members of the plot behind the Mumbai attacks “remain at large, and this investigation remains active and ongoing”. Indian and US officials believe the seven men arrested by Pakistani authorities were mostly minor players and key conspirators, including intelligence operatives and Pakistan Army officials, are still at large. Jaishankar also paid homage to victims of the terror attacks and lauded the security forces “who continue to defend our nation so resolutely”. US ambassador Kenneth Juster also said in a tweet, “On the 12th anniversary of 26/11, our thoughts are with the people of India as we continue to stand together in the fight against terrorism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-keep-spotlight-on-epicentre-of-global-terrorism-says-jaishankar-on-anniversary-of-mumbai-terror-attacks/story-Ld4JcjbbNfUmwYlsepWeoL.html

He also announced to severe his alliance with the BJP on the pretext that the saffron party despite winning three consecutive Lok Sabha polls from Darjeeling did not fulfil its promises to find a permanent political solution and granting of schedule tribe status to the 11 Gorkha sub-communities that have left out of the classification. Though his supporters have been claiming that Gurung would soon return to his home in Darjeeling hills, it is unlikely that he would do so unless he gets legal remedy or the state government withdraws the cases against him. Among hundreds of charges he faces are those under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Bishal Chhetri, vice president of the party’s central committee on Wednesday said, “Gurung would soon return from Kolkata and would address a rally in Siliguri. Bagajatin Park in Siliguri will witness the presence of thousands of people from Darjeeling hills, Terai and Dooars to welcome Gurung.” Chhetri did not say the date of Gurung’s return. Though Chettri said that Gurung would certainly return to the hills, opposition parties claim that it is easier said than done. There is also speculations that Gurung may not immediately return to the hills where his bête noire Binoy Tamang and Anit Thapa are calling the shots. Tamang who heads the GJM (Binoy Tamang faction) and Thapa who is the chairman of the board of administrators in the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration had come to the help of the state chief minister Mamata Banerjee when she was in serious crisis in 2017 during the 104-day-long general strike in the hills demanding separate state of Gorkhaland. It was largely due to Tamang and Thapa that the Gorkhaland movement derailed as Banerjee heaved a sigh of relief while Gurung and his supporters facing multiple charges had to flee the hills for years. “Though Tamang and Thapa failed to deliver results in the 2019 Lok Sabha election and 2019 assembly bye poll in Darjeeling despite all the backing of the state government, the Chief Minister would not disown them immediately,” said a leader of the GJM (Tamang faction) who did not wish to be named. “Though Gurung still has a strong support base in the hills, his entry in the hills is all set to invite unrest and Banerjee would obviously not want this to happen,” the leader said. Talking to Hindustan Times, Anit Thapa said, “Gurung is going to become another Subash Ghisingh and his political career is soon coming to an end.” Ghisingh the Gorkha National Liberation Front president and former chairman of Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council was hounded out of Darjeeling by the GJM on July 26 2008. Since then Ghisingh was living in Jalpaiguri and Siliguri in the plains with his occasional entry to the hills. Ghisingh the man who first started the Gorkhaland movement in the eighties and ruled the hills absolutely for almost 20 years unsuccessfully tried for his political comeback in the hills till he died in Delhi in January 2010. Thapa said, “Gurung had political value till the time he seemed uncompromising with the issue of Gorkhaland. Minus Gorkhaland, he is nothing.” However Gurung’s party is rapidly expanding its local units all across the hills and his supporters are hopeful that he would soon return to the hills and call the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bimal-gurung-to-address-supporters-in-siliguri-but-darjeeling-visit-uncertain/story-rbXrxcmjlq55tWcmnxXz4N.html

In a letter to chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department and field director of Rajaji Tiger Reserve, Vaibhav C Mathur, assistant inspector general of forests, NTCA, has sought “factual status in the matter at the earliest”. On Tuesday, Delhi-based NGO, Centre for Wildlife and Environmental Litigation (CWEL) Foundation, had written to the NTCA about the missing tigress. Bhanu Bansal, founder of CWEL Foundation said, “Not being able to keep track of the national animal in such a manner clearly shows the red tape attitude of Rajaji administration. It is the duty of the officials to protect and conserve the wildlife in their jurisdiction. We have sought urgent intervention by NTCA in this regard and hope that the forest department will be able to find the missing tigress.” On Monday, Uttarakhand forest department started a search operation to find the tigress and deployed four teams on elephants to search for her. The tigress, between 18 and 20 years of age, went missing from the western part of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve and has not been sighted or camera-trapped in almost two months. Officials from Rajaji Tiger Reserve on Wednesday said they had found signs of the tigress in one of the ranges and were working to confirm if it was the same animal. Rajaji Tiger Reserve director DK Singh said, “We found a long trail of pug marks in the Kansaro range of the reserve on Wednesday. The size of the pug marks matches with the dimensions of the tigress’ paws from earlier records. To confirm her presence, we are installing camera traps in the whole area and we should be able to get an image within a few days.” Rajaji Tiger Reserve has only two tigresses in the western part and five tigers from Corbett are to be translocated to increase the population soon. The area from where the tigress has gone missing is important because of the translocation process, raising questions on security aspects. State-based wildlife activist AG Ansari said, “We have been hearing for years about the translocation process, but first, the resident tigers need to be protected in Rajaji. When the first translocation process happened in Sariska Tiger Reserve, the tigers were poached; we do not want a similar situation to be repeated here.” During the last tiger estimation, it was found that the reserve had 34 resident tigers, including 32 in its eastern part, which is spread across a 150 sq km area and two in the western part, which covers 570 sq km. The eastern and the western part of the reserve are divided by a busy traffic corridor, making it difficult for the tigers to migrate between the two parts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tigress-missing-from-rajaji-reserve-ntca-seeks-report-from-uttarakhand-government/story-5SrlTAc8y8QFR2YVUoS5GP.html

The revelation came on Tuesday evening after a branch of the Red Cross Society in Bettiah approached the family members of Ramdev Mahato, incarcerated in Champai Nawabganj jail in Bangladesh, with his message forwarded by Bangladesh Red Crescent Society.“Hope all you be alright. I am lodged in a jail at Bangladesh and needed certain documents for my release from here,” reads the message form, RFL/9013/27/RCM/Jail, dated October 28, 2020, a copy of which is with HT. Back in his native village, emotions ran high among family members as news came about Ramdev’s whereabouts. “We were just hoping against hope and were under immense pressure from the local villagers to perform his last rites. But we chose to avoid it in the hope of a miracle,” said Sunil Mahato (30), Ramdev Mahato’s son. Ramdev Mahato left his Gudara village in Majhauliya panchayat for Deoghar on July 30, 2017 to offer holy water to Lord Shiva during the Hindu month of Shravan. “He was traceless since then. But I believed that he would return sooner or later,” said Ghogha Devi, Ramdev’s wife, adding it was this belief that she had not stopped applying vermillion. Dr Jagmohan Kumar, secretary of Red Cross Society, said Ramdev, lodged in jail in Bangladesh from November 30, 2018, was found out by Red Cross Family news service, a network that works across international borders with an aim to restore and re-establish contacts between separated family members and reuniting them. “It requires some documents such ration card, Aadhar card, voter card, Ramdev’s single and family photograph to initiate the process for his release,” said Dr. Jagmohan, adding the family members are likely to submit the same by Thursday. It is not yet known why and how he crossed the border and ended up in a Bangladeshi jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-villager-believed-dead-found-in-bangladeshi-jail-after-3-years/story-HpdoEnddWjILAducHcnvuK.html

Also Read: Ban on firecrackers an example of judicial overreach, says NaiduWith political parties and activists increasingly knocking the court’s doors to challenge public policies and legislation, the relationship between the legislature and the judiciary has taken a new turn. While elected representatives often grudge the judiciary’s overreach, the courts have in the past pulled up administrators or governments for not doing their bit. On Wednesday, at the inauguration, vice-president Venkaiah Naidu said the recent ban on firecrackers and the vehicle cess levied in Delhi had sparked a debate over judicial overreach and how “occasionally, concerns have been raised as to whether they (judiciary) were entering the domains of the legislative and the executive wings” . This is the first time that the presiding officer of either House of Parliament has commented on this issue. Naidu is the presiding officer of the Rajya Sabha.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said “differences in institutions have emerged in the journey of democracy” and underlined that all three organs have “sufficient powers” to work. He emphasised “coordination” between the three wings and said all of them have a job to protect the public interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constitution-day-pm-narendra-modi-to-address-80th-conference-of-presiding-officers-today/story-bD5ABSR5IdOR9rcDB5AKaP.html

The maulana, a prominent Islamic scholar, reformer, educationist and vice-president of All India Muslim Personal Law Board died Tuesday night at the age of 83 at the Era Medical College.Soon after his death, tributes began pouring in from all over the world. Many political personalities took to Twitter handle to condole his death, calling it a loss to the entire mankind. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, ‘The passing away of Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, who was deputy chairman of All India Muslim Personal Law Board. is very saddening. He made remarkable efforts for social harmony and brotherhood. My condolences to his family and loved ones.’ Defence minister Rajnath Singh said in a tweet, ‘The passing away of Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, a prominent Shia religious leader, is very sad. He was the vice president of All India Muslim Personal Law Board and always stressed on strengthening brotherhood in society. He was a noble and great personality. I express my condolences to his family and loved ones.’ Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and others also expressed grief over the cleric’s demise, calling him ‘the most secular person’. AIMPLB said Sadiq’s loss was a big tragedy. “With his demise, the country has lost a great personality and the board has lost one of its main and true servants. His educational and social services will always be remembered,” the board said in a statement on Wednesday. Maulana Kalbe Sadiq’s last journey began at around 11:30 am from Unity College in Hussainabad (Old City), where a massive crowd joined the funeral procession. “Maulana Sadiq was one person who was never associated with any religion or sect. In fact, he used to be among the common invitees, be it in a Muslim or non Muslim gathering,” said Dinesh Mishra, a trader from Nazirabad who came to pay floral tributes to the maulana.

26-11-2020||India||ICAR stubble burning solution shows promising results at trials in Delhi, Punjab||A proprietary microbial solution developed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) could be a breakthrough in the hunt for a solution to crop-residue burning, a major cause of winter pollution in north India, results from trials in Delhi and Punjab show. “The ICAR’s invention, named Pusa, decomposes crop residue, including paddy straw, and turns it into manure in about 25 days, thus eliminating the need to burn paddy stubble. It could be a breakthrough if adopted with an integrated approach,” YV Singh, principal scientist of microbiology at Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), an affiliate institution of the ICAR which developed the solution, told HT. Singh said the technology had an efficacy range of 70%-80%, citing results from its use in 24 villages in Delhi this October. This means it can successfully decompose up to 80% of the straw in a given area. The Delhi government adopted the technology from IARI to prevent burning of paddy stubble in about 700 hectares of rice fields, a project that cost Rs20 lakh. The institute has applied for a patent for the technology and is in the process of signing contracts with private firms to commercially market the product, Singh said. Also read | Delhi govt asks Centre to use bio decomposer in Punjab, HaryanaAssuming farmers in Punjab burn paddy straw in at least two million hectares, it will cost the state Rs571 crore to fund the use of Pusa decomposer to eliminate stubble burning, HT’s calculation based on the Delhi government’s costs show. Farmers across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh typically harvest paddy in October and then set their fields on fire to clear rice stalks for the next crop. It is the fastest and cheapest way to clear the fields of unwanted stalks. The burning of more than seven million hectares of crop residues has emerged as one of the biggest sources of winter pollution, resulting in weeks-long smog in New Delhi every October and November. Burning paddy straw has emerged as a big problem in the past two to three decades as farmers have shifted to mechanised combine harvesters, which cut the grainy part of a rice plant, leaving the stalk intact. While the straw from basmati rice, which is mostly exported, is soft enough to be used as fodder, the residue of other rice varieties, which account for most paddy acreage, is too stiff to be of any use. Farmers say they have few effective, affordable alternatives to burning. Pusa decomposer comes in the form of capsules that contain an activated package of eight strains of fungi, Singh said. To prepare a solution of 25 litres, farmers need to add four capsules of the decomposer, along with jaggery and checkpea flour, to water. Within a week, a good layer of fungi admixture is formed. To decompose paddy stubble in one hectare, farmers need to spray 25 litres of this solution. According to A. Amarender Reddy, the principal scientist at the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, microbial agents in the solution act on the straw to make it soft, break down its components and release nutrients into the soil. The IARI is trying to popularise its solution in Punjab and Haryana, where farmers have used it in about 12000 hectares, which is just a fraction of the total rice acreage. “Some form of subsidy may be needed to popularise its use,” said Singh said. The farm ministry already runs a programme called “Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the State of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh & NCT of Delhi” with funds worth Rs1,151 crore from 2018-19 to 2019-20 to subsidise machinery needed for management of crop residue. According to data from the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, the state witnessed 40,000 incidents of farm fires on November 5. Five years ago, the National Green Tribunal, an environmental court, banned stubble burning. Punjab authorities fine farmers if they defy the ban but such coercive methods have proved to be of little help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icar-stubble-burning-solution-shows-promising-results-at-trials-in-delhi-punjab/story-z7x93mr1MJilU7CYChL1FJ.html

Other than the BJP-supported Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) all trade unions are supporting the strike.Since the Kerala government also supported the strike it turned a forced shutdown in many parts of the state. All government offices remain closed, government vehicles were off the road and business establishments remained shut.Many industry and trade bodies like Confederation of Indian Industry Kerala chapter and tour organisations had requested the trade unions to avoid forced shutdown but it fell on deaf ears. Many shop owners and others openly expressed their resentment saying work disruption and closure was uncalled for the wake of the dire economic condition brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.The seven-point demand of 10 trade union and their feeder organisations include direct income support to workers, free ration, guaranteed employment days, scrapping of latest farm and labour laws. Except for stray incidents of stone-throwing the strike remained peaceful in the state till 10 am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trade-union-strike-cripples-normal-life-in-kerala/story-TNuBY5u3zjMBvZ6uFKaV9J.html

Trial runs started this Monday and the DHR is just waiting for West Bengal government’s nod. “We are ready to resume the services. We are waiting for the state government’s permission. Initially, joy rides between Darjeeling and Ghoom and back (total distance of 16 km) would be resumed. We have already written to the state government,” said DHR director AK Mishra. The DHR is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a major tourist attraction in Darjeeling which is a popular hill destination in north Bengal and is often referred to as the Queen of the Hills. The train has appeared in various Bollywood films, including Rajesh Khanna and Sharmila Tagore-starrer Aradhana, Shah Rukh Khan’s Main Hoon Na, and Parineeta. More than 1.5 million tourists come to Darjeeling in north Bengal and Sikkim, a tiny Himalayan state, every year. The Toy Train, comprising three compartments, gets around 60,000 passengers every year. Around 15% of the population in Darjeeling hills is dependent on tourism for their livelihood. “We have 13 steam engines and five diesel locomotives. The steam engines are the real attractions and are regularly chartered by foreign tourists. The DHR also runs other services between Siliguri and Darjeeling, Siliguri and Tindharia, and Kurseong and Siliguri and those would be resumed later,” said an official. While long distance train services to New Jalpaiguri station, the nearest railway station to Darjeeling, have already resumed and tourists are flocking to the hill destination, locals said that the resumption of DHR would add to the attraction. “The DHR has a special role to promote tourism in Darjeeling and is the safest and convenient mode of transportation, especially in the Covid-period. The tourist industry would get required impetus both in Sikkim and Darjeeling once the DHR services resume,” said Sandipan Ghosh, secretary of Eastern Himalaya Travel and Tour Operators Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darjeeling-himalayan-railway-awaits-state-government-s-nod-to-resume-services/story-jPXlX5wWs3tdAYgpODMGOI.html
26-11-2020||India||Haryana ‘love jihad’ panel will study what other states did, says Anil Vij||The Haryana government has set up a three-member drafting committee which will frame laws on ‘love jihad’, home minister Anil Vij said on Thursday. The committee will also study the laws brought in by other states.The committee comprises home secretary T L Satyaprakash (IAS), ADGP Navdeep Singh Virk (IPS) and Deepak Manchanda Additional Advocate General, Haryana.  A three member Drafting Committee formed to frame law on Love Jihad in Haryana comprising T L Satyaprakash IAS Secretary Home, Navdeep Sing Virk IPS ADGP and Deepak Manchanda Additional Advocate General Haryana Committee will study the Love Jihad law formed in other states also.Vij had on November 6 told the state assembly that the state government was deliberating on enacting a law to check forced religious conversions. Earlier in June, Chief Minister, ML Khattar had said that the state government has decided that a Right to Freedom of Religion Bill will be passed to stop forced conversions. During an interview with HT in July, the chief minister had said that there were complaints regarding forced conversions and marriages from many districts. “People are free to adopt any religion in an informed manner but using coercion, allurement to force religious conversions is a matter of concern. Such incidents vitiate the atmosphere of society. We are studying similar laws enacted by other states and will accordingly take a call,’’ Khattar had said. On Tuesday, the Uttar Pradesh cabinet approved a draft ordinance which prescribes up to 10 years of imprisonment for those who are found guilty of religious conversion by marriage, coercion, deceit or enticement. Those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to the district magistrate, according to the draft ordinance which would become law after its promulgation by the state Governor.The term ‘love jihad’ has not been mentioned. Last week, Madhya Pradesh announced that it will bring in the next session of the assembly a bill to check incidents of “love jihad”.The new proposed law mentioned that conversion for marriage by force, fraud, lure or instigation would be punishable by a maximum jail term of five years. If such forced conversion is proved, then the marriage concerned shall be declared null and void and anyone who assisted or was a part of the conversion exercise shall be treated at par with the main accused, the proposed bill added.Karnataka and Bihar are also mulling similar laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-love-jihad-panel-will-study-what-other-states-did-says-anil-vij/story-NleApiLormjdKk1K4PlzoJ.html

26-11-2020||India||Ahmed Patel, Congress’ crisis manager: Five instances of how he was a problem solver||Rajya Sabha MP Ahmed Patel, who died of Covid-19 on Wednesday morning, has often been described as Congress’ crisis manager. Here are five instances of how Patel solved problems for his partyCurbing the rebellion of the G-23, 2020This was perhaps the most recent instance of Patel’s crisis management. When several of his Rajya Sabha colleagues Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, and Kapil Sibal wrote a scathing letter asking for internal elections in the party and for introspection, it was Patel who carefully dissipated the tension and rebellion within the party. Patel’s USP from the time he became parliamentary secretary to Rajiv Gandhi has been unflinching loyalty to the family. The letter was seen as a clear attack on the family and on Team Rahul Gandhi for the way the 2019 election campaign was carried out and for Rahul Gandhi’s refusal to take charge of the party. Patel’s strategy was clear—he set into motion a strategy of reaching out to individuals while alienating the hardline dissenters. Patel personally went and met Sibal and spoke to Azad. He also convinced the party’s chief ministers Ashok Gehlot and Bhupesh Baghel to give public statements in support of the Gandhi family. Within a day or two, some letter writers like Jitin Prasada and Akhilesh Prasad gave public statements saying all their concerns had been addressed. Also, Patel and his colleagues carefully orchestrated a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on August 24, just two days after the dissent letter became public. In what was seen as a well-choreographed move, leader after leader praised Sonia Gandhi’s leadership and requested her to stay on as Congress president till a new person was elected within six months. Azad was attacked by most other members of the CWC and with announcements about a timeline for elections, the immediate crisis was averted. The ones who weren’t placated—Azad, Sibal and Manish Tiwari—have started discussions once against post the Bihar election embarrassment.Also Read: Ahmed Patel: A low-profile troubleshooter and a high-power strategistThe Sachin Pilot rebellion, 2020This was the month-long rebellion that preceded the G-23. On July 12, the deputy chief minister of Rajasthan and member of Rahul Gandhi’s inner team, Sachin Pilot, took 18 MLAs and went AWOL from Jaipur. He refused to come back before he was made chief minister instead of Ashok Gehlot. While Pilot spoke to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the person the family trusted to iron things out and the one who worked out the compromise formula was Patel. While Patel was part of the old guard, many of the younger leaders found him accessible and willing to hear them out. Pilot’s aides also say that when Patel (who was known to be close to Gehlot) set up the committee and promised to have his grievances sorted, they knew that his word would be adhered to. A month later, not only was Pilot back in the Jaipur assembly, but without upsetting chief minister Gehlot, a tough balancing act.Impossible alliances: Maharashtra, 2019In 2019, when the Maharashtra government formation was uncertain, Patel spent 10 days in Mumbai. According to his aides, he had handled many big elections but never before had he operated from somewhere other than his Wellington Crescent bungalow in the capital. While Sonia Gandhi was reportedly reluctant to join hands with a party that had a Hindutva ideology, Patel heard out their newly elected legislators and understood that the mood in Mumbai was to strike against a BJP government. That’s why party leaders credit Patel as one of the key architects of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition. There were several hiccups like getting all the letters of support, but Patel refused to move from Mumbai till Uddhav Thackeray and the MVA government was sworn in.Also Read: The centrality of Ahmed Patel in Indian politicsManmohan Singh trust vote, 2008The Indo-US nuclear deal was a key moment for Dr Manmohan Singh who was determined to go ahead with it even if his government was threatened. The threat posed by his Left allies, led by Prakash Karat with 59 members of Parliament, was real. It left the United Progressive Alliance short of numbers and that’s when Patel’s relationships with other parties came in. Patel reached out to Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh. The party had 39 MPs and would make up for the vacuum created by the left. The two roped in several key leaders—most importantly, former President APJ Abdul Kalam who convinced Mulayam Singh Yadav (with a lesson in the benefits of nuclear power) to vote with the Manmohan Singh government. The result was that the SP’s vote ensured a comfortable 275 vote for the UPA government. Patel told HT that it was one of the key moments that he worked closely with Pranab Mukherjee to deliver the trust win.Delivering for Sonia GandhiBut perhaps more than batting for the Congress party, Ahmed Patel will be known for his loyalty to Sonia Gandhi. It was his appointment as her political secretary that made him really come into his own. She trusted his self-effacing, away from the limelight manner, and he ensured that her aura remained spotless. One of the key instances is the way he rallied support for Sonia Gandhi soon after she became party president in 1998. It wasn’t just the Bharatiya Janata Party that led the attack on a foreign-origin leader but that was when Sharad Pawar also left with Tariq Anwar and Purno Sangma, raising the slogan against her foreign origin. At that time, it was Patel who used his good relationship with key alliance partner Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Lalu Yadav to issue a statement in her favour. In the midst of all the attacks, Yadav called her “Bharat ki bahu” (India’s daughter-in-law) which went a long way in showing a vote of confidence for the new and inexperienced Congress president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahmed-patel-congress-crisis-manager-five-instances-of-how-he-was-a-problem-solver/story-Pp5BboXOiFZxuhwokhUSKM.html
26-11-2020||India||Bihar to form block-level task force for Covid-19 vaccination drive||Bihar will form block-level task force and use its routine immunisation channel for administering the Covid-19 vaccine, once available, with the Centre committing to increase the state’s vaccine storage capacity by one crore vials, the government said. It will also engage doctors, dentists, medicos, paramedics, nurses and nursing students as alternate vaccinators for the purpose, said officials. “We have planned to make robust arrangements, akin to conducting elections, as the vaccine has to be administered to the people in the shortest possible period,” said Bihar’s chief secretary Deepak Kumar, who chaired the first meeting of the state’s steering committee on Covid vaccination Wednesday evening. This would mean the authorities would set up booths at block level for administering the vaccine, said officials privy to the meeting. At present, Bihar has a state-level task force and district-level units for undertaking health programmes under the National Health Mission. Doctors and healthcare workers will be vaccinated on a priority basis. The state is currently in the process of preparing a database of health personnel, both in government and private sector. “We will submit within a week to the Centre name of doctors and healthcare workers in the state, as they are the first in the eligible category for vaccination, as decided by the Centre,” said Kumar. The Centre will closely monitor the condition of every healthcare worker vaccinated through a mobile application, the chief secretary added. “Currently, we do not know when and which vaccine we will get, but we should not be found wanting in logistics for its distribution once the Centre makes them available to us,” Kumar said. Bihar is also increasing its vaccine storage capacity to account for the Covid-19 vaccine. “We will add around 1 crore vials to our existing vaccine storage capacity of 1.37 crore vials to account for the Covid vaccine. The Centre has committed to give us 900 ice-lined refrigerators and deep freezers, eight walk-in coolers and two walk-in freezers, which will begin to arrive from December 4,” said executive director of the State Health Society, Manoj Kumar, who is also the state nodal officer for Covid vaccination. Eight walk-in coolers will be distributed among the regional vaccine stores while the two walk-in freezers will be commissioned at Nalanda and Bhagalpur districts, he added. “We will also engage doctors, dentists, medicos, besides nurses, nursing students and paramedics to create a pool of alternate vaccinators so that the government’s routine immunisation and other health-related programme are not affected during the Covid-19 vaccination drive,” said the executive director. The health department generally engages auxiliary nursing midwives for its routine immunisation programme against 12 preventable diseases. Bihar has 674 cold chain points, 10 regional vaccine stores and one state vaccine store at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital in Patna for storing vaccines. The regional vaccine stores are in Patna, Bhagalpur, Purnia, Saharsa, Aurangabad, Nalanda, Muzaffarpur, Saran, Darbhanga and East Champaran districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-to-form-block-level-task-force-for-covid-19-vaccination-drive/story-Tzv8mVP1PAM8nGx9OlY2lK.html

Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said after Covid-19 cases started declining in mid-September, the state government had reduced the size of the containment zones. In an effort to check the possible second wave with the increase in cases, the government had now decided to increase the size of the containment zones, he said. Now 50 metres of an area in which a single Covdi-19 case has been detected would be declared as containment zone whereas in the area in which more than one or cluster of Covid cases were reported, a radius of 100 m would be marked as containment zone, he said. A state government officer said in view of the increase in Covid cases after the onset of winter, the Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday issued fresh guidelines to check the second wave of infection. Along with demarcating the containment zones, the state government had been directed to allow essential activities in containment zones. The district magistrates (DMs) would notify the containment zones on the websites and there would be no movement of people in or out of the zones except for medical emergencies. The supply of essential commodities would be maintained, intensive house-to-house surveillance would be carried out and testing and contact tracing would be done according to the protocol prescribed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, he said. The government has decided to launch intensive surveillance and sample testing drive in 15 districts in which maximum Covid cases are being reported since November 1. The 15 districts include Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Gorakhpur, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Bareilly, Moradabad, Aligarh, Jhansi, Agra, Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar.Intensive surveillance, sample testing and contact tracing drive will be launched in the area in which large positive cases are being reported. The DM and CMOs have been directed to carry out maximum RT-PCR tests in the localities in which large number of Covid cases are being reported. In the second phase, the mapping of the red zones would be launched in the remaining 60 districts, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad he said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed officers to increase the RT-PCR sample tests across the state, Prasad said. In view of the CM’s order, the health department has decided to carry out 60% Rapid Antigen and 40% RT-PCR tests. A health department officer said the state government was constantly strengthening the network of the laboratories in the districts. Recently the CM inaugurated eight new laboratories, increasing the strength to 42. With the increase in the laboratories, the state government could enhance the RT-PCR test, he said. On Wednesday a record 1.78 lakh samples were tested in the state. While 72,808 samples were tested with RT-PCR, 1.03 lakh sample were tested with rapid antigen and 2,308 samples were tested with TrueNat machines. A total of 1.84 crore samples have been tested in the state since the start of the Covid pandemic in March. The increase of the Covid cases among the old people has caused concern among the health department officers. Prasad said the infection rate among the old people had increased from 8% to 10.19%. Covid infection among old people lead to complications and they should be encouraged to stay at home, he said. On Wednesday, UP reported 2,318 fresh Covid-19 cases. There were 24,876 active cases in the state while 11,718 people were in home isolation, 2,378 were admitted in the private hospitals and remaining patients were admitted to government hospitals. With the death of 29 people in various districts on Wednesday, the Covid-19 death toll in the state rose to 7,644.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-adopts-fresh-strategy-to-check-possible-second-wave-of-covid-19/story-5I2nYa1SVwFFVLrYdPhtrO.html

In the past, it was also true for the governance of our country. We have tried to change this after coming to power,” he said.“The rail coach factory in Rae Bareli is an example of how we can change things by changing our outlook. The factory was set up many years ago and had all the machinery to make train coaches, yet only denting-painting (maintenance) was done there. Tall promises were made for the factory, but nothing changed. When we came to power in 2014, we looked into the affairs and, within six months, the factory started making rail coaches. It is now one of the biggest coach manufacturers in the country,” he said.The PM also cited urea production in the country to underline his point.“I was surprised to know that despite having sufficient urea plants, the country was importing urea only because our plants were not working to their full potential. The previous governments had not done much to change this. When we came to power, we made changes, and now the country has become self-reliant in urea,” he said.Will power and good intentions were equally important as capabilities, he said.He also spoke about his experience of popularising khadi with the help of students in Gujarat through a fashion show at Porbandar on Gandhi Jayanti in 2002.This made khadi “fashionable”, he said, adding that the quantity of khadi sold in the last six years was more than that sold in 20 years before 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rae-bareli-rail-coach-factory-was-underutilised-before-2014-pm-modi/story-Hvm3uB9WydCFde90Wgkv6H.html

With the virus claiming more than 1.4 million lives worldwide, as per the worldometers tally, the need for a vaccine is only being felt increasingly.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageEven as countries like India, as well as the United States, prepare a vaccine distribution plan, for once a candidate is finally approved by health regulators, here are the latest updates on the coronavirus vaccine front:1. Bharat Biotech International Limited’s vaccine candidate has reached Gujarat for phase 3 trials. Ahmedabad’s Sola civil hospital is among 130 centres across the country selected for COVAXIN phase three trials, HG Koshia, commissioner, Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA) said. Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, which has developed COVAXIN in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), last week announced the commencement of the third phase trials, the first candidate in India to reach this stage. 2. UK-headquartered AstraZeneca, which is working on a vaccine candidate with Oxford University, in a statement on Wednesday acknowledged an “error” that is bound to raise questions on the preliminary results of its candidate. In a late-phase analysis, participants received a full dose of the candidate, AZD1222; the efficacy was found to be 62%.

26-11-2020||India||Bharat Bandh today: Transport, banking services partially affected||With crores of workers supporting the nationwide strike jointly called by 10 central unions protesting against various policies of the government, several services across the country were hit on Thursday. In West Bengal, Left parties and Congress blocked railway tracks in Jadavpur. Markets were closed and bus services were disrupted in Kochi. The Uttar Pradesh government, meanwhile, has extended the Essential Services Maintenance Act, banning strikes in all departments and corporations under it for a period of another six months. Here’s all you need to know:Who are participating in the strike?The ten central unions include Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS), Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), All India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC), Trade Union Co-ordination Centre (TUCC), Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), Labour Progressive Federation (LPF) and United Trade Union Congress (UTUC).Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) will not participate in the strike.What are the demands?Cash transfer of Rs 7,500 per month tor all non-income tax paying families and 10 kilograms free ration per person per month to all needy people.Expansion of MGNREGA, the rural employment guarantee scheme, to provide 200 days’ work in a year in rural areas at enhanced wages and also extension of the employment guarantee to urban areas.Withdrawal of all “anti-farmer laws and anti-worker labour codes. The demands also include stopping privatisation of public sector.Pension to all, scrapping National Pension System and the restoration of the earlier pension system are also some of the demands.Which services will be affected?A number of services, including industries, banking, transport, are likely to be affected as the trade unions taking part in one-day strike encompasses a large number of sectors. Farmers, Scheme workers, domestic workers, construction workers, beedi workers, hawkers, vendors, agricultural workers, self-employed in rural and urban areas, auto and taxi drivers, railway, defence employees are also supposed to participate.Will bank services be hit?Yes as All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers Association (AIBOA) and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) are participating in the strike. Many lenders, including IDBI Bank and Bank of Maharashtra, in regulatory filings on Wednesday said their normal working could be affected at the branches and offices.The “Lok Sabha in its recently held session has passed three new labour enactments by dismantling existing 27 enactments in the name of ‘Ease of Business’, which are purely in the interest of corporates. In the process, 75 per cent of workers are being pushed out of the orbits of labour laws since they will have no legal protection under the new enactment,” the AIBEA said in a release.The association represents the majority of the banks, except State Bank of India (SBI) and Indian Overseas Bank. It has four lakh bank employees from various public and old private sectors and a few foreign banks as its members.“If strike materialises, the normal functioning of the bank branches and offices is likely to be affected.

26-11-2020||India||Israelis pay respects to victims of 26/11 Mumbai attacks, condemn ‘Pakistan-sponsored terrorism’||Israelis are holding ceremonies to pay respects to the victims of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, demanding that the perpetrators of the carnage be brought to justice and condemning “Pakistan-sponsored terrorism”.Israelis, and Indian students and caregivers paid respects to the victims in Jerusalem, Rehovot and Tel Aviv on Wednesday and ceremonies are planned in Beersheva and Eilat on Thursday.A virtual ceremony on Zoom is also planned for Thursday at 8 PM Israel time (11:30 PM IST). Hundreds have registered to take part in the event.“Israel opposes every country that provides financial and logistical support to terrorists. Peaceful countries should come together to boycott diplomatically and financially those countries that support terrorism. This will help deter acts of terror,” Isaac Solomon from the southern Israeli coastal city of Eilat told PTI.“It is a matter of pride for us Israelis to have a peaceful country like India as our friend. We pray that our friendship continues to grow strong,” the octogenarian said.Ten terrorists of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) carried out 12 coordinated shooting and bombing attacks lasting four days across Mumbai. At least 166 people, including six Jews at the Chabad House and nine terrorists, were killed and over 300 others were injured in the attacks which began on November 26, 2008.Israelis in Eilat have requested that a memorial square be built for the victims of the Mumbai attacks.“We have spoken to the Mayor of Eilat, Meir Itzhak Ha Levi, to set up a Memorial for the victims of Mumbai attacks. The Mayor said that he is on the committee which decides about street and square issues. He will be very happy to help,” representatives of the Sitar Organisation for Immigrant Jews in Eilat told PTI.“In addition, he suggested to even set up an India-Israel friendship square or Mahatma Gandhi Square where a memorial stone for the victims of Mumbai attacks could also be placed,” they said.The Chabad Movement’s Synagogue in the city will put up a plaque on Thursday in the memory of six Jewish victims.The Telangana Association of Israel organised an interfaith ceremony to pay respects to the victims of 26/11. A Jewish Rabbi, a Hindu priest, a Christian pastor and a Sikh priest recited prayers in the memory of those who were killed in the attacks and for peace.“We believe in peace but shouldn’t bow down to terror. Our policy of zero tolerance under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a welcome change,” association president Ravi Soma told PTI.Some 20 people from Telangana working in Israel gathered in Ramat Gan, next to Tel Aviv, as per permission granted to them in view of the coronavirus pandemic.They carried posters and lit candles to pay respects to the victims of “the most heinous act of terror on Indian soil”.Students at the prestigious Weizmann Institute in Rehovot also lit candles and held a silent protest to condemn “Pakistan-sponsored terror”.“We have to learn from the Israelis and pre-empt attempts by Pakistan-sponsored terror outfits. We have to take the fight to their soil,” said an agitated doctoral fellow, Vivek Singh.Students at Ben-Gurion University in Beer Sheva and local Israelis will be organising ceremonies on Thursday evening to mark the 12th anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks.Naor Gudker of Beersheva said, “26/11 for me is the ‘day of terror’ like 9/11. It’s sponsor was Pakistan which targeted both India and Israel. It is not about religion but we would like the world to recognise the true face of Pakistan.” “Time has come for real peace in the world and the international community should come down heavily on such countries and organisations,” Beersheva said.People participating in such gatherings held posters of victims, pictures of mayhem in Mumbai and flags of India and Israel.“Terrorists from Pakistan, who perpetrated these horrific attacks hoped that by striking the places where our countries and people come together, they would succeed in driving us apart.“But they failed miserably in their attempts as this actually brought the people and governments of India and Israel closer than ever before,” said Anitha Nandhini, deputy chief of mission at the Indian embassy.“India and Israel are now strategic partners cooperating in several spheres, including against terrorism. Both countries are in agreement that there can be no justification for acts of terror on any grounds whatsoever.“We thank Israel for standing with India in our endeavour of defeating this scourge,” she said.The Indian Heritage Jewish Centre headed by Avner Isaac will organise a Zoom meeting at 8 PM on Thursday. Indian Ambassador in Israel Sanjeev Singla and Israeli Ambassador in India Dr. Ron Malka will take part in the virtual event.The 12th anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks, as per the Jewish calendar, fell on Tuesday last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israelis-pay-respects-to-victims-of-26-11-mumbai-attacks-condemn-pakistan-sponsored-terrorism/story-ljnWMohapaJJsXMyr4MzwN.html
26-11-2020||India||Amaravati land scam: SC makes FIR open for media to report||Two months after the Andhra Pradesh government headed by Jagan Mohan Reddy alleged corruption in the allotment of land in Amaravati, and accused the state’s former Advocate General of facilitating the purchase of land at throwaway prices by his relatives and acquaintances, including relatives of senior Supreme Court judge NV Ramana, the Supreme Court on Wednesday lifted a media gag on reporting the FIR. The gag order was passed by the Andhra Pradesh high court on September 15, hours after the state’s Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) registered a first information report against former Advocate General (AG) Dammalapati Srinivas and 12 others. By the same order, the HC also stayed further investigation into the scam and ordered that no coercive action be taken against Srinivas.Although an appeal against this order was filed in Supreme Court by the state on September 21, the matter was heard for the first time on Wednesday by a bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah.The court issued notice to Srinivas and sought his response in three weeks. While posting the matter for hearing in the last week of January 2021, the bench said, “In the meantime, directions issued in the impugned order dated September 15, 2020 to the extent of following -- news in regard to registration of FIR or in the context of the said FIR shall not be made public in any electronic, print or social media – shall remain stayed.” The apex court did not remove the stay on the investigation and coercive action.This isn’t the only controversy involving Reddy and justice Ramana. In a letter to CJI SA Bobde on October 6, Reddy alleged that many judges of the Andhra Pradesh high court were biased against the state government and that justice Ramana was influencing the HC roster and getting cases against the state government listed before such judges.On October 10, Jagan’s principal advisor, Ajeya Kallam, disclosed the contents of the letter to the media at a press conference. Two petitions in the Supreme Court against Reddy were filed after that press conference for targeting justice Ramana. The Supreme Court , on November 16, adjourned a hearing on the two petitions. On Wednesday, the bench allowed the high court to continue hearing the pending petition filed by Srinivas in which the interim order of September 15 was passed but said: “The High Court is requested not to finally decide the writ petition.”According to the FIR, details of which can be reported now, between June and December 2014, speculation was rife about Amravati being the prospective new capital of the new state. Srinivas was Additional Advocate General from June 2014 to May 2016 and Advocate General from May 2016 to May 2019. The state’s claim is that Srinivas was privy to information about the exact location of future capital, and with an intention to make pecuniary gain, his brother-in-law acquired around 16 plots near Amaravati. Some of these plots were sold to Srinivas, his wife, and father-in-law at the same rates at which it was purchased from land owners. Certain plots were similarly sold to other individuals named in the FIR, including close relatives of Justice Ramana, the second senior-most judge in the Supreme Court.HT contacted the office of justice Ramana but he was not available for comment.On Wednesday, the state represented by senior advocate Rajiv Dhavan pointed out that in a writ petition, the HC passed orders staying arrest and further investigation as if it were dealing with an anticipatory bail plea. “Is there something extraordinary in this petition that the High Court passed such an order? ” Dhavan asked.Dhavan pointed out that the action in this case was not a “knee-jerk reaction” as it began on March 23, 2020 when the state wrote to Union government seeking probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into alleged irregularities in allotment of land at Amaravati. This was based on findings of a Cabinet subcommittee in December 2019. A special investigation team was constituted in February 2020 which too got stayed by the high court. On September 5, a fresh complaint raising the same allegation was filed that was marked to ACB. A preliminary enquiry led to lodging of FIR on September 15.Srinivas, who had filed a caveat, was represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi who alleged political malafide against the state. Salve pointed out that the former Advocate General was only “a part in an entire piece” as there are others too named in this FIR. Salve suggested that the matter be sent back to the high court as the state violated the HC order by going public with the allegations of the FIR despite a gag order. “The state has no faith in the high court,” Salve said.Rohatgi mentioned that the chief minister faces dozens of criminal cases, and Srinivas was targeted as he appeared against him in several cases as the state’s law officer. Rohatgi claimed that it was “absurd to say that a law officer had prior knowledge of the exact location of capital” and told the court that he was forced to approach the high court as secret investigation was started against him by digging out information from the income tax department and registration of FIR in order to “defame and scandalise” his reputation.Dhavan said that being a law officer offers no immunity from prosecution and if an offence is made out, state should be allowed to investigate and unveil the truth. The bench said, “We are satisfied that the matter requires consideration.”Attorney General KK Venugopal on November 2 refused to grant consent for initiating contempt against Reddy and his adviser over the issue of their allegations against justice Ramana, partly because the matter was already before CJI Bobde (in the form of the CM’s letter). However, he held that the conduct of the two to be “contumacious” and called the timing of the letter “suspect”.Reddy’s allegations against justice Ramana in the letter came within a month of an order passed by the latter on September 16 in a public interest litigation dealing with fast-tracking of criminal trials against sitting and former legislators. There are several such cases against Reddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amaravati-land-scam-sc-makes-fir-open-for-media-to-report/story-LdmOhlJAkx2QPqMNqkDelO.html

Now the conversion for marriage by force, fraud, lure or instigation will be punishable by a maximum jail term of 10 years. Now, the accused will not get bail within 45 days of their arrest. This offence shall be cognizable and non-bailable.” The maximum punishment in the earlier version of the bill, which is due to be tabled in assembly in the upcoming winter session beginning on December 28, was five years. The decision to hike the punishment was taken at a meeting of home and law departments. The maximum punishment in the UP ordinance is also 10 years. “In the draft, the state government has also added a provision of five years jail term for religious gurus of different religions, who will perform the conversion ceremony. The state government will also cancel the registration of organisation, which will promote the forced mass conversion in the pretext of marriage,” said Mishra. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also said the BJP-led state government will not allow “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing activists to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women, but one that courts and the Union government refuse to recognise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-years-jail-for-inter-faith-marriage-in-mp-priests-to-be-penalized-says-new-draft/story-7aRCr6hpOA2J3wiwCv2V5L.html
26-11-2020||India||Pak rubs it in, lets Lashkar front sked prayer meeting for 10 terrorists||Twelve years after the 26/11 attacks, Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD), the political front of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) responsible for the brutal strikes, has planned an event in Sahiwal city in Punjab on Thursday to commemorate the Mumbai massacre by asking its cadres to organise special prayers for the 10 terrorists who carried out the terror attacks.According to intelligence reports, a special prayer meeting will be held in all LeT/JuD mosques to remember those who carried out the 2008 strikes targeting multiple locations in Mumbai that killed 170 people, according to security officials aware of the development. Nine LeT gunmen were killed by Indian security forces while one, Ajmal Kasab, was hanged to death after due process of law on November 21, 2012.Also Read | 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed awarded 10-year prison termTo add fuel to the fire, the JuD, at the behest of Pakistani deep state, has also floated the JK United Youth Movement (JKYM), a political forum to provide support to separatist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as Islamabad’s gambit to rally the international community against India has come to naught. According to intelligence inputs, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the chief operational commander and the head of the LeT’s jihad wing, visited Hafiz Saeed, the co-founder of the LeT and the JuD, at his residence at Lahore’s Johar Town in the last week of October. The meeting, officials said, was in connection with the collection of funds for jihad. Saeed, sanctioned by the UN Security Council with a $10 million bounty on his head, is held responsible by India for masterminding the Mumbai attacks. The officials added that another meeting of JuD functionaries and about 70 businessmen was held at Markaz Aqsa at Gujranwala city on November 13. At that meeting, the group asked for donations from the businessmen to carry on with its terrorist activities in Kashmir. Intelligence inputs suggested that similar meetings were also scheduled at other places in the Punjab province. The intelligence inputs suggested that there is a concerted effort by JuD/LeT to collect funds from the Pakistani soil to foment trouble in Kashmir, even though Islamabad denies harbouring terrorists. The officials said that a meeting of JuD cadres took place at Jamia Masjid Toheed in Lahore on February 26. The venue was adjacent to Saeed’s heavily guarded residence, and he attended the meeting along with other JuD functionaries. Saeed told those in attendance that they need not worry about the court cases against JuD leaders and the situation in Kashmir (in view of the nullification of Article 370) as these are “temporary issues”. On November 19, a Pakistani court gave Saeed and two close aides prison sentences totalling ten-and-a-half years in two cases of terror financing — a decision likely influenced by the pressure brought to bear on Islamabad by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These cases are not even remotely connected to the Mumbai attack case, according to the officials cited above. Since Saeed is already in jail serving two sentences of five-and-a-half-years given to him earlier this year, he will not serve any extra jail time. According to people familiar with developments, the sentencing of Saeed was largely due to pressure on Pakistan from western powers and the FATF to crack down on terror groups and terror financing, including prosecution of those funnelling funds to terrorists. The officials said though some LeT leaders have been declared as “arrested”, it is clear that they have only been taken in “protective-custody” and accommodated at their residences with complete freedom to operate and run the activities of the outfit, including fund raising. The officials added that the Pakistani government has refused to act on “irrefutable evidence” provided by India against the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and has maintained that there was not enough evidence against Saeed and others involved. According to Indian security officials, the perpetrators of the attack are: Saeed (Lahore), Lakhvi (Islamabad), Yusuf Muzammil (Islamabad), David Coleman Headley (under detention in the US), Tahawwur Hussain Rana (under detention in the US), Sajjid Majid (Lahore), Abdur Rehman Syed (Lahore), Major Iqbal (Lahore), Major Sameer Ali (Lahore), Illyas Kashmiri (deceased), Abu Qahafa, and Mazhar Iqbal (charge-sheeted by Pakistan in connection with the Mumbai attacks). The Pakistani government and its deep state have time and again displayed their unwillingness and inability to take on the LeT as well as other India-centric terrorist outfits operating from its soil, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lashkar-front-plans-prayer-meeting-in-pak-for-10-terrorists-who-carried-out-26-11/story-xNJGWUNbazvTla2BVTUw7M.html
26-11-2020||India||NDA’s Sinha defeats RJD’s Choudhary in tight race for Bihar speaker||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Vijay Kumar Sinha was on Wednesday elected speaker of the 17th Bihar assembly through a majority vote amid a furore caused by a viral audio tape in which Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad is purportedly trying to influence a BJP member to abstain from the vote. Sinha, the candidate of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), polled 126 votes and RJDs Awadh Bihari Chaudhary, who was fielded by the opposition Mahagathbandhan, or Grand Alliance, won 114 votes in the House of 243 members.Pro-tem speaker Jitan Ram Manjhi then urged chief minister Nitish Kumar and leader of the opposition Tejaswhi Prasd Yadav to escort Sinha to the speaker’s seat.The election was overshadowed by the furore over an audio tape of a telephone conversation in which Lalu Prasad, in a prison in Ranchi in connection with the embezzlement of funds meant for the purchase of cattle fodder, is purportedly trying to persuade a BJP legislator to abstain from the vote. Former Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi shared the one-and-a-half-minute-long clip on his official Twitter handle.“We will take good care of you. Just help us tomorrow in defeating the NDA’s candidate for the speaker’s post,” the voice purported to be Prasad’s can be heard saying in the audio.tape of the conversation with Lalan Kumar, who said he had accepted the call from the RJD chief when he was in a meeting with Sushil Modi and handed over the audio tape to him later.Bihar minister Mukesh Sahni, founder of the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), who broke his alliance with the RJD just ahead of the October-November elections and joined the NDA, said on the floor of the House: “Those who make calls to MLAs with the intent to topple a government have no right to speak of democratic norms.”RJD’s debutant MLA Mukesh Raushan said: “You will see a big shakeup in March. This government will fall and Tejashwi Yadav will become the chief minister. Legislators from all parties are in touch with us. Just wait and watch.”The speaker’s election didn’t lack drama either. As soon as the House assembled and the pro-term speaker initiated the election process, the opposition raised a ruckus, demanding a secret ballot that Manjhi rejected on grounds that there was no provision for a secret ballot on constitutional matters. Manjhi called for a voice vote on the motion for the speaker’s election and announced his verdict in favour of the NDA candidate, but with both the ruling dispensation, comprising mainly the BJP and the Janata Dal (United), and the opposition (RJD, Congress and the Left), closely matched, the difference couldn’t be made out clearly. When the opposition objected, Manjhi called for a division of votes. Opposition parties created another ruckus, questioning the presence of chief minister Kumar in the House; Kumar is a member of the Bihar legislative council, the upper house of the bicameral legislature. Opposition members trooped into the well of the House in protest.Manjhi said only the members of the House would participate in the vote, but the presence of the chief minister was in his capacity of leader of the legislature and there was nothing wrong with him being in the House . “I have been a member of the House for the last 40 years and there is nothing wrong with it,” he said.The opposition was unrelenting, Tejashvi Yadav said: “They stole the mandate in 2015 and have again done it. Now, it is happening before the chair. It is a mockery of democracy.” Opposition members sat in the well of the House in protest. Manjhi again read out the motion for election of Sinha as the speaker once again and asked those in favour to stand up to be counted. “If you have the numbers, go back to your seats and be counted. If you have the numbers, that will show,” he told the opposition, adjourning the House for five minutes after the count refused to satisfy the opposition. When the House reassembled, the pro-tem speaker again ordered those in favour of Sinha’s election to stand up and be counted. Constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap said that there was nothing wrong in the presence of the CM in the House and the ruling of the speaker was paramount. “Such things have happened in the past also, but this is the first time such a demand has been raised. The leader of the House can remain present in the House. It appears clearly a political move,” Kashyap said.

26-11-2020||India||Ahmed Patel: A low-profile troubleshooter and a high-power strategist||New Delhi Ahmed Patel, the go-to person for Congress leaders in times of crisis and known as the party’s Chanakya for his political acumen, died early on Wednesday at the age of 71 of post-Covid-19 complications. His death, announced in a tweet by his son Faisal, was mourned by parties cutting across ideological lines in a testament to the wide regard he commanded as a political tactician.“With profound grief and sorrow, I regret to announce the sad and untimely demise of my father, Mr. Ahmed Patel at 25/11/2020 at 3:30am. After testing positive for Covid-19 around a month back, his health worsened further due to multiple organ failure,” Faisal Patel tweeted. The veteran Congress politician, a five-time member of the Rajya Sabha and two-time Lok Sabha member, had been admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) at Gurugram-based Medanta Hospital on November 15. Patel had, on October 1, announced on Twitter that he had contracted the coronavirus disease and requested people who had recently come into contact with him to to self-isolate.The passing of Patel,who leaves behind his wife, son and a daughter, is a blow to the Congress and its president Sonia Gandhi, whom he served as political secretary for nearly 17 years. On Monday, former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, another Congress veteran who rose from the grassroots and steered the state towards peace after decades of insurgency, died, also of Covid-19 complications.Popularly known as Babu bhai, Ahmed bhai and AP in political circles, Patel had for decades been the chief crisis manager, the key trouble shooter and political strategist of the Congress, whose leaders were effusive in grieving his death.“I have lost an irreplaceable comrade, a faithful colleague and a friend. I mourn his passing and I feel deeply for his bereaved family to whom I offer my sincere feelings of empathy and support,” Sonia Gandhi said.Rahul Gandhi said Patel “lived and breathed Congress” and stood with the party through its most difficult times. “It is a sad day. Shri Ahmed Patel was a pillar of the Congress. He lived and breathed Congress and stood with the party through its most difficult times. He was a tremendous asset,” he said. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra described Patel as not only a wise and experienced colleague to whom she constantly turned for advice and counsel but also a friend “who stood by us all, steadfast, loyal, and dependable to the end”. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said: “Ahmed Patel ji was one of the most trusted leaders of the Congress Party and a great friend of mine. His passing away is an irreparable loss to the Congress Party.”As a mark of respect to the departed leader, the Congress flag will fly at half-mast for the next three days.President Ram Nath Kovind, vice president M Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined Congress leaders and politicians from other parties in mourning the death of Patel in a rare display of unity that cut across party and ideological lines. “An astute Parliamentarian, Shri Patel combined the skills of a strategist and the charm of a mass leader. His amiability won him friends across party lines. My condolences to his family and friends,” the President tweeted. Naidu called Patel an able parliamentarian who had always maintained cordial relations across the political spectrum. Modi tweeted: “Known for his sharp mind, his role in strengthening the Congress Party would always be remembered. Spoke to his son Faisal and expressed condolences. May Ahmed Bhai’s soul rest in peace.”In a tweet, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda wrote: “Deeply anguished to hear about the demise of veteran Congress leader Shri Ahmed Patel Ji. I pray for strength to the family members and his supporters at this hour of grief. Om Shanti.” Union ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari, Prakash Javadekar and Smriti Irani were joined by several state chief ministers, both those ruled by the Congress and other parties, and allies and rivals in paying tribute to Patel and offering their condolences to his family. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said Patel played a prominent role in the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress, a year ago “The Congress party has lost its Chanakya in Patel’s demise, while the MVA government has lost a guiding light. I got help from his experience and guidance when the MVA government was formed,” Thackeray said.It wasn’t only In forging an unlikely coalition government in Maharashtra that Patel’s negotiating skills were evident. The veteran also played a role in defusing a crisis caused by a letter written in August by 23 senior Congress leaders including his Rajya Sabha colleagues Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal calling for internal elections in the party and introspection. The letter was seen as an attack on the Gandhi family and team Rahul Gandhi for his refusal to take charge of the party. Patel helped thwart a potential rebellion, personally meeting Sibal and speaking to Azad. Patel and his colleagues carefully orchestrated a meeting of the Congress Working Committee on August 24, just two days after the letter became public, At the meeting, leader after leader praised Sonia Gandhi’s leadership and requested her to stay on as Congress chief until a new president is elected within six months. Azad was attacked by most other members of the CWC and with the announcement of a timeline for internal elections, an immediate crisis was averted.The July crisis in Rajasthan caused by a clash between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot blew over after Patel helped work out a compromise by setting up a committee to have the latter’s grievances against the CM addressed. Pilot, who had gone AWOL with 18 MLAs, was back in the assembly a week later.Patel also played a pivotal role in the Manmohan Singh government winning the 2008 trust vote over the Indo-US nuclear deal, enlisting the support of the Samajwadi Party to counter the threat posed by the loss of support of the Left parties, which bitterly opposed the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahmed-patel-a-low-profile-troubleshooter-and-a-high-power-strategist/story-N7tAoh0jnXgOWu7vebnR8H.html

26-11-2020||India||CVC warns officials over property returns||Taking a dim view of central government officials not filing their property details on time, the Central Vigilance Commission issued a warning to all departments that it will take disciplinary action if they don’t complete the exercise by November 30, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. “Timely filing of property return by officials of ministries/departments/organisations is one of the mandatory requirement under Conduct Rules. Property returns are also a good tool for CVOs (chief vigilance officers) to detect the source of funding of the assets of the officials and to find out whether these have been acquired through legal means,” CVC said in a note to all central government departments, chairman and managing directors of public sector banks and insurance companies. HT reviewed a copy of the note issued on Monday.“Non-filing of property returns constitutes good and sufficient reasons for instituting disciplinary action against the delinquent officials,” CVC added. Every year, CVC requires Group A, B and C officers across government departments to file details of their properties. The deadline for this is the last day of January (for details related to the previous year). This year, CVC found, while examining reports submitted by some of the CVOs, that in most organisations, many officials are yet to file their annual immovable or movable property details for the previous year i.e., 2019. The last date for filing this in mostorganisations is January 31. “Almost nine months have since lapsed and the organisations are yet to secure 100% compliance in this regard,” CVC said. The government has taken action against some officers who fail to file their property return, by holding their promotions or vigilance clearance as there’s no official data available on the number of defaulters. The ministry of home affairs has also sent a similar letter to all IPS officers across the country to file their immovable property return for 2020 by January 31 next year. In case the IPS officers failed to submit the details by then, concerned officer’s vigilance clearance will be denied, MHA said.

26-11-2020||India||BJP will suffer a political blow in 2021 says Mamata Banerjee||Hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party for “defeating other parties through manipulation”, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said that the party will suffer a political blow in 2021. Banerjee, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief, launched her party’s campaign for the state assembly elections, due early next year, from Bankura district on Wednesday.Addressing a rally at Sanukpahari in the district, she said, “The BJP is a curse for the country. It has to be stopped. It did not win the Bihar assembly elections. It defeated others through manipulation.”The BJP emerged as the second largest party with 74 seats in the recently concluded Bihar assembly polls.“I will take complete responsibility from now on. I was too involved in administrative duties and could not give so much time (to the party). That’s why I am starting with Bankura,” Banerjee said. “I promise you (BJP) will not win a single assembly seat in Bankura next year. Some people think that if by chance you come to power they may make a fortune. Let me clarify that you stand no chance in the Bengal polls,” she said. Addressing an election meeting in Birbhum district, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said, “The TMC cannot win the polls through manipulation and intimidation. Central forces will be deployed near polling booths and local policemen will be posted far away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-suffer-a-political-blow-in-2021-says-mamata-banerjee/story-vjCvLQ6n7lDIwsN8rPZWMK.html
26-11-2020||India||NIA arrests president of PDP’s youth wing||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested the president of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) youth wing in connection with the case against a senior Jammu and Kashmir police officer who was arrested in January while ferrying two suspected terrorists in a car, said agency officials familiar with the matter.Waheed ur Rehman Parra’s arrest came after two days of interrogation at the New Delhi headquarters of the NIA, which summoned him because, it said, his name had surfaced during its probe of the case against deputy superintendent of police Davinder Singh. In Srinagar, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti termed the arrest blackmail and said Parra had been falsely implicated in the case against Singh, who was arrested in January 11 while travelling on the national highway to Jammu in his car along with three men, two of whom were described as Hizbul Mujahideen militants PDP president, Mehbooba Mufti termed the arrest as black mail and said he had been falsely implicated.”Waheed has no connection whatsoever with this man & is being falsely charged. All just to blackmail & intimidate PDP & other mainstream political parties in J&K,” she said, criticising the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre “BJP milks illegal scrapping of Article 370 in every nook & corner of the country. But when it comes to Kashmiris questioning its abrogation they are locked up & punished. Everyone knows at whose behest Davinder Singh worked for. Ironic that they have the gall to blame others,” the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister wrote in a tweet.Parra is contesting the District Development Council election from South Kashmir’s Pulwama. Besides being chief of the PDP’s youth wing, he is considered to be close to Mufti and has a strong base among the young in south Kashmir, where he played a pivotal role in organising the party’s public programmes.Parra is the first politician to be arrested in the case against Davinder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-president-of-pdp-s-youth-wing/story-vI1p8Sraspggr52f3m8SHM.html
26-11-2020||India||PDP’s office sits on encroached land: J&K administration||A day after two former chief ministers, Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, were listed among encroachers on state land, the Jammu and Kashmir administration on Wednesday made public a list of seven other illegal occupants of land in Jammu district, including the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).The PDP office stands on three kanals (roughly 1,500 square metres) of illegally occupied state land in Sunjwan village of Jammu, according to the administration, an allegation denied by party president Mehbooba Muft, who said the premises had been rented.“Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti’s PDP office sits on an encroached three kanals of state land in Sunjwan. The land is suspected to have been encroached upon when Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was the chief minister,” said an official who requested anonymity.Mehbooba Mufti reacted acerbically. “Godi Gang’s desperation to please their masters without checking facts is evident,” she wrote in a post on Twitter, using a mocking term for supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Otherwise they’d know that PDP office both in Srinagar & Jammu is rented accommodation & NOT owned by the party. Shame on this Godi Gang for misleading people.”Repeated calls made and messages sent to the PDP chief went unanswered.PDP leader Talib Choudhary is also among the alleged encroachers with two kanals of land in Channi Rama under his occupation. The names of former senior superintendent of police Mirza Rasheed, businessman Haji Sultan Ali, former Congress minister Aijaz Khan’s relative Zehan Din and former inspector general of police Nisar Ali figured in the list.Also Read | Abdullahs named in J&K land encroachment listThe Jammu and Kashmir administration is making public the names of alleged beneficiaries of a two-decade-old, now-repealed law called the Roshni Act that allowed people to acquire proprietary rights to land they had illegally occupied by paying for it. It is also naming those who are still in illegal possession of state land. “We are uploading the list of beneficiaries and encroachers. It will take some time” , Jammu divisional commissioner Sanjeev Verma said. When asked whether the alleged encroachers would be evicted from state land, he said: “Whatever is required will be done in accordance with the law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdp-s-office-sits-on-encroached-land-j-k-administration/story-nJvlQqNEYFl1sIAYJ2c9WM.html
26-11-2020||India||At IT panel meet, BJP, Congress spar over J&K internet shutdown||A war of words broke out between MPs of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress on Thursday over whether a Standing Committee on Information and Technology could discuss the issue of internet shut downs in Jammu and Kashmir since the issue pertains to national security, people familiar with the matter said. The BJP MPs, the people cited above said, pointed out that it was a law-and-order issue and the local administration was answerable for measures taken to prevent any tension on the ground. “Officials of the MHA and telecom ministry who were present for the committee hearing told the panel that they were not sure whether the recently amended guideline of a 15-day outer period for Internet shutdowns is still applicable,” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Earlier this month, the Union government issued a gazette notification, inserting Rule 2A into the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 that states “the suspension order issued by the competent authority under sub-rule (1) shall not be in operation for more than fifteen days.” A second member said that the panel will soon present a draft report on Internet suspension. Meanwhile, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, who is also a member of the IT panel, has written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla complaining that the panel chairperson Shashi Tharoor has been using the platform of Parliamentary committee for “parochial political purposes.” In his letter, Dubey said that Tharoor had suo motu selected a subject of suspension of telecom services/ internet and its impact for detailed examination notwithstanding the fact that other members of the committee had strongly objected to this. HT has seen a copy of the letter.Dubey said that Tharoor issued summons to the Union home secretary, to appear before the panel for an oral evidence on November 25. “The fact of the matter is that the union home Ministry has already stated the legal position before the committee in its earlier sitting held on October 16, 2020. But calling the union secretary on the already settled issue indicates that either Dr Shashi Tharoor is suffering from acute amnesia, or he still ‘tossing a coin’ for getting some cheap publicity by discussing an issue of national importance – having wider security implications/ramifications,” the letter says. Tharoor was not immediately available for comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-it-panel-meet-bjp-congress-spar-over-j-k-internet-shutdown/story-f2QP9DGyzK6vmA9Rk6GB1O.html
26-11-2020||India||Ban on firecrackers an example of judicial overreach, says Naidu||Vice president M. Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said the recent ban on firecrackers and the vehicle cess levied in Delhi had sparked a debate over judicial overreach and how “occasionally, concerns have been raised as to whether they (judiciary) were entering the domains of the legislative and the executive wings” . The vice president was speaking at the 80th presiding officers conference of Indian legislative bodies. This is the first time that the presiding officer of either House of Parliament has commented on this issue. Naidu is the presiding officer of the Rajya Sabha. Naidu’s comments, seeking clear boundaries for the three wings of the state—legislature, judiciary and executive—reflected the theme of the conference: “Harmonious coordination between legislature, executive and judiciary”. President of India Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the conference— his first public event after more than eight months—here in Gujarat. Under the chairmanship of Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, the event will see a series of working sessions before Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the presiding officers on Thursday. “There have been debates as to whether some issues should have been more legitimately left to the other organs of the government. For example, (the ban on) Deepavali fireworks; cess on registration and movement of vehicles from the National Capital Region through Delhi; banning use of vehicles after 10 or 15 years; monitoring police investigations; denying the executive any role in the appointment of judges by instituting a collegium which is said to be an extra-constitutional body; invalidating the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act seeking to ensure transparency and accountability (in judicial appointments) are being cited as instances of judicial overreach,” he said, emphasizing that no wing has supremacy over the other under the Indian ConstitutionIn 2014, the government decided to set up the National Judicial Appointments Commission, comprising the chief justice of India, two senior judges of the apex court, the Union law minister and two “eminent persons” to decide on the appointment and transfer of judges. The Supreme Court struck down the law enabling this in 2015. Senior judicial appointments continue to be made by the judges themselves, though the collegium, and while the government, through the law ministry, can ask the collegium to reconsider its choice, or delay signing off on it, it does not have veto power. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said “differences in institutions have emerged in the journey of democracy” and underlined that all three organs have “sufficient powers” to work. He emphasized “coordination” between the three wings and said all of them has a job to protect the public interest. Naidu acknowledged that the higher judiciary has delivered several “far-reaching verdicts in furtherance of socio-economic objectives” and correctional interventions. He also cited instances of legislative and executive excess such as rules under subordinate legislation violating provisions of original legislation or violations of rights and liberties by the executive that are “too visible for comfort.” He also mentioned 39th amendment to the Constitution placing the election of the president, vice president and prime minister beyond the scope of judicial scrutiny as legislative over-activism. A harmonious relationship between three wings of the Indian state “warrants a spirit of mutual respect, responsibility and restraint. Unfortunately, there have been several instances of crossing the boundaries,” Naidu concluded.Senior advocate Raj Panjwani said the legislature has the space “to correct all wrongs or actions which are detrimental to society.”“The role of the judiciary is limited to testing the legality and competence of legislative and executive actions. The problem lies when the legislature fails to correct the wrongs that is a threat to the society at large and also to an individual’s fundamental rights. It is in this scenario, due to failure of the legislature as well as executive to take prompt and appropriate actions, in particular with issues concerning the environment, the Constitution empowers the judiciary to step in and fill up the vacuum caused by this inaction,” Panjwani added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-on-firecrackers-an-example-of-judicial-overreach-says-naidu/story-rOr2GqliAUjgZ7Z7kgpYUM.html
26-11-2020||India||The centrality of Ahmed Patel in Indian politics||In a parliamentary democracy, power is diffused. The legislature is where the sovereignty of citizens is expressed through representatives; the executive is where real authority is exercised, shaping lives of citizens and steering the nation through everyday crises. The political coalition or party which enjoys a majority drives the political outlook and vision governing decisions; the bureaucracy influences both policy formulation and acts as a policy executor; the judiciary keeps an eye on whether the exercise of this authority is being done within the framework of the Constitution; big business has its priorities, and through political funding, often wields an invisible influence on policy; the media plays the role of a watchdog; and civil society represents, often, the views of organised citizens with specific interests which need to be heard and accommodated for deeper legitimacy.If there was one Congress leader who had an almost instinctive understanding of how to manage these various sources and sites of power, it was Ahmed Patel. And that is why his loss is the most significant setback to India’s Grand Old Party in recent times. The setback is even deeper because the Congress—after losing two consecutive Lok Sabha elections and multiple state elections, being perceived as directionless, in the midst of uncertainty over leadership and a cold war between diverse interest groups—is now left bereft of perhaps the one man who had the ability to bridge stakeholders within the power apparatus of the party, and between the party and its possible constituents of support outside.Ahmed Patel entered Parliament when the Congress was in Opposition for the first time in Indian history—after the Emergency. Like many others who cut their teeth in those difficult times when the Congress was being attacked by those in government and facing an internal churn, Patel made his choice early on. He would stay loyal to Indira Gandhi and the family.But it was during Rajiv Gandhi’s time that Patel began understanding the dynamics of power—forming a part of the troika of parliamentary secretaries the PM appointed. It was here that Patel understood the power and constraints within which the prime minister, even one with 400-plus seats, operated; he saw the power of the Parliament, even where the Opposition was at its weakest; he saw the importance of keeping the party organisation together, in the midst of emerging mutinies against the young PM; he saw how handling contradictions that emerge from religion and caste was central to managing politics (an area of familiarity since his home state, Gujarat, too, was often the site of both communal and caste clashes). It was here that he began forming lifelong networks within the party, and his loyalty to the Nehru-Gandhi family deepened.But if he cut his teeth with Rajiv Gandhi, it was with Sonia Gandhi that Patel truly came into his own. Once again, like at the beginning of his political career, the Congress was in crisis in the late 1990s and early 2000s—Sonia Gandhi had just entered formal politics and had not yet attained the respect of all within her own party; Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in power and being rated as the most popular prime minister of recent times; Patel’s home state of Gujarat was now firmly in the grip of the Bharatiya Janata Party, with an unprecedented degree of Hindu-Muslim polarisation and with Patel himself being made acutely conscious of his Muslim identity. Few thought the Congress could return to power.But it did, pulling off a surprise in the 2004 polls. And that is when Patel began harnessing all the skills that he had developed in the preceding two-and-a-half decades. India had the most unusual experiment of the party president (Sonia Gandhi) constituting one element of the power matrix and the prime minister (Manmohan Singh) constituting another. There may be diverse views on whether this experiment was healthy or even appropriate for democracy—but if it lasted for a decade, the man who played a central role in navigating the relationship, determining the messages that went from the party to the government, and playing the messenger at the highest levels of power was Ahmed Patel.Between 2004 and 2014, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that no major political or policy decision happened without either Ahmed Patel’s consent or his knowledge. The man who developed a legendary reputation for operating largely at night became the key gatekeeper to Sonia Gandhi—in terms of who she would meet, what she would prioritise, and which way she would veer—and the most formidable, but largely invisible, power centre in India in recent decades.If a Congress leader had a grievance, he went to Patel. If a state was headed for elections, it was left to Patel to determine the candidates and tone of the campaign. If a Cabinet reshuffle had to take place, it was Patel who deliberated on the names with Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. If an ally had to be managed, it was Patel who worked his phones. If resources had to be mobilised, it was Patel who tapped his corporate network, often leveraging his Gujarati roots with the country’s biggest business houses. If a top bureaucratic appointment was in the offing, officials lined up, quietly—and yes, again in the middle of the night—to make their case to Patel. If the Opposition had to be countered—either by political management or using the instruments of the State (including in violation of the spirit of democratic norms)—it was Patel who gave the green signal. If the media strategy was to be decided, Patel gave the talking points to the party’s spokespersons or briefed journalists, almost always off the record. If a party unit in a state was in the grip of a factional divide, it was left to Patel to read the riot act and reconcile interests. This, indeed, was the hard mechanics of politics that Patel thrived in—away from the public glare on the more orchestrated elements of political theatre.In the last six years, Patel had to deal with two distinct transitions. One was the change in the national political climate, with a dominant BJP, led by his old acquaintance, and some suggest, friend, from his Gujarat days — Narendra Modi—changing the vocabulary and rules of Indian politics. But it was not as much Modi, with whom Patel did share cordial ties, but Amit Shah, who saw Patel as among those responsible for the cases against him in Gujarat, who decided to challenge Patel’s power—including in the thriller of a contest for his Rajya Sabha seat from Gujarat in 2017. Patel won that battle, and this was testament to how, even at his weakest, he had the instruments to secure his interests.The second was the more immediate internal generational transition within his own party, with Sonia Gandhi stepping back and Rahul Gandhi emerging as the next leader. Rahul Gandhi was understood to have deep scepticism of the party’s “Old Guard”, which he blamed for the weaknesses of the United Progressive Alliance government and for the larger political culture within the Congress. Rahul Gandhi appeared to think that the presence of well-entrenched political leaders around his father and mother had led them to make political mistakes. Never confirmed by either side, and often the subject of Delhi’s political grapevine, Patel—in this viewpoint—represented the Old.But over the past few years, even Rahul Gandhi appeared to recognise the indispensability of Ahmed Patel. He played a key, but behind-the-scenes role, along with his old friend who too had cut his teeth in the late 1970s and early ’80s, Ashok Gehlot, in helping Rahul Gandhi mount an aggressive campaign in the Gujarat elections of 2017; he played his part in managing the Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh elections in 2018, with success; as treasurer, he ensured that the Congress—despite being out of power—had the resources to put up a fight in 2019; with Sonia Gandhi‘s return as the party chief, he helped rehabilitate Bhupinder Hooda in Haryana, posing a challenge to the BJP in state polls; and he was a behind-the-scenes architect of the Maharashtra alliance with another of his older, former colleagues, Sharad Pawar.For a man who entered the national political theatre when the Congress was in Opposition 43 years ago, and has left the theatre of life when the Congress is in Opposition now, Ahmed Patel’s life was marked by his relationship with power, even though he wore that power very lightly, with a smile, often understating his own authority and being tentative about any evolving political situation. Or perhaps it was because he had seen power so up close that there was also this tentativeness about Patel; certitudes, he knew, did not work in democratic politics.There can be a strong critique of his importance—for should a man who largely operated invisibly have exercised such power without the commensurate public accountability? Was he so immersed in just navigating the corridors of power in central Delhi that he failed to read the political currents on the ground and prepare his party leadership accordingly? But irrespective of one’s views on Patel, there is little doubt that he remained a true, loyal, indispensable pillar of the Congress—and, by extension, of Indian politics. The party will feel his loss deeply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-centrality-of-ahmed-patel-in-indian-politics/story-NgvulUwkxMTX4KFbtwy26K.html
26-11-2020||India||States can put curbs, but discussion must for lockdowns: MHA||States and Union territories (UTs) may impose local restrictions such as night curfews in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), but they will have to consult the central government before imposing a lockdown outside containment zones, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) said in new guidelines released on Wednesday.The standard operations procedures (SOPs), applicable for December, did not bring about any major changes or impose any significant restrictions. Instead, they focused on “Surveillance, Containment and Caution”, and aimed at consolidating “the substantial gains that have been achieved against the spread of Covid-19”. The guidelines said that states and UTs “shall consider implementing staggered office timings and other suitable measures” in order to reduce the number of employees attending office at the same time in cities where the weekly case positivity rate — proportion of samples found positive for the Covid-19 — is more than 10%. The MHA document also laid stress on Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, asking states and UTs to consider actions, including levying fines on those not wearing masks in public and work spaces.The guidelines asked authorities to ensure strict enforcement of wearing face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing. It said that to ensure social distancing in crowded places, especially in markets, weekly bazaars and public transport, the health and family welfare ministry will issue an SOP, which has to be strictly followed.“...keeping in view the recent spike in new cases in few States/ UTs, ongoing festival season and onset of winter, it is emphasised that to fully overcome the pandemic, there is need to maintain caution and to strictly follow the prescribed containment strategy, focused on surveillance, containment and strict observance of the guidelines/ SOPs issued by MHA and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MOHFW).“Local district, police and municipal authorities shall be responsible to ensure that the prescribed Containment measures are strictly followed. States and UTs, based on their assessment of the situation, may impose local restrictions, with a view to contain the spread of Covid-19,” said the home ministry’s guidelines.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThey added that state authorities shall not impose any lockdown outside containment zones without consulting the Union government. To be sure, the previous guidelines, applicable in November, contained the same clause.The guidelines came in the backdrop of a surge in Covid-19 infections in several parts of the country after Diwali. Alarmed, the Centre has rushed special teams to eight states — Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Manipur, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab — over the past two weeks, while authorities in Delhi and at the Centre have held multiple meetings to devise strategies to contain what is viewed as the third wave to have hit the national capital.As of Wednesday, total cases in the country stood at 9,222,216 and fatalities at 134,699. Over the past seven days (November 17-24), the number of new infections has grown by an average of 43,476 (7.96%) every day across the country. States such as Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have recently released night curfews in select areas to curb the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19.The MHA guidelines asked local authorities to ensure a careful demarcation of containment at the micro level. It said that the list of containment zones will be notified on the websites by district collectors and will be shared with the MOHFW.Listing down the SOPs concerning containment zones — the epicentre of an infection, the guidelines said that only essential activities will be allowed in these areas and that there shall be strict perimeter control, door-to-door surveillance and quick isolation of Covid-19 patients in treatment facilities or at home on case-by-case basis.“Listing of contacts shall be carried out in respect of all persons found positive, along with their tracking, identification, quarantine and follow up of contacts for 14 days (80% of contacts to be traced in 72 hours),” the guidelines said. They added that the surveillance for “ILI/ SARI cases” (influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections) will be carried out in health facilities or outreach mobile units or through fever clinics in buffer zones.The MHA document stressed that all activities are allowed outside containment zones, though some are permitted with restrictions. These are: international air travel of passengers (as permitted by the government); cinema halls and theatres with up to 50% capacity; swimming pools (only for training of sportspersons); exhibition halls (only for business to business purposes); social, religious, sports, entertainment, educational, cultural, religious gatherings with up to a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity and a ceiling of 200 people in closed spaces. However, authorities are allowed to reduce the ceiling to 100 persons or less, in closed spaces.The guidelines asked district, police and municipal authorities to ensure that the containment measures are strictly followed, and also instructed local officials to follow prescribed SOPs for activities permitted with restrictions.The guidelines also said that there shall be no restriction on inter- and intra-state movement, “including those for cross land-border trade under Treaties with neighbouring countries”. No separate permission or e-permit will be required for such movements, they said.The guidelines said that those above 65 and with co-morbidities, pregnant women and children below 10 years are advised to stay at home, and encouraged the use of the government’s contact-tracing mobile application, Aarogya Setu.“Disease spread can be controlled even without implementing a lockdown, and by strictly following the fundamental principles for control of any communicable diseases, including observing respiratory etiquettes. All spikes that have been seen in this pandemic are because people dropped their guard and stopped following Covid-19 appropriate behavior such as wearing mask, maintaining social distancing and hygiene. Lockdown was meant to buy time to prepare country’s health infrastructure to handle patient load. That purpose has been solved,” said Jugal Kishore, head, department of community medicine, Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-can-put-curbs-but-discussion-must-for-lockdowns-mha/story-X6ADCs9ECmfHJsoaoEc8jM.html
26-11-2020||India||Cyclone Nivar makes landfall, rain hits Tamil Nadu||The landfall of Cyclone Nivar began around 10:30 pm, according to India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) latest weather bulletin on Wednesday night. The wind speed is expected to be between 120 and 130 kmph, gusting upto 145 kmph when the cyclone will make landfall, the IMD said in its bulletin at 9:30 pm. It further said that the very severe cyclonic storm lay 50 km east-northeast of Cuddalore, 40 km east-southeast of Puducherry and 120 km south of Chennai.Earlier in the day, thousands of families were evacuated across Chennai and coastal districts of Tamil Nadu on Wednesday even as torrential rains, strong winds and high tides continued to batter the state. “As many as 1,21,152 people have been evacuated across the state including Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam, Ariyalur, Perambalur,” said Phanindra Reddy, principal secretary and commissioner, state’s disaster management and mitigation department. Life came to a standstill as electricity supply was interrupted in several parts of Chennai and other districts as hundreds of trees and electricity poles were uprooted. Buses and cars were seen stranded on roads and subways, forcing commuters to wade through knee-deep water. Several homes in low lying areas were also flooded with water. “People have been advised to not come out until district authorities announce that it is safe,” said Reddy. The landfall is expected between Karaikal and Mamallapuram around Puducherry during midnight and early hours of November 26 with a wind speed of 12-130 kmph gusting to 145 kmph. “Even after landfall, the system is likely to maintain its cyclone intensity for about six-hours and weaken gradually,” the weather office said.Airport operations (domestic and international flights) at the Chennai airport were suspended from 7pm on November 25 to 7am on November 26. As of 8pm, 2,707 people including 525 children in relief camps in Chennai. All major arterial roads in Chennai have been closed until further. Around 465 government ambulances have been stationed in seven coastal districts across the state. Also Read | Cyclone Nivar: Once bitten twice shy, Chennai residents park cars on flyoverOn Tuesday, IMD said that Nivar would make landfall as a very severe cyclonic storm in the evening hours but on Wednesday morning IMD’s bulletin said landfall was expected in the evening. “A delay is seen in timing of the landfall owing to rather slow movement of the cyclone. But there is no change from the expected intensity of very severe cyclone, during the time of landfall. The slow movement realised has been due lighter steering winds in which the Cyclone is embedded as well as due to change in direction of movement, as had been predicted,” added Devi.  The cyclone warning issued by IMD on Wednesday evening was upgraded to “Red” category from “Orange” category owing to the damage and extremely heavy rainfall expected in the region associated with landfall. “A red warning in case of Cyclone represents the 4th stage of warning, which includes the post landfall outlook as well. In the post landfall outlook, we will include the likely movement and adverse weather likely in those districts, which might fall along the expected track of the system after landfall. This is usually issued nearly 12 hours prior to the expected landfall,” Devi explained.Even after landfall, the system is likely to maintain its cyclone intensity for about 6 hours and then weaken gradually. Under its influence rainfall at most/many places with heavy to very heavy falls at a few places with extremely heavy falls (over 20 cm) likely to occur over Ranipet, Tiruvannamalai, Tirupattur, Vellore districts of Tamil Nadu and Chittoor, Kurnool, Prakasam; Cuddappa districts of Andhra Pradesh and adjoining southeast Telangana on November 26.After 6pm, 5,000 cusecs of surplus water was released from Chembaramakkam reservoir into the Adyar river which is an increase from 1,000 cusecs released on Wednesday noon. “It will keep going up as the inflow goes up,” said Reddy. “We will release water in a controlled manner,” said chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami after he inspected the Chembarambakkam reservoir which is about 30km from Chennai in the adjoining Kancheepuram district. “Adyar river has the capacity to carry 60,000 cusecs. Government is taking all precautions.”Braving the rains, civic workers, police personnel, NDRF and SDRF cleared water-logging, fallen trees and poles and evacuated families to safer locations. Armed forces are on standy-by with helicopters and ships ready for rescue operations. The previous cyclone to hit Tamil Nadu was Gaja (classified as a very severe cyclonic storm) in November 2018. It claimed 46 lives and left a trail of destruction leaving lakhs of people homeless. “This cyclone may not cause that amount of damage but it will bring a lot of rainfall,” said former IMD director Y E A Raj.AIADMK and DMK leaders and workers also took part in relief work. Stalin wearing rain gear provided aid to families living in inundated areas such as Kolathur, Choolai and Villivakkam. BJP cancelled its Vetrivel Yatra (victorious spear march) due to the cyclone and joined in the relief work. Chief Minister Palaniswami announced a public holiday on Thursday across 16 districts in Tamil Nadu. In Puducherry, where section 144 is imposed, 2,200 people have been shifted to 285 relief centres. “The next few hours are crucial. We hope there is no major casualty or damage to property,” said the union territory’s collector, T Arun.Independent scientists said warming of oceans due to climate change was leading to more intense cyclones and dangerous storm surges. “Now we have a La Nina in the Pacific, that is cool conditions in the Pacific that makes the local environmental conditions favorable for cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal. During the last 40 years, six cyclones - of the severe cyclone category- hit the Tamil Nadu coast in November. Out of these six, five of them coincided with La Nina like conditions in the Pacific. So that means to some extent we were expecting a cyclone season in the Bay of Bengal during this time - and it is not a surprise,” Roxy Mathew Koll, Scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and co-author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Oceans and Cryosphere report said in a statement on Wednesday.“The case of Cyclone Nivar is similar to that of Cyclone Ockhi in several ways. In November 2017, Cyclone Ockhi intensified rapidly from a moderate cyclone to a very-severe-cyclone in 24 hours, resulting in death of 844 in India and Sri Lanka. We found that unusually warm ocean temperatures favoured its evolution from a depression to cyclone in 9 hours and then to a very-severe-cyclone in 24 hours. The Bay of Bengal is part of the warm pool region, where the temperatures are generally about 28-29°C in November and occasionally exceeding 30°C. These high temperatures are generally conducive for cyclogenesis. On top of that the global warming element is there - this time the temperature anomalies are about 0.5-1°C and in some regions reaching 1.2°C, based on buoy and satellite estimates,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nivar-makes-landfall-rain-hits-tamil-nadu/story-JPsMHU2jRDi9DNyxDhTwDL.html
26-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Next week is an important one for India in its fight against the coronavirus disease. There are clear signs of a second wave — there have been, for some time — but the week starting November 30 will decide how rapidly this gathers momentum. For, this is when we will know whether the crowded markets seen just ahead of Diwali (November 14), and the Diwali celebrations themselves — they were muted this year, but there were some gatherings and family get-togethers, and some people did travel to be with their families — have resulted in a spike in cases. If there is one, it will actually start showing up in the numbers by the end of this week.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThat’s because anecdotal evidence — from Labour Day weekend in the US to crowding in a vegetable market in Chennai in May — suggests that cases peak two weeks after such events. And that’s because science suggests that superspreaders and also superspreader events play an important role in the transmission of the disease.If there’s any chance at all that India will dodge this spike, it comes from the fact that Diwali came at a time that was either the end of the first wave, or the beginning of the second in India. It is possible, and also probable that the country’s second wave will, much like the first, gather momentum slowly, rather than being turbocharged right at its beginning by a sharp rise in case numbers.In this, India is fortunate.This week, the US celebrates one of its biggest holidays, Thanksgiving (on November 26) — one that usually sees a lot of people traveling to be with their families. In each of the past two weeks, the country, now seeing its third wave of the coronavirus disease, has added at least a million cases. And although the country’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that people avoid travelling, over the weekend, US airports saw their busiest period since March, with three million people passing through them, according to data from the Transport Security Administration. That’s still around 40% lower than the number of people who travelled by air ahead of Thanksgiving last year, but media reports suggest that many people believe that travelling to be with family on Thanksgiving is worth the risk of contracting Covid-19, and also that there is a surge in travel. That’s bad news for a country that is doing around 175,000 cases a day on average, where cases are high and rising in almost every state, and where hospitals are being overwhelmed by a growing number of hospitalisations. Experts fear that a Thanksgiving spike could push several states and their public health systems over the edge.It isn’t clear why the nature of waves across countries is as different as it is — the second wave seems to have peaked in much of Europe, which would mean that both waves in most European countries have lasted for less time than corresponding waves in the US (and also India).India’s first wave lasted for months, gathering momentum slowly, peaking in mid-September, and then falling. Geographical and population size could explain this — it is one thing in common to both India and the US, and also Brazil (it has seen the third highest number of cases), which is also seeing a second wave, although that country’s numbers are far too patchy to be taken seriously.In the US and elsewhere, the fact that four vaccines have now shown high efficacy in protecting people from Covid-19 could well be encouraging people to take risks they otherwise would not — the New York Times reported, citing data from a travel search engine, that travel bookings increased after Pfizer/BioNTech’s announcement in early November that their vaccine was effective in protecting people from the coronavirus disease.This behaviour, stemming from the belief that the worst is over— it doesn’t have a name yet, but I am sure one will be coined soon — is just as bad as Covid- or pandemic-fatigue.Sure, at one level, the success of four vaccines has changed everything.Yet, at another, it has changed nothing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-XRMBAttSTD9tBzKKHkGhEP.html
26-11-2020||India||‘Gupkar can canvass freely’: J&K Governor Manoj Sinha||There is complete freedom in Jammu & Kashmir for politics, but not anti-national activities, the Union Territory’s lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha said on Wednesday, days ahead of the region’s first direct election since it was controversially stripped of its special status and bifurcated last year. In an exclusive interview, Sinha, 61, laid out the political road map for the UT and detailed security arrangements for the district development council (DDC) elections, which begins on Saturday where six million electors across 20 districts will choose 280 representatives — 140 each in Jammu and Kashmir. He also shared his assessment of the security situation, insisting that the forces have an upper hand on militants despite recent incidents like a foiled terror plot last week in Nagrota in Jammu district. “Only India’s Constitution permits one to use unconstitutional language. There is full freedom here for those who want to do political activities. But permission is only for politics, not for anti-national activities,” he said. Sinha — who was a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader from Uttar Pradesh before he was appointed the UT’s second LG in August — strongly argued against separatism and a space for the Hurriyat Conference in the region’s politics. Also Read | J&K DDC polls: Gupkar Alliance releases fifth list“I feel that nationalist forces and pro-India voices should get patronage in J&K. We will carry that forward,” he said. Sinha said the state election commission responded to complaints by the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) that their candidates were confined in security camp and not allowed to freely canvass for the eight-phase polls. “Following their complaints, the state election commissioner has assured a level-playing field for all parties. There will be no discrimination. Candidates will have all the freedom to canvass,” he said. PAGD is a recently stitched alliance between six mainstream parties in Kashmir, including former rivals National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party, who demand the restoration of Article 370, which bestowed special status on the region. “This election will be a milestone for grassroots democracy and development… polling will be the real test of people’s fervour, but feedback suggests an overwhelming response,” Sinha said. He condemned the recent killings of political leaders – 10 local BJP leaders have been gunned down this year – but added that his administration made solid arrangements for security to ensure free and fair polls. “Attempts to disrupt the election process will not succeed. People want to participate in elections, and our forces are vigilant,” he added. Sinha disagreed with recent statements made by former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti that militancy was on the rise and more young people were joining extremism, and stressed that the coordination between forces had improved. “Security is not a concern. Our forces are fully alert to deal with any situation. There are people in our neighbourhood who want to destabilise the situation. But there is nothing to worry,” he said. Sinha said his biggest challenge was to create a mechanism for people to air their grievances and get redressal and added that Kashmiri youngsters, who took to arms but surrendered, should be allowed to return to the mainstream. “Anyone who expresses faith in the Constitution must get a chance.”Some political parties disagreed with the L-G’s assessment. “ Lt-Governor is right in theory that nationalist forces needs to be patronised in J&K. In reality, however, the government’s decisions and actions are pushing them to the other side of the fence,” said GA Mir, chief of J&K Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gupkar-can-canvass-freely-j-k-governor-manoj-sinha/story-BMxMfaqbT6jppXtf3SjJYI.html
26-11-2020||India||Delhi NCR in a chokehold of its own emissions||The air quality in the National Capital Region plunged back into the “severe” pollution zone and inched towards emergency levels on Wednesday, shrouding the region in a haze of its own emissions that have now been trapped by a cocktail of metrological factors: low winds, a blanket of clouds, and cold temperatures. The 24-hour air quality index in Delhi was 413 according to the 4pm bulletin by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), and the concentration of fine PM10 particles and ultra-fine PM2.5 particles were close breaching the emergency thresholds. The deterioration comes after a brief respite from an early November spell of pollution largely caused by farm fires in Punjab and Haryana.Weather agency officials said the problem now is because local emissions – tailpipe gases, road dust, smoke from garbage burning and industrial emissions – are not being blown away by wind. It is made worse by cloud cover, which drives up moisture and reduces the room for pollutants to lift higher into the sky.“Both mixing height and ventilation index are very low now, which leads to accumulation of pollutants very close to the surface. This is mainly due to lack of winds which would otherwise disperse these pollutants,” said VK Soni, senior scientist at IMD.Experts also saw this as a reminder of how much of the problem that Capital itself is responsible for. “Today (Wednesday) a fire raged on at the Ghazipur landfill, that too on a day when pollution levels were already in the critical levels. It is such instances that we need to control. Can we say that there are no garbage fires happening in Delhi now? Or no vehicular emissions or we have been able to control road dust completely,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).Also Read | Delhi’s air quality worsens, temperature to rise over next couple of daysRoychowdhury added that Delhi’s air quality also depends on the polluting sources in the NCR towns such as Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Faridabad and Noida -- they recorded AQIs of 444, 299, 348, 414 respectively.Delhi largely goes through several cycles of bad air days in winter, which relent only when the region has favourable weather conditions. After the October-end, early-November peak seen every year for at least the past decade, the second peak arrives sometime in December. This year, however, it seems to have happened sooner than usual.A 2019 analysis by Council on Energy, Environment and Water showed tailpipe emissions from vehicles contribute as much as 39.2% of the city’s PM 2.5 levels. Roadsides dust adds up to 37.8% to this. In PM10 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres), the contribution of road dust goes up to 65.9%.Delhi does not have an emissions inventory showing contribution of local sources to overall pollution levels on a daily basis – the above numbers reflect how it is typically in winter. Experts point out that addressing these is crucial for a long-term solution.“If local emissions are reduced by a large fraction (at least by 25%-30%), the peak in pollution levels reaching in the ‘severe’ zone could definitely be lowered to ‘very poor’ and even ‘poor’ levels. While the number of ‘severe’ days recorded during winter has come down over the past few years, specific action and long-term planning is required,” said Sagnik Dey, associate professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi.Dey also said emissions from the neighbouring regions including Gurugram, Faridabad and Ghaziabad are a problem for the Capital. “Gurugram and Faridabad are upwind of Delhi, the emissions directly have an impact on the city’s air. Besides, a number of industries, both conforming and not conforming to regulations, are located at Delhi’s border and in areas such as Ghaziabad, which also contribute to pollution in the capital,” said Dey.According to Union government’s air quality forecasting wing, the share of farm fires in Delhi’s pollution levels was as low as 2% (the number of fire counts was 63.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai, however, said most of the problem is still due to farm fires that neighbouring states need to address. “Even over the last fortnight, when Delhi’s air quality started deteriorating, the contribution of stubble fires was high. This can be clearly seen through the satellite images of NASA,” said Rai. MM Kutty, the chairperson of the newly-formed Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas, said long-term solutions are being worked upon.“We have a forward looking approach. We are working on identifying long term solutions to this problem (stubble burning). A workable solution will be attempted by the Commission in consultation with all stakeholders so that the problem does not arise in future. Now stubble burning is over. We are also trying to establish the wherewithal to implement various measures to control spike in winter pollution. CPCB should continue to do its job,” said Kutty.A senior official in the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said action on hot spots is being taken. “The patrolling teams have been issuing fines wherever garbage burning has been observed. Besides, all efforts are being taken to prevent dust emissions,” the official said.Soni said slight improvement is likely in air quality from Thursday onwards when light rain is expected and the wind speed is predicted to pick up to 10-12kmph. “The air quality is expected to improve tomorrow onwards. Also, no major deterioration is likely till November 30. It will remain in the lower end of ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ zone,” he said.But even these few days of severe air quality can be more dangerous than typical years. Exposure to high levels of pollution has been linked to an increase in the likelihood that a person can develop a serious grade of Covid-19, raising the risk of fatalities. Over the next few days, people should expect winter to take hold more strongly. “Due to likely fall in minimum temperatures over northwest India, cold wave condition is expected to prevail at isolated places over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, north Rajasthan and west Uttar Pradesh between November 27 and November 29,” the India Meteorological Department said on Wednesday. The minimum temperatures in Delhi on November 23 dipped to 6.3 degree Celsius, lowest for the month in the last 17 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-ncr-in-a-chokehold-of-its-own-emissions/story-P9RMXaoIJhtQABpFR0kKDM.html
26-11-2020||India||Tension in air as farmer march to Capital halted||Delhi Police have upped their guard and bolstered security at the city’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in order to stonewall a massive protest by farmers who are marching to the national capital to stage a demonstration against three contentious laws enacted recently by Parliament to liberalise the farm sector, according to officials.About 200 farmers’ unions have called for a two-day protest in Delhi beginning Thursday, putting the city’s administration on alert over potential law and order issues and a traffic nightmare, and prompting it to announce that any such gathering in the national capital will attract legal action.On Wednesday, high drama unfolded in neighbouring Haryana, where authorities put up blockades on Punjab’s borders to stop farmers coming from the state. While the move worked to some extent, farmers within Haryana challenged law enforcement officials, used tractors to demolish multi-layer barricades on highways and continued their march towards the Capital. Also Read | Farmers at border for ‘Delhi Chalo’ march, Haryana determined to stop them: 10 pointsEish Singhal, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi), said that all requests received from farmers’ organisations to hold protests have been rejected and they have been informed about the decision. “Please co-operate with Delhi Police in ensuring no gathering in Delhi amid Coronavirus, failing which legal action will be taken,” Singhal said on Twitter.He said that additional police and paramilitary forces have been deployed in districts that share borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and in New Delhi district. Jantar Mantar, which is the city’s protest venue, is in the New Delhi district. Ten of 15 territorial police districts share borders with either Haryana or Uttar Pradesh or both.“We have also begun a special checking of vehicles and people entering the city,” Singhal said. “We have warned them (protesters) over the phone, we have warned them on social media. If they still enter Delhi, they should be ready to face the law.”A deputy commissioner of police (DCP), who did not want to be named, said officials were keeping a close watch on large vehicles entering the city. “If people are coming in large numbers in a vehicle, they are being stopped and their identities ascertained,” he said. District DCPs are camping at the border points, where anti-riot and crowd control vehicles have been deployed.Metro train services on several corridors will be restricted during the first half of the day on Thursday. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has decided to stop regular services between several stations on six of its corridors.As tension hung in the air in Delhi on Wednesday, Haryana’s Ambala turned out to be the epicentre of a confrontation between police and the protesters. Despite appeals to withdraw their “Delhi Chalo” call, farmers gathered in large numbers near the New Grain Market in Ambala Cantonment on the national highway. The farmers, led by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Gurnam Singh Charuni, hit the roads with tractors, cars and bikes that carried ration and tents. Officials used water cannons when the farmers managed to break the barricades at Ambala. Ambala superintendent of police (SP) Rajesh Kalia accused the farmers of creating a law and order challenge. “They resorted to stone-pelting...they tried to hit the police with their speeding vehicles and run over the police...we will lodge an FIR (first information report) against them,” he said, even as the farmers marched towards Kurukshetra. Attempts by police to stop the farmers failed in Kurukshetra as well, even though officials installed barricades and used water cannons. “We are farmers and we do not have any plan or strategy, but we will not clash with the police and will continue our march peacefully”, said BKU state president Charuni. Meanwhile, the district administrations of Kurukshetra and Kaithal districts blocked Haryana’s borders to halt farmers from Punjab. “The police have been deployed at the state border in Cheeka of Kaithal district and the farmers from Punjab will not be allowed to enter Haryana,” said Kaithal SP Shahank Kumar Sawan.Later at night, the farmers stopped their cavalcade near Samana Bahu village in Karnal district and announced that they will resume their march on Thursday morning. With the police diverting traffic on key roads, there was a long traffic jam on the National Highway 44.In Punjab, farmers who were stopped in their tracks said they did not want any confrontation but will carry on with their protest. Leaders of farmer organisations announced that they will sit on a dharna at the inter-state border for a week. “We don’t want a confrontation. Our aim is to oppose the Centre’s farm laws. If we are not allowed to cross Haryana and head for Delhi on Thursday, our protest destination will be the border points for a week. If we get public support, the duration of the dharnas may be increased,” BKU (Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said. In a related development, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday said that in view of losses being suffered by railways and Punjab, it would be forced to pass harsh orders against those blocking rail tracks. The observations were made as the Centre and Punjab told the court that blockade by farmers of rail tracks was still in place in Amritsar remained, although such obstructions have been removed from other places. Food bowl Punjab is at the centre stage of a farmers’ agitation against moves to open up agricultural markets in the country and bring sweeping reforms to the farm sector, which supports nearly half the population. Farmers have demanded a repeal of three laws enacted by Parliament in September which, together, allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s minimum support price (MSP) system, which offers cultivators assured prices from the government, largely for wheat and rice. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal held day-long negotiations on November 13 with leaders of several farmers’ groups in attempt to end over two months of a politically challenging agitation. The discussions were inconclusive, but both sides had agreed to continue negotiations in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tension-in-air-as-farmer-march-to-capital-halted/story-7UaqmlSpTGoVUU2MkzAw2O.html

The couple was stopped by the police in the nick of time. They said they were frustrated over police inaction in the murder of their 5-year-old daughter Pari, who was kidnapped while playing outside her residence in the village in July this year. Pari’s bones and skull were found dumped in the backyard of their house ten days after she went missing from her home. Later, DNA tests on the bones as well as the Sahu couple proved that it was of the 5-year-old girl.As opposition BJP and Congress demanded resignation of the minister allegedly believed to be involved, minister of state(Home) Captain Dibya Shankar Mishra said the state government had decided to hand over the murder case of the five-year-old girl to CID. This was informed in the state Assembly.Mishra said the polygraph tests of four people have been completed in the case. The call detail records of mobile phones of the suspects have been examined. Till now, 34 suspects have been questioned in the case that was registered under sections 363, 364, 302, and 201 of IPC.On Monday the girl’s parents alleged that her body was found in the backyard with eyes gouged out and kidneys removed. “Babuli Nayak, a close aide of the minister along with his accomplices killed her. Even as months have passed, the accused are moving scot-free. Arun Sahu is sheltering the criminals,” alleged the deceased girl’s mother. Minister Sahoo, did not respond to the allegations levelled by the couple despite several attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-orders-cid-probe-into-murder-of-5-yr-old-girl-after-parents-try-to-kill-themselves/story-fqyr1Tt0igqSfpCQwI6cwJ.html
26-11-2020||India||Kerala and Bengal accept govt’s GST borrowing option||Kerala and West Bengal are the latest members of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council to accept the Centre’s borrowing option of Rs1.1 lakh crore to meet the indirect tax revenue shortfall in 2020-21, reducing the number of dissenting states to three from 10 in September, the Union finance ministry said on Wednesday.“Governments of Kerala and West Bengal have communicated their acceptance of Option-1 to meet the revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation,” the ministry said in a statement. With this, the number of states and Union territories (UTs) that have accepted the first borrowing option has gone up to 28, it added.“While 28 members have formally accepted the first borrowing option proposed by the Centre, the total number of states may soon go to 29 as Punjab is also considering joining the majority,” an official in the Union government said requesting anonymity. The Centre is yet to get formal acceptance from the governments of Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, the official added.At the 41st GST Council on August 27, the Centre had given two borrowing options to states to meet their revenue shortfall of about Rs2.35 lakh crore in the current financial year. Two days later, it had specified that under the first option, states would not have to pay either the principle or interest if they borrow only Rs97,000 crore (later this amount was raised to Rs1.1 lakh crore) to meet the GST revenue shortfall because of implementation issues. However, they would have to bear significant interest costs if they choose the larger borrowing option of Rs2.35 lakh crore that included revenue shortfalls due to an “act of god”, which was the Covid-19 pandemic. Initially 10 states – mostly administered by non-National Democratic Alliance (NDA) parties -- objected and insisted that the entire borrowing would have to be done by the Centre without imposing any direct interest burden on states. They were Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal.The states and UTs who opted for the first option are getting the amount of shortfall arising out of GST implementation through a special borrowing window, the statement said. The Union government has already borrowed Rs24,000 crore on behalf of states in four instalments during this window, which was operationalised on October 23.“Now the State of Kerala and West Bengal will also receive funds raised through this window starting from the next round of borrowings,” the finance ministry said.While formal notification with regard to Punjab is awaited, other 28 states and UTs to accept the first option are -- Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Telangana, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, Puducherry, West Bengal and Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-and-bengal-accept-govt-s-gst-borrowing-option/story-VnXLO0endVZ8CskDPxEsgK.html
26-11-2020||India||Freedom for politics, not anti-national activities: J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha||Fifteen months after constitutional changes nullified its seven-decade-old special status, Jammu & Kashmir is set for the District Development Council (DDC) polls, breaking the political ice in the turmoil-prone region. On the face of it, the eight-phase elections, beginning on November 28, are meant to bolster grassroots democratic institutions. They will be a barometer of the popular mood and security challenges – chillingly brought home last week by a foiled Nagrota terror plot – before the Centre decides to wade into deeper waters on the assembly elections. They will also be a litmus test for Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, 61, who, in his over three months at the helm, has started a quiet outreach to prepare the ground for the Union territory’s first political exercise in which the mainstream Kashmir parties are taking part.In an exclusive sit-down interview with Ramesh Vinayak at the Raj Bhawan in Jammu, Sinha spoke on a range of issues, including the security dynamics, the Gupkar alliance, the Roshni land scam, and a road map on economic revival. Edited excerpts:It’s been more than three months since you were appointed lieutenant governor of the country’s most sensitive region. What has been your experience? After taking over, the biggest challenge I sensed was that common people here didn’t have a platform to air their grievances and get redressal. To that end, I took decisions to create a regular and robust mechanism. All deputy commissioners and superintendents of police will meet the public for an hour five days a week. Likewise, commissioners and inspectors generals of Jammu & Kashmir divisions are meeting people three times a week. There are block divas programmes from 10am to 4pm every Wednesday, when officers of all departments attend to public grievances, including those related to ration cards, revenue records, and social pension. People are more interested in government construction works than social security schemes. A balance between the two is crucial for development. So I focused on 100% saturation of the Government of India’s 55-odd social welfare schemes. After a three-week public awareness programme, the implementation has gathered momentum, and reached 95% in 16 (of the 20) districts. In J&K, people are talented, but there has been a scarcity of opportunities. We are trying to get them maximum opportunities. People want peace and development. That is our prime focus. A key reason, it was speculated, that you were picked was because of the Centre’s keenness to have a political hand. Has lending a political touch helped? Now I don’t belong to any political party. I have no political leanings at all. Yes, democracy needs a political process, which we have initiated. For grassroots democracy, the most vital is Panchayati Raj institutions. When, in 1992, Parliament enacted the Panchayati Raj Act, it was formulated as a three-tier system – gram sabha, block development council, and district development council (DDC). But for some reasons in J&K, it was only a two-tier system which had the provision for the district development board, on which, instead of elected representatives, MLAs used to be nominated. It was felt that the system elsewhere should be implemented here too. So an amendment was brought to have directly elected district development councils for which the poll process is now underway. It is heartening that a large number of people have enthusiastically filed nominations for DDCs, which will be the third tier. Polling will be the real test of people’s fervour, but feedback suggests an overwhelming response. We want to create a strong Panchayati Raj system in J&K.What is your assessment of the security scenario in J&K? Security forces have an upper hand. A few incidents [of terrorism] have taken place, including the recent one at Nagrota. The coordination between security forces is good. J&K Police is now fighting on the front, which is seen as a new development. Security is not a concern. Our forces are fully alert to deal with any situation. There are people in our neighbourhood who want to destabilise the situation. But there is nothing to worry. When the Centre made constitutional changes in J&K last year, a key argument it made was that this will deal a decisive blow to militancy in Kashmir. But the security situation still appears fragile. The government has successfully met the challenges on the security front. I don’t agree that the situation is fragile. It is fully under control. You know what was happening here earlier. One can see the difference between then and now. How do you see the situation at the Line of Control? There has been escalation in ceasefire violations and infiltration attempts. Yes, there is cross-border firing. But our forces are giving muhn tor jawab (a befitting response). No one in the country now needs to be told how we retaliate to such situations. The country knows it well, and so does the other side. There has been a considerable decline in infiltration. This is not happening on Kashmir’s LoC. There is a new trend of infiltration from the border in Jammu, and in Punjab. We recently discovered a cross-border tunnel in the Jammu sector. There are attempts to drop narcotics and arms and ammunition through drones. Security agencies are upgrading the technological wherewithal to deal with the new challenges. In the run-up to the DDC elections, there have been targeted killings of political workers, particularly of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Valley. What steps has the government taken to ensure a secure environment for contestants and voters? Such incidents are aimed to diminish the people’s faith in the democratic process and create fear. We got an assessment done and made solid arrangements for security. Attempts to disrupt the election process will not succeed. People want to participate in elections, and our forces are vigilant. Let me assure the people of J&K and the rest of the country that we will make sure that the polls are free and fair. Leaders of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration allege that their candidates are confined in security camps, and are not allowed to move freely for canvassing. Following their complaints, the state election commissioner has assured a level-playing field for all parties. There will be no discrimination. Candidates will have all the freedom to canvass. How will you build on the DDC elections for the revival of a broader political process in J&K?Broadly, each district will elect 14 representatives. In some districts, four to five former MLAs are in the fray. So, in a way, it is a mini-MLA election. When the district development board will be constituted, the DDC members will have a pivotal role to play on development priorities of their districts. This election will be a milestone for grassroots democracy and development. What is your road map to holding elections to the legislative assembly? The nation and people of J&K have faith in what the Prime Minister said in his Independence Day address with regard to assembly elections here. The delimitation commission is doing its job. It is also working in four states of the north-east. Once delimitation is done, it will be up to Election Commission to hold the polls. The country has constitutional institutions whose rights are defined and no one can interfere in that. Is there is a time frame for the delimitation exercise? I can’t tell that. The question as to when will be elections be held should be addressed to Election Commission. Constitutional institutions have their dignity. They should be allowed to do what they are mandated to do. What the Prime Minister and home minister have said in Parliament [on elections in J&K] carries a lot of significance and should be trusted. What is the trend on locals joining militant ranks? Has their number gone up? Former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti say that militancy is on the rise? I will go by the numbers put out by security agencies and J&K Police. Their number has considerably declined. Mainstream Kashmiri leaders allege that the government is not allowing the public to express dissent... Only India’s Constitution permits one to use unconstitutional language. There is full freedom here for those who want to do political activities. There is no restriction on them. But permission is only for politics, not for anti-national activities. Security agencies are encouraging Kashmiri youngsters who took to arms to surrender and return to the mainstream. You have promised rehabilitation, which drew criticism in Jammu. How will you strike a balance? Many youngsters [in militant ranks] are realising that they are on the wrong path, and are returning to the mainstream. This is a new and welcome trend. Nobody should have an objection to this. Agar subha ka gaya sham ko ghar wapis aata hai, use avsar milna chahiye (If one is back on the right path, he should get a chance). What I said with regard to their rehabilitation was misunderstood. Anyone who expresses faith in the Constitution must get a chance. Some of the states afflicted with Left-wing extremism have a rehabilitation policy. Security forces and the army are mulling such a policy here, too. What is your sense of the street mood in Kashmir? There is a perception that it is hostile to the Indian State. I don’t see anything like that. I have spent three months in Kashmir. There is a good atmosphere here. People are looking forward to opportunities to progress. How do you see the formation of the Gupkar alliance on a single-point demand for the restoration of Article 370? Do you see it as a sign of strengthening of democracy, or do you endorse the home minister’s view that this is a gang and unholy global alliance? It is not my job to make a political comment. The home minister is also a leader of a political party. He may have said something. In the country, anyone is free to form a political alliance. Some people have made that [alliance]. The public will decide. Is the alliance good for democracy? Time will tell. Let’s wait. The Kashmiri parties say the ruling BJP is trying to delegitimise their dissent and discredit them. If the BJP is discrediting some party, where do I come in the picture? I don’t have any connection with the BJP right now. So how can I answer on behalf of the BJP or any other party? Kashmiri parties are crying foul over the J&K administration’s decision to make public the names of those allegedly involved in the Roshni land scam and the encroachment of forest land ahead of the DDC elections. They are calling it politically motivated..The administration has not decided anything at its own level. The Roshni Act, and how people got the government land under it, has been under the scanner for a long time. There is already a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report on this. In 2018, the act was scrapped by the then governor. Some public interest litigations were filed in the high court, which last month held that all land allotments under the act were illegal. It also directed the divisional commissioners in Jammu and Srinagar to upload the names of those who were allotted government land for a song under the Roshni Act, and also encroachers of forest land. This is what the administration started doing two days ago. There is no politics in it. This is only compliance of the high court directions. The recently notified new land ownership rules for J&K, allowing outsiders to buy land, have evoked strong reactions in both Jammu and the Valley. Kashmir parties have even alleged that J&K is now up for sale. How are you allaying their apprehensions? The land laws of J&K were antiquated, and some of the clauses were contradictory. The new law is progressive and has adequate safeguards. About 90% of J&K land is agricultural and can be bought only by an agriculturist who will not be from Punjab or Haryana, but only J&K. So, 90% is fully secure. About 5% to 6% is government land, and gone are the days when someone could occupy that. We have opened up the land to set up industrial clusters, private educational and health institutions. J&K has lagged in that. That is all that has changed on land laws. We have identified 3,000 acres and initiated the process of acquisition. The new land law is for the betterment of the people of J&K who have been given the same safeguards as those in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. What has been the progress on vesting forest land rights to communities?The Forest Rights Act, 2006, came into force in the entire country except J&K. That deprived rural and tribal peoples dependent on forests of their rights. But, after abrogation of Article 370, this act has been implemented here, too, since October last year. A detailed plan has been drawn up. By March 1, the district committees will complete the task of providing land rights to Paharis, Bakarwals, Gujjars, and other tribal communities. There appears to be a deep distrust between Kashmir’s mainstream politicians and the Centre? I meet representatives of all political parties. It is a continuing interaction and I solicit their cooperation for fast development of J&K. I have no issue with seeking their support for peace and progress. Are you open to recommending the restoration of statehood to J&K? What is the tangible achievement that you want to see before the Centre can consider doing this? The Prime Minister has told the nation that this is a temporary phase. The home minister said in Parliament that the statehood will be restored. So people should trust what he has said. Definitely, people will get statehood in the near future. What is your road map for the economic revival of J&K, reeling under the double whammy of turmoil and the Covid-19 pandemic? The economy of this place has suffered for a long time. After consultations with all stakeholders, a Rs 1,375-crore package was sanctioned for local business and industry, which have also been granted 50% concession on electricity and water charges for a year. Several administrative reforms have been implemented. A new industrial policy is expected to get the Union cabinet’s sanction anytime soon. That, I am confident, will get J&K private investments of Rs 30,000 crore in two or three years. It will boost the economic revival and create employment avenues. How do you plan to address unemployment?Unemployment is big problem everywhere, but it’s more acute in J&K. Apart from government jobs, there are fewer job opportunities here. The number of government employees here is the same as in Bihar though the latter’s population is 11 times more. We are working on a three-pronged approach. First, a time-bound recruitment drive for 13,000 vacant government jobs is underway, and will be completed in six months. Second, we expect a plethora of opportunities after the new industrial policy kicks in. Third, we are focusing on skilling and start-ups. By 2025, the target is to provide entrepreneurial opportunities to 80% of J&K youth. Tata group has set up a skill development centre in Baramulla, which will be inaugurated after the DDC elections. A similar facility in Jammu will come up this month. In a week or so, we will sign a memorandum of understanding with the Bombay Stock Exchange for setting up training centres in financial and insurance services. We are working on many fronts, including setting up of a state-of-the-art sports infrastructure for which the PM has sanctioned Rs 200 crore.What is your assessment of the future of the Hurriyat specifically and separatist politics in general in Kashmir? I feel that nationalist forces and pro-India voices should get patronage in J&K. We will carry that forward. How have you adapted from being a long-time political activist to the hot seat of constitutional head of India’s most sensitive border territory? I don’t see it as a hot seat. I have already toured 16 of the 20 districts and done public outreach on a large scale. I enjoy working here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-for-politics-not-anti-national-activities-j-k-lieutenant-governor-manoj-sinha/story-XaALmgAJggEl5re9v8Rk5K.html

26-11-2020||Editorials||How Mumbai changed India | HT Editorial||It has been exactly 12 years since Pakistan-based terrorists — with the explicit sanction of at least a part of the Pakistani establishment — launched the most audacious terror attack on Mumbai. The 26/11 attacks brought home to both the Indian State and citizens that it could not be business-as-usual anymore. Besides conventional wars, Pakistan had engaged in asymmetric warfare — encouraging violence in Punjab in 1980s; in Jammu and Kashmir since 1989; in Mumbai in the early 1990s; across the Indian heartland through carefully-choreographed attacks in public places meant to spread panic and stir inter-community tensions; even against the Indian Parliament in 2001. This had devastated families and communities, and created deep anger. But the scale of the attack in Mumbai, its televised and prolonged nature, the manner in which citizens could relate to the iconic spaces of the city, and the human stories of tragedy redefined India’s approach. Diplomatically, engagement with Pakistan may have gone through its ebbs and flows since the attack — indeed, the Manmohan Singh government launched a peace effort at Sharm-el-Sheikh only the following year which failed and Narendra Modi himself went to Lahore. But the attack also changed something within India. Citizens were no longer willing to give the benefit of doubt to Islamabad; concessions to win peace were frowned upon, since Pakistan’s intent was in doubt; and increasingly, having a tough approach against Pakistan became a prerequisite to passing the test of Indian nationalism. Domestic political actors may have contributed to this climate but make no mistake; at its root was Pakistan’s continuous violation of inter-state norms. Mumbai shifted Indian discourse in favour of retaliatory action after a terror attack — a strategy the Modi government has adopted. Internally, India recognised that its internal security grid was fragmented and ill-equipped. Enhanced inter-agency coordination — particularly getting intelligence agencies to generate more actionable inputs, and other agencies to act on it well in time — became a priority, as did instituting more efficient protocols to reduce response time to a crisis. But these successes are often invisible and, as the old adage in security affairs goes, the other side just has to get it right once. India must continue to pay close attention to its internal security capabilities while keeping an eye on what Pakistan is up to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/how-mumbai-changed-india-ht-editorial/story-7Jc6ZJ4aYu2PKK3ndo1PpM.html
26-11-2020||Editorials||The life and legacy of Diego Maradona | HT Editorial||Sport loves heroes. Followers of sport relish being mesmerised by a wiggle of the feet, a flick of the wrist, and a glint in the eyes. We enjoy according greatness and bestowing legendary status. With hyperbole as the fuel that powers sport, we sometimes use these words too lightly. And then, in the middle of this process of being mesmerised by flashes of genius and anointing lofty honorifics, comes a person like Diego Armando Maradona.There are only a few sporting icons who become not the product of a generation but the very definition of it. If Mohammad Ali was a force of nature who coalesced with the Civil Rights movement and the opposition to the Vietnam War to offer a protagonist to 1960s America, Diego Maradona was a phenomenon who became the leading man of the 1980s on the global stage. From his continent to ours, the world could apply him to any context while he stamped individualism over a team sport in a manner than no one else has done, or perhaps will ever do.The key difference between him and other great sporting icons was his ability to elevate, along with his personal legend, the platform itself. If the bedrock of Roger Federer’s greatness comes from his eight Wimbledon titles, the football World Cup became greater when Maradona won it for Argentina in 1986. And through it, Maradona almost single-handedly introduced the joy of sport to a larger world audience at the dawn of the era of live television. Maradona had many flaws, and made several comebacks from the pit of his own personal drugs-and-loneliness-infused hell. He admitted he was always black or white, never grey. Maradona died on Wednesday at 60. But he will forever remain heroic, human, infectious, and eternal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-life-and-legacy-of-diego-maradona-ht-editorial/story-teG8bZFmeX80h4v9a5KlQO.html
