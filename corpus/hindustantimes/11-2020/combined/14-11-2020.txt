14-11-2020||Mumbai||Places of worship in Maharashtra allowed to open from Monday||The Maharashtra government on Saturday gave its nod for the reopening of all religious places from Monday, lifting the Covid-enforced shutdown of eight months. The state also issued standard operating procedure (SOP), including compulsory wearing of masks, no physical offerings or prasad, no group singing or touching idols, among other preventive measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in places of worship.As per the SOP issued by the state government, only those places of worship that are outside the containment zone shall be allowed to reopen. People over age 65 and below 10 years old, people with co-morbidities and pregnant women are advised to stay at home.A statement from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said that Covid-appropriate behaviour, including wearing masks and no crowding, must be strictly maintained when visiting places of worships. All places of worship were closed to the public since lockdown was imposed in March to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.A statement from CMO said, “The people of the state observed discipline during this [Covid] period. That is why the situation in Maharashtra has not gone out of hand as in other states. Maharashtra has always been blessed by saints, Gods, and Goddesses. However, Holi, Ganeshotsav, Navratri and Pandharpur wari (procession) did not take place as a precaution. Not only that, but other religions also observed discipline, such as during Eid and the Mount Mary fair.”The statement added that self-discipline will have to be maintained at these places. “You have to take off your slippers and enter the temple, but don’t forget that a mask is mandatory. Temples will open, other places of worship will open. Only if we follow discipline, then only we and Maharashtra will get God’s blessings.” Meanwhile, Maharashtra reported 4,237 new infections and 105 deaths on Saturday, taking the tally to 1,744,698 and toll to 45,914. Mumbai saw 726 new cases and 16 deaths, taking the tally to 269,133 and the toll to 10,558. Following Mumbai, Pune registered the second-highest number of cases, 522, and 18 deaths, followed by Nashik which saw 423 cases and two deaths. The MMR accounted for 34.86% or 1,477 cases of the new infections. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 2.63%. State’s recovery rate improved to 92.41% after 2,707 patients were reported to have recovered, taking the tally to 16,12,314, according to the health department. Active patients’ tally in the state stands at 85, 503, including 16,185, the highest number of active patients in Pune. The SOP order issued by chief secretary Sanjay Kumar added that individuals must maintain a distance of 6 feet, practice frequent hand washing with soap or sanitizer, compulsory masking, and respiratory etiquette must be followed. The order added that large gatherings and congregation will continue to remain prohibited.The entrance of places of worship, according to the SOP, must have thermal screening and sanitizer dispenser. The state has also called for staggered entry of visitors in places of worship, which must be decided based on the size of the structure, ventilation etc. by the trust/board running the place and the local authorities.Shoes and footwear, preferably, must be kept inside their own vehicles. If needed, it must be kept in a separate slot for each person or family by the person themselves. Touching of idols, statues, holy books is not allowed.It added that with a view of a potential spread of infection, recorded devotional music/song must be played as far as feasible. Choir or group singing is not allowed. No physical offerings like prasad or distribution or sprinkling of holy water to be allowed inside places of worship, the SOP order added. The use of air-conditioner must be between the temperatures of 24 to 30 degree Celsius, while humidity must be in the range of 40-70, intake of fresh air should be as must as possible, the SOP said.The reopening of places of worship had become a major point of friction between the ruling combine and the principal opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). BJP had made several demands seeking reopening of temples and other places of worship after the Centre allowed reopening of religious places in its advisory in September. Maharashtra governor, Bhagat Singh Koshyari, in a stinging letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last month, asked his government to reopen places of worship.Welcoming the decision of the state government BJP leader Pravin Darekar said that the state government acted after the party and religious outfits put pressure on it to reopen religious places. “The government woke up late, but we welcome the decision. The decision came because we kept pressure on the government,” Darekar said in a statement.Although the state has allowed temples to open, district collectorates have been directed to take necessary steps to augment the health infrastructure, anticipating a potential spike after Diwali. “The district administrations have been asked to ramp up the health infrastructure with 10% more bed facilities than they had in September when we witnessed a peak in the cases. Besides it, we have also asked them for aggressive tracking of contacts to keep the spread of the virus under check,” said an official from the health department. The officials also said that after the temple and religious places were allowed to reopen from Monday, the decision about resumption of local trains for all will be taken after assessing the Covid-19 situation. “We had written to the Western and Central Railway two weeks ago, asking them to chalk out the plans for resumption of the local trains for all in non-peak hours. But we are not pushing for immediate resumption as there could be a spike in cases after Diwali. The decision over it may be taken a week after Diwali by reviewing the situation,” an official from Mantralaya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/places-of-worship-in-maharashtra-allowed-to-open-from-monday/story-kUerUL223xCaseFXRHcnyN.html
14-11-2020||Mumbai||Five of Navi Mumbai family killed as bus falls off bridge in Satara||Five members of a Navi Mumbai family of 11, including a three-year-old boy, were killed after their speeding tempo traveller fell off a bridge on Saturday morning, police said. The remaining six and the driver, who was booked, sustained injuries and were recuperating at a hospital. The family was headed to Goa for a vacation and started from Vashi around 9pm. The crash took place on Tarali river bridge, on the outskirts of Umbraj village in Karad, Satara, between 4.30am and 5am, according to the police. “The driver of the vehicle dozed off while on the bridge. Due to this, he ended up hurtling off the bridge 50 feet below,” said AL Gorad, assistant inspector, Umbraj police station. According to the police, after the vehicle crashed, one of the injured occupants called the emergency police helpline. The police traced the call and sent for rescue operations. The five killed are Madhusudhan Nair, 42, his wife Usha, 40, their 23-year-old son Aditya, along with Sajan Nair, 35, and his three-year-old son Aarav, police said. The local traffic police said the place where the crash took place is not a black spot – an accident-prone area. The two-lane bridge is separated by a dividing gap, which looks over the river. Incidentally, a spot a few metres after the bridge ends is prone to crashes, police added. “Such a crash has not taken place on the bridge. Nevertheless, crash barriers have been installed on the side of the roads to prevent crashes. It appears the vehicle, owing to its high speed, crashed through the concrete barrier and off the bridge,” said Asmita Patil, in-charge at Karad traffic police. The driver of the vehicle and six other members of the Nair family sustained injuries in the crash. All of them were said to be recuperating and out of danger. The injured were rushed to Satara civil hospital and the bodies were sent to Karad civil hospital for an autopsy. “We contacted their relatives in Mumbai to inform them about the crash. The relatives are on their way,” said an officer from Satara police. Meanwhile, the police have registered a case of rash driving and causing death due to negligence against the driver, Rinku Gupta, 30. Police said he was sober at the time of the crash. The police sought help from cranes to pull the vehicle out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/five-of-navi-mumbai-family-killed-as-bus-falls-off-bridge-in-satara/story-6eMO6Z9bluZ3PVgnyUt8pO.html
14-11-2020||Mumbai||Exhibition of portrait rangolis at Thane ends today||Portrait rangolis of 24 well-known personalities from various disciplines including sports, politics and freedom fighters have been displayed at Kopri’s Vidyasagar Vidyalaya. These are made by experts who took three to four days to make them using rangoli powder. They are put up for public display till Sunday.This is an annual feature wherein artists from across Maharashtra participate. However, this year it has been restricted to local artists only. Moreover, those visiting have to maintain social-distancing and wear masks to watch the wide display of portrait rangolis.Vikas Gharkar, who made a portrait of legendary cricketer Kapil Dev, said, “This was the first time I attempted Kapil Dev’s portrait. It took me almost four days to focus on the minute nuances. I have been participating in this annual event for the last six to seven years and try to come up with a new portrait every time.”Similarly, Yogesh Bhagane made a portrait of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah with the Rafale planes in the backdrop. “This has been in the news for quite some time now. To get Modi’s and Shah’s facial expressions right was quite a task,” added Bhagane. Art lovers were in awe of these portraits. “To prepare one such portrait is a task and some artists have managed to make two portraits in a single image. That takes a lot of patience. I am in awe of their skill, creativity and talent,” said Anirudha Joshi, 45, a visitor from Kopri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/exhibition-of-portrait-rangolis-at-thane-ends-today/story-Mu729QnRqIhLqxDhIgJ93N.html

Thereafter, pollution levels remained in the “severe” category for three days on the trot.This time, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said that a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post the Diwali.Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, said.V K Soni, the head of the IMD’s environment research centre, said calm winds, smoke from farm fires and firecrackers emissions may push the air quality to the severe zone on Diwali night.  The wind speed is expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly, he said.There will be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, he added.The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said the situation is likely to improve significantly on Sunday.  “Under the influence of a Western Disturbance, isolated rainfall over plains of northwest India and adjoining central India is likely on Sunday. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from East-Southeast direction of Delhi with wind speed up to 20 kmph,” it said.“Generally cloudy sky, light rain, thundershowers accompanied with gusty winds (speed 30-40 kmph) is likely towards afternoon-evening on Sunday,” the central agency said.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying “celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases”.A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel clarified that the direction will apply to all cities and towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November 2019 was in “poor” and above categories.  “At other places, restrictions are optional for the authorities but if there are more stringent measures under orders of the authorities, the same will prevail,” the NGT had said.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had on Wednesday ordered closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17 in view of a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season.It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-turns-severe-on-diwali-imd/story-Yyug1W6LvEtStFD0uXXpAO.html

14-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra celebrates Diwali in toned-down manner amid Covid-19||Diwali, the festival of lights, is being celebrated across Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra on Saturday with fervour, but in a subdued manner under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic.This year, Laxmi Pujan, the main day of Diwali, and Naraka Chaturdashi, are being celebrated on the same day on Saturday.In Maharashtra, families celebrate this day by getting up early in the morning and having an ‘abhyanga snan’ (ritual bath) as per the custom. People light earthen lamps, adorn the balconies with ‘akash kandil’ (sky lantern) and colourful rangoli patterns are drawn at the entrance of houses.Early morning ‘Diwali Pahat’ cultural programmes in major cities across Maharashtra, including Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nashik, have become an integral part of the festival.However, these programmes were missing this year due to the coronavirus outbreak.Nevertheless, some organisations conducted online programmes, like musical events and interviews.Masunda Lake in Thane city and Phadke Road in Dombivli (in Thane district) are famous spots for such programmes, where people gather in large numbers to enjoy the cultural extravaganza. However, such celebrations were cancelled this year due to the pandemic.Even as the Maharashtra government has not banned firecrackers, the Shiv Sena-led Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has announced a ban on the use of crackers and fireworks in the city to curb the spread of coronavirus.The civic body has, however, allowed use of ‘mild firecrackers’ on Laxmi Pujan, saying Mumbaikars can use anar (cracker known for a sparkling display and showers of coloured sparks upwards) and ‘fulzadi’ (sparklers) at their private premises.In a recent review meeting with senior Covid-19 task force members on the preparedness for a possible second wave, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope had said firecrackers could have an adverse effect on lungs.Maharashtra has so far recorded 17,40,461 coronavirus positive cases, while 45,809 people have so far died due to the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-celebrates-diwali-in-toned-down-manner-amid-covid-19/story-y7UygaCUGAsAIiikPnVwjP.html

All places of worship are closed for citizens since a lockdown was imposed in the third week of March to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.The statement by the CMO added that self-discipline will have to be maintained at these places. “Footwear is kept outside the temples, but one must not forget mask will remain compulsory. There should not be any crowding in the places of worship,” the statement added.”The people have maintained discipline in the fight against Covid-19, and therefore the situation in Maharashtra did not go out of hand as it happened in other states. During this time, not just Holi, Ganeshotsav, Navratri, Pandharpur Wari pilgrimage, but Eid, Mount Mary festival etc were also celebrated with discipline… But now on the Deepawali Padwa, the New Year [as per Hindu calender], the state government has decided to reopen all the places of worship,” it added.The reopening of places of worship had become a major point of friction between the ruling combine and the principal opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP had made demands seeking reopening of temples and other places of worship after the Centre allowed reopening of religious places in its advisory in September.

14-11-2020||Pune||Buldhana’s Lonar Lake declared Ramsar site, second for Maharashtra within a year||The Lonar lake in Buldhana district of Maharashtra has been declared as the 41st “Ramsar” site of India. It has effectively become the second Ramsar site in the state. There are 2,412 designated Ramsar sites in the world. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention for the conservation of wetlands was called the ‘Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat’. The convention got its name of Ramsar Convention from the city of Ramsar in Iran where it was signed in 1971 and came into force in 1975. “I’m glad that the Lonar crater is now officially a Ramsar Site. Having seen it for the first time in 2004, it is a sight that captivates everyone. It has its own significance in the world of biodiversity, tourism and geology,” tweeted Aditya Thackeray, environment and tourism minister of Maharashtra. “Inhabiting the site are 160 species of birds including the vulnerable Asian woolly neck (Ciconia episcopus) and common pochard (Aythya ferina), 46 species of reptiles, and 12 species of mammals including the iconic grey wolf (Canis lupus),” reads the announcement by Ramsar Convention. According to the Ramsar Convention, the ecology, botany, zoology, limnology or hydrology of the wetland needs to be considered before including it in the list. The inclusion will ensure added funds and training for the maintenance of the site for the staff and indigenous people. However, ecologist and academic Madhav Gadgil is sceptical about the development. He urged the government to first take steps at the local level failing which international intervention like Ramsar list may not help. “These protections need to be brought to life. For example, UNESCO heritage site Kaas plateau has been made worse after being declared a heritage site. I have never seen even one site which has gained an advantage after being protected by the forest department. At Lonar, the sewage is let into the lake. There are red algae blooms - it is getting spoiled. Tourism is also highly politicised. If we have to fix this then, we must take out the tourist lodges near the heritages sites and prevent sewage from entering the lake. Where is the political will for doing all this? Rivers like Mutha and Bhima have also turned into gutter Gangas. What’s the use of giving international status? Maharashtra and the Central government climate change ministry should take it up seriously,” said Gadgil. “The sites are both threatened by household sewage and urban wastewater and by unsustainable tourism” reads the announcement further. The lake had made news in August when the water in the circular-shaped lake turned pink. The phenomenon was caused by salt-loving Haloarchaea microbes which lead to pigmentation, according to a report by Agharkar Research Institute (ARI) in Pune, an autonomous body under the department of Science and Technology. The Lonar lake was declared as the 41st Ramsar site along with Sur Saroivar or Keetham Lake in Uttar Pradesh. The first site from Maharashtra to enter the list was Nandur Madhameshwar in 2019. Uttar Pradesh has the highest contribution from India to the list with eight and Punjab has the second highest with six sites in the list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/buldhana-s-lonar-lake-declared-ramsar-site-second-for-maharashtra-within-a-year/story-vhomyKcTPrNmbaRL5WgIPN.html

14-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: His bandaged feet||One of his feet is wrapped in plastic — the kind of bag in which the fruit sellers might keep your apples.“It has patti inside,” says rickshaw puller Kalicharan. This evening he is sitting on the rickshaw’s passenger seat, his legs stretched out, both his feet resting on the saddle. Motionless for now, he seems ready to jump up as soon as a customer approaches.Kalicharan explains that he wrapped his bandaged foot in a plastic so that the dressing remains dry, and no street keechar (dirt water) spills over it. He got the feet injured four days ago. “It was about this time in the evening... a customer was lifting his bag when it fell on my foot.”The foot initially didn’t pain much, Kalicharan recalls, but “it was looking very bad, full of blood.” With his rickshaw, he pedaled to a government hospital where he got the injury looked after by a doctor for free. “Nothing was broken, but the bag squashed the maas (flesh).”Later Kalicharan returned home, which is on a pavement. He lives alone. He says he has no friend on the “patri” (pavement) and that night, following the injury, no one inquired about his bandage. “Because none of the people who also sleep there noticed it.” In fact, as always, Kalicharan went to the same dhaba for the same dinner (fish and rice) where, despite being a regular, no cook or waiter enquired about the bandaged foot either. He also didn’t inform his family in the village in Jhansi, UP, “because no one is alive.” Kalicharan had a wife who passed away some years ago. He doesn’t know his age, but he says that he has been a rickshaw puller in Delhi since 1984.“So you have absolutely no one in the world?”—this is the query put to him.Kalicharan shakes his head in acknowledgement.“So you have to take care of your injury on your own?”Kalicharan nods.“Do you ever feel lonely?”Kalicharan shakes his head. This time, he answers by also responding in words. “What would I do with loneliness?”He continues to lounge on the passenger’s seat, both his feet still resting, for now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-his-bandaged-feet/story-QrFchkrn5l1BVIN6GhlYON.html
14-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi adds 7,802 new Covid infections, 91 more fatalities||Delhi on Friday reported 7,802 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), up from 7,053 new infections added the previous day, as the city continued to reel from the effects of a third wave of the disease.The number of new daily deaths dropped marginally on Friday to 91. With 104 deaths reported, Thursday saw the highest number of deaths due to Covid-19. Friday’s toll took the overall deaths in the city to 7,423 on Friday.“When the number of cases rises, there will naturally be an increase in the number of deaths also as we are seeing a Covid-19 mortality rate of 1.48% nationally. Covid-19 beds, especially beds in the intensive care unit (ICU), are nearly full in most hospitals, which means hospitalisations are increasing,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, department of pulmonary medicine, All India institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. The case positivity rate — the percentage of people who test positive among the total number tested, soared to 13.80% on Friday, up from 11.71% the previous day. The daily case positivity rate has also been averaging at least 10% for the past couple of weeks.The positivity rate is representative of the ongoing spread of the infection in the city, and the transmission is thought to be controlled when the positivity rate remains below 5% for two weeks. “As I have observed, there are not only more cases but we are also seeing lightly increased severity in infections these days. That could be one reason why more deaths are taking place,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, respiratory and critical care medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital.“Looks like it may continue like this for a few weeks before the numbers start coming down,” he added.The Delhi high court allowed the state government on Thursday to reserve 80% of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in 33 private hospitals for Covid-19 patients for two weeks. Earlier, the state government had increased a total of 500 beds, including 110 icu beds, in eight of its hospitals.Even with the HC allowing the government to reserve 80% of the total ICU beds, the beds are filling up fast.“Even as we continue to open more and more ICU beds, they are filling up fast. I am getting so many calls every day requesting a bed. And, if you compare to May or June, we are getting sicker patients, even in the wards. If this continues, I don’t know what will happen,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director, department of pulmonology and sleep disorders at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh.To reduce mortality due to the infection, the state government has also ordered all its testing centres to check the patients’ oxygen saturation to prevent deaths from “happy hypoxia”, where a person does not have any apparent breathlessness even as their oxygen saturation drops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-adds-7-802-new-covid-infections-91-more-fatalities/story-UjE2hC9jqTIhvSPDbW8V2I.html

14-11-2020||City||Ludhiana: Cracker sales go up a day before Diwali||After witnessing a lull throughout the week, the cracker market in Ludhiana’s Dana Mandi saw a huge rush on Friday, a day before Diwali. The wholesale dealers stated that though the footfall was comparatively lower than the previous years, they are still hopeful of clearing the stock by Saturday.A visit to the market on Friday afternoon revealed that though a large number of customers had turned up to make last-minute purchases, most of them preferred to buy crackers in small quantities. Many were also seen flouting distancing norms and carelessly roaming around without masks.Pradeep Gupta, president of Dana Mandi Cracker Association, said, “Due to the pandemic, people’s buying capacity is lower this year but they are still keen on buying at least a few crackers.” said Gupta. He added that though they have stocked up green crackers too, these are finding only a few takers.The usual favourites, including fuljhadi (sparklers), chakri and anar (fountain), rockets and bombs, remained in big demand this year too. Many people were also seen purchasing sky lanterns of vibrant colours. Kapil Malik, a customer, said, “I have bought crackers in small quantities as my children are very fond of these. In view of the severe air pollution, I decided not to purchase anar this time.”Sale at 8 earmarked spots In all, 41 vendors have been allowed to sell crackers at eight earmarked sites in the district. At Dana Mandi in Salem Tabri, the administration had given permission to 13 dealers to set up their firecracker stalls.Green-crackers rider doesn’t go well with tradersThe National Green Tribunal (NGT) and state government’s last-minute announcement to allow only green crackers to be burst for two hours this Diwali has not gone down well with the dealers. They say that the announcement should have come at least three months ago, when the production was yet to start. A dealer requesting anonymity, said, “This time, I invested Rs 2 lakh on crackers. But the state government announced it much later that only green crackers will be allowed, leaving us high and dry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-cracker-sales-go-up-a-day-before-diwali/story-rbeUJ9S2BPO9T8nF3KPLRK.html
14-11-2020||City||Ludhiana advocate helps slum kids dispel the darkness of digital illiteracy||For 10-year-old Munni and several other slum children in the city, this Diwali marks their passage from the darkness of a digital divide to the light of education.Having never touched a computer before, some 200-odd slum children in the city are now able to independently use basic computer applications, such as Paint and MS Word, all thanks to a city-based advocate, Hariom Jindal.Jindal, who runs a school for slum children, had introduced computer classes for the students last month, when the school reopened for the first time after the lockdown. “In this day and age, computer literacy is very important. Our idea is to provide basic computer education to these children so that they can find themselves a good job, and don’t suffer the plight of their parents,” says Jindal.Many of these kids used to beg on streets or go for rag-picking to make a living, but now they have pledged not to accept any donations. “People used to come and donate food, sweets and crackers in the slums every year. But this year, we won’t accept any of it,” says Seema, 13, one of the students at Jindal’s school.She proudly reveals that though she started taking the computer lessons only a week ago, she is already adept at Paint. Her friend Munni, 10, adds, “I am very excited and grateful to be receiving these lessons. I want to grow up and become a teacher so that I can teach other children like me.” Jindal says that he tells his students that free food and donations only make them dependent on others. “Only education can make one completely independent and self-reliant,” he says. Won’t accept donations, free food, say slum kidsJust like students at Jindal’s school, 3,200 other slum children, studying at a school run by Nobel Foundation, have pledged to not accept any free food, firecrackers or sweets.Rajinder Sharma, head of the Nobel Foundation, says that 99% of the slum kids don’t accept such donations. Sunny, 12, a student of the school says, “Every year, people come in big cars and offer us food and sweets. We turn them down and our reaction surprises them. We ask them to help us in our education instead of offering us free goodies.”Rekha, his classmate, says, “We won’t make a beeline in front of these cars this time. Instead, we will be making rangolis, applying mehendi and taking part in online competitions this Diwali.” Ludhiana police bring a smile to kids, masks for safety The Ludhiana Police and the Rotary Club of Ludhiana have joined hands this Diwali to bring a smile on children’s faces and also ensuring that they stay safe amid the pandemic.On Friday, the police visited the slums near Pataka Market, on Hambran Road, and distributed masks, chocolate packets and stationery items such as pencil box, colours, colouring books and notebooks among children. Joint commissioner of police Bhagirath Singh Meena, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, special branch) Rupinder Kaur, ADCP Sameer Verma, Rotary Club zonal president Amanpreet Singh and advocate Rajinder Babbar were among those who visited the slums as part of this programme. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal, in a special message, said, “This festive season, we stand with slum children to help them celebrate a Happy and Covid-free Diwali.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-advocate-helps-slum-kids-dispel-the-darkness-of-digital-illiteracy/story-lwqg9uYp5sBWWAmOEV3gnN.html

14-11-2020||Chandigarh||Manesar land case: Multiple legal opinions interpreting SC directions add to complications||Multiple pieces of legal opinions tendered by the Haryana advocate general’s office with regards to the interpretation of the “deemed award” ordered by the Supreme Court in the Manesar land case seems to have complicated the matter. The case will be heard by the top court on November 17. The apex court had last month asked the Haryana government to furnish names of officials who passed orders for excluding land parcels from the apex court-ordered “deemed award” in Gurugram’s Manesar. These land parcels were apparently excluded on account of execution of collaboration agreements between landowners and developers after August 27, 2004, the day a Section 4 notification of the Land Acquisition Act was issued to acquire the land. The SC has also sought to know the present status of development at the site with pictures. Haryana seeking clarification The SC is hearing a prayer seeking clarification whether its 2018 judgment would also cover land parcels purchased prior to the date of Section 4 notification on August 27, 2004, but transferred by the landholders between August 27, 2004 and January 29, 2010 by way of collaboration agreements in favour of other parties and whether they will form part of the “deemed award”. The opinionsThe first legal opinion on May 2018 said that out of 912 acres, land parcels transferred by the landowners between August 27, 2004 and January 29, 2010 would come under the “deemed award”. Based on this opinion, the state government in November 2018 passed “deemed award” for about 420 acres. The state government, however, belatedly realised that there were certain land parcels where landowners collaborated with builders to get licences. Also, there were land parcels which had been released by a ministers’ committee after Section 6 notification. Thus, a second opinion was sought. The legal opinion of December 2018 said the land which was included in Section 6 declaration would fall within the award deemed to have been passed on August 26, 2007. A third opinion of March 2019 reiterated the December 2018 opinion. A fourth opinion was sought after the Gurugram land acquisition collector demanded clarification with respect to passing of award for the balance land. The legal opinion tendered by the advocate general’s office in July 2020 said that passing the award for balance land which has not been transferred by landholders during August 27, 2004 to January 29, 2010 would be violative of the apex court judgment. The award is to be announced for land where collaboration agreements were entered between August 27, 2004 and January 29, 2010. The “deemed award” is to be announced qua the land which was released after Section 6 notification on the recommendation of ministers’ committee. However, it is to be considered that if any land holding which was released but not transferred between August 27, 2004 and January 29, 2010 is to be excluded from the “deemed award” and the rest is to be included, the AG’s opinion said. ‘Our land outside the scope of SC order’ The SC had last month restrained three real estate developers who claimed that their land was outside the scope of apex court’s orders and landowners from creating fresh third-party rights on 268 acres which was once sought to be acquired for creating an industrial township in Manesar in Gurugram, but was dropped from the acquisition by the Congress regime in 2007. The 268 acres were a part of the 688 acres being acquired for public purpose and dropped during the Congress rule. Box: What has happened so far A CBI investigation was ordered in 2015 and the decision to drop acquisition proceedings of 688 acres in Manesar and around was set aside by the Supreme Court in 2018. Award for this land deemed to have been passed on August 26, 2007. The apex court had ruled that 688 acres will vest in the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation and all licences granted in respect of lands covered by the “deemed award” of August 26, 2007 will stand transferred to HSIIDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/manesar-land-case-multiple-legal-opinions-interpreting-sc-directions-add-to-complications/story-MEuc26Etz1Zkc1rdeMqWXP.html
14-11-2020||Chandigarh||Repair cost of old govt houses in Chandigarh to go up: NITTTR report||A preliminary report submitted by the National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research (NITTTR) has told the Chandigarh administration that the repair cost of old government houses will go up in the coming years. Hence, it should consider reconstruction in a phased manner.The preliminary report was sought by UT on the structural stability of 1,400 houses in Sector 22, Sector 7 and Sector 19, but the report is about such accommodations in Sector 22. The report was commissioned last year and submitted in March this year.“These houses are old and require regular and special maintenance. And the costs may rise in the coming years. In view of this, the department may look into reconstruction of these houses in a phased manner,” the report says.NITTTR also said that the final report in respect to other places will get delayed as due to the pandemic, they were not being allowed to enter the premises by residents.Part of compliance report submitted to HCThe report is part of a compliance report submitted this week in Punjab and Haryana high court by the administration as part of steps being undertaken to increase housing for employees in the city. The proceedings for the same are being monitored by the high court since 2017.The UT’s status report also mentions that high-rise buildings in Sectors 7 and 22 cannot be constructed since these are part of a dozen odd sectors where under the first phase reutilisation of government housing is being considered. Other sectors are 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20, 23, 24, 27, 28 and 29.The status report also mentions that redensification should not be carried out since it is a complex issue and will create a lot of problems. “It will put pressure on the existing infrastructure—drinking water, drainage system, parking, schools, colleges, hospitals etc. So any work related to redensification would violate the recommendation of the Chandigarh Master Plan 2031,” a document in the report reads. To the high court suggestion that UT should aim at 5,000 houses in multi-storey mode, UT said a final decision will be taken after a complete report from NITTTR, adding that 192 houses were being constructed for police personnel, besides 144 and 216 under two other categories. All these three projects are in Dhanas.The UT’s report also said that multi-storey towers were coming up in the IT park, which will also cater to the housing needs of employees. UT has told the court that the houses to be offered for allotment would be photographed and photos uploaded on a portal so that those interested did not have to physically visit the place. As for renovation, 46 agencies had been roped in for maintenance work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/repair-cost-of-old-govt-houses-in-chandigarh-to-go-up-nitttr-report/story-KfIANo2XxcH91YdR5UIcdK.html

Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan has marked a magisterial probe to investigate the presence of inflammable material at the dhaba and fuel theft from the tanker to sub-divisional magistrate Kuldeep Bawa, who will submit a report in a week. The deceased have been identified as Jaswinder Singh, 35, owner of Rama Punjabi dhaba, and his relatives, Babloo, 20, and Vikram kumar. Another victim, Sandeep Kumar, suffered 80% burns and is admitted at PGIMER, Chandigarh.“The dhaba owner and his staff used to steal fuel from oil tankers in connivance with the drivers and store it in drums in the eatery’s basement,” said Aashika Jain, additional district magistrate (ADM).On Friday, they were again taking out fuel from a tanker when there was a spark in the pump, which caused a blast due to the petrol and diesel drums stored in the basement. Jaswinder and Vikram were killed on the spot, while Babloo succumbed to his injuries at GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh. The unidentified tanker driver fled the scene as he heard the explosion.Two fire tenders were rushed to the spot and the dhaba was sealed. The blast’s impact caused cracks in the building. An evaluation of the structural safety has been ordered.While dousing the flames, Dera Bassi fire station officer Pardeep Kumar Rana suffered injuries and was admitted to the local civil hospital. Senior superintendent of police Satinder Singh said they had booked the deceased dhaba owner and the tanker driver under Sections 304 (causing death by negligence), 379 (theft), 420 (cheating) and 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of the Indian Penal Code.Deceased dhaba owner was arrested last yearIn July last year, police had registered a case against Jaswinder for illegally storing 525 litres of petrol and 630 litres of diesel in his dhaba’s basement. ADM Jain said an inspection drive will be carried out at all dhabas in the area to check fuel theft. “Oil smuggling is common in districts of Punjab bordering Chandigarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir due to the price difference. We have for long been informing the Punjab government about this,” said Ashwinder Mongia, president, Mohali District Petroleum Dealers Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/blast-at-lalru-dhaba-during-fuel-theft-kills-three/story-QNmkJQFYCNhW5kTwnHhQ9L.html

Our teams are inspecting the markets to keep a check.”DC Ashok Kumar Sharma said as per the orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), there was a complete ban on crackers in the district and he appealed to the citizens to help the administration by following the orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ambala-police-seize-8-sacks-of-illegal-crackers-increase-vigil/story-IOEaLXswZ0eLwdPZn8jm3K.html

Even SSP Mohali Satinder Singh reached the spot and pacified the protesters, assuring them of an early solution.Harvinder Kumar, president of the Sanitation Employees Union, who was sitting on a dharna outside the council office, said that many employees of the council were working on contract basis and were not being paid by the contractor, that too in the festive season.Kumar said that when he complained to the council officials, instead of supporting the employees, they sided with the contractor, which disturbed him and he decided to stage a protest in front of the council office.When contacted, EO Jagjit Singh said the council had nothing to do with the salaries, which the contractor had to pay. Regarding the throwing of garbage, we will take action against the contractor, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/non-payment-of-salaries-contractual-sanitation-workers-stage-protest-throw-garbage-outside-mc-official-s-office-in-dera-bassi/story-Ucs4Jp5iKNN3sXUvFvPQSJ.html
14-11-2020||Mumbai||BJP questions land deals in Maharashtra; Shiv Sena promises fitting reply||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), stepping up its attack on ally-turned-rival Shiv Sena, on Friday alleged that there are irregularities in various land deals by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which the latter heads. The Sena, rubbishing all the allegations, said that a fitting reply will be given to the BJP leaders making these claims after Diwali and that they should be ready to face the “consequences”. While one of the alleged deals includes a 7-acre land proposed to be acquired by the BMC for a 5,000-bed hospital in Mulund, the other is pertaining to a land at Dahisar. The party also claimed that the mayor has illegally possessed some flats of a slum rehabilitation project (SRA). Apart from these allegations, the BJP said also raised questions over a land purchased by Rashmi Thackeray, the wife of chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and Manisha Waikar, the wife of Sena legislator Ravindra Waikar, from the late interior designer Anvay Naik, who died of suicide in 2018. The BJP has also approached the Lokayukta, urging an inquiry into the deals pertaining to the land parcels in Mulund and Dahisar. According to Somaiya, the process to acquire the land at Mulund for the infectious diseases hospital moved at a “suspicious pace” for the “benefit” of a particular builder. He alleged that the cost of the land is around Rs3,000 crore and it was proposed to be acquired without any scrutiny, with the sole intention of “favouring’ the builder who owns it. The estimated cost of the construction of proposed hospital is Rs12,000 crore. Somaiya said that after his petition to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for action, he approached the Lokayukta and he has been assured that the due process for an inquiry has begun. The BMC has denied any wrongdoing in the matter. “We floated an expression of interest (EoI) and had received proposals over it. We have not purchased any land parcel yet. After going through technicalities, the [BMC] commissioner wrote to state government to take up the project,” a senior BMC official. In another allegation, Somaiya said that a 9-acre land in Dahisar was purchased by BMC for Rs349 crore. He alleged that the civic body made the deal with a private builder last year on November 29, a day after Thackeray was sworn-in as the CM. “The builder purchased the land in 2010 for a mere Rs2.55 crore. The land parcel has various reservations including a garden and a road that’s encroached upon. Three former consecutive commissioners struck down the proposal to buy the land from Nishalp Reality. But the BMC, under pressure from Thackerays, purchased it for Rs349. The builder has now demanded Rs550 crore more claiming that the earlier valuation was faulty,” said Somaiya. Meanwhile, Somaiya also produced nine more 7/12 extracts in the land purchase transaction of the 9.35-acre Raigad land by Rashmi Thackeray and Manisha Waikar. According to Somaiya, Rashmi Thackeray and Manisha Waikar jointly purchased the land in Korlai village in March 2014 through 30 land transactions. “Rashmi had 40 land transactions in total, of which 30 are for the land owned by Naik. The land is not fit for agriculture as mentioned in the records and hence the Thackerays should clarify what was the purpose behind purchasing the land, which is close to the sea. They should also reveal if they had any business partnership with Naiks,” he said. A spokesperson representing Thackeray family said that the Sena leaders have been authorised to speak on the issues. Refuting the allegations, the Sena said the BJP was attempting to change the direction of the probe into Naik’s suicide. Party’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut dared Somaiya to produce evidence on the land deals between the Thackerays and the Naiks. Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Raut referred to BJP as “shethji’s party (a party of the wealthy)” and called Somaiya a “vyapari (trader)”. “The spokespersons of the shethji party are not ready to speak about a Marathi woman who lost her husband. She and her daughter are crying for justice and when we are trying to ensure that they get justice, these people are making allegations to divert the direction of the probe into the suicide,” Raut said. He added that the BJP wants to protect the three-accused, including Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, in Naik’s abetment to suicide case. “Shethji’s party wants to protect the accused,” he said referring to Goswami and two others. The Sena leader in no uncertain terms warned Somaiya to stop levelling allegations without evidence. “This is a legal deal. Nothing will be proven [in these allegations]. This deal was finalised by a Marathi manoos, does it prick his eyes? Somaiya claims 21 deals, but show me at least five deals. This is a warning to him.” Responding to the demand for a probe by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) into the alleged land deals, Raut hit back and said, “Why only ED...let there be a probe by the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation). Go to Interpol, FBI, KGB, Interpol and the United Nations.” Meanwhile, Ravindra Waikar said, “Somaiya should give proof of the 30 transactions he has been talking about. We have been saying that the land transactions were revealed on all platforms including income tax returns and elections affidavits, from time-to-time. His allegations are baseless and we are ready to face any inquiry.” Somaiya also accused Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar of illegally possessing a few flats of a slum rehabilitation (SRA) project in Worli. He filed a petition at Bombay high court over the issue and said that the hearing is expected to take place after Diwali. “Pednekar set-up offices of a company owned by her relatives in the tenements allotted to the original tenants at Gomata Janata Society in Worli. The SRA tenements are neither allowed to be used for commercial purposes nor can be transferred. I have moved the court against the mayor,” he said. HT tried contacting the mayor but her phone was switched off. Maharashtra transport minister and Sena leader Anil Parab said that Somaiya must be “prepared to face the Sena’s allegations too.” He is known for making baseless allegations and his track record is sufficient to prove this. He has been given the responsibility [by his party] with the task of targeting us. Let him complete his series of allegations. We will respond after Diwali. But he too should be prepared to face our allegations against him.” The attack on the Thackerays and the Shiv Sena by the BJP is one of the several attempts in the past 11 months after the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) led by Thackeray came to the power. In August, BJP leaders targeted Thackeray scion and Maharashtra cabinet minister Aaditya by alleging his involvement in the Sushant Singh Rajput (SSR) death case. The MVA government was also accused of inept handling by the Mumbai Police during the probe into the actor’s death case, which now the CBI has taken over. Prior to that, in April the BJP attacked the state government and held it responsible after two seers and their driver were lynched by a mob at Gadhchinchale village in Palghar. The BJP had alleged mishandling of the case by the police that led to the killing of the three men. BJP has also been aggressively targeting MVA and its other two ruling parties, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party) over various issues, including handling of agriculture distress, the Covid-19 situation in the state and the crimes against women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-questions-land-deals-in-maharashtra-shiv-sena-promises-fitting-reply/story-GKnuSQDSbdLH337CTjDVEP.html
14-11-2020||Chandigarh||Garbage not being collected from houses of those in quarantine, say Chandigarh residents||Many Covid-19 patients, currently quarantined in their homes, have been left in the lurch with no garbage collectors from the municipal corporation (MC) coming to collect it from their homes.While regular door-to-door collectors have been directed not to collect the “potentially infectious garbage”, it is still the duty of the MC to collect the same from the patients’ houses. But many people have complained that since they were quarantined, nobody from the MC had turned up.“Against the tall claims of the MC and the administration of caring for Covid-19 patients, this is the reality. While we struggle with the disease, the MC has failed to even lift the daily garbage, which is lying in our houses for more than a week now,” said a resident of Sector 51, who along with his wife and son, has been directed to be home quarantined till November 20.Heaps of garbage are getting collected at people’s houses as they themselves can’t go out and nobody can come in their houses except for MC officials. “We are collecting garbage in polythene bags and cardboard boxes, but we have run out of options. It has been 14 days since we were quarantined and the garbage has not been collected,” said a resident of Sector 30.With no help coming from MC, some families had to seek help from the health department for removal of the garbage. “On one of the regular calls from the health department, we had to complain to them about the lack of garbage collection. They intervened and then somebody from the MC came to collect the garbage,” said a resident of Sector 38W.When contacted, Dr Amritpal Singh, MOH, said, “We are regularly collecting garbage from houses of Covid-19 patients. There can be some cases where we may have missed due to lack of information with our department. We will check and ensure that garbage is collected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/garbage-not-being-collected-from-houses-of-those-in-quarantine-say-chandigarh-residents/story-UY0FlJTEvplcTdYcXGHoPO.html
14-11-2020||Chandigarh||Covid cases continue to surge for second consecutive week in Chandigarh||Incidence of coronavirus infection continues to rise in Chandigarh for the second consecutive week with the Union Territory reporting 749 more cases last week (November 6 to 12) as compared to the preceding week.As many as 502 infections were reported between October 30 and November 5.UT health officials attributed the increase to people not adhering to safety norms by intermingling in crowds, majorly in market areas, and extensive movement due to festivals.The surge in cases is also coupled with an increase in the number of fatalities, as per official records. Last week, 15 deaths were reported as compared to four a week before. The fatality rate has, however, been around 1.5%-1.6% in the last one month.“Enforcing measures like social distancing and wearing masks in public is not only the onus of the administration, residents should also be more sensitive and adhere to norms when the threat of extensive spread is looming large. Inter-state movement has also increased mostly from Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, where the spread is witnessing an upward trend. All this is contributing to the surge, however, the numbers are not alarming,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department.The number of active cases increased to 1,002 on Thursday; they had dropped to 593 on November 2 after the peak of 3,171 cases on September 16.“As active cases grow, the number of fatalities also increases. The number of recoveries are less than new cases being reported in the last 11 days, thus the Sector-48 Covid hospital has been reopened again,” health officials said.The testing level as well as the positivity rate have increased gradually in the last four months. The positivity rate in the last week touched 9% against 7.1% a week before. Testing in UT in the last two months has also been increased by making rapid tests available in market areas and in dispensaries, and with random checking of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-cases-continue-to-surge-for-second-consecutive-week-in-chandigarh/story-qrQzQmUCSTpVZjcMIzmv5M.html
14-11-2020||Mumbai||Self-discipline real weapon, says Navi Mumbai civic chief ahead of Diwali||Even as Navi Mumbai has seen a huge dip in Covid positive cases, the civic commissioner has appealed to people to celebrate the festival with utmost care.Abhijit Bangar, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation commissioner, said that if the city faces another wave, it could be more fatal.“All have been under restrictions since the last nine months. The per-day active cases have gone down drastically. Some of the Covid centres have also been shut due to lack of patients. It doesn’t mean that the virus has disappeared. The danger on each one of us is still there. While visiting the market, people are seen in a festive mood. Each one of us has to keep in mind that even while enjoying a festival, the guidelines need to be followed. Masks have to be worn always and social-distancing has to be maintained,” Bangar said.Bangar insisted that self-discipline is the biggest feature to fight the pandemic. “With every ‘Mission Begin Again’ notification, we are easing on some or the other restriction. People need to understand that one small mistake can lead them to travel backwards towards the restrictions again. The other countries are prime examples of how a second or third wave is much more disastrous than the first. Be it any festival, self-discipline in the celebrations is a must,” Bangar added.The civic body was to follow the state government norms for celebrating Diwali but after National Green Tribunal (NGT) regulations over the celebration, the city decided to ban the sale of the fire crackers.NGT has enforced a ban in cities and towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November (according to available data from last year) has dropped below the ‘poor’ category.“As per the notification of NGT, Navi Mumbai falls under this category and hence we decided to not give permission to anyone to sell fire crackers. Since there is no sale, there should not be any bursting of crackers as well. If anyone is found bursting, the law enforcement agency would look at the action to be taken,” Bangar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/self-discipline-real-weapon-says-navi-mumbai-civic-chief-ahead-of-diwali/story-s4ixckMfAq0XFRQGpXg6jL.html
14-11-2020||Mumbai||Crowd management the key for Thane civic body this Diwali||The Thane Municipal Corporation has set up a team to ensure crowd management in Thane market during the festival. Moreover, mobile testing vehicles for Covid are also set up at various locations in aid of those who come for shopping.Naupada area is known for its Diwali fervour and many locals come over for shopping along the streets of Ram Maruti Road. Keeping this in mind, the shopkeepers have also implemented various precautionary measures and strict social-distancing norms.Rasik Chedda, chairman, Ram Maruti Road Shopkeepers Association, said, “Every shop has a sanitizer at the entrance. Only a limited number of people are allowed to enter these shops at a time. However, the shopkeepers are responsible for any crowd gathering outside the shops as well. All social-distancing norms have been shared with the shopkeepers and masks are compulsory for those inside the shops as well as the customers.”The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) is making time-to-time announcements across the market area to create awareness regarding social-distancing norms, lesser crowd and the need to wear mask at all times.“If there are any complaints related to crowd management, we will send a team to disperse the crowd gathered at the market areas. Moreover, our mobile Covid testing units set up inside the Thane Municipal Transport buses are also active in these areas keeping in mind the festive shopping crowd. Currently, the situation in Thane city is very much under control,” said Vipin Sharma, TMC commissioner.Unlike previously, the streets in Naupada are not decked up for the festive season. Neither was any special cleaning work initiated by the corporation.“We already had started a sanitization drive wherein each ward had to focus on the cleanliness within their precincts. Various visits and checks were made to ensure that the cleanliness drive was implemented and followed across the city. However, apart from that no special cleaning or lighting was done for Diwali as they have been done in the previous years in Thane as the pandemic is still prevailing,” said a senior officer from TMC.Shoppers do not find Thane markets having the same festive charm like the previous years, “Although shops have reopened and well lit up, the decorations and festive mood across the city are missing. The shopping crowd is back on the streets but everything seems a bit low key with so many rules to be followed. Most shops are ensuring that only few customers visit them to maintain social-distancing rules,” said Kanchana Sinha, 44, resident of Teen Hath Naka, Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/crowd-management-the-key-for-thane-civic-body-this-diwali/story-S74WzI5pWQepueKouTyDGL.html
14-11-2020||Chandigarh||Automobile sales zoom in Chandigarh, jewellery loses lustre during Dhanteras||A rare astrological occurrence with the festival of Dhanteras – considered auspicious for buying precious metals – falling over two days brought cheer to automobile dealers. About 405 vehicles were sold in the city between Thursday and Friday, shows data available with the UT Registration and Licensing Authority (RLA) and the UT State Transport Authority (STA). Till 5 pm on Friday, 261 motorcycles, 143 cars and one auto rickshaw were sold and registered at the point of purchase as per records. The number of those preferring registrations later is almost negligible, say auto dealers. “After the lockdown people are back in the market for automobiles. The sales, however, aren’t as good as 2019, with those of premium brands such as BMW and Mercedes on the lower side,” says Ronny Hoon, president of the Federation of Chandigarh Regional Automobile Dealers. People prefer value for money, he addsHoon, who runs a Hyundai dealership, says people had brought forward or postponed vehicle delivery dates for Dhanteras with many pre-booking the i20 hatchback. Hoon, who also owns a Hero dealership, said the brand’s motorcycles followed a similar trend.Nitin Mehan, who owns the Maruti Suzuki dealership Autopace Chandigarh, says the government’s stimulus to employees for Diwali resulted in many of them turning up during Dhanteras for buys. Sales actually improved for him this year by around 20%, with the Swift and Alto hatchbacks doing well this Dhanteras.Dull scenario Meanwhile, jewellery sales remained dull during Dhanteras. “The response of people was lukewarm as compared to last year,” says Vinod Talwar, president, Jewellers Association Chandigarh.“ This year the price of 24 carat gold at Rs 53,000 per 10 grams was 40% higher compared to last year, which is why people came in but did not pick up anything. Silver at Rs 660 per 10 grams was also higher than last year but had more takers. Coins and religious idols made of silver, however, had many takers,” he addedRajeev Sahdev, president, Chandigarh Jewellers Association, added that the Covid effect led to decrease in sales No complaints of traffic congestionEven as the festive fervour led to a rush in markets, the traffic police received only two complaints of traffic congestion this year on the traffic helpline 1073, as compared to 51 calls last year. Speaking about this, officiating senior superintendent of police (SSP, Traffic) Manoj Kumar Meena said, “This year the deployment was increased and specific plans were prepared for each market. These were also uploaded online for people to see.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/automobile-sales-zoom-in-chandigarh-jewellery-loses-lustre-during-dhanteras/story-DfWQKcuEQvDyvXK7wzDv0L.html
14-11-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: Happy Diwali, go for peace not pollution, care not crackers||Stay away from crowded placesYes, festivities bring joy and excitement, but we should not forget that Covid-19 has not been vanquished. So, to prioritise our safety and that of our loved ones, let us have virtual celebrations. Let us meet and greet friends and family members through video and phone calls or by using social media apps. A namaste is always preferable in these times to a hug or a handshake. Avoid eating out or ordering takeouts and cook tasty food at home. Make sure your diet contains vitamin C, omega 3 fatty acids and other high nutritional foods to increase immunity levels. And if you are going out, don’t forget your masks. Also, do not use a sanitiser while lighting diyas and candles as the alcohol in it is inflammable. Avoid crackers. Puneet AggarwalGo green with a vengeanceThere is a great risk of a surge in Covid cases because of the rush in markets, so the best thing to do would be to celebrate a green Diwali this year by lighting earthen oil lamps and not bursting crackers. People must also as far as possible not venture out of their homes to avoid getting infected.Rajinder Parshad Donate to the poorWe can light diyas, make rangolis and distribute sweets among friends and family. Donate clothes, masks and sanitisers to the poor so that they can keep themselves as well as their families safe. We should clean not only our houses but our surroundings too. We should pledge to spread happiness, not pollution and do what we can for the needy as their sufferings have been greater than ours during the pandemic. Ishita NaraHeavy fines please for bursting crackersDiwali should be celebrated by lighting up homes, common areas such as parks and greeting our near and dear ones. Sweets should be made at home as the ones available in the market are often not made with pure ingredients. Heavy penalties should be imposed on persons violating the cracker ban. Whatever the occasion, be it religious or political, no crackers be allowed at any time from now on. Inderjit Singh Sidhu, MohaliStay at home, keep things simpleEvery individual is under the threat of coronavirus while smog is engulfing our lives too. It’s a welcome move to ban crackers but it should have come earlier. Simple celebrations will suffice this year by exchange of gifts and organising of indoor games with the family. This coronavirus phase has united every family so it’s high time we preserved our traditions by cleaning up our surroundings and distributing extra stuff among the needy. A small amateur show can be organised for family too. Aman KaurHelp those in needCovid-19 has made life miserable for a lot of people who have lost their jobs or faced salary cuts. In India, there is a big gap between the rich and poor and because of inflation the poor do not have a lot of money in their hands. The true spirit of Diwali means helping those who need it. SK Khosla, ChandigarhBecome Santa Claus this DiwaliThis Diwali we must perform our social responsibility of not polluting the environment and let the ring of laughter replace loud crackers. It is important to follow the norms set to fight the pandemic to keep the spirit of the festival alive. Use biodegradable ingredients such as rice powder, colourful grains, turmeric, and flowers for rangoli and replace electrical lamps with clay diyas. We must try utilising old utensils or fabrics to make interesting DIY decorations and choose fabric or recycled paper for wrapping gifts. Make a healthy switch to home made goodies and opt for handcrafted gifts, personalised cards or gift plants and terrariums. We can be the Santa Claus this Diwali and light up many lives by sharing clothes, sweets or books and experience the biggest joy by celebrating the festival, which marks the victory of good versus evil, in its true sense . Komal Singh, ChandigarhStrive to be better each dayThe beauty of life is that it can be enjoyed every moment with a deep sense of gratitude that leads to contentment and joy. However, in this day and age, our hearts could be filled with negative emotions, insecurity and negative thoughts. This Diwali let us light the dazzling diyas of faith and positivity by making ourselves better persons by adopting a healthy lifestyle, learning and growing through books. Diyas should also be lit to express gratitude for those who gave up their today for us, and with love and support to those who lost their loved ones. Let’s burn the crackers of hatred, insecurity and selfishness and replace it with love and harmony. Aditi MalhotraAvoid crowdsThe surge in Covid cases after a lull necessitates strict observation of safety rules viz use of mask,gloves and sanitisers and avoiding crowded places to maintain social distance. We need self-restraint to celebrate the festival safely and should avoid crowds and sensitise others too to do so. In our family we have decided to gift plants to friends. One of our rituals annually is to provide woollen clothes and blankets to the lepers’ home and meals/sweets at an orphanage. No one should make personal visits. Conveying good wishes to loved ones by phone or e-mail will be good enough. Usha Verma, ChandigarhHelp small craftsmenLet’s encourage people to use earthen diyas and candles instead of electrical lighting to illuminate homes to provide some financial help to small craftsmen and to save energy. Instead of sweets, exchange saplings and books as Diwali gifts. Above all, try to help at least one needy person. Dr Sukhdev Singh Minhas, MohaliSpend time with the elderlyThe best way to celebrate Diwali this year is to spend time with our loved ones, especially the elderly, just being together as a family and thanking God for the life he has given us. Instead of spending money on oneself it’s important to help the less fortunate and in providing food to the needy. All of us should light diyas and pray for harmony, peace, prosperity and happiness for all and take a pledge to help those who need it. It’s important that people take social responsibility in their own individual capacity to be safe and follow social distancing norms. Samita KaurRWAs have to step inThe effort to sensitise people about the ill-effects of crackers should continue throughout the year. In educational institutions, seminars and debates should be organised to impress upon the youngsters the urgent need to shun crackers. Resident welfare associations must play a responsible role in ensuring a complete check on cracker burning in their areas, as besides creating pollution, these cause burn injuries. SS Arora, MohaliDon’t increase burden on hospitalsMedical experts have been warning us to avoid social gatherings and bursting of crackers, which can lead to a manifold rise in the number of Covid infections, increasing the burden on limited medical facilities in the country. Considering the extraordinary times we are living in, it is better to take medical advice as a matter of faith, avoid crowded places, take all precautionary measures to save ourselves and others and strictly follow the restrictions imposed by the authorities on crackers in their respective areas. One should celebrate Diwali at home with the family, put up lights, do pooja and make rangolis. Let the dark clouds prevailing across the globe be blown away and peace and wellness prevail. Suresh Verma, ChandigarhStay put at homeFirst of all, safety guidelines, ie face masks and sanitisers should be used and social distancing followed. People should light up their homes and clean their houses, decorating them with flowers and toys, earthen lamps and candles. No one should be rushing to the markets. Families should ensure they sit together to worship the goddess Lakshmi and pray for the good health, wealth and happiness of all. And yes, no gambling please. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, Mohali Time for introspectionDiwali should be celebrated without inflicting any harm upon our fellow humans, birds, animals and the environment. Let Diwali be an occasion for introspection. Any bursting of firecrackers is synonymous with vulgar display of affluence. Heavens will not fall if firecrackers are not burst. Vote-bank compromises today must not be to the detriment of the coming generations. Let us also make a difference to those for whom even two square meals a day is a feast. Make their Diwali memorable by offering them food and gifts besides clothes to face the winter season. Lalit Bharadwaj, Panchkula We have a lot to be thankful forI think people should take it as a blessing if they are fit and fine and with their families on this day. They should not take the risk of visiting crowded areas.Wish your loved ones a Happy Diwali on phone or through social media apps. Stay at home, don’t burst firecrackers, don’t buy sweets from the market and above all avoid being a part of a large gathering. Suman Kansal, Panchkula Light diyas of positivityThe best way to celebrate Diwali is to not just be happy but also to spread happiness, not only among humans but nature too. I want my Diwali to be lit up by the positivity of diyas, to explore my creativity through colourful rangolis and have my family come together and make new and positive memories. I also want to light up every corner of my home. In this current situation, we all should understand that firecrackers need to be avoided as doing so would mean increased risk of Covid-19. Shefali Aswal, Chandigarh Help slum childrenLet’s say no to firecrackers and instead bring joy to the lives of slum children by sending them gifts that they could use instead of spending money on sweets and cards for friends and relatives who are well off. Clothing and items of daily needs would help.Col TBS Bedi (retd), MohaliSpend money for a good causeMoney that’s budgeted for buying crackers should instead be spent on helping the needy, especially the homeless or those living in old age homes and orphanages, others who are disabled, transgenders, or have been afflicted by leprosy. Saplings can be planted to save the environment on Diwali. I along with my family never burst crackers and every Diwali I try to help needy people in my own way. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliCracker ban decision came too lateIn the days of Covid 19 and increasing air pollution the ban on crackers is a right step keeping the health of the people in mind. But why does the administration always wake up at the eleventh hour? This is injustice with the traders who have invested lakhs of rupees in buying crackers. This decision should have been taken two to three months back, thus avoiding monetary loss and any heartburn. Dr Devinder Garg, ChandigarhWe have to mend our ways – nowNature has taught us a lesson during this pandemic , whether we accept it or not. If we do not mend our ways now then we may not get another chance to celebrate the next Diwali. Celebrations this year should be free of air and sound pollution.Chander VijLife cannot be risked for moneyChandigarh has a large population of senior citizens, who are in the high risk category for contracting Covid-19. Hence, the more pollution there is, the more susceptible they will be to infections. The contention of the traders that their Diwali is ruined is unjustified as lives of the people cannot be put to risk for a few bundles of notes. Rajiv Boolchand Jain, ZirakpurLeave the world a bit better“To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.” On this auspicious Diwali, let’s take inspiration from this beautiful quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson and make sincere efforts to uplift the life of all the people around us. Avik Seth, ZirakpurStart cleaning upPeople should stay at home to celebrate an eco-friendly Diwali with their families. We should clean and sanitise our homes. Like olden days, whitewashing the house makes sense as it automatically sanitises and kills germs. Arun Goyal, ChandigarhGift plants to Covid warriorsAlways remember, your happiness doubles by sharing. 1) So, use the money you were going to spend on buying crackers to help someone who is need.

Vasundhara Chaudhary, MohaliNot a time to show off your wealthAim to make this auspicious festival a day of giving and forgiving, and not of show of wealth or sycophancy. Let it be a happy day full of love and brotherhood, where people reach out to one another, even making up with estranged relatives. Saying sorry on this day should be a normal thing. Let us seek the blessings of our parents and grand parents, thereby enriching the sanskars in our children. Let us not rush to others’ houses to give gifts and crowd around to prove to the world how sincere we are. Why don’t we understand? Why have we already started hearing the sound of crackers bursting ? As if farm fires were not enough, why are we adding into pollution, and to the discomfort to animals and birds? The coronavirus should have at least taught us to value life and be humble. Let it be a day of sharing joy and brotherhood. At the end of the day, it should leave us happy with a kinder heart, and stronger bond.

14-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra to implement waqf rules; income from assets will be used for charitable purposes||The Maharashtra government has decided to implement the Waqf Properties Lease (Amendment) Rules, approved by the Centre this year. With the implementation of the rules, waqf properties can now be leased out at 2.5% of the market value, per annum, instead of minimal rates. A 292 square metre (sqm) plot at Bhuleshwar in south Mumbai becomes the first such case. The income generated can be used by the trust for betterment of the backward section of the community, minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said.Waqf is the property given in the name of God for religious and charitable purposes in Islam. Maharashtra has around 93,418 acres of waqf land spread over around 23,566 registered properties, with the maximum land parcels in Aurangabad region — 57,802 acre, followed by 9,310 acre in Pune, 9,260 acre in Nagpur, 8,350 acre in Nashik, 5,941 acre in the Konkan and 2,755 acre in Amravati. The basic role of the state waqf board, set up in 2002, is to keep an account of the revenue and expenditure of waqf properties and ensure that they are being used for the purpose they were created. The Waqf Act allows leasing out the properties, but has held their transfer or exchange as illegal.Waqf properties are generally leased out by the respective trusts on nominal rates since decades. To change this practice, the Central government brought in the waqf properties lease rules in 2014 and later amended them in February this year. However, the rules were never implemented in Maharashtra.The minority affairs department headed by Malik, for the first time, decided to implement the rules for a property at Bhuleshwar which belongs to Rogay Charitable Trust and is being leased out to Indian Oil Corporation. An order to this effect was issued by the minority affairs department on November 11 stating that the tenant will have to pay 2.5% per annum of the market value of the property for a period of 15 years (January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2029).“With the decision, the trust is now going to get ₹2.55 lakh per month instead of ₹2,500 per month that they were getting from the same tenant for decades. It means the trust can generate proper income that can be used for betterment of the backward classes of the community and education of poor children,” the minority affairs minister said.He said that the rules had not been implemented in the state in the past six years but the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has now decided to follow them in letter and spirit. “Following the Waqf Act, the trust will have to submit their annual audit report to the state waqf board through which we can monitor that the money is being used for the purpose intended,” Malik said.“Any trust found involved in irregularities can also be dissolved by the state waqf board,” he added.According to the rules, “The reserve price per square feet for lease of an immovable waqf property shall — (a) for hospitals, educational institutions and social sectors, be not less than 1% per annum; (b) for commercial activities, be not less than 2.5% per annum; of the market value of the property.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-implement-waqf-rules-income-from-assets-will-be-used-for-charitable-purposes/story-yz2NmRPxBKIhx5x6OL5XSI.html

The police also urged people to report the bursting or sale of firecrackers in their vicinity.The special branch of Navi Mumbai police has issued instructions to citizens asking them to maintain social distancing and avoid crowding in public areas. The police said there is an apprehension of worsening of the Covid-19 crisis due to firecrackers bursting, especially for those infected.“We will take action against those violating the orders. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 guidelines imposed for social distancing and wearing masks will continue to remain the same,” said Pravin Patil, deputy commissioner of police, crime branch.Police have warned of action under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, against those violating the permissible noise levels in the city. For residential areas, 55 dB is allowed from 6 am till 10 pm and 45 dB from 10 pm to 6 am. In silence zones, 50 dB is allowed during daytime while for night, it will be restricted to 40 dB.Police have also urged people to celebrate at home as religious places continue to be closed.“Officials and staff from the local police stations will be patrolling the streets to ensure that the rules are followed. Appropriate action will be taken against violators,” said Rupali Ambure, deputy commissioner of police, special branch.Officials have also formed special teams to prevent chain-snatchings, molestations and eve-teasing.

14-11-2020||Delhi||‘Bad air leading to Covid-19 spike; respite soon’: Arvind Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday identified high levels of air pollution as “one of the biggest factors” for the spike in Covid-19 infections, linking the two crises the Capital is currently reeling under, but said that the third wave of the coronavirus disease outbreak in the city was likely to come under control in another 7-10 days.Kejriwal’s comments come at a time when the city has recorded persistently grim Covid numbers – it logged the most single-day fatalities on Thursday and, a day earlier, the most number of new cases. The city’s hospitals have been swamped as active cases rose from 21,490 on October 13 to over 43,000 on November 13.At the same time, the air quality in the Capital has been several times over the safe limit for most of this month. For six days from November 6, it remained in the “severe” zone – above 401 – with the reading at some monitoring centres maxing out. Exposure to high levels of air pollution may exacerbate a Covid-19 infection, particularly since the virus as well as the particulate matter affect a person’s ability to breathe once they enter deep into the lungs. For every 1ug/m3 increase in exposure to PM2.5, the increase in mortality risk due to Covid-19 rises by 11%, a group of researchers from Harvard University said in a recent study.“Whatever necessary steps are needed, we are taking them. There are steps we will take over the next few days, next week and we believe within the next 7-10 days, the outbreak will be brought under control,” the CM said in a video press conference. Kejriwal did not elaborate on the options being considered by the government to control the outbreak, but according to senior government officials who asked not to be named, the administration has asked the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to convene a meeting by Tuesday.Experts said they feared it might take longer for the city to turn the corner from its current peak. “By the current trends, it looks like cases can go up for at least another three weeks unless the government imposes certain restrictions on non-essential activities – that can concern market timings, size of gatherings, etc,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“We are seeing slightly more severe cases that are taking longer to recover. There are different theories but the most plausible seems to be rise in air pollution levels as this trend is largely seen in Delhi where pollution levels are the highest,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, respiratory and critical care medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital.“Both, severe pollution and festive season is contributing to the spread and severity of the disease, and how the outbreak pans out we will get to know exactly once the festive season gets over. The cases will eventually come down but I don’t see it happening in days; it will probably take weeks,” he added.The spike has been particularly pronounced due to the festive season. In the week ending October 25, when the city held muted Dussehra celebrations, there were an average of 3,663 cases every day. As on Thursday, this number rose to 7,196. In comparison, the number was 2,627 in the first week of October.In his address, the chief minister spoke at length about the air quality crisis, which he said has played a big role in driving the epidemic. “One of the biggest reasons for Covid-19 spike in Delhi is rise in pollution,” Kejriwal said. The 24-hour air quality index according to Friday’s 4pm bulletin stood at 339, in the “very poor“ category, worse than the 314 on Thursday, and weather experts expect the number to worsen over the weekend when at least some people are expected to defy bans to burst firecrackers. “Even though we have forecast that this Diwali is likely to be better compared to the last few years, the weather is expected to be unfavourable. If people in the city burst crackers, then the pollution level could slip to ‘severe’ on Diwali day and a day after,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre.The crisis prompted the National Green Tribunal to ban the use of firecrackers across the National Capital Region (NCR), a decision that was also based on research showing a strong link between Covid-19 severity and bad air quality. “This time, the period of hazardous air seems to have arrived even before Diwali. The relationship of air pollution with severity of pneumonia is well established. Therefore, it is expected that there will be an increase in positivity and severity of Covid 19. Instead, all efforts should be made to curb pollution,” the tribunal said on November 9.The link between pollution and coronavirus disease was first made in Italy where officials discovered almost 40% of documented cases and a third of fatalities in the northern region of Lombardy. The epicentre of the outbreak also turned out to be a heavy industrialised and polluted region. The findings were backed by a statistical analysis of Covid-19 case and mortality spread across the 3,089 counties of United States. The team of researchers from Harvard University discovered that regions with worse air quality recorded more serious numbers. “We found that an increase of 1 ug/m3 in the long-term average PM2.5 is associated with a statistically significant 11% increase in the county’s Covid-19 mortality rate,” said the authors in their report, published in Science Advances on November 4. The air quality crisis has been an annual event for the last decade, Kejriwal said in his briefing on Friday as he devoted a sizeable chunk to one of the major causes of air pollution: farm fires in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.Kejriwal shared results of an experiment with a bio decomposer – developed by the Pusa Institute – that can be used to dissolve crop stubble that farmers usually burn. Last month, he said, the bio decomposer was spread over 2,000 acres of farm lands in Delhi and results of the experiment – based on samples collected from 24 villages -- showed that 70%-95% of total crop stubble have been decomposed.“Now we have a solution. I urge other states, the central government and the Supreme Court to take note of it. The Delhi government will file a petition along with this report to the central government’s air safety commission urging them to issue directions to states to use the bio decomposer,” said Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bad-air-leading-to-covid-19-spike-respite-soon-arvind-kejriwal/story-jbav2qfVYjg5t8EVydmTRL.html

The precautionary measures cannot be neglected. It is difficult to say if the second wave will come or not, but whatever is going on in the world and in European countries, where they have again imposed lockdown, we should be ready for any situation” Dr Sanjay Oak, who heads the state’s Covid-19 task force, told TV9 Marathi new channel. “We are celebrating Diwali in the backdrop of Covid-19 and we should not run away from wearing masks no matter what. In European countries, they have asked people to wear masks even at home as it has been proved that wearing a mask is the cheapest and easiest way to get protected from Covid-19.”Also read: Covid-19 likely to be more lethal during winter in cities like Mumbai, say expertsChief minister Uddhav Thackeray, too, on Wednesday had appealed to citizens to celebrate Diwali in a “low-key manner”, to avoid a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections. “I am celebrating Diwali sitting at home and exchanging greetings online. It is important to keep ourselves and our family safe until the vaccine is available and reaches us. It is only because of the restraint adopted by the people during festivals of all religions in the past eight months, we could keep the virus at bay. It is possible even in future if we adopt Covid-19-appropriate behaviour,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-132-new-covid-19-cases-take-maharashtra-s-tally-of-infections-to-1-740-461/story-d4kOnKaLoGv5g9qkDHp5oI.html

14-11-2020||Mumbai||Lonar Lake in Buldhana district declared Ramsar site, second for Maharashtra within a year||Lonar crater lake in Buldhana district, 500 kilometres (km) from Mumbai, has been declared Maharashtra’s second Ramsar site. Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention (held for the first time in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971), which aims to halt the worldwide loss of wetlands. On Thursday, the Ramsar Convention of Wetlands of International Importance announced on its website that Lonar Lake was now a Ramsar site. In January, Maharashtra got its first Ramsar site at Nandur Madhmeshwar, in Nashik. “Lonar Lake on the Deccan Plateau is an endorheic or closed basin, almost circular in shape, formed by a meteorite impact onto the basalt bedrock. The site includes the lake as well as escarpments, which form the crater walls, and forested zones. The lake is high in salinity and alkalinity… but threatened by household sewage, urban wastewater and by unsustainable tourism,” read the convention’s declaration.State environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said, “Lonar crater has its own significance in tourism and geology. As it becomes a Ramsar site, it will help us protect it better in the years to come.”   I’m glad that the Lonar Crater is now officially a Ramsar Site. Having seen it for the first time in 2004, it is a sight that captivates everyone. It has its own significance in the world of Biodiversity, Tourism & Geology.Photos by: CM Uddhav Thackeray ji. pic.twitter.com/g6MKN0XRY4He also shared a photograph of the site taken by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and said the CM had been pushing for tourism at Lonar. Forest minister Sanjay Rathod said, “The declaration comes as a Diwali gift for environment lovers and it is a matter of pride for the forest department and the entire state.”“It is a good achievement for the state that it got two Ramsar sites within a year,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra, adding that the Ramsar status would help conservation efforts. Lonar and Nandur Madhmeshwar bring India’s tally of Ramsar sites to 41. Maharashtra has proposed six more wetlands as Ramsar sites.Also read: 800-ha Nandur Madhyameshwar declared state’s first Ramsar siteIndependent experts said Maharashtra and the Deccan region had low representation in Indian Ramsar sites. “There is a large scope of increasing the number of Ramsar sites considering several wetlands are of high ornithological value,” said Ritesh Kumar, director, Wetlands International (South Asia).The 77.69-hectare (ha) Lonar lake is part of the 365.16-ha Lonar wildlife sanctuary. Located 500 km from Mumbai and over 90 km from Buldhana city, the lake has an average diameter of over 6,000 feet and is 449 feet deep. The area is home to 160 species of birds, 46 species of reptiles, and 12 mammal species including the grey wolf. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the lake was formed as a result of a meteorite impact between 35,000 and 50,000 years ago. It was identified as a unique geographical site by a British officer CJE Alexander in 1823, and declared a notified National Geo-heritage Monument in 1979.Lonar wildlife sanctuary falls under the unified control of the Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), Amravati. “The Ramsar status enhances protection for rare and endemic species, facilitates the development through national level policies, provides access to financial aid through the convention’s small grant fund, and allows access to expert advice on site related problems of this wetland,” said MS Reddy, field director, MTR.The lake was first proposed as a Ramsar site in 2017 by the state forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lonar-lake-in-buldhana-district-declared-ramsar-site-second-for-maharashtra-within-a-year/story-XLBrbNADwhPuAX0KHZdo0N.html

14-11-2020||Pune||Young generation should know works of Nehru: Chhajed||Minister of state Vishwajeet Kadam on Friday inaugurated a two-day photo exhibition on former prime minister and Congress leader Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru at Balasaheb Thackeray art gallery near Sarasbaug. Kadam said, “Some people are trying to defame the national leader who built the new India, but their efforts would never affect the great works of visionary leaders like Nehru.” Abhay Chhajed, former city Congress president, has organised the event to mark the Children’s Day celebrated every year on November 14 to commemorate the birth anniversary of independent India’s first prime minister. Various events are held on the day to increase awareness of the rights, care and education of children. Chhajed said that the exhibition is an effort to show the younger generation the achievements of the visionary leader. Chhajed said, “Nowadays it has become a trend by the ruling party to blame Nehru for everything wrong in the country. All the institutions that India is proud of today were founded in his time, including IITs, IIMs, NID, NCL, Atomic Energy Commission, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Indian National Committee for Space Research.” The Congress leader said that despite enjoying a clear majority in the Parliament, Nehru involved the opposition parties in decision making and gave them space. “One of Nehru’s successes was the creation of the modern Indian state. When Nehru became the prime minister, the country was poor, hardly literate and unable to feed itself and average life span of Indians was just 32 years. By 1964, the average life span of Indians was 50 years,” he said, highlighting the overall development of the country during the period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/young-generation-should-know-the-works-of-visionary-leader-like-nehru-chhajed/story-TnyAlXdW6k5za9EqqMQqyJ.html

These patients will be called to the OPD to detect the early symptoms of flu so that they could be diagnosed earlier and start treatment at the earliest.On Thursday, PMC reported 233 fresh positives, taking the case total to 1,74,884 and seven deaths which takes the death toll to 4,089.Ashish Bharti, health chief, PMC, said, “We will start Covid-19 comorbidity clinics in all the dispensaries and maternity hospitals which would have a dedicated OPD for the comorbid patients whom we have detected during the state survey, ‘My family, my responsibility.’”“Early detection of symptoms will lead to early treatment which prevents fatalities. We will divide these hospitals and comorbid clinics into each ward and once in a week we will have a stipulated time to operate these clinics,” he said.Bharti also added that currently, the only problem is arranging for anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive medications which we will have to provide to the patients coming for the consultation.He said, “We will have to provide consultation and medication for free at the clinics. The comorbid people who have been detected through the survey will have to come to the clinic for regular assessment of their health. We will soon start the clinic.”Dr Sanjay Dabhade from Jan Aarogya, said, “It is a good move. However, it is too late for them to start this but they must not just operate them during Covid-19 but continue to keep a watch on these patients so as to ensure that the overall mortality of the city goes down. Many patients discontinue their tablets for diabetes and hypertension which leads to higher mortality.” There are about 52 dispensaries which will be attended by the dispensary doctors who will look for early signs of Covid-19 or any flu-like symptoms and then they would be advised for further treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-to-start-comorbidity-clinics-to-save-people-at-risk/story-WeRO9A0ZUkE3DvtPqQoSmM.html
14-11-2020||Delhi||Mandatory fire safety checks at GB Road soon||All buildings housing brothels at Swami Shradhanand Marg, commonly known as GB Road (Garstin Bastion Road), in central Delhi will soon have to mandatorily undergo a detailed safety inspection.The move comes after a four-storey building — that partially serves as a brothel — went up in flames last Thursday (November 5), prompting the evacuation of 60-70 sex workers and their customers. The fire continued to rage for more than two hours and a spate of cylinder blasts on the upper floors caused the top floor to collapse partially. While no deaths or injuries were reported, the firefighting revealed glaring lapses as far as safety from fire is concerned.GB Road, which connects Ajmeri Gate to Lahori Gate near Old Delhi, has around 85 brothels, which employ around 2,500 women as sex workers. Officials said the inspection will be carried out jointly by Delhi Fire Service and North Delhi Municipal Corporation, and are expected to begin after Diwali on Saturday. Officials said the brothels are a cause of major concerns as most of the buildings there have narrow staircases, mezzanine floors, small chambers and dilapidated roofs, all in violation of fire safety norms.Rajesh Kumar Shukla, assistant divisional officer, who led the firefighting effort on Thursday, said they found that these buildings have staircases that are less than a metre wide, and mezzanine floors and chambers that have been constructed illegally with no fire-fighting equipment in place. “There is barely any fire safety norm being followed here. The current situation is disastrous. Any major fire can turn out tobe fatal leaving no scope for evacuation or rescue operation at all,” Shukla said.Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service (DFS) said these brothels have never been inspected by the Delhi Fire Service. “In my memory, the area has never been inspected. This is also because Delhi Fire Service Act 2007 and Rule 2010 do not include the word ‘Kotha’. Further, as these are residential buildings which are less than 15 metres tall, they do not fall under our purview. There are shops on the ground floor and residential area on the second and third floors. The mercantile shops are also not under our purview as they do not exceed a height of nine metres,” Garg said.Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation said the constructions in GB Road area were very old, dating to the 1960s, when norms were not very strict. “I had visited the place immediately after the incident. The area is congested, with narrow lanes. After Diwali, we will conduct a survey to identify vulnerable buildings in the area and check for illegal construction in the buildings. We will try to find out how fire hazards can be avoided and what other structural safety measures can be taken,” Prakash said.The Aam Aadmi Party’s Shoaib Iqbal, who is the member of legislative assembly from Matia Mahal, the constituency under which a part of GB Road also falls, said they have been planning for long to relocate the sex workers. “Even though no lives were lost, the fire incident reminds us of the magnitude of tragedy that may unfold. We plan to discuss it with the fire department and other authorities concerned and reach a solution,” Iqbal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/all-gb-road-brothels-to-undergo-mandatory-fire-safety-inspection-soon/story-uP3NvLCvwXctKSToX9vc4N.html
14-11-2020||Delhi||Few firecrackers, at least in Delhi’s big markets||Despite the sale and purchase of firecrackers being banned in the National Capital Region (NCR), several residents of Delhi said they were worried that prohibitions would be flouted, leading to the almost inevitable annual post-Diwali air pollution spike. An HT spot check on Friday revealed that while firecrackers were not openly available in the city’s major markets, some bootleggers and small shops had made arrangements to surreptitiously supply customers with the banned products.The Delhi Police, for its part, said it has formed special teams and flying squads under each police station and police district to prevent the sale and bursting of crackers on Diwali, adding that they have seized nearly 3,000 firecrackers and arrested 47 persons in the past 10 days for either selling or bursting firecrackers. However, some residents of the national capital — in Mayur Vihar, Saket and CR Park — told HT that they could hear firecrackers in their vicinity. The police and government crackdowns, however, did ensure that firecrackers were not being sold openly at busy markets such as Sadar Bazar and Dariba Kalan in Old Delhi. Some people were able to go about their business discreetly, and while police said they arrested many such offenders, some others slipped through the cracks.In north-west Delhi’s Pitampura, for instance, a resident said firecrackers were being sold in some local grocery stores, and were available to customers familiar with the shopkeepers.In north Delhi’s Sarai Rohilla, the police caught a grocer was caught with 20kg firecrackers he allegedly intended to sell from his grocery store. “The grocer was caught with Rs 4,500 worth of firecrackers during checking at a police picket,” said Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (north). The police said they had seized around 85kg of firecrackers across the city on Friday and arrested four men for selling them, taking the total number of such arrests to 41. Further, three people were booked for bursting crackers on Friday.Some residents posted videos on Twitter of firecrackers being burst. “I’ve been hearing crackers being burst for at least two days now, and had to finally call the police in the evening,” said a 28-year-old resident of Saket, who asked not to be named.At many markets in the southern part of the city, shopkeepers refused to even reveal any places where firecrackers could be purchased. “The plainclothes policemen were tricking shopkeepers into revealing the identity of illegal traders. The word has gone out and no one wants to take a risk,” said a shopkeeper, Anant, in Badarpur Market. In areas such as Mayur Vihar, IP Extension, Tughlaqabad and Sangam Vihar, while people thronged to wrap up the last-minute shopping, firecracker shops remained closed. Sunil Kumar, 32, who sets up his vegetable cart near a firecracker shop in Mayur Vihar, said, “The shop also sell colours and other items apart from firecrackers. But the shop has been closed for three days now. Customers come enquiring about firecrackers, but to no avail. We understand the ban and the crisis, but who will explain these to our children? They want to burn firecrackers because for them, that’s what Diwali is all about.” Harjit Singh Chabbra, general secretary of the Fire Crackers Association of Delhi, who has a licensed shop in Sadar Bazaar (one of the biggest wholesale cracker markets in Delhi), said: “We have been ruined, as the government did not inform us about the ban in advance. We had bought crackers before the ban, but they are now lying unused. This year, maybe people will not burst crackers as licensed wholesale shops like ours have been closed for over 10 days now. In the previous years, the other sellers would normally buy from us and sell it in their local markets but this year, the ban was put in place more than 10 days ago.” The Delhi Police, in a statement about their preparedness, said pickets have been placed in markets and places with high footfall to sensitize public for wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. “Public address systems and banners are also being used to sensitize people,” the police statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/few-firecrackers-at-least-in-big-markets-in-delhi/story-iBXmTK4YcF5q2p0j9LSBDM.html
14-11-2020||Delhi||Will Diwali again lead to a bad air spike?||For the past five Diwali nights, the bursting of firecrackers has sent the air quality, which is in any case toxic at this time of year, to emergency levels, maxing out nearly all monitors in the city.According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air in Delhi remains severely polluted for a week after Diwali due to a combination of emissions from firecrackers, farm fires in neighbouring states, and adverse weather conditions.This means that the slight improvement in Delhi’s air since Wednesday — it went from “severe” to “very poor” — may be short-lived, a possibility experts have flagged in recent days, if the cracker ban is not strictly followed. WATCH | Diwali 2020: Kedarnath temple, CST decorated; UP CM performs aarti in Ayodhya The AQI on Friday was 339, while it was 314 on Thursday. “The key this year will be to enforce the cracker ban effectively. Last year, because of an early Diwali, and better enforcement, we saw our first “severe” air day only after Diwali. But this year, we have already experienced a week of severe air quality,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment. On Diwali, PM Narendra Modi likely to celebrate with troops on western border CPCB data shows that over the past five years, the pollution levels in the city have remained in the “severe” levels in the days following Diwali. Last year, despite slightly better wind speeds, the air quality index (AQI) on Diwali day (October 27) was 337, in the “very poor” category. In the subsequent days, the air quality continued to deteriorate and on October 29, the AQI was 400. The next day, it rose further to 419. In 2018, a similar trend was seen. On November 7, Diwali day, from an AQI of 281 (poor category), it rose to 390 the next day, a tad short of the “severe” zone. The subsequent day, the AQI climbed to 423. According to Roychowdhury, last year, despite favourable weather conditions and increased enforcement, pollution levels remained high simply because too many firecrackers were used. On a scale of 0 to 500, an AQI value between 301 and 400 is considered “very poor”, while values between 401 and 500 are considered “severe”.To assess the impact of firecrackers on Delhi’s air this year, the CPCB has directed the state pollution control boards of Delhi and NCR towns to conduct detailed ambient air quality monitoring in two or three localities, so as to understand the trend. In Delhi, the areas chosen for this monitoring are Pitampura, Janakpuri and ITO. “It will be a 15-day study, assessing the air quality seven days before Diwali and seven days after Diwali. Noise monitoring assessment will also be carried out from November 9 to November 14,” a statement by CPCB on Friday said. Senior CPCB officials said in that in northwest Delhi’s Pitampura area, the levels of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), PM2.5 (ultra fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres), and metals in PM10 (lead, nickel, arsenic) will be monitored. In Janakpuri, the levels of metals in PM2.5, such as aluminium, barium and iron will be monitored. Noise pollution assessments will be conducted in six areas in Okhla, Lajpat Nagar, Mayur Vihar Phase-2, Kamla Nagar, Pitampura and Janakpuri from 6pm to midnight on Diwali. Real-time noise monitoring will also be done at 10 places in Dilshad Garden, RK Puram, Civil Lines, Anand Vihar, Dwarka and Punjabi Bagh. A Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) analysis of the air quality during the Diwali week in 2019 showed that in Delhi-NCR the concentration of PM 2.5 levels jumped 10-fold in the seven hours starting 5pm on Diwali evening. This was alarming as Diwali last year was celebrated earlier than usual, which means the city was warmer and had favourable conditions for the dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/will-diwali-again-lead-to-a-bad-air-spike/story-YOAMM1REv4zyjE3NpvPdTI.html

14-11-2020||Noida||Businessman robbed near IP Park||A businessman driving home with his wife and friends after a party in Indirapuram was robbed of his gold and cash at gunpoint on Friday morning. Police said the robbery took place when he had stepped out of his car in central Delhi’s Indraprastha Park early Friday. The 39-year-old businessman, his wife and two friends saw the crime unfold from inside their car and recorded the entire incident on their mobile phone.RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east), said a case of robbery has been filed at Sunlight Colony police station and the police are working on certain specific leads to crack the case.The victim, Amit Arora, is in the transport business and lives in Rohini’s Sector 18.The DCP said Arora and his wife Megha were returning from Indirapuram in Ghaziabad after attending a party. They were accompanied by their friends Rohit Sharma and Megha Sharma.“Around 1.15am, when they were driving towards ITO, they stopped near Shanti Stup in Indraprastha Park as Arora wanted to relieve himself. Arora was outside the car when five men arrived in a white Swift car. Three of them got out of the car and one of them pointed a gun at Arora and another threatened him with a knife,” the DCP said.Arora was made to hand over his gold bracelet, a gold chain, two gold rings, a watch and Rs 40,000 cash to the robbers. He alleged that after targeting him, the robbers started walking towards Arora’s car while asking the occupants to get out, but Sharma was able to steer the car away. “The robbers escaped in their car,” said Arora.Arora said the police took over an hour to reach the crime spot; the DCP said the initial call was marked to the Tilak Marg police station as the victims had given the crime spot as Pragati Maidan.“We received the call at 2.45am after the PCR call was transferred to our district,” the DCP said.Meena said a subsequent probe and CCTV footage analysis has revealed the last four digits of the Swift car’s number plate. Arrests are imminent, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/businessman-returning-home-with-family-and-friends-robbed-by-car-borne-men-in-ip-park/story-SFrdZJ4AxXoRz1AfQXGx7I.html
14-11-2020||Delhi||40-yr-old sets himself on fire at mall after store refuses to replace handset||A 40-year-old man allegedly set himself afire at a mall in outer Delhi’s Rohini on Friday afternoon when a store refused to replace a “malfunctioned” mobile phone he had gifted to his niece for online classes, police said. The man, who repairs inverters for a living, suffered 40% burns and is being treated at Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, according to the Delhi Police. PK Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini), said the man is stable and continues to remain under observation in the hospital. Mishra said the man had bought the smartphone from a store at a prominent mall in Rohini a month ago and gifted it to his 14-year-old niece who is a class nine student at a government school for her online classes. “According to the family, the phone started to get heated and malfunctioned. He visited the store on November 6 and demanded the handset be replaced, but the company cited their policy to deny him a replacement,” the DCP said, based on his family’s complaint. Further correspondence with the company yielded no results and he was again cited the same policy for refusal, the DCP said. “On Friday, he decided to set himself on fire if his request was turned down,” the deputy commissioner of police said, quoting the family members.When his request was again turned down on Friday, Mishra allegedly filled en empty bottle with petrol from his scooter parked outside the mall and then set himself on fire while climbing down the stairs. The police said they are continuing to probe the circumstances of the alleged suicide bid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-sets-himself-on-fire-after-mobile-store-refuses-to-replace-handset/story-qZlkpue1sWTUTjETChm6TM.html
14-11-2020||Chandigarh||2008 UT Employees Housing scheme: CHB to present revised options to delegates on Nov 17||Hoping to resolve objections to the costing of the 2008 UT Employees Housing scheme, the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) will present two revised options to the employee representatives on November 17.At the meeting, to be chaired by the UT adviser, employees’ views on the options – seven storey or 10-storey housing projects – will be taken. These have been devised to reduce the cost of the flats offered under the scheme. As per the UT urban planning department, the 10-storey housing options will require amendments in the Chandigarh Master Plan -2031, which does not permit high-rise buildings.Recently, the employees had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court on the delay by CHB in preparing the revised options.Notably, the process to reassess and revise the cost of the project started after the August 19 meeting between UT administration officials, employee representatives and the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) officials. The meeting was chaired by the Union home secretary to discuss all matters regarding the housing scheme.After deliberations, it was decided that the calculation of rates be made again for different categories by applying various factors like floor area ratio, collector rate, plotted area etc., in consultation with the representatives of the petitioners. The housing scheme for administration employees was launched in February 2008. The draw of lots for 7,827 applicants was held in November 2010. A total of 3,930 employees were declared successful and submitted Rs 57 crore. Around 4,000 flats were planned in Sectors 52, 53 and 56. Later, the scheme was shelved, but revived after the employees took up the matter with local MP Kirron Kher. But the MHA allowed the administration to transfer the land to CHB at the current collector rates.This caused the apartment costs to shoot up from the earlier Rs 34.70 lakh to Rs 2.08 crore in case of 3-BHK, Rs 24.30 lakh to Rs 1.64 crore for 2-BHK and Rs 13.53 lakh to Rs 1 crore for 1-BHK. Even for one-room flats, the earlier cost of Rs 5.76 lakh was revised to Rs 50 lakh.The employees then moved the high court alleging that CHB was charging five times the initial price for land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2008-ut-employees-housing-scheme-chb-to-present-revised-options-to-representatives-on-nov-17/story-SK0Gc9N2x4uWpyQIADcEBL.html
14-11-2020||Pune||Pune roads flooded with shoppers on Diwali eve||A day before Diwali, the streets of Pune were filled with buyers on Friday. Major city market areas like Laxmi road, Tulshibaug and Raviwar peth reported a huge rush. Residents had stepped out to purchase various things for Diwali from clothes, sweets, electronic goods, gold jewellery and other household items. With more people on the streets, major traffic congestions were also reported on city roads due to the Diwali shopping rush and traffic police were seen monitoring the vehicular movement. “From the last one week slowly the business is growing and in the last two days, there is a heavy rush at our shop to purchase clothes. We have made face mask compulsory and only four to five customers are allowed at one time inside the shop. Also, each and every customer is given a hand sanitiser and their thermal checking is done before entering the shop. We had to keep adding two people at the shop to clear the rush,” said Rushi Jain a clothing shop owner on Laxmi road. There are three major roads for Diwali Shopping in Pune city – Laxmi road, Kumthekar road and Tilak road. There was also a crowd on Friday at Tulshibaug, Bohri Aali and Raviwar peth markets. Deepak Chaudhaury, electronic shop owner on Tilak Road said, “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, there was a slow start to the sale of electronic goods, but as we kept various festival offers, attractive EMI options for customers there is a good response now. Though people have suffered financially during the lockdown the sales of electronic goods are increasing now. We hope that the overall market business condition gets better from Diwali.” Punekars have been enthusiastic of Diwali shopping despite the fear of Covid-19 infection spread. Shweta Kanade a housewife said, “This year due to the Covid situation we had already decided to not shop as much, we only bought festive clothes for children. And washing machine for the house as it was a long pending in our list to buy. Going to shop in the current market rush is still a risk and so we avoided the frequent trips outside. We have come out in a market place only for today and from now we will celebrate the festival at home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-roads-flooded-with-shoppers-on-diwali-eve/story-NUUPsStRrDuqLslKxR2oxM.html
14-11-2020||Pune||Form death audit committee at civic body-run Covid hospitals: State to PMC||In line with the formation of a panel by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to carry out death audit of Covid patients, the Maharashtra government has brought a general resolution (GR) directing government hospitals across the state to institute similar panels. According to the state directive, the committee must have a hospital superintendent, a physician who is either private practitioner or government doctor, a medical college physician and a public health professional. The state has taken the step after observing a rise in critical cases and deaths despite fall in fresh Covid cases. PMC has constituted the “death audit committee” in its bid to curb the rising death rate of Covid patients. The civic administration has issued guidelines to all its hospitals to form a committee. The new order makes it mandatory for all PMC-run Covid hospitals to assess and analyse the exact cause of death of patients due to the virus. Though the government released the order on November 5, PMC issued an order for appointment of death audit committees for each of its hospitals two weeks back. The audit report will carry out factual analysis of death of Covid patients, including age, gender, previous ailments, recovery time, remedial measures, line of treatment adopted by the hospital and survey report of the area where the patient was residing. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said, “PMC has already issued directions for constituting the committee at each of its hospitals and efforts will be taken to follow necessary compliances. The exercise will give a clearer picture of the disease to the administration.” Dr Sudhakar Bhoite, a public health professional said, “The new order is yet another step towards bureaucratic handling of the virus. Instead of providing the administration with more funds and manpower, the state government is making them adopt a clerical approach in combating the disease. The government could have instructed the state health department doctors to complete this process rather than burdening the PMC medical staff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/form-death-audit-committee-at-civic-body-run-covid-hospitals-state-to-pmc/story-1mxKc1YQIr0epnC8HnKKWJ.html
14-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai local trains may resume for all if no spike in Covid-19 tally a fortnight after Diwali||Mumbai’s local trains may be thrown open to all commuters about a fortnight after Diwali festival, if there isn’t a significant spike in Covid-19 cases, said sources. Officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said that daily Covid-19 cases will be closely monitored for two weeks following which a final call on resuming local trains will be taken. Instances of spike in daily cases reported in the city will further postpone resumption of the service. Daily, over 7.5 million people travel by Mumbai suburban train network which was closed in March following Covid-19 outbreak. Later, the services were started for people in essential sectors and last month, for all women commuters during non-peak hours. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner who is in charge of health, said, “The virus has a 14-day cycle and this period will be crucial to know if there is any surge in Covid cases post-Diwali. The state government will take a final call on fully resuming local trains. Inputs based on observations with regards to starting local trains will be given to the state by all civic bodies of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.”Also read | BMC forms squads to monitor Covid-19 guidelines violations around DiwaliOn October 30, the state government had written to the general managers of both the zonal railways and had proposed three time-slots during the day for general commuters, and two time-slots for essential services staff. The government had also sought a ladies special train every hour.Since October 24, the city has seen a downward curve of Covid with cases reporting as low as 535 in a day. Prior to this, daily cases reported were all-time high on almost every alternate day. With the coming Diwali festival, that falls on November 14, the civic body is taking various measures to avoid any further surge in cases, similar to the one following the Ganesh festival in September. Daily Covid cases in Mumbai that were reported then were above 2,000 on most of the days.Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health expert, said, “Diwali is one of the biggest festivals in India and will be a crucial time for Covid-19 as well. Authorities should ensure that the downward trend continues till the end of November and if that happens, it’s a good sign.”Meanwhile, the railways said while discussions with state and BMC are ongoing, there is no time frame decided to resume local services for all.On October 30, the state had written to the general managers of both the zonal railways and proposed three time-slots for general commuters, and two slots for essential services staff. The railways, however, said there have been no discussions over introducing different time slots. “The state said a mobile application to facilitate commute with fewer crowds is being prepared,” said a railway official.Meanwhile, the railways resumed Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVM) services. “We are operating 88% of suburban local train services and have opened ATVMs in a phased manner,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-trains-may-resume-for-all-if-no-spike-in-covid-19-tally-a-fortnight-after-diwali/story-ctrEph49Cq5xyQ5KylVqsI.html

It is believed that on this day Lord Rama (the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu) returned from a 14-year-long exile, during which he fought and won a battle against the demon king Ravana.People across India and around the world celebrate the festival by decorating their houses, exchanging gifts, and offering prayers in order to commemorate the “victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-extends-wishes-on-diwali/story-Mr2m8Z3qfx2nlkWdRDTFJO.html
14-11-2020||World||Joe Biden likely to break barriers, pick woman to lead Pentagon||President-elect Joe Biden is expected to take a historic step and select a woman to head the Pentagon for the first time, shattering one of the few remaining barriers to women in the department and the presidential Cabinet.Michele Flournoy, a politically moderate Pentagon veteran, is regarded by U.S. officials and political insiders as a top choice for the position.Her selection would come on the heels of a tumultuous Pentagon period that has seen five men hold the top job under President Donald Trump. The most recent defense secretary to go was Mark Esper, who was fired by Trump on Monday after pushing back on issues including troop withdrawals and the use of the military to quell civilian unrest.If confirmed, Flournoy would face a future that is expected to involve shrinking Pentagon budgets and potential military involvement in the distribution of a coronavirus vaccine.Democrats have long sought to name a woman to the top post in a department that didn’t open all combat jobs to female service members until about five years ago. Flournoy had been the expected choice of Hillary Clinton if she had won the 2016 election. Her name surfaced early as a front-runner for Biden’s Cabinet, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.Seen as a steady hand who favors strong military cooperation abroad, Flournoy, 59, has served multiple times in the Pentagon, starting in the 1990s and most recently as the undersecretary of defense for policy from 2009 to 2012. She serves on the board of Booz Allen Hamilton, a defense contractor, which could raise concerns from some lawmakers. But her moderate views would likely ensure wide bipartisan support in a position that requires Senate confirmation.Few other names have been mentioned, though former Department of Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson was listed as a possible choice at one point. Choosing a woman would be consistent with Biden’s pledge to have a diverse Cabinet.She has been outspoken on American foreign and defense policy, particularly over the past year. She favors closer international cooperation after four years of a Trump White House that touted an “America First” policy and was more distrustful and critical of allies.“Whoever the next president is,” she said in March, “whether it’s a second Trump term or Vice President Biden or whoever it is, one of the top agenda items is going to try to, I think, repair some of that perception” that America may no longer be a reliable partner. “But I don’t think it’s going to be easy or happen overnight. I think it’s going to take a lot of work over a number of years to recover that trust and that standing.”She has also cautioned against drastic, immediate changes.“One of the most dangerous tendencies is for — after a change of administration, particularly when there’s a change of party — for the new team to come in and use the term ‘repudiation.’ But to come in and assume that everything their predecessors did was wrong, you know, they throw the baby out with the bathwater, basically, and they overcorrect in another direction,” she said in a Hudson Institute forum.Arnold Punaro, a retired Marine two-star general and former staff director of the Senate Armed Services Committee under then-Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, said recently that he regards Flournoy as “incredibly well-qualified” to lead the Pentagon.The Defense Department is one of three Cabinet agencies — the others being Treasury and Veterans Affairs — that have never been led by a woman. Some of the 28 men who have held the top defense job since it was created in 1947, including three who served in Trump’s administration — Jim Mattis, Esper and current acting Secretary Christopher Miller — have been military veterans. Flournoy did not serve in the military.Like Mattis and Esper, Flournoy views China as the most significant long-term challenge to American predominance on the world stage. In July, she said the United States is losing its military technological advantage over key competitors like China and that reversing this trend must be the Pentagon’s top priority.She has, however, also warned against abandoning the Middle East and instead advocates “more modest levels of continuous presence” there. As an example, she has backed a limited role in Afghanistan that focuses more on countering the terror threat and less on rebuilding the country.“We want to reduce our commitment, but we want to do it in a way that’s smart and that safeguards our interests in the process,” she said in March about Afghanistan, adding that she hopes “we don’t just cut and run.” Trump has pushed for a full troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of the year, but so far the Pentagon has no orders to do that.On North Korea, she said in an October online forum that while nuclear disarmament should remain the ultimate goal, she finds it “hard to see” Kim Jong Un agreeing to give up all his nuclear weapons, which she said he sees as his regime’s “survival card.”On Iran, Flournoy has argued for a revised approach of deterring the Islamic Republic by breaking the familiar pattern of sending more American forces to the Gulf in response to Iranian provocations, as the Trump administration did in May 2019 after what it called credible threats to U.S. interests in the region.Flournoy is a co-founder of Westexec Advisors, a consulting firm that provides advice and geopolitical risk analysis to corporate clients. She works with a mixture of former senior government officials — including Antony Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state and currently Biden’s top foreign policy adviser — and military experts such as retired Army Gen. Vincent Brooks, who led U.S. forces in Korea until 2019.In 2007, Flournoy helped create a think tank, the Center for a New American Security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-likely-to-break-barriers-pick-woman-to-lead-pentagon/story-mk4EUZToWP8bnR5fOIifZO.html

Lamenting what he called “an immaculate deception,” Navarro said any speculation about what Biden might do on trade policy or with regard to China “I think is moot at this point.”Senior US federal and state election officials on Thursday said there is “no evidence” that hackers were able to tamper with the vote, and most world leaders have congratulated Biden on his victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-planning-for-second-trump-term-despite-defeat-official/story-uLH7wJ6C0KBcs7IDJAyuGK.html

U.S. authorities had been tracking Masri and other al Qaeda operatives in Iran for years, it said.Al Qaeda has not announced his death, Iranian officials have covered it up and no government has publicly claimed responsibility, the Times said.Iran on Saturday denied the report, saying there were no al Qaeda “terrorists” on its soil.Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a statement that the United States and Israel sometimes “try to tie Iran to such groups by lying and leaking false information to the media in order to avoid responsibility for the criminal activities of this group and other terrorist groups in the region”.The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump’s “scare-mongering tactic against Iran has become routine,” Khatibzadeh said. A U.S. official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, declined to confirm any details of the Times’ story or say whether there was any U.S. involvement. The White House National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Masri, one of al Qaeda’s founding leaders, was killed along with his daughter, the widow of former al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden’s son, Hamza bin Laden, the Times reported.Osama bin Laden orchestrated the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan in 2011.Shi’ite Iran and al Qaeda, a Sunni Muslim militant organization, have long been enemies.Masri had been in Iran’s “custody” since 2003 but had been living freely in an upscale suburb of Tehran since 2015, the Times cited unnamed U.S. intelligence officials as saying.U.S. counterterrorism officials believe Iran, also a U.S. enemy, may have let him live there to conduct operations against U.S. targets, the Times said.It was not immediately known what, if any, impact Masri’s death has had on al Qaeda’s activities. Even as it has lost senior leaders in the nearly two decades since the attacks on New York and Washington, it has maintained active affiliates from the Middle East to Afghanistan to West Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-denies-report-al-qaeda-s-no-2-leader-killed-in-iran/story-imofcYfeJBRMAL5BMpRKFO.html
14-11-2020||World||US top diplomat arrives in France on touchy 7-nation tour||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Paris on Saturday at the start of a seven-country tour of Europe and the Middle East, a trip that is certain to be awkward since all the nations on his schedule have congratulated Joe Biden for his victory in the U.S. presidential race.The trip is aimed at shoring up the priorities of the outgoing administration of President Donald Trump. It will include visits to Israeli settlements in the West Bank that have been avoided by previous secretaries of state.The United States’ top diplomat — as well as its president and much of his Republican Party — have not accepted the results of the American election, and the unusual circumstances will likely overshadow the issues.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian noted on Friday the “difficult subjects” on the table, from the situation in Iraq and Iran, terrorism, the Middle East and China.”For the moment, my counterpart is Mike Pompeo, until Jan. 20…,” Le Drian said on BFMTV, referring to the date when Trump’s term ends. “He’s coming to Paris. I receive him.”That meeting will take place Monday, Le Drian said, suggesting that Pompeo also will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron.The French president, who spoke with Biden four days ago to offer congratulations, has had a tense relationship with Trump. Both leaders initially worked to woo each other with gestures of extravagance, such as Macron making Trump the guest of honor at a Bastille Day military parade. Trump later pulled out of the Paris global climate accord, a blow to Macron.After France, Pompeo’s tour takes him to Turkey, Georgia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The leaders of all of those countries have offered public congratulations to Biden.Beside France, Turkey, Georgia and Qatar have had fractious relationships with the Trump administration, and it was not clear whether Pompeo planned public engagements with their leaders — or whether he would take questions from the press, with whom he has had a frosty relationship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-top-diplomat-arrives-in-france-on-touchy-7-nation-tour/story-kFLxmJrLIDNFaV8mBlR06J.html

The Lanzhou Municipal Health Commission said in a statement on its website that it had found one positive sample on Friday on the inner packaging of imported frozen shrimp from Saudi Arabia that had passed through customs in the coastal city of Tianjin.The cold storage plant in Lanzhou where the case was discovered had been temporarily closed, all employees of the plant had been tested, all food involved was sealed and the whereabouts of all food sold had been determined, the statement said.The commission said the shrimp had been purchased by Zhanjiang Guolian Aquatic Products Co Ltd, entered the country on Oct. 21 and reached Lanzhou on Nov. 8.The positive sample in Lanzhou follows the detection of the virus on the packaging of a batch of Brazilian beef in Wuhan on Friday, and on Argentinian beef samples in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces this week.The World Health Organization says the risk of catching Covid-19 from frozen food is low, but China has repeatedly sounded alarms after detecting the virus on imported food products, triggering disruptive import bans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-finds-coronavirus-on-packaging-of-saudi-shrimp/story-S5NzeNtN1OeWEPYfriw6kO.html

Using rubber boats, rescuers scramble to pluck residents stranded on rooftops of submerged houses in Cagayan and Isabela.Philippine Coast Guard footage showed a big swath of the provinces submerged in brown floodwaters triggered by the spilling water from Magat Dam, a large rock-fill dam on the Magat River in the main island of Luzon.Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba said in an interview with radio DZBB on Saturday that one rescuer was electrocuted on Friday night.Mamba, who described the flooding as the worst in memory, appealed for helicopters, adding that some of the flooded areas cannot be accessed by land.Evacuation centres are full, he said, adding some victims were moving in with neighbours amid Covid-19 concerns.Typhoon Vamco lashed a big part of Luzon, home to approximately half of the country’s 110 million population and 70 per cent of economic activity.Non-stop torrential rains have been dumped by Vamco and the cyclones before it forced operators of dams in Luzon to open the floodgates to release water, as the reservoir’s levels breached the spilling marks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-vamco-leaves-53-dead-22-missing-in-philippines/story-UxrMaj0UzOIJeC9z3upArJ.html
14-11-2020||World||Amid Covid-19 surge, Paris hospitals begin to see signs of hope||Dry-coughing as he pedals — a hack, hack, hack after-effect of his own personal battle with Covid-19 — the doctor cycles through the dark of pre-dawn Paris, speeding to a crisis meeting at his hospital where, way back in February, the disease carried away the first of what has now become more than a quarter-million dead in Europe. In the nine months since then, critical care chief Philippe Montravers and the 150 doctors and nurses he leads at the towering Bichat Hospital in Paris have become experts about their enemy. That knowledge is proving invaluable against the second deadly surge of the virus that is again threatening to overwhelm European health systems. Puffing and spluttering as he pedals, because his lungs are still congested, Montravers details the progress that he and his team have made in their care since they fought off the gruesome initial wave of cases last spring, therapeutic advances that are helping Bichat and other hospitals better resist the renewed tide of infections. Bichat in February was the first hospital outside Asia to record the death of a person infected with the virus: an 80-year-old tourist from China.“In the first wave, people didn’t dare come to the hospital. They were scared, scared of being infected,” Montravers recalls. “When they arrived, they were on their last legs, exhausted, unable to move, and so — hop! — we intubated and ventilated them.” Now, there are steroid treatments that weren’t available to Bichat’s doctors in the first surge. They have also learned not to put patients on ventilators if at all possible and to instead keep them awake and bathed in oxygen, dispensed through face masks instead of invasive tubes. The sick are also savvier, and are seeking help earlier for their symptoms, making them easier to treat. Added together, these and other advances mean that patients more often are spending days instead of weeks in critical care and surviving in greater numbers.“We’ve won about 15 days in caring for them and the mortality has dropped by nearly half,” Montravers says. That picture is reflected nationwide, too. Although France now has more patients hospitalized with the virus than during the April peak of the initial wave, there are about 2,000 fewer in intensive care. The situation remains dire, with one death in four in France now linked to Covid-19 and the country again largely locked down. But hospitals appear to be holding, with capacity to survive the surge’s high point projected to sweep across France in coming days.“The system is on the verge of cracking but, at the same time, there is a bit of hope at the end of the tunnel,” Montravers says. At another of Paris’ major hospitals, anesthetist nurse Damien Vaillant-Foulquier is also starting to believe that they will see off this wave of infections, too. When the system was struggling with coronavirus cases in the spring, he was switched from his specialty job of putting people to sleep for surgeries and instead thrown into the fight in intensive care wards, including intubating patients on respirators. But he has not been drafted this time, even as cases snowballed, enabling him to continue caring for non-Covid-19 patients getting liver transplants and cancer surgeries.“In September-October, I and most of my colleagues were convinced that we’d be heading back to the ICUs,” he said. “But for the moment, no.” Bichat has been able to set aside more resources for life-saving nonvirus treatments, too. In March-April, the hospital that specialises in heart and lung transplants, among other things, stopped about two-thirds of surgeries to free up space and staff for virus patients, Montravers says. This time, just one-third of surgeries are being postponed. Those that have gone ahead even as teams fought the virus surge included a lung transplant last week and another the week before that. The illuminated towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral loom against the lightening sky as Montravers pedals to his morning meeting. There, he and other hospital administrators discuss how best to divvy up their beds and personnel. One of the questions he’s asking himself as he rides is what might the next 48 hours hold? Should he mothball more operating rooms to divert additional resources to fighting the virus? “The situation at the hospital is complicated because we’re not sure where we are going, exactly,” he says. From personal experience, Montravers is doubly aware of how the virus can spring nasty surprises. He and his wife, who also works in a hospital, “were totally destroyed for two weeks” when they were infected, laid low by fevers, headaches, pain and coughs. He lost 5 kg (11 pounds) of muscle, which he is now trying to regain on his bike. But the good news on his morning ride was that the previous night had been calm in his critical care department; they took in just one additional coronavirus patient, a 70-year-old woman with breathing difficulties. They still had beds to spare in an operating room that was converted for critical-care use in case of any sudden avalanche of virus cases. So far, they had not been needed.“It’s not an overwhelming tide, as we could have been expecting,” he said. “Things are not doing so badly and not as badly as we expected one month ago.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-surge-paris-hospitals-begin-to-see-signs-of-hope/story-iGGcdXvYrKMrUCJEGmrpSP.html

The emergency listing will allow vaccines to be made available faster when there is a threat, and could pave the way for similar measures to be adopted for a Covid-19 product, it said.“The assessment essentially weighs the threat posed by the emergency against the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product based on a robust body of evidence,” the organization said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-approves-first-ever-vaccine-for-emergency-use-against-polio/story-Q6ICtIaMmH90j7gcp2OKON.html

We went down less and we went up more, which is quite a combination of facts,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. The coronavirus has killed 244,302 people with over 10 million confirmed cases in the US so far. “While healthy Americans have gone back to work and to school, we continue to spare no expense to protect the elderly and vulnerable. According to some estimates, a national lockdown cost USD 50 billion a day and hundreds of thousands of jobs every single day,” he said. “Ideally we won’t go to a lockdown. This administration will not be going to a lockdown. Hopefully... whatever happens in the future. Who knows which administration it will be. I guess time will tell. But I can tell you this administration will not go to a lockdown,” Trump said. According to media projections, Democrat Joe Biden, 77, has won the November 3 presidential election. However, Trump, the Republican incumbent, has alleged election fraud and mounted legal fights in a number of battleground states.Also Read: Joe Biden, set to take over as US President in Jan 2021, tweets urgent action needed on Covid-19 “There won’t be necessity.

Lockdown, among other things, he said, results in depression, loss of jobs, and business closures. “It’s a terrible thing. So this administration, under no circumstances, will go to a lockdown. But we’ll be very vigilant, very careful. We understand the disease. It’s a complicated disease but we understand it very well,” he said. He asked all Americans to remain vigilant especially as the weather gets colder and it becomes difficult to go outside and to have outside gatherings.

Johnson issued his 10 Downing Street statement to mark the “spectacular, joyful festival of Diwali”, which bursts through the autumnal darkness with an underlying theme of hope and triumph over Covid-19.Also Read: PM Modi greets nation on Diwali, hopes for ‘brightness and happiness’ “This year, perhaps more than any other, Diwali holds a potent meaning for all of us; because just as surely as Lord Rama defeated the demon king Ravana and brought his wife Sita home, and just as Diwali celebrates the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, so too – I have every confidence – that we shall triumph over Covid-19,” Johnson said. He reiterated the “mantra” for a year when Diwali is being marked in a locked down setting across the UK for people to wash hands, wear a face covering, and keep their distance from anyone not part of the household. “Let’s all take comfort from the meaning at the heart of this fantastic festival. And let the many millions of Diwali lights all over the world shine through the darkness as beacons of hope for a better future,” he said, adding his wishes for British Sikhs for Bandi Chhor Divas. Meanwhile, Prince Charles released a Diwali message video through his South Asian diaspora-led charity British Asian Trust and pointed out how the festival this year coincides with his own 72nd birthday. “The Festival of Lights is, I know, a special time for families and friends to come together to share gifts and sweets and to enjoy each other’s companies. Very sadly this year, the ongoing public health crisis means that this will simply not be possible for so many of you and I can so well imagine how difficult and disappointing this must be,” said the heir to the British throne.Also Read: ‘Very poor’ tag for Delhi’s air as IMD predicts foggy Diwali “Amid these strange and difficult circumstances, however, I hope that you might still draw strength from the message of Diwali – that ultimately good will triumph over evil, hope over despair and light over darkness,” he said. The royal also praised the British Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities for coming together to do really “vital work” during the pandemic as symbolic of the underlying Diwali message of “timeless values of duty and service”, which resonates with people of all faiths and none. “Together you are an indispensable part of what makes this country so special. Happy Diwali and a happy, peaceful and prosperous year ahead,” he said, as he concluded his message by lighting a candle and the words “Shubh Diwali”. The Leader of the Opposition Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer, also struck a similar note with his Diwali and Bandi Chhor message for British Hindus and Sikhs. “As the Hindu community celebrates this time of victory of good over evil, lightness over darkness and knowledge over ignorance, we are reminded of the hope that Diwali brings,” he said in a statement. “This is particularly significant this year as the world battles the health, economic and social crisis caused by Covid-19...as you light your lamps and pray for happiness and prosperity for all, remember that light will always dispel the darkness of despair and that these difficult times will also come to pass and be replaced by times of great joy and celebration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-prince-charles-mark-diwali-with-victory-of-light-over-darkness-messages/story-pYhOLWChN47gUoenLRdHlM.html

14-11-2020||World||Covid-19 in US: Oregon, New Mexico order lockdown as other states resist||The governors of Oregon and New Mexico ordered near-lockdowns Friday in the most aggressive response yet to the latest wave of coronavirus infections shattering records across the US, even as many of their counterparts in other states show little appetite for reimposing the hard-line restrictions of last spring.“We are in a life-or-death situation, and if we don’t act right now, we cannot preserve the lives, we can’t keep saving lives, and we will absolutely crush our current health care system and infrastructure,” Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico said in imposing a two-week stay-at-home order.Oregon Gov. Kate Brown ordered a two-week “freeze” starting Wednesday, under which all businesses will be required to close their offices to the public and mandate work-from-home “to the greatest extent possible.”While most Oregon stores will remain open, gyms, museums, pools, movie theaters and zoos will be forced to close, and restaurants and bars will be limited to takeout. Social gatherings will be restricted to six people.The Democratic governor warned that violators could face fines or arrest.“For the last eight months, I have been asking Oregonians to follow to the letter and the spirit of the law, and we have not chosen to engage law enforcement,” Brown said. “At this point in time, unfortunately, we have no other option.”Both states had lockdowns earlier in the year, but the coronavirus is coming back with a vengeance across the country, and the US is facing a long, dark winter. The scourge is blamed for 10.7 million confirmed infections and almost a quarter-million deaths in the US, with the closely watched University of Washington model projecting nearly 439,000 dead by March 1.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicDeaths have climbed to about 1,000 a day on average. New cases per day are soaring, reaching another all-time high on Thursday of more than 153,000. Hospitals are getting swamped.Still, there is little will among many governors and other elected officials for going back to the kind of lockdowns and large-scale business closings seen last spring. Some governors also continue to resist issuing statewide mask rules.Among the reasons given: public fatigue, fear of doing more damage to already-crippled businesses, lack of support from Washington, and the way efforts to tame the virus have become fiercely politicized.“I think that governors and mayors are, again, in a really tough spot. The American population is emotionally and economically exhausted,” Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.President Donald Trump asked all Americans to remain “vigilant” but ruled out a nationwide “lockdown.”“Hopefully, whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be, I guess time will tell, but I can tell you this administration will not go to a lockdown,” Trump said in his first public remarks since his defeat by President-elect Joe Biden.Governors in many states, such as New York, Maryland, Virginia and Minnesota, have taken largely incremental measures over the past few days, such as limiting the size of gatherings, making businesses close early, restricting capacity or cutting off alcohol sales earlier in the evening.Nevada Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak has repeatedly argued that containing the virus is largely up to individuals.“Some people are going to ask, ‘Why not limit retail, or casino resorts, or restaurants right now?’ That’s a fair question,” he said. “That is the tightrope of trying to balance controlling the Covid-19 spread, protecting our hospitals from surges, and at the same time, not destroying and shutting down our economy.”In Texas, which this week became the first state to surpass 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has emphasized new treatments and vaccines that are expected to become available soon.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has taken an even harder line against new restrictions, suing after El Paso closed nonessential businesses because of a surge so severe that mobile morgues are being brought in. An appeals court Thursday temporarily lifted the shutdown.Officials have gotten pushback from some constituents, especially business owners who fear for their livelihoods.In Ohio, Bahram Akradi, founder, chairman and CEO of Life Time health clubs, objected when the governor added gyms to a list of businesses that could be shuttered if cases continue to rise.“Another shutdown would just be completely devastating and simply unjust,” Akradi said. He added: “The damage of not allowing people to have healthy activity is much more than the gain.”Also Read| ‘Operation Warp Speed made Pfizer vaccine possible’: US president Donald TrumpIn Montana, where cases are up more than 16% in the past week, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock said he is wary of imposing tougher statewide restrictions without additional federal aid to unemployed individuals and small businesses.“I never wanted to punish the businesses that are doing right in this pandemic to keep their employees and customers safe. Shutting down those businesses would do just that,” he said.The political perils of statewide mandates have been on display in Wisconsin. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers issued a “safer at home” order in March that was challenged by Republican lawmakers and struck down by the conservative-controlled state Supreme Court in May.The result has been a hodgepodge of local limits across the state, with some of the strictest in places like Milwaukee, which is moving forward with imposing steep fines of between $500 and $5,000 for violations of local health orders.Other governors have likewise relied on local and county officials to tackle the crisis, creating a patchwork of restrictions around the country. But that strategy has its limits against a virus.In Tennessee, Nashville Mayor John Cooper said he doesn’t plan on reinstating restrictions on the city’s honky-tonks and other businesses. He said shutting down just one county would probably be ineffective against the virus because the surrounding areas wouldn’t be following the same guidelines.“We are also subject to what goes on in our state, and we can’t keep just our county safe,” Cooper said.Some economists say the crisis has been falsely portrayed as a choice between the economy and public health. Instead, they argue that the economy cannot recover until the virus is brought under control and people are confident enough to go shopping, eat at restaurants and do other things again.Experts have argued, too, that strict but relatively short lockdowns could ultimately result in less economic pain than the half-measures employed now, which have only succeeded in dragging out the crisis.Dr. Michael Fine, former director of Rhode Island’s Health Department, said the outbreak requires more aggressive strategies. Closing bars earlier in the evening, he said, “might have worked in July, but there’s not a chance they’ll work now. It’s like taking an eyedropper to a forest fire.”“Short of very profound lockdowns, I don’t think we have a chance of slowing the spread,” Fine said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-in-us-oregon-new-mexico-order-lockdown-as-other-states-resist/story-rxvhwc7YsCDOFIu3FlsfbP.html
14-11-2020||World||She fell from the sky: How the Covid-19 pandemic crashed into Russia’s legendary space city||The Star City Closed Administrative Territorial Unit is barely an hour’s drive northeast of the Kremlin, but for decades the town never appeared on any maps. Only after the Soviet Union fell apart was its location revealed.Even now, it is shrouded by forests, and behind its tall concrete walls lies the somber infrastructure of Russia’s legendary space program, and the Soviet-era apartment blocks that its cosmonauts and scientists call home.Star City’s medical clinic stands in a wooded area just past a monument to Yuri Gagarin, who became the first man in space in 1961, and a soaring symbol of Cold War-era glory. To this day, flowers are often placed at his feet.For around a decade, physician Natalya Lebedeva worked out of the Star City clinic as a paramedic. One autumn, she and another doctor were called out to the 12th-floor apartment of a young musician.“We walk in and he’s in nothing but his underwear,” the other paramedic recalled. “And Natalya screams, ‘Grab him!’“Click here for complete coronavirus coverageThe young man was heading for the open window.“If she hadn’t screamed, I wouldn’t have noticed. It didn’t even cross my mind that he might try to jump,” the paramedic said.They wrestled the young man away from the ledge. “It’s good that he was wearing underwear, at least. Otherwise, I don’t know what I might have grabbed.”Bleak tales peppered with black humor were part of everyday life for Lebedeva and her team as they navigated Russia’s often maddeningly bureaucratic and underfunded medical system.So was the pressure, working in a close-knit and closed-off town, a place of rumor and recrimination, heroism and national pride.“Star City is not just some city. The residents there are not easy,” said Irina Antropova, who worked with Lebedeva on the town’s ambulance service from 2006 until 2009. Fewer than 6,000 people live in the town’s dozen or so apartment blocks, many of them working for the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. “They are cosmonauts, the families of cosmonauts, military personnel.”In the circular building housing the training center’s centrifuge, a 300-ton arm spins cosmonauts around an 18-meter radius until the force of gravity acting on their bodies is multiplied up to eight times, replicating the feeling of re-entering the atmosphere, of falling to Earth.A new diseaseWhen the first whispers of a new disease in China reached Russia in January, Lebedeva, a doctor trained in neurology, was working as the head of Star City’s ambulance service.The team was close, ambulance driver Vladimir Chizhenko said. “We all lived as one collective.”But medical work in Star City wasn’t standard fare. The clinic’s head doctor, Olga Minina, once received a late-night call on her mobile phone from a worried father asking about the health of his child. The father was cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev, and he was calling from space.Covid-19: Deaths, cases breaking global recordsThe town’s status, and the fame of its residents, ramped up the stress. Rumors spread fast in the insular town. “As it is a closed city, and outsiders do not have access to the territory, they all live there, stewing in this world of theirs,” Antropova said.Lebedeva, 51, wasn’t married and lived alone. Private and independent by nature, friends said, she responded to the panopticоn in which she lived by keeping to herself.“Of course, everyone was interested in her personal life,” Antropova said. “So she kept it all very secret.”Lebedeva had moved to the Moscow region from her hometown in southern Russia after her mother died, and she began working as a Star City doctor in the 2000s.In 2009, the town stopped being a military base. But its clinic, though now fully civilian, didn’t join the standard Russian healthcare system. Instead, in 2010 it entered the structure of the Federal Medical and Biological Agency (FMBA), a sparse network of medical facilities servicing Russia’s nuclear facilities and security services, the high-level scientific research sector and aerospace.Under the FMBA, with its direct reporting line to the Kremlin, Star City’s clinic was a highly strung place.Lebedeva was a buffer, shielding her team of drivers and paramedics, defending them in disputes, four members of the team said, recalling fierce arguments with the head doctor over hours and pay.“Then we would spend time ‘resuscitating’ her after those meetings,” said a medical worker who spoke on condition of anonymity.Minina, the head doctor, said that she and Lebedeva were close, even in the tense atmosphere of Star City.“The residents who are on my watch, each one of them is a celebrity,” Minina said. “So, of course I can be quite tough, because for me – one misstep and it’s the firing squad.”Minina recalled occasions when she too would shield Lebedeva and the ambulance team from complaints. They’d leave work together, exhausted, she said, but Lebedeva would still suggest they get coffee together, or go visit the church across town.“We may have had our differences,” Minina said. “But she was a person that I could call at 4 a.m. and she’d get the job done. I trusted her very much.”Antropova, the ambulance leader’s former coworker, said Lebedeva would take all the stress in her stride, saying, “Well, yes, well, yes, it’s not easy, but Irina, I’ll survive it.”But even before the pandemic hit, she seemed different, ambulance driver Chizhenko said. She’d stopped joining the team on their lunch breaks, going for a walk instead, he said.“I would tell her, why are you putting up with this? Leave this job. With your qualifications, you can always find another job. And recently, she had started to agree with me.”On February 28, Chizhenko, tired of battles over pay, worked his last shift before handing in his notice. Two days later, the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in Moscow was discovered.Preparing for spaceThat day, March 1, NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy arrived in Star City to prepare, together with two Russian cosmonauts, for a six-month stint on the International Space Station.As they trained, coronavirus cases in Russia crept up, and restrictions grew. “I hear the streets in Moscow are quiet and empty,” Cassidy told a specialist spaceflight magazine toward the end of the month. “Here in Star City, it’s kind of like this oasis in the woods.”On March 23, the astronauts laid flowers by Gagarin’s statue, and the next day set off for Russia’s space launch facility in Kazakhstan. It would be Star City’s last public event before lockdowns began.Microsoft says Covid-19 researchers were targeted by Russian, North Korean hackersWithin a week, the number of reported coronavirus cases in Russia had shot up four times to more than 1,500. Moscow and the surrounding region – including Star City – went into lockdown. Regulations were strict: Residents could leave their homes only to reach the nearest shop or pharmacy, or to walk pets within a 100-meter radius.Hospitals and healthcare workers across Moscow began to prepare for a crisis.“He warned us”Raisa Ketseleva, daughter of Star City ambulance driver Victor Ketselev, 59, said her father had planned to be on holiday in Belarus in April.“When this whole pandemic started … Dad had a big meeting at work and they said that it would reach their facility, too,” she said. So he canceled his trip. “He said: ‘I’m not going to abandon my colleagues. I will stay and work.’“Ketseleva said that at first, she didn’t understand how serious the pandemic was. Many friends simply didn’t believe the coronavirus was real. “They didn’t show us that sort of thing” on state TV. Her father, though, “understood that it was an illness that could end in death. He warned us.”He also told her that despite his ambulance work, the only protective equipment he had was a basic face mask.Lebedeva was keenly aware of the danger facing her team. “She was very anxious about her work, about her department, about us … and members of our families, because all this fell on her shoulders,” her deputy, senior paramedic Marina Izmaylova, recalled.Lebedeva began to lobby for staff to have access to protective gear and coronavirus tests, former coworker Antropova said.“They were not being tested at the start of April,” Antropova said Lebedeva told her at the time. “The head doctor was refusing to test them, because if anyone tested positive, they would have had to put everyone” on quarantine. And if that happened, Star City would be left without medical care.Head doctor Minina, however, painted a different picture: She said she personally secured 200 test kits – hard to come by at the time – from a research institute in Moscow. But there were guidelines and systems in place, and it was too early to test staff when there were no confirmed cases in the town, she said.Some protective gear, earmarked for pandemic response, had been provided by the FMBA, and the team had far better kit than in neighboring clinics. Still, Minina said, she searched hard for additional supplies, amid a “super deficit” of masks on the market. In a statement, the FMBA said Star City’s clinic was provided with sufficient PPE for visits to patients with suspected COVID-19 and that testing of staff began March 25.On April 2, the problem of testing and protective equipment blew up into an argument in the Star City clinic, said a doctor at the clinic who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Everything started boiling there,” the doctor said.The virus reaches star cityOn April 11, on the eve of Star City’s annual celebration of Gagarin’s liftoff into space, ambulance driver Ketselev developed a sore throat.On April 13, his temperature began to rise, his daughter said.On April 15, his colleagues from the Star City clinic showed up to do a coronavirus test. A top Gagarin Training Center official had just tested positive, and mass testing of clinic staff had begun.The next day, Ketselev’s test came back positive, his daughter said.By that point, his shift partner had developed a cough. The partner’s wife and child were coughing, too, Ketselev’s daughter said. The third ambulance driver, a young man who had replaced Chizhenko when he quit, also fell ill, Chizhenko said.Cloth masks highly preventive against Covid-19, says new CDC studyOn April 18, with his temperature soaring, Ketselev called Lebedeva and told her he was in agony. She said he should go to hospital, and after a long night searching for bed space, Ketselev was taken away in an ambulance. His daughter spent the next morning frantically ringing hospitals in the area, trying to work out where he might be.By April 22, 27 staff members of the Star City clinic had tested positive for coronavirus, a letter sent to the town’s mayor on that date showed. So had 10 of their family members. Head doctor Minina, too, was in the ICU, with damage to 75% of her lungs, she said.In the letter, cardiologist Svetlana Zakharova, who had taken over from Minina, asked the mayor to press the Moscow region health ministry for support.” The organization of medical support for the population of the Star City Closed Administrative Territorial Unit has become exceptionally difficult, especially the provision of emergency medical care,” according to the letter, seen by Reuters.“At that point … we were truly fighting for our lives,” said senior paramedic Izmaylova, who was also hospitalized with severe COVID symptoms.On April 20, Lebedeva was hospitalized in Moscow after testing positive.Before liftoff, a close encounterIn the days before the virus started to spread in Star City, the three astronauts were preparing for liftoff at the Russian cosmodrome in Baikonur.On the morning of April 9, liftoff day, the three men, dressed in their white spacesuits, met with Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency. They also met with Evgeny Mikrin, deputy head of RSC Energia, which had built the Soyuz rocket they were about to take.The astronauts spoke with the officials through a wall of glass, a quarantine measure. They walked out to the launchpad without the traditional crowds of well-wishers lining their way. At 11:05 a.m. Moscow time, they blasted into space.Two days after returning from the liftoff, rocket designer Mikrin, 64, started to feel unwell. A coronavirus test came back positive.Covid-19 vaccine could make social divisions worseOn April 12, Andrey Voloshin, a pilot and Gagarin Training Center official, also tested positive, a test results message seen by Reuters showed, becoming Star City’s first confirmed case. He had not attended the liftoff, but had met the party returning from Baikonur, Star City Mayor Evgeny Barishevsky said.By the end of the month, 10 employees of the Gagarin Training Center had tested positive, local authorities reported. The space agency said 173 employees of Russia’s overall aerospace industry were sick, and six had died.Mikrin would die of the disease on May 5. President Vladimir Putin wrote a short statement expressing his condolences online.A spokesman for the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, said that the liftoff group had tested negative immediately before and after the trip to Baikonur. Although tests were known to be unreliable in those early days, he said, there was no concern because strict quarantine measures had been followed throughout the liftoff.Still, within weeks of Russia’s first confirmed case, the coronavirus had penetrated the closed walls of Star City and crossed the high-security gates of its cosmonaut training center. It had radiated across Russia’s revered space program during a moment of international attention and national pride, and had, potentially, come within an inch of glass away from traveling to space in a cosmonaut.The search for someone to blameIn Star City, with the clinic in the grip of the outbreak, a hunt was launched for someone to blame, the doctor at the clinic said.“They wanted to blame us, that it was us that infected them, not the other way around,” the doctor said of officials with the space program. “They wanted to blame the doctors.“And then they started coming down hard on [Lebedeva], claiming she fell ill, infected everyone,” the doctor said.Head doctor Minina said she didn’t know of any probe into the outbreak at the time; she herself was already in the hospital. But she said that reports had spread widely around the town blaming Lebedeva for rocket designer Mikrin’s positive test – despite the fact that he wasn’t a resident, and the two had had no contact at all. But the rumor was there.A Roscosmos spokesman said he recalled some talk of accusations of negligence at the time, but it did not come from the space agency. “We did not initiate [any investigation] ... nor add to any rumors,” he said. That wouldn’t even be within the agency’s purview, he said.According to the Gagarin Training Center, responding to a request for comment, the center had no issues with the Star City clinic’s work at all.Lebedeva phoned several colleagues and close friends from her hospital bed, four people said. She had been admitted to the central FMBA hospital #83 in Moscow.Her illness wasn’t severe. “Her temperature was a little over 37 degrees,” or 98.6 Fahrenheit, and “her lungs were affected only to a small degree,” her friend Antropova said.During several calls from the ward, Lebedeva repeatedly said that she was being blamed for being the source of the outbreak, a friend said. “She called me and said … ‘I am going to be jailed. It’s the end for me.’““I said … ‘How were you supposed to have prevented this, how? How? Come on. What are you, God?’“ the friend recalled.But Lebedeva was in tears. She said she had been contacted by investigators from the police.Ketseleva, the ambulance driver’s daughter, said that some weeks later, Star City police officer Maxim Statsenko visited her at home. He refused to disclose what he was investigating, she said. “But I asked him questions, of course, and I understood that they were searching for who fell sick first.”Reuters called Officer Statsenko to ask him about Lebedeva and his investigation. “I don’t know anything,” he said, and hung up.In a statement, the FMBA said: “The detection of COVID-19 among the employees of [the Star City clinic] led to an internal audit by the management of the FMBA’s interregional directorate #170. No charges were brought against N.V. Lebedeva as a result of the audit. The management of the FMBA and the [Star City clinic] also had no issues with the work of N.V. Lebedeva.”Star City doctors criticized the idea of blaming anyone at all during a pandemic or searching for who infected whom. “We did everything by the book,” head doctor Minina said. “I’m a doctor, not a ballerina. I got sick because I was on the front line.”On April 23, ambulance driver Ketselev was hooked up to a ventilator. Chances of recovery for patients on a ventilator were known to be low.From her hospital bed, Lebedeva wrote a WhatsApp message to Minina: “I have understood that this is the virus of panic and fear.”A fall to earthLebedeva was last active on WhatsApp at 00:21 on Friday, April 24, said a friend and former colleague at the Star City clinic, Natalya Zhernakova.That day, several friends couldn’t reach her by phone. They began calling the FMBA hospital, friend Antropova recalled, but “the hospital told them that all information about Lebedeva was ‘closed.’“On Saturday, Lebedeva’s friends contacted the Star City clinic ambulance service, Antropova said. “And her colleagues already… They had already received the information,” Antropova said, her voice breaking.“They had been told that Natalya … had committed suicide.”She had fallen from the window of the Moscow hospital’s coronavirus ward and died from her injuries, a television channel reported.The FMBA released a statement on April 27: “On April 24, 2020, as the result of an unfortunate accident, Natalya Lebedeva tragically died.”The word “accident” angered many of Lebedeva’s friends, who believe she committed suicide out of desperation.Responding to a request for comment, the FMBA said her death was a tragic event and that law enforcement officials have opened an investigation.With no confirmation of the manner of Lebedeva’s death from the FMBA, the town stewed.“They’ll cover it all up, because it’s space. Serious people are involved,” the doctor at the clinic said. “That’s why they wanted to blame it all on the ambulance service.”A week after Lebedeva’s death, Ketseleva was told that her father, the ambulance driver, had died. Her mother was left to grieve alone and in quarantine for another month.Ketseleva was sent a video, seen by Reuters. The person recording it walks through the empty corridors of Star City’s clinic. Benches are cordoned off with red-and-white hazard tape. At reception, the camera turns a corner.There, under a bouquet of flowers, stand portraits of Ketselev and Lebedeva, a black ribbon on each.Swan songIn early May, a funeral cortege traveled slowly through Star City, followed by two ambulances with sirens on throughout. The coffin for Lebedeva, whose surname is derived from the Russian word for swan, lebed, was white.Star City resident Dmitry Saraev and others wrote on social media of watching from their windows. “This mourning escort became Natasha’s swan song, performed not by her but by her staff and vehicles,” Saraev wrote.Star City ambulance dispatcher Tatyana Krivushina, 65, fell sick soon after her mother, who died in late May. Krivushina died on June 6.In the last days of August, the head of the FMBA, Veronika Skvortsova, visited Star City. Pulling up in a black Mercedes, she toured the Gagarin Training Center, posing for a photograph in front of а Soyuz rocket training simulator.Skvortsova also toured the Star City clinic. Among her festive welcome party was Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space.Skvortsova talked to doctors and inspected the clinic’s equipment, an official video showed. In the 2.5-minute clip, the outbreak at the clinic wasn’t mentioned.At one point on her tour, Skvortsova visited the clinic’s reception area. A press photo shows her standing in the corner by a noticeboard.Behind her is the table on which the memorial bouquet was placed next to the framed photographs of Ketselev and Lebedeva. By the time of the official visit, the flowers and the portraits were gone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/she-fell-from-the-sky-how-the-covid-19-pandemic-crashed-into-russia-s-legendary-space-city/story-pMvc5aDo120btkbAzL1hCO.html
14-11-2020||World||‘Operation Warp Speed made Pfizer vaccine possible’: US president Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump on Friday said that Operation Warp Speed made it possible for Pfizer to develop its coronavirus vaccine in partnership with BioNTech while addressing the press at the White House. Operation Warp Speed a joint partnership program between several drugmakers, US Defence Department and the US Health and Human Services to help speed up the research, development, production and manufacturing of vaccines to stop the spread of coronavirus. ‘It’s been an incredible effort. As a result of Operation Warp Speed, Pfizer announced on Monday that it’s China virus vaccine is more than 90% effective,” said Donald Trump who was accompanied by the chief adviser for the Defense Department’s Project Warp Speed Moncef Slaoui and vice president Mike Pence. This is the first time the US president has spoken publicly after his defeat in the US presidential election. LIVE: President @realDonaldTrump delivers an update on Operation Warp Speed https://t.co/6UQ0SZMsCQ“In July my administration reached an agreement with Pfizer to provide $1.95 billion to support the manufacturing and distribution of 100 million doses… Our investment will allow citizens access to the vaccine made by Pfizer free of charge. Pfizer said that they are not a part of Operation Warp Speed but it turned out to be an unfortunate misrepresentation. They are a part of it, that’s why we gave them $1.95 billion,” he further added. He said that his administration made it possible to develop a treatment ‘ahead of schedule’ and compared to that any other administration would take ‘four or five years’ to do the same. Trump also said that his administration is working to secure an emergency use authorization following which distribution process will be charted out. He said it is a ‘matter of a few weeks’ till they figure out the distribution process.Frontline workers, elderly population and high-risk individuals will be inoculated in the beginning, said the US president. Trump also said that there will be no lockdown and cited that it results in loss of livelihoods. He said, “This administration will not go into a lockdown. It leads to depression, job losses, loss of livelihoods and costs lives.”He further said, “Hopefully whatever happens in the future, who knows, which administration it will be, I guess time will tell, but I can tell you this administration will not go to a lockdown.”Trump also praised his own administration for the handling of the pandemic and said that it is doing better than most of its ‘peer countries’. He also said that the US continues to test in large numbers and has a low case fatality rate. US has recorded more than 11,000,000 cases so far and its death toll is now close to 250,000. It has recorded more than 100,000 cases for the last two days in a row. Praising his handling of the US economy, Trump said, “We reduced unemployment by half and we have doubled our growth. This is rapid recovery when compared to other Western nations. We went down less, went up more.”Trump also took a jibe at New York governor Andrew Cuomo who has earlier said that his administration will set up a team which will review the vaccine and recently lamented that the Trump administration will be in charge of vaccine distribution. Trump said that Cuomo is doing the wrong thing from the perspective of public health and accused him of politicising the situation. He said, “New York does not trust the vaccine. It pains me. Cuomo has to let us know when they are ready.” Trump also said that they are ready to roll out the vaccines for New York as soon they let the government know that they are ready.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/operation-warp-speed-made-pfizer-vaccine-possible-us-president-donald-trump/story-9On6rtIrlhFSAExomqHABL.html
14-11-2020||World||Rishi Sunak appeals for virtual Diwali in UK; lights diyas||Calling himself a “practicing Hindu”, chancellor Rishi Sunak lit diyas outside his house in Downing Street and on Friday appealed to the Indian community in the UK to celebrate Diwali virtually, admitting that this year the celebrations will be “difficult”.Diwali has almost become a mainstream festival in the UK, with members of the royal family, ministers and others joining celebrations in temples and highlighting its message of triumph of good over evil. The Prime Minister holds a Diwali reception every year.However, the Downing Street reception will not be held this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, home secretary Priti Patel and others took to social media to wish people. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall also extended greetings.Sunak, son-in-law of Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy, appealed to people to follow restrictions in force in the current lockdown to last until December 2. Several councils and the London mayor have cancelled public celebrations, opting for virtual events.Sunak said: “Faith is important to me, I’m a practising Hindu, I pray with my kids, visit the temple when I can. For us as Hindus, Diwali is special, and it’s going to be difficult this year.

14-11-2020||World||Microsoft says Covid-19 researchers were targeted by Russian, North Korean hackers||Hackers working for the Russian and North Korean governments have targeted more than half a dozen organizations involved in Covid-19 treatment and vaccine research around the globe, Microsoft said on Friday.The software company said a Russian hacking group commonly nicknamed “Fancy Bear” - along with a pair of North Korean actors dubbed “Zinc” and “Cerium” by Microsoft - were implicated in recent attempts to break into the networks of seven pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers in Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the United States.Microsoft said the majority of the targets were organizations that were in the process of testing Covid-19 vaccines. Most of the break-in attempts failed but an unspecified number succeeded, it added.Few other details were provided by Microsoft. It declined to name the targeted organizations, say which ones had been hit by which actor, or provide a precise timeline or description of the attempted intrusions.The Russian embassy in Washington - which has repeatedly disputed allegations of Russian involvement in digital espionage - said in an email that there was “nothing that we can add” to their previous denials.North Korea’s representative to the United Nations did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Pyongyang has previously denied carrying out hacking abroad.The allegations of cyber espionage come as world powers are jockeying behind the scenes in the race to produce a vaccine for the virus.They also highlight how Microsoft is pressing its case for a new set of global rules barring digital intrusions aimed at healthcare providers.Microsoft executive Tom Burt said in a statement his company was timing its announcement with Microsoft President Brad Smith’s appearance at the virtual Paris Peace Forum, where he would call on world leaders “to affirm that international law protects health care facilities and to take action to enforce the law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-says-covid-19-researchers-were-targeted-by-russian-north-korean-hackers/story-b3SthPm4d5EXBi15h1N4nL.html

14-11-2020||India||Covid-19 spike in Delhi: Kejriwal likely to meet Amit Shah next week||Amid a sudden spike of Covid-19 cases in the Capital, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is likely to meet Union home minister Amit Shah next week requesting additional beds for Covid-19 patients in the Centre-run hospitals in Delhi. Apart from more beds, Kejriwal may ask for further assistance, including ensuring cooperation from other states in controlling pollution which is leading to rise in coronavirus cases during the festive season, sources said to PTI.During the first wave of Covid-19 in Delhi in June-July, Union home minister Amit Shah had intervened and a centre-state combined approach was credited for mitigating the situation.Since the last week of October, Delhi has been seeing a sudden jump in the number of daily infections. Death toll in a day has also breached 100-mark on November 13. After Diwali, the daily infections may rise to 15,000, as it has been projected. In view of the projected number, the AAP-led Delhi government had earlier requested Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to augment the bed capacity in those hospitals. In a letter to Vardhan last week, Kejriwal had cited a shortfall of around 4,900 beds in hospitals and sought his direction to the hospitals run by the central government in Delhi to provide at least 1,092 additional beds, including 300 ICU beds, with the required medical staff.Kejriwal on Friday said the COVID-19 situation in the national capital should come under control in seven to 10 days.“Covid-19 cases have been increasing for the last few days. I am also concerned about it. We have been taking all appropriate measures to control it. We are considering taking more steps next week. I think the situation should come under control in seven to 10 days and the cases should start decreasing,” he had said.The Delhi high court has recently rapped the AAP government for relaxing the restrictions. Noting that the government is doing everything under the Sun to “unlock things”, the high court allowed it to reserve 80 per cent of beds in the intensive care units of the private hospitals for Covid-19 patients.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-spike-in-delhi-kejriwal-likely-to-amit-shah-next-week/story-EGFugfVoemWNUFcZ7HKeeO.html
14-11-2020||India||8 years after IPS officer died by suicide, Chhattisgarh cops to probe death||The Chhattisgarh government has constituted a panel headed by a director general of police rank officer to probe the suicide of an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer and then Bilaspur district’s Superintendent of Police (SP) in 2012, officials said on Saturday. According to an order issued by the government, the five-member committee will be headed by Director General of Police (Jail) Sanjay Pillai and other officials. They will probe the death of 2002-batch Chhattisgarh cadre IPS officer, Rahul Sharma (37) who shot himself with his service revolver in the police officers’ mess in Bilaspur on March 12, 2012. The BJP government in the state at that time had recommended a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which had ruled out any foul play in the death of Sharma after investigation and the agency had filed its closure report in 2013, a senior official said. After the Congress came in power in 2018, some leaders had been demanding probe into Sharma’s suicide Senior officials said that the latest probe announced by the government eight years after the incident will carry out an extensive investigation into some points mentioned by the CBI in its report into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-years-after-ips-officer-died-by-suicide-chhattisgarh-cops-to-probe-death/story-67kdF0KSobB4t1lVDC9hDL.html
14-11-2020||India||India concerned over situation in South China Sea that ‘erode trust’||Against the backdrop of China’s assertive activities in the South China Sea, India on Saturday expressed concern over actions in the region that erode trust and said a proposed code of conduct for the disputed waters shouldn’t affect the legitimate interests of third parties. External affairs minister S Jaishankar outlined India’s position on the South China Sea while representing the country at the East Asia Summit, which brings together the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), India, Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand South Korea, Russia and the US. With Chinese Premier Li Keqiang watching, Jaishankar pointed to the importance of adhering to international law, respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty, and promoting a rules-based global order. Without naming China, Jaishankar expressed concern about actions and incidents in the South China Sea that “erode trust” and said ongoing negotiations on the proposed code of conduct “should not be prejudicial to legitimate interests of third parties and should be fully consistent” with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The minister’s remarks came amid the India-China border standoff in Ladakh sector along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Both sides are yet to make headway in disengagement and de-escalation despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks since the standoff began in May. China has been pushing the members of Asean to quickly conclude negotiations for the code of conduct for the South China Sea. Premier Li had raised the issue during the Asean-China Summit on Thursday, reflecting Beijing’s efforts to consolidate its influence in the region. The code of conduct is aimed at regulating activities in the South China Sea, where China is embroiled in disputes with Asean members such as Vietnam and the Philippines. The virtual East Asia Summit, chaired by Vietnam Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc in his capacity as chair of Asean, discussed ways to strengthen the platform and make it more responsive to emerging challenges. Jaishankar reaffirmed the importance of the summit as a leaders-led forum to exchange views on strategic issues. He also underlined the need for greater global cooperation in the post-Covid-19 world to tackle challenges cutting across national boundaries such as terrorism, climate change and pandemics. He briefed the summit on India’s response to Covid-19 and reiterated Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s commitment to help make vaccines accessible and affordable to all nations. Jaishankar also noted the growing interest in the Indo-Pacific as an “integrated and organic maritime space with Asean at its centre”. He pointed to the synergy between Asean’s Indo-Pacific outlook and India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and said: “Harmonising various perspectives would never be a challenge if there is commitment to international cooperation.” The leaders underlined the importance of cooperation in ensuring safe, effective and affordable access to Covid-19 vaccines, and sought greater cooperation in keeping global supply chains open for a speedy and sustainable economic recovery. Regional and international issues such as the situation in the Korean peninsula and the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar’s Rakhine state were also discussed. The summit adopted the Hanoi Declaration and four leaders’ statements on marine sustainability, epidemics prevention and response, women, peace and security, and steady growth of the regional economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-concerned-over-situation-in-south-china-sea-that-erode-trust/story-gAdrIY3UugAeOhi9g7YRQJ.html

14-11-2020||India||India summons Pakistani chargé d’affaires to protest civilian deaths in LoC shelling||India on Saturday summoned Pakistan’s chargé d’affaires to lodge a strong protest over unprovoked ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, saying the firing was aimed at supporting cross-border infiltration by terrorists. Aftab Hassan Khan, the acting head of the Pakistan high commission, was summoned by the external affairs ministry a day after the ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops triggered an intense exchange of fire. Nine Indians, including four civilians and five security personnel, were killed while the retaliatory shelling killed at least eight Pakistani soldiers and injured a dozen more. A strong protest was lodged with the Pakistani charge d’affaires over unprovoked ceasefire violations by Pakistani forces in multiple sectors along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir on Friday, resulting in the “death of four innocent civilians and serious injuries to 19 others”, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “India condemns, in the strongest terms, the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians by Pakistani forces,” the statement said. “It is highly deplorable that Pakistan chose a festive occasion in India to disrupt peace and perpetrate violence in Jammu and Kashmir through coordinated firing along the length of the LoC using heavy caliber weapons, including artillery and mortar on Indian civilians,” it added, referring to the festival of Diwali. India also strongly protested “Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorist infiltration into India, including through supporting cover fire provided by Pakistan forces”, the statement said. The Indian side reminded Pakistan of its bilateral commitment to not allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India in any manner. On Saturday, an uneasy calm settled along the LoC in Uri and Gurez sectors after the heavy shelling by the two sides across the de facto border. Following the unprovoked firing by Pakistani forces, the Indian Army had retaliated with artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles. Pakistani ammunition and fuel dumps and terror launch pads were among the targets destroyed by the Indian shelling, officials said. The heavy exchange of fire on the eve of Diwali turned the spotlight on the LoC at a time when Indian and Chinese forces are locked in a standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-summons-pakistani-charge-d-affaires-to-protest-civilian-deaths-in-loc-shelling/story-8MwvXBriUsE4ptuK6NW1QJ.html

14-11-2020||India||Higher temperature may keep Mumbai’s post-Diwali air pollution lower: SAFAR||With Mumbai recording the hottest day this season so far on Saturday, the city is expected to witness marginally lower air pollution post Diwali owing to change in weather factors such as hotter conditions and rise in wind speed, said official at the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).The day temperature recorded at the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the city, was 36 degrees Celsius, 2.4 degree Celsius above normal. Colaba, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 35 degrees Celsius, almost 2 degrees Celsius above normal. Pollution levels were in the ‘moderate’ air quality category on Saturday (Diwali) against a prediction of ‘poor’ air quality. The air quality index (AQI) for all pollutants on Saturday was 111 (moderate) with PM2.5 levels in the satisfactory category at 54 microgrammes per cubic metre (µg/m3) against the safe limit of 60 µg/m3, and AQI for PM2.5 at 98 (satisfactory).SAFAR published a revised air quality forecast for Sunday that said, “A positive development is that the prevailing temperature is not as cooler as expected. Also increase in wind speed may bring relief for Mumbai and the AQI is going to be towards the lower end of the very poor category with a 50% firecrackers (half of the average emissions from firecrackers in 2016-2018) scenario. In case of no firecracker emissions, AQI is likely to remain steady and within poor range only.”Also read: ‘Very poor’ tag for Delhi’s air as IMD predicts foggy DiwaliThe most polluted areas are expected to be Chembur, Mazgaon, and Malad on Sunday. On Saturday, not a single location in Mumbai recorded ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’ air. Bhandup and Navi Mumbai had the cleanest air.“The highest levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are expected between 1 am to 4 am between Saturday night and Sunday morning. Air Quality will start to improve from Monday,” SAFAR said.Against the originally predicted AQI of 338 (very poor), which would have been the worst post Diwali air quality in six years, SAFAR’s revised forcecast said the AQI was expected to be 309 (very poor) on Sunday and 267 (poor) with 50% cracker emissions, and 227 (poor) on Sunday and 203 (poor) on Monday from zero firecracker emissions. SAFAR categorises AQI levels from 0-50 as good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate, 201-300 is poor, 301-400 is very poor, and above 401 is severe.Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR said, “When the temperature and wind speed is low, pollutant particles get suspended closer to the surface but in this case current weather factors can allow slight increase in pollutant particle dispersion.”According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the wind direction changed from cooler northeasterly winds to warmer easterly to southeasterly winds on Saturday allowing the rise in temperatures. The wind speed ranged between 11 and 14 km/hour against the average wind speed over the past three days at 5-6 km/hour. The minimum temperature on Saturday increased to 22 degrees Celsius (a degree Celsius above normal) from 19.6 degrees Celsius on Friday in the suburbs while south Mumbai recorded a 1 degree Celsius rise from Friday to 24 degrees Celsius on Saturday.SAFAR also predicted that the concentration of PM2.5 on Sunday would be over twice the safe limit if firecrackers were used. Against the safe limit of 60µg/m3, Mumbai could record 132 µg/m3 on Sunday (50% firecracker emissions) and 98 µg/m3 (nil emission from firecrackers).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/higher-temperature-may-keep-mumbai-s-post-diwali-air-pollution-lower-safar/story-ynaOgxqBl5TeVJEfTJkNqN.html

The extended family of 11 was headed to Goa for a vacation.The Nair family travelling in a Tempo Traveller bus had left from Vashi for Goa on Friday around 9 pm.The crash took place on the Tarali river bridge on the outskirts of Umbraj village in Karad, Satara between 4.30 am and 5 am, according to the police.“The driver of the vehicle dozed off and ended up crashing off the bridge. The vehicle fell 50 feet from the bridge by the river side,” said AL Gorad, assistant inspector at Umbraj police station.One of the injured occupants called the emergency police helpline number following which a rescue operation was mounted.Five persons including Madhusudhan Nair, 42, his wife Usha, 40, their 23-year-old son Aditya were killed along with Sajan Nair, 35, and his three-year-old son Aarav.The local traffic police officials said the spot where the crash took place is not a blackspot – a location where crashes are more likely to occur. The two-lane bridge is separated by a gap. Incidentally, a spot a few metres after the bridge ends is prone to crashes, police said.“Such a crash has not taken place on the bridge. Nevertheless, crash barriers have been installed on the side of the roads to prevent crashes. It appears the vehicle was at such a high speed that it crashed through the barriers while diving off the bridge,” said Asmita Patil, in-charge at Karad traffic police.The driver and six other members of the Nair family were injured in the crash. All of them are said to be recuperating and out of danger.The injured were rushed to Satara civil hospital and the bodies of the five victims were sent to Karad civil hospital for autopsy.“We contacted their relatives in Mumbai to inform them about the crash. The relatives are on their way,” said an officer from Satara police.The police have registered a case of rash driving and causing death due to negligence against the 30-year-old driver Rinku Gupta. Police said he was sober at the time of the crash but may have been fatigued. After the injured were rescued, the police deployed cranes to pull the vehicle out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-from-navi-mumbai-killed-in-satara-as-bus-plunges-50-ft-from-bridge/story-aFnqOGtnBJFdCuQLyGJJGM.html

Akhilesh is ready to bury the hatchet with estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav and his Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party. And if the SP comes to power, Shivpal’s party will have representation in the cabinet, Akhilesh said. “We will adjust that party too. Jaswantnagar is his (Shivpal Yadav’s) seat and the Samajwadi Party vacated the seat for him. In the coming times, we will make their leader a cabinet minister, and what other adjustment is needed?” Akhilesh said, as quoted by PYI. Shivpal Yadav, the estranged uncle of Akhilesh Yadav, was elected from the Jaswantnagar assembly constituency in the 2017 state elections. He later floated a new political party, Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia), and contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections on its symbol from Firozabad.“When the elections are contested by the election officers, superintendents of police, additional district magistrates, SHOs and police jawans, who will win then. The BJP was not contesting the bypolls but the officials of its government,” Akhilesh said on the performance of his party in the bypolls in the state. In 2017, SP and Congress announced an alliance in the assembly election. BJP had won 312 seats, while the Congress won seven seats and the SP won 47 seats.

Various organisations also came together to distribute goodies to the workers across 144 dormitories which house migrant workers including Indian nationals working in labour-intensive industries here. When the coronavirus pandemic hit Singapore’s shores, the migrant workers in dormitories were the worst affected, with tens of thousands infected. Many were placed in quarantine or under lockdown in an effort to control the spread of the disease, and restrictions were imposed on what they could do on the rest of the days. Currently, they are still largely restricted to their workplaces and dormitories, or approved locations such as recreation centres. “The last few months have been very challenging for our migrant brothers in the dormitories. They have cooperated with measures implemented by the authorities and have generally taken all the controls in the right spirit... (It is) timely during this festive period to recognise and laud the contributions of some of the true heroes of this pandemic - the workers themselves,” Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) chairman Yeo Guat Kwang said on Saturday. Over 1,000 volunteers took part in the initiative organised by the Ministry of Manpower’s Assurance, Care and Engagement (Ace) Group, the Hindu Endowments Board (HEB) and the Coordinating Council of Sikh Institutions (CCSI), The Straits Times reported. From November 12 to 14, the workers received gift packs containing savoury and sweet treats such as murukku and laddu, which were contributed by the three organisers, various Hindu temples, Sikh Gurdwaras and Indian International School here. Meanwhile, Singapore reported two imported Covid-19 cases on Saturday, said the Ministry of Health (MOH), adding that they have been placed on stay-home notice upon arrival here. There was no locally transmitted infection for the fourth consecutive day. The 12 imported cases, reported on Friday, came from France, India, Indonesia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Myanmar, Russia, France and the Netherlands, United States, United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates. Fifty Covid-19 patients are hospitalised while 28 were recuperating in isolated community facilities as of Friday. With six patients discharged on Friday, 58,008 people have fully recovered from the disease in Singapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pre-recorded-prayers-played-in-dormitories-for-migrant-workers-celebrating-diwali-in-singapore/story-Qbn3yz31zxkUIrlUVnPDrJ.html

The civic body has planned to spend Rs 160 crore on various works including repairs, restructuring and widening work of drains at 19 chronic flooding spots in Western suburbs as part of a major overhaul plan for chronic flooding spots across Mumbai. This is expected to increase the water receding time.Civic officials said that some of the work has been well-planned so that it can be finished before the next monsoon but some crucial work will be completed in the next two to three years. The civic work mainly includes re-modelling or new construction of box drains on the SV Road drain from Vrindavan Hotel to Marve Road junction in Malad.“All ward offices were asked to identify localised water-logging spots that can be fixed in the short duration of 6 months. The measures will help excess water, that gets accumulated in areas during monsoon, pass through bigger drains easily. The work is expected to start in January,” an official said requesting anonymity.Apart from this, BMC is also mulling to have flood tanks in the city to hold excess rainwater. The tanks will be constructed along the lines of underground water holding tanks in the Japanese capital, Tokyo, and are likely to be located between Bhandup and Mulund. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner said, “We are now focusing mainly on the civic works that is crucial for next monsoon and ensure that we finish those before that. Flood tanks are a long-term concept that would require thorough studying and planning the scope of work. The work on this front is still ongoing.” The city has witnessed multiple instances of flooding and water-logging for hours in many areas during monsoon this year and reported record-breaking rainfall. Areas like Andheri, Malad, Goregaon, Hindmata, Sion and King Circle among others faced severe water-logging for long hours. The official attributed these disasters to delayed drain cleaning work this year due to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bmc-plans-to-spend-rs-160-crore-to-improve-storm-water-drains-reduce-flooding-during-monsoon/story-XVI4V7OqGCbRknGGRgO0wK.html

The entire pilgrimage would be through the virtual queue system this time, so the usual heavy rush can be regulated, Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran said after a high level meeting of officials to review the final preparations at the temple on Friday. Detailing various measures taken by the government to ensure a smooth pilgrimage in the wake of the pandemic, Surendran said each pilgrim, visiting the shrine, should carry a COVID negative certificate, taken within the last 24 hours. Covid-19 testing kiosks would be opened at Pampa and Nilakkal, the base camps, to help devotees to carry out the test before beginning the trekking. Apart from this, arrangements would be made by the health department to make antigen tests in various centres including, all bus stands and railway stations at Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruvalla,Chengannur and Kottayam, where pilgrims arrive to proceed to the Lord Ayyappa temple, he said. Steps would be taken to ensure social distancing while allowing pilgrims for darshan.

The New York Times has reviewed Obama’s memoir, highlighting the political leaders from around the world he has talked about. According to The New York Times review, Obama has called Rahul Gandhi “a nervous, unformed quality about him, as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject.”Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also find mention in Obama’s memoir among other leaders.

14-11-2020||India||PMLA adjudicating authority dismisses attachment of assets of Kochhars||In a major setback to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in its probe against former ICICI Bank managing director Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar, an Adjudicating Authority under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) has dismissed the attachment of their properties worth Rs 78 crore by the agency. The adjudicating authority has also trashed the premise of the case -- that a loan was given by the ICICI Bank to Videocon Group following which an alleged kickback of Rs 64 crore was paid to Deepak Kochhar. Tushar V Shah (Member, Law), adjudicating authority, said in a detailed 800-page order on Thursday that the loan of Rs 300 crore to Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL) by ICICI Bank in September 2009 was never declared NPA (non-performing asset) and was in line with the credit policy of the bank. He further observed that the loan was repaid; so there was no question of a loss to the bank and that Chanda Kochhar was just one of the members in loan sanctioning committee and that the “decision to sanction any loans could not have been taken by her individually.” Shah also termed the investment of Rs 64 crore in Deepak Kochhar’s Nupower Renewables Ltd (NRL) from Venugopal Dhoot’s SEPL (Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd) a business transaction. He observed that the agency failed to establish that this money was proceeds of crime. “The FIR fails to justify any investigation having been done before alleging the wrongful loss in respect of the said RTL (rupee term loan) of Rs 300 crore from ICICI Bank to M/s VIEL. The said RTL loan account of Rs 300 crores is shown by Chanda Kochhar to be not declared NPA,” the order stated. The federal anti-money laundering agency provisionally attached movable and immovable properties worth Rs 78 crore including Rs 10.5 lakh cash belonging to Kochhars and their flat at CCI Chambers, Church Gate, Mumbai in January . According to the law, a PMLA adjudicating authority has to sign off on any attachment. Regarding the CCI Chambers flat of Kochhars, which the agency has alleged was part of the kickback, the Adjudicating Authority observed: “It is beyond doubt that the flat was purchased by Deepak Kochhar in the year 1995-96 much before the period of alleged scheduled offences i.e. 2009-2012 and prior to coming into force of PMLA, 2002.” He further observed that the “flat was not from the alleged proceeds of crime and the consideration paid way back in the year 1995-96 could not have been designated as proceeds of crime, from any source whatsoever.” He also criticised Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for not yet interrogating senior officials of the bank: Sandeep Bakshi, K Ramkumar, Sonjoy Chatterjee, N S Kannan, Zarin Daruwala, Rajiv Sabharwal, K V Kamath and Homi Khusrokhan. These people were members of sanctioning committees of ICICI Bank at different periods. ED officials who didn’t want to be named said the order of Adjudicating Authority will be challenged. An agency spokesperson wasn’t immediately available for comment. Kochhar’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said: “ED galloping ahead before CBI is not contemplated in law and this practice of ED attaching properties and arresting people on the basis of CBI FIR has been exposed; ED complaint filed without CBI having moved an inch is clear abuse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmla-adjudicating-authority-dismisses-attachment-of-assets-of-kochhars/story-AIrg4VA8R68R5V0LYNZ5ZN.html

On the ongoing series of allegations made by BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, Raut, in a veiled warning, added that if the Sena starts digging old graves it will unearth skeletons of corruption involving the national party.Raut said that Shiv Sena had never suppressed the voice of the opposition parties. He added that Somaiya, a former Lok Sabha MP, is not taken seriously by his own party.“I don’t think his party also takes whatever he does seriously. But opposition must criticise. We want a strong opposition party in the state. Those who know Uddhav Thackeray and knew Balasaheb Thackeray will definitely tell you that we never stiffle or suppress the opposition like it is done in other states and by the Centre. Therefore, he must stop leveling false allegations. If they want to dig old graves, even we can do that. But our outlook is to forget the past and move on. If we keep digging graves, we will find the skeletons of your corruption,” he said.Speaking to reporters on the eve of Diwali, Raut recalled the same period last year when the movement to make a new political alliance to form the MVA government has started. He said that during this first year the Thackeray government faced several challenges, both natural and man-made, but the CM crossed the hurdles.“Several unholy attempts were made to destabilise the governments but none were successful. In the last year, opposition tried to carry out several operations but could not even scratch the government. So they should stop the language of operation Lotus and work with the government for the state. Nobody in the state has any doubt in that the Uddhav Thackeray-led government will complete its full term and that he will remain the chief minister,” the Sena leader said.

The Oxford Bookstores has curated the selection of books,” said Rajanvir Singh Kapur, managing director of WBTC.Entry is free for children. Only parents accompanying their children will have to pay normal tram fares to board it.Earlier in September India’s first library on tram was launched in Kolkata with a wide range of books including those for competitive exams. A similar effort was earlier initiated at Brno in the Czech Republic.“The concept of transforming an AC train into a moving children’s library is, however, the first of its kind in the world,” said Singh.Kolkata has the only existing tramways in India. The Kolkata Tramways have been operating since 1873 when the first tram pulled by horses started operations.The authorities are planning year-long activities for children on-board such as story-telling, poetry sessions, and book launches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/library-for-children-on-tram-to-be-launched-in-kolkata/story-K5Llc3hppTXtPVoJOjXuWP.html

At least eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 12 injured when the Indian Army retaliated with artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles.Mukthair Ahmad, a resident of Uri’s Garkote, said there has been complete silence along the LoC since Friday night. “No shelling took place in Uri after yesterday [Friday]’s heavy shelling which left four civilians dead and many injured.”Ahmad, who lives close to the LoC, said many shells fell on roads and close to the residential areas. “We live in fear every time now. Do not know when the shells will start raining close to our homes.”Mohammad Jaffer, a resident of Gurez’s Baktoor village, said the shelling stopped on Friday allowing his family to return home from an underground bunker. “The shelling started around 11 am yesterday [Friday] and continued till evening forcing all the people to take shelter in underground bunkers.”Jaffer said it has started snowing, making the tense situation along the LoC particularly difficult for them. “Our area receives heavy snowfall and where will we go along with our families in this harsh winter.

14-11-2020||India||Coastal road: BMC pays Rs 150.33 crore for marine biodiversity conservation||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is building the coastal road in south Mumbai, has deposited Rs 150.33 crore funds required for the conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity as per specific conditions under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance. BMC, however, has revised the total construction cost and reduced the applicable funds for marine biodiversity conservation by 31%. According to CRZ clearance granted in May 2017, the civic body had to pay 2% (Rs 254 crore) of the total cost of the project (Rs 12,721 crore) to the Mangrove Foundation — an autonomous society that assists the state government in marine conservation — on or before commencement of work in December 2018. “The total project cost computed by the mangrove cell was not correct. The actual project construction cost is Rs 8,429 crore along with some additional costs taking the complete tally to around Rs 8,750 crore. So, as per CRZ condition, all approvals have been received to pay 2% (Rs 175 crore) to the Mangrove Foundation. Of this, Rs 25 crore was paid last year, and now the final fund transfer of Rs 150 crore is underway,” said a senior BMC official in-charge of the project, requesting anonymity. Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell) and executive director, Mangrove Foundation, said, “We have received an official intimation from BMC that they have processed Rs 150.33 crore. The funds will be kept in fixed deposits as per the Foundation’s mandate. The interest earned will be utilised for improving coastal and marine biodiversity of Mumbai and Thane regions, research projects, and to build awareness among citizens.” The 9.9-km-long road aims to connect Princess Street flyover in south Mumbai to the Worli-end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link and cut short travel time between south Mumbai and western suburbs by 70%. The submission of funds comes after a delay of two years. HT had, on November 3, reported that Tiwari had requested the environment department to ensure that conditions under CRZ clearance are complied with before considering fresh amendments proposed by BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coastal-road-bmc-pays-rs-150-33-crore-for-marine-biodiversity-conservation/story-XfVwFYr7ic8jZOvtJYYo1K.html

There is no change in troop position or Indian armour on ground even as some reports have speculated that both India and China have decided to de-escalate and disengage troops with no patrolling zones at friction points. India and China have completed eight rounds of talks on disengagement and de-escalation with tangible results still not in sight.Undeterred by the inclement weather, the Indian troops are packed up in snow tents and igloos with the adversary living it out in containers across the LAC. With the Indian Army fully deployed on the LAC along with specialized forces, the Border Roads Organization has decided to keep all the high mountain passes - Marsimika La (18314 feet near Hot Springs), Chang La (17585 feet on road to Pangong Tso) and Khardung La (17582 feet, on road to DBO) - open for army movement throughout the winter.“All the reports about agreed step by step disengagement and de-escalation are speculative as the negotiations are still on at the military commanders level. There is no change in any position on ground with Indian troops high on morale and ready to face challenges posed by the PLA and the deteriorating weather,” said a top military commander.A former Army Chief and a top diplomat both concurred by saying that breakthrough on the LAC will not be achieved easily as both sides are testing each other’s capability and capacity to stand up against the weather. “ It is a staring game. The first one who blinks will lose,” said a former army chief.The PLA troops are also packed up on their side of the LAC and holding their positions at Gogra-Hot Springs, North Pangong Tso and on South Pangong Tso with accretion of troops across the DBO sector. According to available inputs, the Chinese are in strength at the base camp in the Galwan sector and at the friction point at finger four on Pangong Tso with continued rotation of troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-troops-hold-positions-at-lac-in-ladakh-braving-pla-and-polar-temperatures/story-GwI12EopXiheomax6UVXgP.html

14-11-2020||India||Bengal CM Mamata, Prashant Kishor strategise to control rebel TMC minister||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her election strategist Prashant Kishor are trying to control rebel party heavyweight and transport minister Suvendu Adhikari and his aides in the districts through talks and pressure tactics. Their efforts showed some apparent signs of success on Friday evening when the minister did not make controversial statements at the public programmes he attended. Earlier this week, senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders told HT on condition of anonymity that Adhikari is unhappy with Banerjee’s nephew and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee and Kishor for making recent organizational changes and wants the party to field candidates of his choice at 65 assembly seats spread across several districts. This is unacceptable to the leadership. Assembly polls in Bengal are due in about six months. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, has said that its doors are open for Adhikari if he is serious about switching sides. Many TMC leaders joined the BJP before and after the polls. Like some of them, the transport minister is also named in the CBI’s FIR in the Narada sting operation case. Kishor, who was roped in by Banerjee after the Lok Sabha poll debacle, drove down from Kolkata to Adhikari’s home at Kanthi in East Midnapore district on Thursday evening. The minister, who threw a veiled challenge at the TMC from a huge rally on Tuesday, was not present at home. Kishor talked for more than two hours with his father Sisir Adhikari, the TMC’s most senior Lok Sabha member who represents the Kanthi constituency. TMC leaders aware of the development said Kishor conveyed to Adhikari that the leadership might consider discussing the minister’s demand for assembly poll tickets for some of his followers if he stops acting against the party. In a parallel move, the chief minister called up district leaders and said nobody should make any statement against Adhikari or his family. Suvendu Adhikari’s brother Dibyendu is the Lok Sabha member from Tamluk while Soumendu, the youngest of the three siblings, is chairman of the Kanthi municipality. The strategy apparently paid off within 24 hours. Adhikari did not say a word against the TMC while addressing people at the inauguration of some community Kali Pujas in Bankura district on Friday evening. The minister’s followers, however, had put up posters in his support in Bankura town. Similar posters, displaying Adhikari’s image sans any mention of the TMC, have appeared in several districts of south and north Bengal since last month. “Kishor had a talk with Suvendu’s father. The differences, if any, will be sorted out,” said TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy. Suvendu Adhikari avoided the media. The rift in the TMC came out in the open on Tuesday when the transport minister addressed a rally held by his supporters at Nandigram in East Midnapore in memory of party workers killed 13 years ago in a violent land agitation that helped Banerjee oust the Left Front government. There was not a single TMC flag or photograph of Banerjee at the venue. This made the leadership angry and urban development minister Firhad Hakim rushed to Nandigram the same day to address a counter rally. He referred to Adhikari as a traitor without taking his name.“Journalists and political observers are waiting for me to announce my political programme. They want to hear me talk about the roadblocks I am facing and the path I am going to take. I will not announce my political programme from this sacred platform. I will speak from a political platform. I am not afraid of anyone. We will meet on the battlefield,” Adhikari said at Tuesday’s rally. Leaving food for thought, he ended his short speech with the slogan “Bharat Mata Zindabad,” (long live motherland) which appeared to be an improvisation of the Hindi slogan BJP leaders raise. TMC leaders, including Banerjee, end their speech by saying “Jai Bangla” (victory for Bengal). Interestingly, Adhikari said this as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cm-mamata-prashant-kishor-strategise-to-control-rebel-tmc-minister/story-1uZUWcoyZcEtLEF946ANfO.html

We are also grateful to the families of those on the borders,” he tweeted.In 2019, PM Modi visited the “Hall of Fame” in Rajouri and the Pathankot Airbase. In 2018, he visited Kedarnathand and inspected a military post on the India-China border and in 2017, he visited Gurez sector of north Kashmir.

14-11-2020||India||From Holi to Diwali, how Covid-19 and lockdown impacted India||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has brought the world to a halt. The year 2020 has seen millions getting affected across the globe by the disease which originated in China late last year.In India too, Covid-19 wreaked havoc and affected normal lives of the people. Most of the festivals in the country were observed under lockdown.It started in March this year, when the first phase of the lockdown was imposed by the Centre to check the spread of the disease. Though the festival of Holi was celebrated weeks before the nationwide lockdown was announced (on March 9), the entire country had started to feel the impact of the coronavirus disease.Many events in national capital Delhi were cancelled in March as the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country stood at 47. Delhi has been in severe grip of the pandemic till now, and has been witnessing a record spike in the number of daily cases. The national capital’s tally has now reached 4,74,830.The spike has been particularly pronounced due to the festive season. In the week ending October 25, when the city held muted Dussehra celebrations, there were an average of 3,663 cases every day. As on Thursday, this number rose to 7,196.In comparison, the number was 2,627 in the first week of October.Till March 10, 1,10,000 people worldwide had been infected with Covid-19. But the situation started deteriorating rapidly and the global tally reached a million. India too imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25 - initially for 21 days - and kept increasing it due to the grim situation. The lockdown remained in place for 75 days.During this period, movement was restricted, planes grounded and trains stopped. It led to a crisis; people who wanted to go to their native places, were stuck. Due to the immediate curbs, the country saw massive movement of migrant labourers from metro cities to their native places. They walked miles on foot; the ordeal to reach their hometowns lasted many days.All this happened because many economic activities came to a grinding halt due to the lockdown, and thousands lost jobs. Restaurants, schools, shopping malls and places of worship were shut down too.Along with the curbs that were put in place, the government also started increasing the testing for Covid-19 to determine the spread of the disease. Soon, the number started swelling, and different symptoms started appearing in infected people. Not just lungs, doctors found out that the Sars-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the disease, affected other internal organs too.The situation turned grim, the curbs more stringent. The race to find a vaccine too began.India saw the first relaxation in curbs in the month of June when Unlock 1.0 kicked in. The government allowed opening of hotels, temples, mosques and other religious places from June 8 but laid down protocols to be followed before letting people in. In the containment zones, which had increased since the outbreak was first reported, no relaxation was given.In the following months, the government ordered phase-wise opening of different sectors of the economy, to help people and businesses but strict measures remained in place in the containment zone.Though the situation has improved, and the country is past the peak of the disease, the vigil is on. Depite relaxations, the government is constantly monitoring the situation. On Diwali too, there are restrictions in place and authorities have urged people to avoid going to crowded places where the fear of catching infection looms large.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-holi-to-diwali-how-covid-19-and-lockdown-impacted-india/story-GmLvrnXQp9OUzYPIRyGncK.html

According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the Air Quality Index (AQI) at 6.00 am on Saturday was 364. On Friday, the average 24-hour AQI stood at 339.Pollution levels are expected to rise over the weekend and may improve after the passage of a western disturbance, causing rain over parts of north India after November 15, according to an official forecast.The AQI was in the ‘severe’ zone for six days, starting November 5. Delhi got minor relief on Wednesday and Thursday, when the AQI improved to the ‘very poor’ category after winds shifted direction, blowing in from the east.ALSO READ | Delhi wakes up to ‘very poor’ quality air, likely to deteriorate later todayKuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the average wind speed on Friday was around 8kmph, which led to an increase in the pollution levels. He said from Diwali afternoon, the wind speed will dip to nearly 6 kmph.“From Diwali evening (Saturday), the air quality is likely to start deteriorating. However, from Sunday night, the wind direction is expected to change again to easterly and there is a possibility of light rain. The pollution particles stick to the moisture in the air and settle closer to the ground, making the air quality worse,” Srivastava said.The IMD forecast said from Monday, the wind speed is likely to improve, which again could improve the air quality.ALSO READ | ‘Bad air leading to Covid-19 spike; respite soon’: Arvind KejriwalMeanwhile, IMD has predicted a foggy Diwali morning and a cloudy day on Saturday. The minimum temperature is likely to be at around 12 degree Celsius while the maximum temperature is predicted to be around 30 degree Celsius. On Friday, Delhi’s minimum temperature, recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official reading for the city, was 12.3 degree Celsius – one degree below normal. The maximum temperature was 29.7 degree Celsius – one degree above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/very-poor-tag-for-delhi-s-air-as-imd-predicts-foggy-diwali/story-vv9HrwwWeX3gMHeSgAiCmK.html

14-11-2020||India||East Asia Summit set to focus on pandemic, economic recovery||External affairs minister S Jaishankar will represent India at the East Asia Summit on November 14, with leaders of the 18-member grouping that includes China and the US, expected to focus on the pandemic and economic recovery.This will be the second time this week that the top leadership of India and China will be on the same virtual platform. Prime Minister Narendra Modi used his participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit on Tuesday to make an indirect reference to Chinese infrastructure projects by saying SCO members should respect sovereignty and territorial integrity while implementing connectivity initiatives.The East Asia Summit, which brings together the 10 members of the Association for Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) will discuss ways to strengthen the platform and make it more responsive to emerging challenges.The leaders will also exchange views on global and regional issues, including the pandemic and cooperation among EAS members to achieve speedy and sustainable economic recovery.“EAS is the only leaders-led forum of its kind that brings the US, China, Russia, India, South Korea and Australia together on one platform. It allows members to focus on strategic issues in the Indo-Pacific and serves as a mechanism to reinforce adherence to international norms and rules,” said a person who didn’t want to be named.The external affairs ministry said India believes Asean-led frameworks, of which EAS is an important part, are at the core of the regional security architecture and need to be strengthened further.The virtual East Asia Summit, being held on the margins of the Asean Summit, will be chaired by Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc. Vietnam is the current chair of Asean.India is a founding member of EAS, which was established in 2005. “India also sees EAS as a logical platform to promote a free, open, inclusive, transparent, rules-based, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,” said the person cited above.At the last East Asia Summit in Bangkok in November 2019, Modi had unveiled India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI), which is aimed at forging partnerships to create a secure and stable maritime domain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/east-asia-summit-set-to-focus-on-pandemic-economic-recovery/story-qXarJ1tzVDCJUSXTgmItMK.html
14-11-2020||India||Inside the operation to restore the Peshawar homes of superstars Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor||Tucked away near the centuries-old Storytellers’ Bazaar, the decaying Pakistani mansions once home to Bollywood superstars are being brought back to life as Peshawar emerges from years of Islamist militancy.The ancestral homes of Golden Age heroes Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar in the northwestern city are symbols of its link to the world’s largest film industry, but have suffered from decades of neglect.The region’s archaeology team says it is close to wresting the more than 100-year-old buildings, located in the heart of the historic walled city, from their private owners so they can be restored and turned into museums.“I always feel sad and angry while looking at Kapoor’s house, that it once was a beautiful mansion of top quality,” said Samiuddin Khan, who remembers running through the 40-room abandoned house as a child and flying kites from the rooftop.“It was extremely beautiful inside. The structure is still intact but some walls have collapsed and much of the wood has been damaged.”Once an architectural wonder, the family home of Kapoor, who died aged 63 in 1988, is influenced by Mughal empire, Central Asian and British colonial design, featuring ornately carved doors and balconies and gothic-style windows.Kumar lived in a simpler home down a small lane in a busy market, its entrance faded and its roofless interior heavily damaged.The actors grew up in a quarter that is home to the fabled Qissa Khwani (“Storytellers’“) Bazaar where travellers would share tales of their adventures.Kumar, who is now 97, has credited his successful career to his early life in the neighbourhood, where he first learned to narrate.But like many emerging actors, the pair were enticed away from Peshawar to India’s entertainment centre Bombay, now Mumbai, in the years before the partition of British-ruled India.The pair even starred alongside each other at the beginning of their careers, in the 1949 hit “Andaz”.“This is our cultural heritage and we take pride in preserving it. We are very proud that Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor were from Peshawar,” said Abdul Samad, director of archaeology and museums in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province -- of which Peshawar is the capital.Present-day Indian superstar Shah Rukh Khan, known as the King of Bollywood, also has links to the area but his family home which is still in use has not suffered the same decline.Across the country, hundreds of pre-partition buildings have been left to ruin or been demolished over the years.Many had been built by Hindus and Sikhs who left them behind when they fled newly founded Muslim-majority Pakistan for India, archaeology experts say.- Heritage treasure trove -Peshawar suffered a huge knock-back to its cultural standing after becoming a hotbed of Islamist extremist violence from the 1980s onwards, bringing an end to the golden era of Pashto-language cinema in the region, known as Pollywood.Militant groups, including the Pakistani Taliban, bombed at least three cinemas and more than 100 music shops before a military crackdown near the border with Afghanistan in 2015 resulted in drastic improvements in security.As the city revives, more than 1,800 heritage buildings with traditional features have been identified for preservation by the province’s archaeology team, but impoverished Pakistan will need years to arrange the finances required to their purchase and restoration.“If a proper archaeological survey was conducted, we would discover a cultural site almost every kilometre,” said archaeological director Samad about Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.There are hurdles still to overcome in saving the Kapoor mansion too.Its owner Hajji Ali Qadir told AFP he would take the authorities to court if they did not pay him at least two billion rupees ($12.5 million).“I told them that it’s an antique and the price for an antique is multiplied 10 times,” he said. “We will get more money if we build a plaza here.”The archaeology department has said it will use legal powers if needed to purchase the Kapoor and Kumar homes with taxpayer money, for a figure still to be determined by the province’s financial authorities.Bollywood movies and their leading actors are loved by Pakistanis, despite the country’s contempt for its rival neighbour to the east.Millions bypass bans on Indian films in cinemas and on television by watching them on YouTube or pirated DVDs.“We felt proud and held our heads high while watching the actors from Peshawar performing in Indian movies, that this land has produced such great actors who proved their worth in Mumbai,” Khalo Khalil Sarhadi, an 80-year-old resident of Peshawar, told AFP.“Now the new generation will know how Peshawar has produced big stars and actors, those who have given an identity to Pakistan and India,” he said of the museum projects.sjd-ecl/wat/qan/kma||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inside-the-operation-to-restore-the-peshawar-homes-of-superstars-dilip-kumar-raj-kapoor/story-HfLF5HVB1p1phnqhYSW2DK.html
14-11-2020||India||Govt eases norms for thermal power plants, allows coal to be sourced, moved without fresh approvals||The Union environment ministry has relaxed norms for the coal mining sector and thermal power stations, allowing thermal plants to change their source of coal irrespective of its ash content or mode of transport from the source.This means that coal will be allowed to be transported by trucks covered with tarpaulin sheets, even if the source of the raw material is located a long distance away.The change was made in an office memorandum issued by the ministry on November 11, and comes after demands by thermal power plants, who said that the constraints were leading to delays in obtaining coal from new domestic sources. “All the thermal power plants having environmental clearance can change the coal source (from imported to domestic, domestic to domestic and domestic to imported) including lignite through e-auctions, short-term linkage, long-term linkage other linkage options of the ministry of coal or any organisation recognised for allotting coal linkages without seeking the amendment in environmental clearance...,” the order, reviewed by HT, states. Environment activists, however, said the move could lead to a spike in pollution because there will be no oversight of how changing the source of coal would impact the environment. Under the environment impact assessment notification 2006, any change in the sourcing of coal required thermal power plants to seek an amendment in the environmental clearance (EC) granted to them. This would mean that environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee would reassess the project based on the new source. This was to ensure that the transportation and use of coal was monitored in order to ensure emissions is low. Every EC usually stipulates transport mode, which was rail/conveyor belt. The new rules state that no amendment will be required in the EC granted to the plant, even if the source of coal, and consequently, its distance from the thermal power plant changes. Details regarding the location of the coal source; quantity; quality which includes (ash, sulphur, moisture content and calorific value); distance and mode of transportation, will only have to be informed to the environment ministry and its regional office.About transportation, the office memorandum advises thermal power plants that, as far as possible, transportation should be done by rail or conveyor belt or other environment friendly modes. But road transportation of coal will be allowed in tarpaulin covered trucks, till railway or conveyor belt infrastructure is made available. There is no deadline about when this infra will be ready.“The EC is granted based on a specific source of coal and distance from the mine. Any change in source required an amendment in EC as conditions for appraisal change. Now we have done away with the need for that amendment,” said a senior environment ministry official.“We had asked the ministry a couple of times about the need to simplify these norms. This is for a simple reason. Mines keep changing. Every time there is a change in the mine location, there is unnecessary delay in amending the EC,” said Ashok Khurana, director general of the Association of Power Producers. Experts have warned that this could lead to air pollution, damage of roads in many areas through which coal will be transported and it weakens the environment appraisal process for thermal power plants.“The flexibility to change the source or coal or indefinitely using road transportation even as mandatory rail lines or conveyor belts are being put into place can be seen as part of the pool of exemptions and incentives being given to the mining projects. In effect, the ministry has replaced rule of law with flexibility of law that is to only suit the requirement of mining and coal power projects,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research. “This no holds barred approach has serious implications for places and people where these decisions will be operationalised. Coal transportation will be carried out on public roads or village roads, none of which was in the original plans,” she said. “The ash content requirements for sourcing of coal were watered down earlier. So we are not being vigilant about the quality of coal. If coal is dirty and emission control equipment is not installed as per norms, then emissions will be high,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-eases-norms-for-thermal-power-plants-allows-coal-to-be-sourced-moved-without-fresh-approvals/story-rXuP2PWEskjEtCN2qkhLNL.html
14-11-2020||India||Farm groups lay down demands as talks begin||Representatives of farmers from Punjab who are protesting a set of laws enacted to liberalise the farm sector held talks on Friday with agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal, but the seven-hour-long negotiations did not result in any breakthrough ahead of a planned march to the national capital on November 26 by thousands of cultivators.Food bowl Punjab is at the centre stage of a farmers’ agitation against three laws enacted on September 24 that open up agricultural markets in the country and bring sweeping reforms to the farm sector, which supports nearly half the population.Food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey on November 10 invited leaders of at least 30 farmers’ bodies, including constituents of the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKCC), an umbrella platform spearheading the protests, for talks with the two ministers, in an attempt to end a politically challenging farmers’ uprising. People familiar with the developments said that, at the meeting, held at Vigyan Bhawan, participating farm leaders demanded an outright repeal of the three laws and a roll-back of the reforms; a legislation guaranteeing minimum support prices (MSP); the resumption of goods train services in Punjab; the pending Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020 be sent to a select committee; and the repeal of an air pollution ordinance for the national Capital that aims to crack down on farm stubble fires.A government statement at the end of the talks stated that “various issues related to farmers’ welfare were discussed at length and the talks were held in a cordial atmosphere with both sides agreeing to continue to hold further discussions”.AIKCC said Friday’s talks were “inconclusive” and the government offered no “concrete assurances” but talks could continue in future. “There was no agreement on any issue. We made it clear that we want the three laws repealed. We told them that farmers don’t want these laws because they are meant to benefit businesses rather than farmers,” said Darshan Pal of the Krantikari Kisan Union, a participant. Pal’s organisation is a constituent of AIKSCC. The three laws farmers are protesting, together, allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s MSP system, which offers cultivators assured prices from the government, largely for wheat and rice. The three legislations are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, which Parliament cleared in September. The delegation sought a legislation guaranteeing MSP and procurement, which refers to the government’s buying of farm produce at federally determined assured prices. “The government did its best to address a key fear of the farmers’ delegation that the MSP system will be weakened. The assumption that MSP could be withdrawn is simply not correct,” a farm ministry official said, requesting anonymity. There were two rounds of discussion on this issue. The government presented farmers with procurement data, which showed that support prices for rice under the Modi government had increased 43% between 2013-14 and 2020-21, and foodgrain quantity procured had gone up 109% in the same period. “Since the government assured us that MSP would continue, we repeatedly asked what is the problem in bringing a law to guarantee it. The ministers evaded this question,” Pal said. “We also asked rail minister Piyush Goyal to resume goods train services in Punjab and not punish the state since we have vacated stations, trains and even platforms but the minister sought a guarantee that we will allow passenger train movement too, which we didn’t agree,” he added. Farmers in the state have blocked rail tracks and road transport as part of their protests. “We have said please don’t demand of us that we concede and give in writing to allow passenger train movement too as a pre-condition, which is basically like asking us to call off the agitation itself,” said Avik Saha, the secretary of AIKSCC. The delegation demanded that the government refer the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020, currently awaiting Parliament’s approval, to a select committee. Farmers have opposed a key provision of the bill, which provides for a direct-benefit-transfer mechanism for transferring power subsidy directly in cash to eligible consumers, including farmers, a major recipient of subsidised power. The farmers also sought a repeal of an ordinance passed by on October 29 to tackle air pollution, called The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas, 2020 because it “seeks to unfairly penalise farmers for crop-residue burning”, said another participant Balbir Singh of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal faction). “We demanded that all intellectuals arrested by the government should be freed. There are court cases against farmers too, which should be withdrawn,” Pal added. Friday’s talks appear to be an attempt by the government to be accommodative of a precondition set by farm leaders that any talks must happen in the presence of Union ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-groups-lay-down-demands-as-talks-begin/story-T19mtKXk5TVBZszNQAqtIM.html
14-11-2020||India||Lotus, peacock motifs to adorn new Parliament building||Indian Parliament’s new building, to which it is expected to move in 2022, will come not just with more space and facilities but also a distinctly Indian touch, built around symbols associated with the country. There are plans to incorporate the peacock and the lotus, India’s national bird and flower, into motifs and murals, and the complex will have a real banyan tree (the country’s national tree), said officials familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. The existing circular building, completed in 1927, is most famous for its 144 columns but it too has some recognisable Indian touches. The use of fountains both inside and outside the building, Indian-style balconies and marble lattice screens. ‘Iconic structure’ planned near Yamuna as part of Central Vista projectThe new building, to be constructed right in front of the existing one, will use the motifs in a contemporary way, the officials said. “One House will have lotus motifs while the other House will see peacock inspired bas-relief. There will be no Central Hall but a central lounge will be available to MPs for socialising,” said one of the officials.The construction of a new Parliament building is part of the larger Central Vista development plan the NDA government has embarked on, which will see the construction of a new secretariat to house government offices, and of new residences for the Prime Minister and the Vice-President. The current Parliament building is inadequate to allow for any expansion in the size of the houses — an exercise that is expected to begin around 2025-26 so as to make the houses more representative.Central Vista redevelopment: Contractors will need to curb air, noise pollutionThe cost of the Central Vista project is projected to be Rs 20,000 crore, with the Parliament building estimated to cost Rs 861 crore. The entire project is scheduled to be completed by 2024, while the new Parliament building is expected to be constructed by 2022. The new Parliament building will also have around 90 offices to accommodate all ministers. “There will be several dining halls including an exclusive dining hall for MPs and another one for VVIPs,” said an official. But before the new edifice gets functional, the existing Parliament complex will see some key changes. The Gandhi statue in front of the main gate — the favourite spot for Opposition MPs to protest — will be temporarily shifted as it falls right in the middle of the construction site.

Now, the global death trajectory too has seen a sharp rise — it’s still nowhere near peaks seen during the first wave in the US and Europe in individual European countries, but with more countries around the world affected now (as compared to March, April, and May), the overall number of deaths has increased.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageOver the past week, daily deaths have surpassed the previous peak witnessed in early April. This means that more people are dying from Covid-19 across the world every day now than ever before in the 11 months since the virus was first reported in eastern China’s Wuhan. And even in countries such as France, the UK, and Italy, the numbers are climbing sharply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-deaths-cases-breaking-global-records/story-0MAk8SEGRu053bhsQARSfM.html
14-11-2020||India||India hits Pak targets after shelling at LOC||At least eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 12 injured on Friday after the Indian Army targeted Pakistani positions across the Line of Control (LoC) in north Kashmir with artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles in response to heavy shelling by the neighbouring army in which eight Indians — four security personnel and four civilians — lost their lives, people familiar with the developments said.Pakistani ammunition dumps, fuel dumps, and terror launch pads were among the targets destroyed by the Indian Army, they added.The heavy exchange of fire — triggered by ceasefire violations by the Pakistani army in multiple sectors on the eve of Diwali — has turned the spotlight on the LoC at a time when Indian and Chinese forces are locked in a border dispute along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive Ladakh sector, where a disengagement plan is under discussion but has made no significant progress so far.Three Indian soldiers, a Border Security Force (BSF) sub-inspector, and four civilians including a woman and a seven-year-old boy, were killed in Pakistani shelling in Uri, Naugam, Keran and Gurez sectors in north Kashmir, the officials said, asking not to be identified. Three Indian soldiers were injured.The Pakistani casualties include at least two Special Service Group commandos, they said.The Indian Army blamed Pakistan for unprovoked ceasefire violations along the LoC. “Pakistan initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation along the LoC spread across multiple sectors including Dawar, Keran, Uri and Naugam. Pakistan used mortars and other weapons,” said Srinagar-based defence spokesperson Col Rajesh Kalia. He added that the neighbouring army deliberately targeted civilian areas.“Our troops retaliated strongly causing casualties and substantial damage to Pakistan army’s infrastructure across the LoC. Several ammunition dumps, fuel dumps and multiple terrorist launch pads have been damaged,” Kalia said.The Pakistani army began shelling Indian positions after the Indian Army foiled a major infiltration attempt in the Keran sector, the officials said. There has been a significant increase in ceasefire violations by Pakistan this year. While the neighbour violated the ceasefire 3,233 times last year, the figure this year stands at 4,052 so far, according to army data. Pakistan carried out 394 violations in October as against 128 till now in November.The Indian Army released several images, including unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) footage, showing multiple Pakistani bunkers and other positions going up in flames in the retaliatory Indian action. One of the videos released by the army showed a Pakistani soldier running for cover before his post was hit by an anti-tank guided missile.“Pakistani casualties may be higher. What we have right now is an initial estimate,” the officials said.The Pakistanis have got it back “right and proper”, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations, commenting on the Indian Army’s retaliatory action. “Pakistan is seeking to create trouble along the LoC as it is aware of our focus on the LAC and the commitment there. The Pakistan army is making desperate attempts to push in infiltrators before harsh winters set in. The ceasefire violations are carried out to help the infiltrators. Also, the Valley has been quiet and the neighbour wants to up the ante there to trigger violence and bloodshed,” Bhatia added. In Naugam sector, a BSF officer posted at Atma Complex was killed in the shelling. He was identified as sub-inspector Rakesh Dobal. Baramulla SSP Abdul Qayoom said that shelling was still going on in some areas of Uri. “Four civilians were killed in Uri and another four were injured,” he said.The ceasefire violation was reported from all the important sectors stretching from Uri to Gurez. All these sectors have witnessed multiple ceasefire violations this year and soldiers have been on high alert.Locals in Uri said the Indian and Pakistani soldiers were targeting each other’s pickets at Haji Peer and Kamalkote sectors since morning. The locals said small arms and mortars have been used during the shelling which triggered panic among the villagers near the LoC.“This was one of the deadliest shellings in many years in Uri sector. Some shells hit residential houses,” said Iqbal Ahmad, a resident of Uri. “The people are very scared as we could see shells landing in the villages,” another civilian Mukthair Ahmad Khawaja said. The situation in Uri town was tense even as ambulances sped towards villages near the LoC to ferry injured civilians to hospitals.In Keran and Gurez sectors, mortar shells landed close to residential areas in Izmerg, Baktore and Tarabal localities, which are just few kilometres from the LoC. Two girls were injured in Baktore and both were referred to Srinagar for treatment.“We were attending an election meeting when shelling began around 11am. The intensity of shelling was heavy and people ran for cover. The markets were shut and many people took refuge in underground bunkers. Now the shelling has stopped but people are still in underground bunkers,” said Zaheer Ahmad, a government official posted in Gurez. The infiltration attempt in Keran sector on Friday was the second infiltration bid this week, Kalia said. “Three terrorists were killed in the earlier unsuccessful infiltration bid in Machil sector on November 7-8,” he added. Three soldiers, including a Captain, were killed in action in Machil that day.At a time when there are military tensions between India and China in eastern Ladakh, the military is also keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hits-pak-targets-after-shelling-at-loc/story-YpYtsSed1VZ3ZeEYZqTs9I.html

14-11-2020||India||16 million Covid-19 warriors lead virus battle||From March to June this year, nurse Bimlesh Kain, 57, woke up every morning at 5am and travelled 30km from her home in Rohini to report to work at the Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Hospital by 8.30am. Dressed in personal protective gear (PPEs), Kain was at the nurse’s station in the hospital’s Covid-19 ward for a nearly 11-hour shift. That was her life for much of those months. “I started work in the Covid-19 department in March when the Covid-19 roster had been formulated, and was on active Covid-19 duty till June. It was a gruelling experience,” she says. Kain is currently in isolation after being diagnosed with Covid-19, and is awaiting her next posting in another government hospital. Click here for complete coronavirus coverageKain is also one of India’s Covid-19 warriors, as they are termed, a force of health workers, ASHA and Anganwadi workers volunteers, and people from fire departments, whose number is now close to 16 million (15.89) according to a database maintained by the IT ministry of the Union government. It’s a number that’s increased since April, when there were 11 million Covid warriors -- with more being drafted in to help India and Indians combat a viral disease for which there is still no vaccine, although health workers have progressively become better at saving lives. The disease, first recorded in India on January 30 in a Kerala student, has infected 8,764,826 people across the country since, killing 129,129. But 8,154,463 of those infected have recovered, with many not requiring hospitalistion, and India’s case fatality rate of 1.48% compares well with the world’s 2.44% -- a statistic in which Covid-19 warriors such as Kain can take pride. According to details available on covidwarriors.gov.in, these overall numbers include around 900,000 doctors, 150,000 MBBS students, 1.75 million nurses, 1.12 million pharmacists, 830,000 Ayurvedic doctors, 3.5 million ASHA and Anganwadi workers, 3.5 million members of the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (a voluntary grass-roots youth organisation), and 2.5 million members of the National Service Scheme, another voluntary student organisation. Covid-19: Deaths, cases breaking global recordsWhile the role of the doctors, nurses and pharmacists is clear, the others perform critical tasks such as supervising quarantine facilities, helping with contact tracing, even monitoring lockdown restrictions. ASHA and Anganwadi workers in particular are at the frontline of the state’s war against the virus in rural areas. “Covid-19 warriors have different roles in the larger scheme of Covid-19 management, like we call warriors even those patients who have recovered from the disease and are now volunteering to generate awareness about the disease, the need for testing and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, among other things. States are making use of these people. Then there are frontline workers, members of civil defence, NGOs, etc, that are also our corona warriors,” said a health ministry official, who wished to remain anonymous. “Then there are ASHA workers who contribute towards disease surveillance, especially in containment zones in many states by making door-to-door visits, mapping houses for high-risk cases,” the official added. Around 1.36 million Covid-19 warriors have undergone training on the Integrated Government Online Training (iGOT) platform. The platform is an inter-ministerial collaboration, and individual ministries can upload content on the website according to their individual requirements. “There are web modules created to teach, for example, bio medical waste management, how to dispose of personal protection equipment, infection control and hygiene practices, etc. These have been created in a quick, easy-to-learn format,” said a senior government official who asked not to be named. The Covid-19 warrior dashboard itself comes under the purview of one of the empowered groups set up by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March to combat Covid-19. No such database was previously available. The dashboard is developed and maintained by the National Informatics Centre under the ministry of information and technology.Experts said it always helps to have an exact idea of the human resource at hand . “In an outbreak situation it is a good idea to have a comprehensive list of trained manpower that can be utilised based on the requirement of a state,” says Dr MC Misra, former director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16mn-covid-warriors-lead-virus-battle/story-zB7GXnf9iLK0lSzRd7iLXO.html
14-11-2020||India||Ayodhya lights up on Deepotsav with 6,06,569 diyas to set another Guinness world record||Ayodhya on Friday created a new Guinness world record by lighting 6,06,569 earthen lamps (diyas) at the majestic Ram Ki Paidi ghat on the banks of the Saryu river and other ghats of the temple town during the fourth Deepotsav. Ram Ki Paidi, a series of ghats, wore a celestial look with lakhs of earthen diyas illuminating it in the backdrop of the Saryu. A Guinness team was present to judge the event. By creating this world record, the Ayodhya administration broke its own record it set last year by lighting 4,10,000 diyas. Chief minister Adityanath lit the first diya at Ram Ki Paidi ghat. Governor Anandiben Patel was also present on the occasion. The CM congratulated the Ayodhya administration for the world record and for organising the Deepotsav event successfully. Around 8,000 students of Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University, Faizabad, had volunteered to make the event successful. “I congratulate the Ayodhya administration, students of Ram Manohar Lohia University and all volunteers for creating this world record,” Adityanath. Hundreds of temples and maths dotting Ayodhya were also lit up for the occasion. Almost the entire town was decked up with colourful lights. In the 2018 Deepotsav also, a Guinness record of lighting 3.1 lakh earthen lamps was set. After the BJP government came to power in UP (March 2017), the Adityanath government has been organising Deepotsav celebration in Ayodhya on the eve of Diwali. The grand finale of Diwali celebrations in Ayodhya was marked by all-women Ram Leela by artists from Chhattisgarh. Adityanath watched this performance along with other members of his cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-again-creates-guinness-world-record-by-lighting-6-06-569-diyas/story-Hvz3C10s5C21bpq6zlyhqN.html
14-11-2020||India||Madras HC orders removal of Tamil movie teaser from social media, ‘obscene’ ads from TV||In two cases, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court has directed the Tamil Nadu government and Centre to ensure that ‘obscene’ content is removed from social media sites and television observing that it will otherwise affect young minds amid a rise in crimes against women and children. Hearing a batch of public interest litigations (PILs), on Wednesday, the bench comprising justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi directed that the teaser of a Tamil movie, Irandam Kuthu, be removed from social media for propagating vulgarity (as per Cinematograph Act, 1952). The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has given an ‘A’ rating for the film after 32 cuts and is slated for a Diwali release. It is a sequel to a 2018 movie by the same director and comes under the genre of erotic-horror-comedy. The petition (filed by a cultural outfit, Samuganeethi Kalvi Panpattu Maiyam) listed all the sexual innuendos in the teaser’s dialogues. It appealed that children attending online classes due to Covid-19 had the “possibility of uncontrolled viewership” of the movie’s “vulgar and obscene teaser”. Though the petition sought an injunction against the film, the court said it was not in its limits to restrain the movie.“The court has also directed to take penal action under sections 67 and 67a (of the Information Technology Act, 2000 prohibiting obscene and sexually explicit material). So those who have produced and directed the movie will have to face consequences,” said a senior lawyer in the case who did not wish to be named as the court is yet to issue copies of its order. “Social media is a state subject. So Tamil Nadu is the appropriate respondent to issue a notice directly to the intermediary, like YouTube, to remove the indecent content under section 39 of the IT Act,” he said.The court also ordered an interim restriction on television commercials based on another petition that stated condom advertisements are “in the nature of arousal of the prurient interest” which should not be telecast in the middle of films and serials. “We are specifically against ads on contraceptives, underwear, soaps that promote virility,” says M Purshothaman, counsel for the petitioner, K S Sagadevaraja.The petition said that while contraceptives are a preventive measure against birth control and sexually transmitted diseases, the ad “need not explicitly show a sexual act” which is against sections 5 and 6 in Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act, 1995.“We pushed this matter urgently because children are hooked to TV due to the pandemic and several movies will be screened during Diwali,” Purshothaman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-orders-removal-of-tamil-movie-teaser-from-social-media-obscene-ads-from-tv/story-teDIGhmmln5TiFyvLDuO4M.html
