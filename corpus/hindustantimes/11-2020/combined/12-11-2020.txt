12-11-2020||News||Delhi: An agenda to bring back blue skies||Every winter, when we cannot breathe, we discuss air pollution. But we need action not just in the few winter months, when the pollutants settle close to the ground because of inversion, when wind is low and moisture traps the toxins. We need to understand that sources of pollution — other than the stubble-burning in Punjab and Haryana — are constant. We just don’t feel that the air is foul and deadly because there is sun and wind, which disperses pollutants. But it does not make it better for our lungs.The second thing we need to realise is that all soft and easy options for combating pollution are over. Delhi now needs transformational measures to drastically reduce toxins from combustion sources such as vehicles, power plants and industries which use coal for energy. We also need to step up implementation and enforcement on sources such as garbage-burning or construction-related dust. We also need to do much more to convince farmers not to burn stubble, but to use it to either fertilise their soil or to sell it for fuel to industry. The agenda for action is clear. The newly-formed Air Quality Commission (AQC) needs to hit the ground running.It is not as if nothing has been done. The data on air quality shows a decreasing trend and this is good news. This is because governments, both at the Centre and state, have acted. I say this because we must have confidence that action will lead to results. Otherwise, we will drown in cynicism and procrastination.First, there is the transition to Bharat Stage VI (BSVI) fuel and vehicle standards; this was a leapfrog action as the country jumped over one generation of vehicle emission technologies. The new generation BS VI heavy duty and diesel vehicles will be 80-90% cleaner than their predecessors. However, the result of this will only show up when there is fleet transition — that is when larger numbers of these cleaner vehicles come on to roads and replace the older vehicles. But let’s not discount the impact of much cleaner fuel that is now driving our vehicles.Then there have been efforts to control gross-polluting vehicles — in Delhi, the problem was from diesel trucks that moved through the city at night when inversion was the highest. Based on Supreme Court (SC) directions, the numbers of these vehicles have drastically reduced by building expressways that allow diversion and congestion tax that provide deterrence. The impact of this measure is showing up in the air quality charts.There is also the ban on coal — brought about by the Delhi government — and the incentives for industry to change to piped natural gas. The only remaining coal-based power plant in Delhi, Badarpur, has been shut and the effort is to ramp up gas-based power generation at Bawana. New emission standards for clean coal power plants have also been notified — but are still not implemented. In the neighbouring states, brick kilns have been moved to cleaner technology of zigzag and now shut down by judicial orders.So, there is action, there is improvement in air quality. But the bad news is that much more needs to be done. This is the agenda for the future. Just think, during the lockdown, when we all saw blue skies, there was a complete lockdown — all vehicles were off the road; factories were shut. Clearly, the lockdown, with its devastating effect on the economy and livelihoods, is not the solution. But what this reveals is the scale of the intervention that is required to bring us clean air, even during the peak winter periods.The scale was critical in the first-generation reform that Delhi undertook when it moved to compressed natural gas (CNG); it was a leapfrog solution; it was transformational as all gross-polluting vehicles such as buses and autorickshaws made the move to clean fuel in a short time. The second-generation action focused on each source. Now, we need the third wave.What then is the way ahead? We need to move from polluting coal (pet coke and furnace oil have already been banned) across the region. This would mean moving to natural gas or ensuring that there is supply of reliable and affordable power. This is possible, but will require shifting fiscal strategies to incentivise clean fuel.But this is not enough. We need to do much more to reduce the number of vehicles — remember every time we clean up the tailpipe of the vehicle, but then add many more on the road, the end result of clean air is negated. We need massive augmentation of buses, not just in Delhi but other neighbouring towns and linking public transport with last-mile connectivity. The right to walk and cycle is linked to the right to clean air.However, this agenda remains incomplete if we don’t focus on what is really broken — the institutional capacity for governance of our cities. We cannot stop the burning of garbage that is littering our roads and grounds, unless there is municipal capacity. We cannot step up enforcement against polluters, unless the pollution control boards have the required strength to monitor, inspect and penalise. This is where AQC will have its work cut out. Building new institutions, without repairing and strengthening the old, is not the answer.This is the real agenda for clean air, blue skies and clear lungs in our cites. Our right to breathe is possible, but only if we don’t gloss over some hard truths and tough action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/delhi-an-agenda-to-bring-back-blue-skies/story-89b4Vy3SOg4ZN5ppAqrqUK.html
12-11-2020||News||How Bihar has exposed the limits of each party | Opinion||The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), despite polling almost the same number of votes as the Mahagathbandhan (MGB), has managed to retain power in Bihar. What does this tell us about the state of various political formations in the state?The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is the single-largest party for the second time in a row. Last time, it lost power despite being a part of the winning coalition after the Janata Dal (United) walked over to the NDA in 2017. This time, the RJD led pre-poll alliance has fallen short of a majority. It is tempting to see the RJD’s 2020 (75 seats) performance as a deterioration over 2015 (80 seats). However, when read with the fact that the RJD failed to win even one Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 elections, 2020 seems like a Phoenix act. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks like the biggest beneficiary. It is believed to have used the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) to undermine the JD(U) — the LJP acted as a spoiler for the JD(U) in 26 seats — to become the senior partner in the NDA. If true, then the fact that the BJP got Nitish Kumar to part ways with the RJD in 2017 and then possibly unleashed this tactic is indeed shrewd politics. However, it has failed to emerge as the single largest party yet again. The JD(U), despite retaining power, has lost stature both within and outside the NDA, emerging a distant third and winning its lowest-ever share of seats. Nitish Kumar has displayed unconditional reverence to Narendra Modi during and after the elections and his erstwhile independent posturing is all but gone. What is one to make of these empirical trends? The BJP wants to create a rainbow Hindu coalition, transcending the boundaries of caste. The NDA and MGB’s identical vote shares show that this has not happened. The BJP’s Bihar performance is unlike that in Uttar Pradesh (UP), where the Hindu consolidation strategy has worked wonders. To be sure though, political Hindutva in UP has, historically, had a sharper edge. The JD(U)’s politics has centred on building the “coalition of extremes”. The traction for this comes from a silent support base of Extreme Backward Classes (EBCs) and Dalit groups. Nitish Kumar’s good governance rhetoric is largely about protecting this numerically-significant, but individually-vulnerable, section from a return of oppressive upper caste/Yadav rule. This election has underlined the political limits of this strategy. Kumar increasingly stares at the possibility of becoming a mere figurehead as his hold on both government and politics will face a growing squeeze. The RJD seems to have become a victim of its own strength. Even a perceived revival of its fortunes may have triggered a counter-consolidation to prevent its return to power. The MGB’s graph plummeted in the second and third phase after it was seen at the cusp of power. The Yadavs are loyal and indispensible to the RJD, but seem to scare everybody else. Without resolving this dilemma, it cannot capture power. The performance of the Left forces and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) also hold important lessons. With 16 MLAs, the three Left parties have shown the best strike rate in the MGB. Why did they do so well? A plausible answer can be that it was only the Left which could credibly champion the MGB’s rhetoric of economic justice. Why has the Communist Party of India (Marxist Leninist) Liberation, a marginal Left force in the country, performed the best? Unlike the Communist Party of India and Communist Party of India (Marxist), it never did business with the RJD, when it was in power, in the name of secularism. This built its credibility as an anti-establishment force and allayed EBC-Mahadalit fears about the RJD where it contested. The AIMIM has got five MLAs in the Muslim dominated Seemanchal region. What explains its success? The BJP, after having delivered on its core Hindutva agenda of Ayodhya, Article 370 and the triple talaq legislation (seen by Muslims as a precursor to the Uniform Civil Code) pushed the envelope by raking issues such as Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens. Mainstream secular parties (including the RJD) have adopted a ”tactical” non-confrontationist approach on such issues. This allows the AIMIM to rally Muslims in places where their demographic advantage allows the luxury of greater political assertion. The 2020 result in Bihar tests the limits of all kinds of vanguardism. It continues to frustrate the BJP’s hopes of becoming the Hindutva vanguard. Nitish Kumar has learnt that the politics of being the lesser evil in the name of posing as a vanguard of governance is doomed to end in a political coup d’état. The RJD still seems to be paying the price for a sectarian betrayal of the non-Yadav backward castes in whose name Lalu Prasad assumed the vanguardism of social justice in the 1990s. By putting all three major political currents on notice, Bihar’s electorate has delivered a profound mandate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-bihar-has-exposed-the-limits-of-each-party-opinion/story-o9Q286W2aWrX03ljawQnfL.html
12-11-2020||News||From multilateralism to Indo-Pacific, India and Italy deepen bonds||The virtual summit between Prime Minister (PM) Giuseppe Conte and PM Narendra Modi marks an important milestone in the bilateral relations between Italy and India. The two PMs had an exchange that ranged from global to regional and bilateral issues. The results of the meeting were summarised in the Joint Declaration and Plan of Action, which referred to priority areas and strategic goals on which the bilateral partnership for the period 2020-2025 will be based upon. As far as our cooperation in the multilateral arena is concerned, Italy and India agreed to reinforce their partnership also in view of the very special opportunity that the next two years present with their consecutive presidencies of the G20. In this context, we committed to coordinate our activities and set common priorities to strengthen the impact and relevance of our legacy. We both believe in an efficient multilateralism, one that is capable of responding to the needs of a multipolar world. Tackling the current health situation is among the main tasks that the international community will deal with in the near future and this is why we must rely on a reinforced role of the World Health Organization. In this context, Italy and India will work together on a sustainable and inclusive recovery post Covid-19. On the climate crisis, looking to COP26, that Italy will co-chair, we have made significant progress with our Indian partners.We are also aware that a sustainable economic recovery will depend on the activation of solid and reliable global supply chains and enhanced connectivity. In this framework, we are confident to work with our partners for a reinforced trade system that encourages equitable and free trade. As far as regional cooperation is concerned, Italy is aware that the Indo-Pacific region plays a crucial role: It’s through its sea-lanes that a great deal of the world’s trade and energy resources are exchanged. The Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean overlap by connecting continents. That is why, like many other partners, we are interested in ensuring that the connectivity projects between these shores are built on a rules-based international order, rule of law, sustainable and transparent infrastructure investment and freedom of navigation. With this in mind, Italy became a Development Partner of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) with the purpose of contributing to any initiative aimed at facilitating the cooperation between Europe and the Indo-Pacific for the sake of stability, security and prosperity of all the countries concerned. Moreover, thanks also to the Indian support, Italy has recently joined the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) as a dialogue partner. Again, our purpose is investing in the blue economy sector and fostering a stronger cooperation between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean.Bilaterally, we have achieved very important results: Over 15 agreements were signed on the occasion of the virtual summit to further enhance our economic, cultural and scientific ties. Some of the agreements are in the defence industry sector. In particular, our national champion in shipbuilding, Fincantieri, signed two MoUs with Cochin Shipyard Ltd on design, shipbuilding, manufacturing and repair/refit. We are also focusing efforts in the field of aerospace, defence and security to explore joint productions or technology transfer.As far as our economic relations are concerned, we are very aware that the Make in India programme opens many opportunities to Italian companies. There is a strong potential to further strengthen our economic relations and promote investments both ways. This was clearly acknowledged also in the High Level Economic Dialogue at the level of CEOs that was held at the end of October, prior to the summit. With the joint declaration and action plan, we laid before us the basis of our strategic partnership for the next five years and we are looking forward to working with our Indian friends to deliver on what has been agreed among our prime ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/from-multilateralism-to-indo-pacific-india-and-italy-deepen-bonds/story-RIUODAiHgphpQMgqqhFzYO.html
12-11-2020||News||Modi and the politics of welfare||Coming into the Bihar election, most analysts predicted a one-sided victory for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). While the exit polls predicting an NDA loss turned out to be wrong, the NDA’s razor-thin victory proved a surprise. We have now heard all of the narratives about the weak performance of the NDA. Chief minister Nitish Kumar was facing “anti-incumbency.” Rebels from Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) ate into an otherwise comfortable victory. Tejashwi Yadav struck a chord with the electorate.These are all, at some level, accurate portrayals of what happened in Bihar, but they are also excessively local explanations. An over-reliance on these sorts of explanations masks the changes we are seeing across the Indian electoral system. In the 2019 national election, the NDA won 53% of Bihar’s vote. In the recently-concluded state election, the NDA (admittedly minus the LJP) won around 37% of the vote. This continues a trend of the NDA performing at least 15 percentage points worse in state elections as compared to the 2019 national election — something witnessed in Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, where elections have happened either before or after the national polls. What explains this disjuncture? Why are voters increasingly choosing opposing parties in state and national elections (what political scientists call “split ticket voting”)?In a recent article written with my Centre for Policy Research colleague Yamini Aiyar, we have analysed the reasons for split-ticket voting. We boil it down to two conditions. One, voters must be able to separate what is given by the Centre and what is given by the state. And two, voters must distinguish between regional and national preferences. This is what allows a voter to support Narendra Modi at the Centre while supporting his political rival at the state level.While these are characteristics describing when split-ticket voting occurs, we need a theoretical model to understand why this has suddenly happened in India. In another article, I have argued that we need to understand the appeal of Prime Minister Modi through the prism of “vishwas” (trust/belief). There are three elements to this argument. First, voters have become increasingly frustrated with federal “accommodation” along multiple axes — whether it be between castes, between Hindus and Muslims, or between states — generating a demand for greater centralisation. Second, to bypass the institutional procedures of compromise, voters must place their faith in a leader (Modi in this case) to “represent” or make decisions for the nation as a whole. And, third, the political machinery, through advertising around central schemes and innovative use of media, must build a direct connection between Modi and the voter.Indeed, as Rajeshwari Deshpande, Louise Tillin, and KK Kailash have argued, voters have increasingly attributed welfare schemes to Modi and not their state leaders (as has often been the case). This phenomenon is perhaps best explained by the fact that welfare under the NDA is certainly louder than the United Progressive Alliance and this has kept the bureaucracy more alert.How does this hurt state-level leaders aligned with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)? As attribution for welfare schemes have increasingly been given to Modi, the political appeal of state leaders and their welfare delivery has all but disappeared — leaving voters to stew about corruption and joblessness. Indeed, a quick look at recent elections shows that chief ministers such as Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Madhya Pradesh, Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh, and Nitish Kumar in Bihar — all aligned with the BJP, directly or in alliance, who built their reputations on broad-based welfare schemes — have been hit hard by “anti-incumbency” and voter anger. These are all CMs who no longer command much of an “independent” base of support beyond Modi, with one key exception being Yogi Adityanath in Uttar Pradesh.Nowhere is this phenomenon more evident than in “coronavirus politics”. In principle, India’s crippling lockdown should have hurt both the ruling party at the Centre, BJP, and the ruling parties in Bihar, Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) and BJP. But the BJP’s immense popularity stayed largely intact with 67% strike rate in these elections by campaigning on the personage of Modi, while the JD(U) had a paltry 37% strike rate. We have a data point here. As a Hindustan Times analysis piece showed, districts in which Modi addressed a rally had a strike rate of four to 12 percentage points higher in the final two phases of the Bihar election. In short, voters approved of Modi for his ability to protect Indians, and punished Nitish Kumar for his failure to protect them. The strike rate for the JD(U) dropped to 27% in constituencies in districts with higher proportions of male migrants.The sheer popularity of Modi, and the “vishwas” that voters have placed in him, has changed the way the state-level leaders must do politics. No longer can they simply rely on state funds to curry favour with voters by using high social and development expenditure. In a strange twist of fate, no one is feeling the pinch more than state leaders allied with the BJP and Modi.Neelanjan Sircar is an assistant professor at Ashoka University and a senior visiting fellow at the Centre for Policy ResearchThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/modi-and-the-politics-of-welfare/story-KrGDMo7rXYwWGhdZJK79gJ.html
12-11-2020||Mumbai||DGGI arrest director of firm in Mumbai for availing fictitious input tax credit amounting to ₹520 crores||The Mumbai zonal unit of the directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI) on Thursday arrested Sunil Ratnakar Gutte, director of Sunil Hitech Engineering Ltd., on charges of having fraudulently availed and utilised, as well as passed on fictitious input tax credit (ITC) total amounting to ₹520 crores. The input tax credit is an option that allows taxpayers to claim credit for taxes paid on the purchase. Issuance of an invoice or bill without supply of goods or services and wrongfully availing or utilising the input tax credit on a bill/invoice, without any supply of goods or services is a cognizable and non-bailable offence.The accused Gutte fraudulently availed and utilised ITC on the strength of bogus invoices received and issued without any actual supply of goods or services. A recent extensive investigation by DGGI Mumbai zonal unit led them to unearth a large cartel of companies, which had indulged and participated in the fraud. According to GST department, Sunil Hitech Engineers Ltd. had issued and received fake invoices valued at approximately ₹3,000 crores, and involving ITC amounting to ₹520 crores. Further investigations have revealed that the beneficiaries of these bogus invoices are located in all parts of the country, including New Delhi, Hyderabad, Ludhiana, Gurugram, Meerut, Ahmedabad, Kolkata. During the probe, Sunil Hitech Engineers Ltd emerged as one of the key operators involved in the fake ITC cartels throughout India. Following this Gutte was arrested on Thursday. GST investigators believe that the bogus transactions by the accused company were used not just for generating bogus input tax credit, but also for artificially inflating their turnover so as to gain higher credit limit & bank loans, and also to siphon off funds.Gutte was arrested under the provisions of section 69 (1) of the Central Goods and Services Act, 2017, for committing offences under section 132 (1) (b) and Section 132 (1) (c) of the said Act. He was produced in court and was remanded to judicial custody. In a similar action, the GST officials have also arrested one Vijendra Vijayraj Ranka, director of Shree Oshiya Ferro Alloy Pvt. Ltd. Shree Oshiya Ferro Alloy Pvt. Ltd. had fraudulently issued as well as received bogus invoices without actual supply or receipt of any goods or service to the tune of ₹1,371 crores, involving ITC amounting to ₹209 Crores. The investigation has revealed that Shree Oshiya Ferro Alloy Pvt. Ltd. had made substantial supplies to Sunil Hitech Engineers Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dggi-arrest-director-of-firm-in-mumbai-for-availing-fictitious-input-tax-credit-amounting-to-520-crores/story-cJZa4RrBs7RKGN59pHeXvJ.html

The PIL filed by a Pune-based environmentalist sought implementation of the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) order which banned the use of fire crackers across the country due to poor air quality. The PIL sought directions to the state and local authorities to abide by the NGT order. A division bench of justice AK Menon and justice SP Tavade, while hearing the PIL filed by Aniruddha Deshpande, was informed by advocates Niranjan Bhavake, Amit Karle and counsel Aseem Naphade that NGT had, on November 9, passed an order banning the sale and use of fire crackers. The order, while specifying a total ban on fire crackers in cities where average ambient air quality during November (as per available data of last year) fell under ‘poor’ and above category, had also directed states to regulate the use and sale of fire crackers where air quality was ‘moderate’ or below. In light of these directions of NGT, the PIL sought a ban on sale and use of crackers across the entire state as the ambient air quality, as per the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), was below ‘moderate’ or ‘poor’ categories. On its part, the state through government pleader Priyabhushan Kakde informed the court that in light of the NGT order, the state had issued a notification on sale and use of crackers across the state on November 9 itself. The notification, Kakade submitted, put a total ban on use of fire crackers in nine districts which included Ambernath, Badlapur, Chandrapur, Dombivli, Nagpur, Thane, Mumbai, Vasai, Virar and Kalyan. Referring to the notification, Kakade submitted that in 14 other districts, which included Akola, Amravati, Aurangabad, Bhiwandi, Jalgaon, Jalna, Kolhapur, Latur, Nashik, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Solapur, Sangli and Ulhasnagar, the respective municipal corporations had been directed to assess the situation and air quality and to take a decision accordingly in line with the NGT order. After hearing the submissions, the court expressed its satisfaction with the measures initiated by the state in implementing the NGT order and disposed of the PIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/firecrackers-banned-in-9-districts-14-districts-yet-to-decide-maharashtra-govt-tells-bombay-hc/story-fbVK5434O5h8Fpe70cuhjI.html

12-11-2020||Mumbai||Firecrackers could lead to Mumbai’s worst air pollution post-Diwali in 6 years: SAFAR||The city could breathe its most polluted post-Diwali air in six years if firecrackers are used on Saturday, according to an air quality prediction by researchers.With a 50% firecracker emissions scenario on Diwali (Saturday) and prevailing weather conditions over Mumbai, high smoke level is expected to aggravate and push the city’s air quality to the ‘very poor’ range the next day, making it the worst air quality in the last six years, read the air pollution forecast for Diwali 2020 released on Thursday by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research’s (SAFAR), under the Ministry of Earth Sciences. In an emission scenario where no crackers are burst, the air quality is likely to be in the ‘poor’ category. SAFAR began air quality monitoring in Mumbai in June 2015.Last year, Mumbai had recorded its cleanest Diwali and post-Diwali air in five years, owing to high wind speed under the influence of Cyclone Kyarr in the Arabian Sea.This year, the most polluted areas in the city are likely to be Andheri, Mazgaon and Chembur. “The highest levels of PM10 (large coarser pollutant particles) and PM2.5 (fine pollutant particles) are expected between 1am and 4am on the night of November 14 (Saturday) and morning of November 15 (Sunday). Air quality will start to improve from November 16 (Monday) and could reach poor or moderate levels by Tuesday,” the SAFAR forecast stated, adding that cool winds from the northerly to northeasterly direction were expected over Mumbai with moderate wind speed.“The air quality has been predicted taking into account two emission scenarios. The first where 50% firecracker use as compared to the average analysed, based on usage in previous years (2016-2018), standard background emissions, and meteorological conditions such as wind speed, temperature, moisture, etc. The other scenario considers nil firecracker use and just weather parameters,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.“This may be the most polluted post-Diwali air since we began monitoring air quality in Mumbai, if firecrackers are used, as moderate wind speed and cool temperatures will allow pollutant particles to settle close to the surface and limit swift dispersion,” Beig added. SAFAR categorises AQI levels from 0-50 as good, 51-100 as satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate, 201-300 as poor, 301-400 as very poor, and above 401 as severe.In the scenario where firecrackers are used, the air quality index (AQI) for PM2.5 on Friday is expected to be 217, falling under the ‘poor’ category. On Saturday (Diwali) it may reach 263 (poor) and on Sunday may hit 338 (very poor). The AQI is likely to drop to 308 (very poor) on Monday. However, in the emissions scenario when no firecrackers are used, the AQI on Friday would remain the same but the Saturday recording would be 243 (poor), Sunday 267 (poor), and Monday 233 (poor).SAFAR also predicted that the concentration of PM2.5 this Diwali was likely to be almost three times the safe limit if firecrackers were used, and almost twice the safe limit without firecrackers. Against the safe limit of 60µg/m3 (microgrammes per cubic metre), Mumbai could record 109µg/m3 on Saturday and 170 µg/m3 (50% firecracker emissions) and 103 µg/m3 and 110 µg/m3 (nil emission from firecrackers).On Thursday, the city recorded an AQI of 204 (poor) with Mazgaon and Chembur being most polluted at 310 and 309 (both very poor), respectively. Bhandup (54) and Worli (68) had the cleanest air, both in the satisfactory category.Last year, the AQI was as low as 87 (satisfactory) on Diwali day (October 27, 2019) and 96 (moderate) a day after Diwali. In 2018, Mumbai recorded an AQI of 221 (poor) on Diwali (November 7, 2018), and 305 (very poor) AQI a day after. Mumbai recorded high pollution levels during Diwali 2017, when the AQI was 204 (poor) on Diwali (October 19, 2017), and 319 (very poor) the next day. In 2016, an AQI of 278 (poor) was recorded on Diwali (October 30, 2016), and 315 (very poor) the day after.

12-11-2020||Chandigarh||Cracker ban to stay in Chandigarh||The ban on firecrackers will continue without any relaxation, the Chandigarh administration decided on Thursday.Rejecting the review representation made by a city-based traders’ association, UT adviser Manoj Parida said the order issued on November 6 under the Disaster Management Act, banning sale and use of firecrackers in the city, needs no modification or relaxation.The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday had denied any relief to Chandigarh Cracker Dealers Association, which had challenged the UT administration’s order. Refusing to intervene in the matter, the court had told the dealers to approach the administration instead with a representation of their grievance.“The number of Covid cases is rising in Chandigarh. The pollution caused by bursting of crackers is likely to aggravate the situation further by adversely affecting the air quality. Despite restrictive hours for bursting crackers last Diwali, the air quality remained very poor in Chandigarh,” Parida said in his order in response to the traders’ representation.The adviser also quoted the National Green Tribunal order on the cracker ban on November 9, which states that “if there are more stringent measures under orders of the (local) authorities, the same will prevail”.‘Stall allotment was conditional’The traders had opposed the decision to ban crackers just a week before Diwali, stating it would lead to heavy losses. Traders had contended that they already purchased their stock and the administration had also conducted draw of lots for the allotment of stalls for cracker sale. However, Parida said that while conducting the draw of lots, it had been “clarified categorically that the allotment will be subject to a final decision by the UT administration regarding imposition of any ban on crackers”. “The applicants (association) were specifically asked not to go for advance purchase of crackers until November 6. A letter was also written to the president, Chandigarh Cracker Dealer Association, on November 5, stating that the purchase of crackers should be kept on hold,” the adviser said in his order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cracker-ban-to-stay-in-chandigarh/story-XH18SPgEzDY59Gd61kcmnO.html
12-11-2020||Mumbai||BMC commences coral translocation at Haji Ali and Worli for Mumbai coastal road project||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) began the process of shifting corals along the coastal road project route on Thursday, and it will take seven days to complete the process.The state mangrove cell, which is monitoring the translocation, explained how the process will be carried out by the Goa-based National Institute of Oceanography (NIO).Protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, corals are marine species sporadically spread across rocky intertidal regions along the Mumbai coast. BMC plans to shift two species of corals – 18 colonies across almost three feet at Worli, and another species across 1.1 foot at Haji Ali. BMC received WPA clearance from the Centre and forest department in October for the translocation.“We began surveying both coral areas on Thursday with NIO and the mangrove cell. From Friday, major works will commence,” said a senior BMC official, requesting anonymity.DR Patil, divisional forest officer (mangrove cell) said that the corals will be shifted to two different sites by NIO. “For Haji Ali, large boulders [on which coral colonies are] will be removed from the base and shifted at an identified location at Navy Nagar. Each coral colony will be tagged. Initially, all boulders will be removed and kept at Haji Ali in the water itself. Once all colonies are collected, the boulders will be shifted together.”The mangrove cell has appointed range forest officer Suresh Warak and marine biologist Harshal Karve to monitor the translocation.At Worli, sparse coral colonies have been identified across isolated rocks. “These rocks will be cut out and relocated to a site in Worli itself [outside the project area]. A base using cement and other materials will be made on which the cut rocks will be placed,” said Patil, adding that each coral colony will be tagged. “This will help us understand how many corals have been shifted and monitor them post translocation.”Environmentalists said the entire translocation process had been plagued by lack of transparency. “It seems that this translocation is being carried out as a fait accompli, and there is no information available about the experience or the track record of the people carrying out this operation. I do hope the corals survive the translocation,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust.CONDITIONS TO TRANSLOCATE CORALSWhile issuing the final nod to translocate two coral patches the Union environment ministry listed six conditions that BMC must comply with:i) The entire translocation operation must be carried out in the presence of the forest department, and an expert from the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun or any marine expert from a national instituteii) Ensure adequate protection to the corals during the entire process and also at the translocated siteiii) No damage is caused to other wildlife and utmost care exercised during translocationiv) Submit a completion report post translocation to MoEFCC and periodic reports on the status of corals after translocation to new sitev) Ensure no diversion of protected areas or eco-sensitive zones are involved, and the process is not in contravention to any judicial awardsvi) In case of any mishap during translocation that endangers or may endanger the safety of the scheduled species, MoEFCC may review or revoke permissions given.

12-11-2020||Delhi||Don’t be burdened by ideology if it hinders national interest: Modi at JNU event||New DelhiOne should not be burdened by ideology if it is a question of national interest, which is a much higher aim, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday while inaugurating a statue of Swami Vivekananda at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).Speaking at the event at JNU -- considered an academic bastion of the Left -- through video-conferencing, Modi said India’s history was replete with examples such as the freedom struggle or the movement against Emergency, where people of diverse ideologies joined hands for a common national goal.The prime minister, however, warned against shedding ideology for opportunistic goals.The premier university has been in the eye of many ideological battles in recent years as debates on nationalism and secularism have raged within its campus.“If there is one thing that has inflicted huge damage on our country’s democratic set-up, that is to giving more importance to an ideology over national interest. Because someone’s ideology says something, that person will stay confined within that thought – this is not the right approach. Everyone takes pride in their ideology. But our ideology in matters of national interest should be in standing with the nation, and in no circumstance against the nation,” the prime minister said.In the past whenever the country has faced a tough time, people from varying ideologies came together, Modi said, adding during the freedom struggle, people from diverse thoughts came together under Mahatama Gandhi’s leadership.“No one had to shed their ideology under Bapu’s leadership. Everyone gave preference to a common cause. The country saw a similar unity during Emergency. I was fortunate to be part of that movement...there were former leaders and activists of the Congress, leaders of the RSS and Jana Sangh, socialists and communists. There were many from JNU who struggled against emergency. None had to compromise on their ideology. There was only one aim – national interest. And that was the greatest aim,” the prime minister said.When there is the question of national integrity or interest, to be burdened by ideology only leads to harming of the country’s interest, Modi said.“I agree that to compromise on ideology for opportunism or selfishness is as wrong. However, in this information age, such opportunism does not succeed. We are able to see such things minutely in our day-to-day life. We have to stay away from opportunism,” the prime minister said.Pointing to the JNU hostels, the prime minister said they were named after rivers such as Ganga, Sabarmati, Godavari, Tapti, Jhelum, Sutlej, etc. “Like these rivers, you come from diverse parts and with diverse thoughts. This sharing and germinating of ideas has to continue to flow,” he said, adding, only because of diversity of ideas, India is the most vibrant democracy of the world.Modi said the youth should not accept any status quo without questioning it.“I wish this statue of Swami Vivekananda provides inspiration to all to develop compassion, devotion to country and a vision of oneness. This is not just a statue but a symbol of that lofty thought by the strength of which one sanyasi introduced India to the world. He knew what India could give to the world. In USA’s Michigan University, he had said this century belongs to you but the 21st century would belong to India. This statue embodies that very sentiment, the prime minister said.Referring to the popular Sabarmati Dhaba in the JNU campus, Modi said debates and ideas were exchanged happened at this spot. “Your craving for ideas and discussion were satisfied at the Sabarmati Dhaba; now you have another spot,” he added. Speaking on his government’s “pro-farmer” and pro-poor reforms, he said reforms were being carried out in every sector with self-dependence (Atma-nirbharta) in mind. People of the country have through their vote supported these reforms, he said.“You in JNU keep analysing the social and political scenario of the country. Who knows better than you what kind of things were said about reforms at one time in India. Is it not true that good reforms were considered bad politics? Then how did good reforms become good politics?” the prime minister asked.“A safety shield is being prepared before every reform. This shield is vishwas (trust). For instance, pro-farmer reforms; the farmer was only a subject of political discussion for decades and actual steps for their welfare were very limited. But in the past five-six years, we have developed a safety system for farmers. Be it better irrigation system, modernisation of mandis, availability of urea, crop insurance, online marketing, MSP to the tune or one and half times the cost, etc.”The path had been cleared to allow farmers to become exporters, he said.A similar approach was being followed to uplift the poor, the prime minister said, adding this section was always the most neglected. Lauding the new National Education Policy (NEP), he said, “The focus of the NEP is inclusion. Language is just a medium and not a measure of knowledge. That is the spirit of this NEP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/don-t-be-burdened-by-ideology-if-it-hinders-national-interest-modi-at-jnu-event/story-U5LwZfnRyZ9z5qcB4g7boK.html
12-11-2020||Lifestyle||Yours, mine, ours — A happy Diwali for all||A glimmer of hope, a sparkle of happiness and twinkles of laughter - the little joys of life are what festivals entail. Celebrating Diwali in its true essence and espousing its true spirit, these industry pioneers are doing every bit to ensure that the people around have a truly happy Diwali. From an award-winning fashion designer supporting her weavers through the pandemic to a Michelin-star chef helping the less fortunate, here’s how the stalwarts are giving it back to society this year. Designer Madhu Jain, who is known for her exemplary work in keeping Ikat alive is supporting her weavers through these times, with Diwali being no exception. “I am giving them work. It’s just that we are not working on the huge scale that we used to, but I will fight hammer and tong for what I believe in. It is a tough call in today’s time but that’s my philosophy,” she says.Crafts revivalist Laila Tyabji has just wrapped up the annual 11-day Diwali Bazaar, the Festival of Lights at Dastkaar, which received good footfall despite the pandemic. “There were around 125 participants – weavers and crafts people from all over the country. Both the artisans and the customers were happy to have an event like this happening again,” she says, adding that Diwali for her would be sans any parties or celebrations.Michelin-star chef Suvir Saran feels that it is now incumbent upon us that have a roof over our heads and gainful employment to help others less fortunate. He says, “My calling to action came as I saw loyal and hardworking employees lose their jobs and livelihood. I help where and as I can. Have also retained two of my chefs and we are working on R&D so as to be ready for the next chapter of the life of hospitality post Covid-19. Of course, there is the Blind School and we as a family make sure to keep them in our minds. It was where my mother always went to shop for Diwali and also give her time, and we kids carry on that tradition.”The year has been a very tough one and any support that we can give others is much needed believes restaurateur AD Singh. He says, “Now that Olive is restarting its restaurants we have restarted our efforts to fight hunger in children which is an absolute crime. At many of our restaurants under the Kitchens Against Hunger initiative, we charge diners ten rupees extra on their bill and match the same from our side. This corpus will go this season to specific NGOs we support like the Jai Vakeel foundation, the OM foundation etc, to help them provide midday meals for children.”Designer Nupur Kanoi feels that any small contribution towards the society makes a big difference. She says, “This year everybody’s helping each other in the maximum ways one can. We have been working at 30-40% capacity and we have ensured ‘corona-insurance’ for the safety of our workers. We are intentionally working with everything made in India to provide work to our karigars and artisans, and are concentrating more towards our own textiles.”Follow htcity for more updates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/yours-mine-ours-a-happy-diwali-for-all/story-QotaNY0MqIyAG0blnTShaN.html

The efforts also helped him better the record of another local golfer, Shubhankar Sharma (17 years and eight months), to become the country’s youngest to win the title. Kochhar turned professional the very next year in February.Now, after a wait of almost four years and 45 tournaments in the PGTI circuit, Kochhar has finally won his maiden pro title at the Tata Steel Players Championship 2020 presented by the Chandigarh Golf Club on Thursday.The leader of the last two days, Kochhar taking full advantage of his home course, played a round of three-under-69 to complete his tally at 18-under-270 and pocket the winner’s cheque for ₹4.84 lakh.

It’s been almost four years since I turned professional. I was searching for this opportunity,” said an elated Kochhar, adding that though over the years he was not able to win the title, he remained very calm, focused and kept on working on his game. “Today, finally, I am able to break the jinx. In the past, I came close to winning and finished at second place three to four times. I was even placed second last week in Panchkula, and that built my momentum for this win. I am really happy for today’s victory, and being my first pro title, it will always remain special for me in the years to come,” he said. ‘Overall I am in a better shape’Kochhar started the tournament with six-under-66 and maintained his consistency till the end (66-68-67-69).

My confidence is up, I am much healthier, changed my lifestyle, the way I eat, the way I sleep and the way I work. Overall I am in a better shape,” he said. “In the last two months, I had played a lot of golf at my home course and have been very much familiar with the course. And our weekly in-house pro tournaments at Chandigarh Golf Club also helped me to prepare better for the tournament,” said Kochhar, who has been visiting the course with his grandfather Dr GS Kochhar since he was little above three.He started the sport at an early age and had been the top ranked golfer in the age group categories in the amateur circuit.

My entire day goes to the sport, and after Class 12, I had taken a break from the studies. But now, I will pursue my graduation from next year,” said Kochhar. As for now, he plans to take a break for a few days, following which his coach Jesse Grewal will conduct analysis of his game and “will work on my shortcomings or wherever we need to improve”. “My next target is the Jeev invitational tournament to be held next month in Chandigarh,” he said.How others fared at tournamentChowrasia played Thursday’s best card of 10-under-62 and also broke the previous course record of 8-under-64, jointly held by Rashid Khan, Sudhir Sharma and Abhijit Singh Chadha.Chandigarh golfer Yuvraj Singh Sandhu (67) and Gurugram’s Veer Ahlawat (70) were joint fourth at 13-under-275.Abhijit Singh Chadha (66) in tied sixth at 11-under-277 and Aadil Bedi (68) in tied 10th at nine-under-279 were the other two local players in the top 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-golfer-karandeep-kochhar-pockets-maiden-pro-title/story-tCxM3Kh5kYS5dWPbhS4JHP.html

A probe in the matter is underway, said the police.The man, who is from Lucknow, is living in an area under the Sector 39 police jurisdiction. He has alleged that he had contacted an escort service online on November 6.“I spoke to a man and it was decided that we would meet at the Botanical Garden metro station.

The complainant only remembered part of the licence plate number (of the suspects’ car) and we are working on tracing the vehicle,” said Azad Singh Tomar, station house officer, Sector 39 police station.However, senior police officials said that the case is more complicated.“It seems that the victim has had prior contact with the suspects and had even worked with them on earlier occasions.

12-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Ranney wells not functional, residents face water woes||NOIDA: The Noida authority has started the process to hire an agency for repairing defunct Ranney wells and tube well. The move comes after residents complained of poor water supply for the last one month. Officials said complaints have been coming in from October 15, when cleaning of Upper Ganga canal, which supplies drinking water, began.The cleaning will continue till November 15. It is an annual exercise due to which residents witness water woes annually. Officials said residents have requested that the Ranney well and tube well should be repaired on time so that they do not face water woes during the festive season.According to the authority’s water department, five out of the 11 Ranney wells they have are completely shut and 126 tubewells out of 431 are not functional due to technical issues. As a result, the supply of groundwater also gets affected during the festive season.“We are preparing estimates so that we can invite tenders from interested agencies, which can repair the non-functional Ranney wells and tubewells,” said RP Singh, project engineer of the Noida authority.Residents, meanwhile, said the authority should have repaired these well in advance. There are a total of 11 Renney wells in Noida. Each Ranney well extracts ground water and stores it for supply to households. One Ranney well supplies 18 million liters per day (MLD) water to the city. “We have been demanding from the Noida authority that the water supply should not get affected during the festive season. But the water department did not repair these earlier. As a result we are staring at a water crisis. The water supply is not only erratic but muddy water is being supplied in many areas,” said AN Dhawan, legal advisor to the federation of Noida residents’ welfare association (FONRWAs), an umbrella body of city RWAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-ranney-wells-not-functional-residents-face-water-woes/story-dseI0o1zBjp2QTVfGjay5H.html

12-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Slight drop in air quality likely on Diwali but rains may lead to quick recovery||Noida: The air quality of Noida could drop due to a change in wind direction late on November 13 and November 14 – Diwali day, which may lead to accumulation of pollutants, however, a quick recovery is on the cards due to the possibility of rains, said experts. Favourable weather conditions pulled Noida and Greater Noida out of the “severe” air quality category on Wednesday, however, the air as on Thursday was still very poor. According to weather analysts, a slight deterioration, though within the “very poor” category, is likely on Friday and Saturday due to change in the wind directions and speed. “The wind speed is likely to drop towards Friday evening and Saturday. The direction may drop from easterly to north-westerly and the speed may drop from maximum 12 kmph to 6 kmph. This combined with additional local emissions, or possibility of stubble burning, may slightly bring down air quality. But rains are expected on Sunday, a day after Diwali, after which the winds will also increase. This could lead to quick improvement,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). The experts also believe that the improvement in the air quality a day after Diwali would also depend on the intensity of the rains. “There is a western disturbance and a cyclonic circulation over Uttar Pradesh, which will lead to rains in western UP and the national capital region, including other areas in northern India on Sunday, November 15. However, the improvement of air quality depends upon the intensity of the rain. If the intensity is moderate then the air quality will improve,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting agency Skymet. He added that a low rainfall or a drizzle would lead to an increase in the moisture content and trap the pollutants, rather than washing them away. “Heavier pollutants would need strong winds for ventilation,” he adds. According to CPCB records, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Diwali 2019 (October 27) was 358, or “very poor”, against Diwali 2018 (November 7) at 288 or “poor”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-slight-drop-in-air-quality-likely-on-diwali-but-rains-may-lead-to-quick-recovery/story-6EBX6JsbUSmIuLuKKjrPWI.html
12-11-2020||Noida||Air quality of Noida improves slightly, even as violations continue||Noida: The air quality of Noida and Greater Noida showed a little improvement on Thursday as weather conditions remained mostly favourable, yet pollution levels remained in the “very poor” category.However, a slight rise was seen in the smaller particle pollutant PM2.5, which often increases due to smoke from fire or vehicular emissions, showed data assessed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the city saw easterly winds at a speed of 10 to 12 kmph, however, the dispersion was not as high as expected, possibly due to the higher humidity in the air or festival rush leading to more emissions. Weather analysts expect the air quality to worsen slightly due to the change in wind direction on November 13 and 14, but the recovery is likely to be swift in the days to follow.“Easterly winds may see a marginal change or may vary for the day to north-westerly and easterly, but pollutants will ventilate due to better wind speed. On November 14, however, the wind speed may drop to five to six kmph, which may worsen air quality,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. According to CPCB, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 305 on Thursday, against 309 on Wednesday. The city witnessed an AQI of 455 or “severe” on Monday. The AQI of Greater Noida on Thursday was 327, against 340 on Wednesday, and 436 or “severe” on Monday. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 328 on Thursday, against 360 on Wednesday and 444 or “severe” on Monday.Despite a slight drop in the overall AQI, Noida’s PM2.5 levels were at 180.63 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m3) on Thursday against 170.54µg/m3 a day earlier. The PM10 levels, however, shrunk in Noida, from 418.49µg/m3 on Wednesday to 342.17µg/m3 on Thursday. In Greater Noida, PM2.5 remained unchanged 180µg/m3 Wednesday and Thursday, despite supportive winds. The PM10 also remained almost the same with the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) recording them at 385.57µg/m3 on Thursday against 388.79 on Wednesday. “Smoke is the major source of PM2.5, be it from vehicle or stubble burning, unlike PM10 which are coarser particles which rise due to dust. The rise in PM2.5 could be because of more vehicular movement due to the festive season,” said Shambhavi Shukla, program officer, air pollution, centre for science and environment (CSE). Meanwhile, a large pile of horticulture waste was set afire during the day on Thursday in Greater Noida West. The fire was quickly doused off and the waste taken away.“A huge pile of freshly trimmed fauna and some dry horticulture waste was set afire at Sector 16, Greater Noida west. The waste came from three spots – one from a private builder who was getting hedges trimmed outside their construction site, the second from development work at a park and the third from a road divider. We quickly sent a complaint to the concerned officials and after some time, the fire was doused and remains removed from the spot. This is a common issue in this area,” said Manish Kumar, vice-president of Noida extension flat owners’ welfare association, a citizen’s welfare group, who reported the incident. “We had received a complaint about the burning and are investigating the matter. A penalty will be imposed on the concerned department or individual. Waste burning cases are random and we had been imposing penalties and instigating the concerned authorities, like the state industrial development authority and Greater Noida authority, to manage their waste so that it’s not set afire,” said Archna Dwivedi, regional officer, UPPCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-quality-of-noida-improves-slightly-even-as-violations-continue/story-IbDy5f7I8R6FX6qvliHlcL.html

The school was awarded for its commendable efforts in the area of water conversation/management. A team from the ministry inspected the school in January and had decided to announce the awards on National Water Day in March. But, due to the coronavirus outbreak, it was delayed. School principal Anita Singla congratulated the students and staff members and said that they will continue to make efforts to save water. The initiative was taken up by Jasbir Singh Sandhu, the school’s agriculture master, who has come up with a kitchen garden from waste water and the seasonal vegetables grown there are used to prepare mid-day meal. Singh also came up with another creative idea to set up a water-recharging pit where waste water is utilised and can be reused. He also formed teams of NSS volunteers which keep a tab so that water is not wasted and another team of students to help villagers to save water. To sensitise students, authorities organise various competitions such as painting and nukkad nataks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/govt-school-gets-national-award-for-water-mgmt/story-0aNPmReBhONTV9xhnLRgrI.html

Officials said they are trying to seek help from neighbouring districts as Uttar Pradesh officials have increased the daily antigen testing target of both Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, from 2,000 per day to at least 3,500 per day.Sources in the district health department said that the entire stock of rapid antigen kits was exhausted by Thursday evening, and that no replenishments could be made from the warehouse at Meerut. Sources also revealed that stocks of Viral Transport Medium (VTM) vials were about 6,000 in number till Thursday evening. The vials are used for storing samples which are taken up primarily for RT-PCR tests. “A shortage was often observed during the past several days, but new stocks used to come in. However, by the end of Thursday, the entire stock of rapid kits was exhausted and new stock is awaited. We tried to find more boxes of rapid kits, if any was available with us, but to no avail,” said a source from the district health department, asking not to be identified.The district at present has been conducting about 4,000-4,500 tests per day, most of which are being done through rapid antigen kits, at different walk-in centres. The rapid kits give faster results for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease and the test results are generally made available to people within half an hour.“We are trying to get about 2,000 kits from a neighbouring district to ensure that testing is conducted on Friday. Further, we have also spoken to officials in Lucknow and they have assured that sufficient stock of kits and vials will be provided by Friday evening. During Diwali days, we expect that a lesser number of people will come for testing,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of the district. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls and messages sent for his response over the issue. At 58.15%, the share of rapid antigen kits in the overall testing for Sars-Cov-2 in Ghaziabad is high. According to the records of the district health department, they have conducted a total of 4,77,923 tests so far till November 11, and these included 2,77,952 tests through rapid antigen kits, whose use was started from June 26 in the district.Alok Kumar, the state’s principal-secretary (health), on Thursday sent a communication to all the districts in UP where the revised target for daily tests conducted through rapid kits was defined. The order said that all districts combined had earlier been given a target of 92,500 daily tests and this has not been changed. However, officials said that targets have been reduced for districts having lesser number of cases, while the daily testing target has been increased for districts where daily positive case count is higher. As a result, both Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar have been given a revised target of conducting 3,500 tests through rapid antigen kits, as against the previous daily target of 2,000 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-exhausts-rapid-antigen-kit-stock-officials-ask-nearby-districts-for-help-as-state-raises-testing-target/story-6F1ZenAI6iQye4DP0VaJHP.html

The 15-day drive was initiated on October 29 in Ghaziabad during the festival season and ended on Thursday. According to the health department figures, under the drive from October 29 to November 12, about 20,852 tests were conducted for the specific groups such as auto-rickshaw drivers, beauticians, staff of showrooms and malls, staff at sweet shops and chemist shops, among others.The focussed testing yielded 79 positive cases who were isolated as per Covid-19 protocols. However, officials of district administration said that such specific groups have potential to spread infection more than a normal person who moves out.“These groups were tested specifically as they operate in markets and, if found infected, have potential to spread infection to large number of people. So, this drive was taken up specifically around the festival season so that more of such people can be identified and filtered out if infected. This will prevent their customers from getting infection,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.The target groups were tested through rapid antigen kits as well as through RT-PCR tests. The reports of 738 RT-PCR tests conducted on November 11 and 12 are awaited, the officials said.However, the test records available from October 29 to November 12 indicated that highest number of positive cases, 19, was found among staff of showrooms and automobile workshops. About 13 staff members working at chemist shops were also found positive. The records also found that seven auto drivers and 14 staff at different sweet shops were found positive for Covid-19 during the drive.Though the overall positivity rate of the tests conducted during the drive was about 0.38%, experts said that the rate can still be considered high if it is seen in comparison to the total population.“I feel that 0.38% positivity is still high for such groups if we see them in view of total population of the district which is about 45 lakh. So, such categories of persons can also be called as high risk groups which have potential to spread infection manifold. So, the drive has been conducted timely and must continue till the festive season ends,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of the Indian Medical Association - Ghaziabad.The health department officials said that the focussed testing was done to prevent the spread of infection.“The focussed testing was done randomly for specific groups to find which one has high positivity and can infect people more. These groups, which have potential to be super spreaders, come in contact with hundreds of people each day during the festival season. So, we conducted random tests and isolated those who turned positive,” said an officer from district health department who wished not to be named.The officials added that the department has time and again advised and is spreading awareness among the masses to adhere to wearing of face masks, wash hands frequently and maintain social distancing in order to avoid infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/super-spreaders-in-ghaziabad-markets-as-79-staff-of-business-establishments-found-covid-19-positive/story-2Xz5bkKG9gRIoxW1u4WMLI.html
12-11-2020||Chandigarh||Traditional appeal of diyas still popular in Ludhiana||The festival of lights is incomplete without diyas but the coronavirus outbreak this year has cast a shadow on the business of earthen potters and sellers. Traditional diyas have stood the test of time. As residents are saying no to Chinese lights, most are inclined towards buying the earthen pots to light up their homes on Diwali.A dozen earthen diyas are available at Rs 10 in most markets including Jawahar Nagar, near Kundan Vidya Mandir School, and Gandhi Nagar, behind SDP College for Women. In Ghumar Mandi, the price may go upto Rs 20. Decorated and painted diyas are available at the price range of Rs 30 to Rs 40 per dozen. The diya handi is priced between Rs 120 to Rs 500 depending on the size. Kumhar Gali, behind SDP College for Women, is a potter’s colony where over 25 people are in the business of preparing clay products including diyas and utensils. Laxman Das, 50, has been making diyas for the last 35 years and learnt the art from his grandfather. The most important aspect about making diyas is getting the clay right and shaping the item perfectly, he said. It took Das three months to prepare the earthen pots and about 70% stock has already been cleared. “I have devoted a lot of time to making the diyas and spent nights to complete the work a month before Diwali. My wife and son painted 30% diyas as both traditional and coloured diyas are in demand. I am hopeful that the rest will also get sold before Diwali as my son is selling them near Chaura Bazaar and has set up a temporary stall to clear the stock.”Salamat Ali, 40, recalls that the previous generations of his family were able to sustain themselves by selling earthen products throughout the year. “Amid the pandemic, all diya sellers have bought limited stock and except that it will be cleared ahead of Diwali. This time, customers are opting for traditional diyas and saying no to Chinese lights. Apart from selling diyas and handis, I have a variety of clay utensils and flower pots at my shop,” he said. “I went to Kolkata in March this year to get the stock as idols of Ganesh and Laxmi are in huge demand during festival such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Puja, Karva Chauth and Diwali. But, due to the lockdown, I got stuck there for 10 days and returned on March 30 by hiring a private taxi. The items which I have purchased in March reached Ludhiana in July and not many customers turned up during Ganesh Chaturthi. But, before Diwali, rush was witnessed at the shop and we have come up with a variety of items for customers,” Ali added.The diya sellers in Ghumar Mandi and Jawahar Nagar have set up stalls and receive over 50 customers per day. More rush at these shops is witnessed in the evening. The clay diyas are biodegradable and environment friendly. Keeping in mind the poor air quality levels in the city, shoppers have switched to buying earthen diyas. Sumitra Rani, a resident of Prem Nagar, said: “This time, I have decided to celebrate Diwali in a simple way. Instead of decorating the house with Chinese lights and candles, I purchased three dozen earthen diyas and will beautify the rangoli with them. I want to show my children the Indian culture and by lighting diyas on the day, I will embellish my home. It is better to use earthen pots they don’t cause pollution. Due to worsening air quality in the city, we must avoid crackers.” Novel shapes pique shoppers’ interest Diyas from Kolkata that are shaped like religious figures including Ganesha, Laxmi, Shiva and Hanuman have filled the markets. The flower decorated diya with a glass lid on top is also very popular among shoppers. Shopkeepers said the variety of idols come from Delhi, Kolkata and Gujarat. The plate diyas with Goddess Laxmi’s feet is another variation added by the sellers. These special items were available in several shops near Police Lines and Hambran Road. Customers were seen inquiring about these new fancy items and bought them to decorate their homes and use them while performing puja in the evening on Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/traditional-appeal-of-diyas-still-popular-in-ludhiana/story-oqme6xq5JQVd9xyM2OsfII.html
12-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s air worsens slightly; still better than rest of NCR||For the second day running, Gurugram’s air was the cleanest in the national capital region (NCR) on Thursday clocking in a “poor” score of 293 on the central pollution control board’s (CPCB’s) air quality index (AQI) bulletin.Meanwhile, neighbouring Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad recording “very poor” air. Thursday’s AQI reading was, however, marginally worse from the previous day’s 288, also in the “poor” category that falls under the range 201 and 300 and can cause breathing discomfort to people on prolonged exposure. Experts, however, said that the air quality was predicted to deteriorate from Diwali night on November 14 and attributed the current improvement to favourable wind - blowing easterly rather than north-westerly and thus reducing the effect of stubble burning in neighbouring areas.“The air quality is expected to stay in a similar range during the day on Friday but will start deteriorating towards the night. Due to emissions and low wind speed on Diwali night, air quality will deteriorate further,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist. Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist at Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the head of Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, also maintained that the improvement in the air quality over the past two days would not last for long. “The air quality will deteriorate during the Diwali weekend due to a change in the wind direction,” said Srivastava said. An expected Western Disturbance around November 16 may bring about rain in certain areas that could improve air quality and reduce temperature by at least 4°C, he added.The level of ultrafine particulate matter, PM2.5 (diameter of 2.5 microns or less), the city’s primary pollutant, was 241.12 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Thursday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. Gurugram’s minimum temperature on Thursday was 14.6°C and maximum was 28.3°C, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Palam observatory in Delhi, which, according to the Met department officials, gave a fairly accurate reading of city’s weather. Both maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover in a similar range on Thursday.

HSVP administrator Jitender Yadav said that the agency had land on both sides of the Rapid Metro line but a lot of it had been encroached upon for shops, service centre and other commercial purposes. “We have appointed an official to look into the details of land ownership, identify the pockets acquired by HSVP, find out the latest status so that these can be monetised. Soon the status of land will be quantified,” said Yadav. The identification process is expected to be completed within a month, said officials. As per the initial estimates of the authority, HSVP has land on both sides of the metro stations at sectors 55/56, 54 and 42/ 43; and also DLF Phase 1 metro station and other metro stations in Cyber City, said officials. Yadav said that along with monetising the spaces, the authority would also see if there any civic requirement is needed to be fulfilled in these areas.” Not only this but we are in the process of identifying all HSVP land in the city to make it encroachment free as we want to monetise our assets,” he said. The HSVP for the last two years has been facing acute financial stress due to payment of enhancements for land acquisition and the authority owes around ₹12,000 crore to the banks, as per an RTI. Recently, the HSVP suffered a setback in raising money after Punjab and Haryana High Court stopped it from holding e-auctions for sale of plots till the claims of allottees for alternative plots is settled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-to-reclaim-land-along-rapid-metro-line/story-r5vFxN0Mn8Ht8FqSqgWBEO.html
12-11-2020||Gurugram||Active Covid cases cross 6K mark; festive season may see reduced testing||The number of active Covid-19 cases in Gurugram crossed the 6,000 mark on Thursday for the first time, according to the daily health bulletin issued by the district health department. In 24 hours, the district recorded 692 new infections. The total number of patients currently in home isolation or hospitalised increased to 6110. According to official data, more than 450 people are recover every day in the city. But active cases are consistently moving upward. Out of the total active cases, 93% are under home isolated and almost seven percent are hospitalised. Health officials cite that it is likely that the number of active cases will decline in the next 10 days due to a recovery rate of almost 83%. As reported by HT on Thursday, active cases might be around 5100 by November 30 based on the state health department projection for the current month.Dr. Virender Yadav, Gurugram’s chief medical officer, said, “Since it is Diwali time, the team will observe the Covid-19 trend during the weekend and if required meeting will be held with private labs and hospitals on November 17 or 18 to tackle cases.”Reduced testingYadav said he expected the walk-in testing footfall and overall testing to decrease during the weekend. On Thursday, 3832 tests were conducted, slightly lower than Wednesday’s 4161. “Diwali is a major festival. Therefore, we are expecting not many people would turn up for the Covid-19 until it is an emergency,” said Yadav. Another reason for reduced testing, Yadav said, would be the concern on the testing kit stocks. “The department is running short of antigen kits. Only RT-PCR tests will be administered till the department receives kits from the state government next week,” he said. Both government and private labs conduct nearly 800 rapid antigen tests a day. It is likely that without antigen kits, testing will drastically fall down by nearly 600 tests a day. More so, evening testing camps will not be held on the evening of Diwali, while routine sample collection at Civil Hospital, sector 10 and Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) and 14 testing camps as per the department’s schedule will continue on Diwali day, that is, November 14.“Routine testing will happen at the sample collection centres. Health workers will do contact tracing and hold testing camps. Routine evening camps, however, will not take place on the evening of Diwali,” said Yadav. For the evening camps, health department stations its two testing vans outside malls or market areas. Tests are administered to only symptomatic patients. For more than a month, these vans were stationed at different locations each day to facilitate people to get tested for Covid-19 while they visit markets. Through evening camps, the district health department administers Covid-19 tests to over 200 people every day. A few private labs said that the routine walk-in testing will be handled till 3pm on Diwali. “Generally, team conducts tests on collected Covid-19 samples during the night hours. On Diwali, the night team won’t be working instead the tests would run on Sunday morning. Despite this, the target is to deliver test report within 24 hours,” said Dr Rishabh Rajput of Modern Lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/active-covid-cases-cross-6k-mark-festive-season-may-see-reduced-testing/story-RUnpKTs91N7Gc4hVy5ujlN.html
12-11-2020||Gurugram||Man assaulted to death for marrying Dalit woman||A 28-year-old man died on Tuesday night after he was assaulted by a group of Dalit men for marrying a woman from their community. Police on Thursday arrested at least five suspects, who are relatives of the woman, in connection with the assault in Badshahpur.According to the police, Aakash Singh, of Alwar in Rajasthan, had married the woman in July, against her family’s wish, and started living at a rented accommodation in Bhondsi.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police, said that since his wedding, he had been receiving threatening calls from his brothers-in-law and the woman’s relatives. “His in-laws were unhappy with the couple as they had eloped and married against the wishes of the woman’s family. They had threatened them not to be seen in the area. On November 8, he received a call from his in-laws, after which the couple went to meet them in Badshahpur. Both were excited,” he said.Singh and his wife went to his in-law’s place on November 9 for the first time in five months, the police said.Rahul Singh, Aakash’s elder brother, who lived in the same house as the couple and accompanied them that day, said that the woman’s relatives asked them over for drinks and dinner, and took the brothers out. “His brothers-in-law and his friends had already kept iron rods, wooden sticks and plastic pipes in their car with the intention to assault my brother. After a couple of drinks, they started abusing us, to which my brother intervened and asked them to behave. Two of them went out and returned with sticks and rods and attacked us,” he said.The police said that Rahul had escaped from the spot and called his friends from the vicinity, but the suspects severely thrashed Aakash and left him in an unconscious state.Sangwan said Rahul returned with his friends after half an hour and found his brother lying in a pool of blood. He rushed him to Civil Hospital in Sector 10 and informed police. “He was referred to Safdarjung Hospital where he died on Wednesday undergoing treatment,” he said.The police booked the suspects under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 323 (assault) of the IPC on Monday and added Section 302 (murder) on Thursday at Badhshahpur police station.On Thursday, the suspects, identified as Ajay alias Prami Jatav, Ravi Singh Jatav, Pawan Jatav, Dharmender Jatav and Mohit Jatav, all residents of Ravidas Mohalla of Badshahpur, were arrested.“They wanted to take revenge on the deceased as he had eloped with their sister and married her against their wishes. They had planned to kill him several times earlier also, but could not succeed,” he said.The police said Aakash’s statement could not be recorded before he died, as he did not regain consciousness. “During questioning, the suspects gave different statements. One of them said he had come to their area to sell illegal countrymade liquor and another one said that he had hit one of the suspects while he was walking and Aakash was sitting in an autorickshaw. We are investigating and questioning the suspects,” he said.The woman is presently living with her parents and could not be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-assaulted-to-death-for-marrying-dalit-woman/story-nZiwKtnGdK5Cj33Inw1NBK.html
12-11-2020||City||Manesar to have its own municipal corporation||Gurugram: The proposal to set up a municipal corporation in Manesar has the potential to transform the area into a satellite township of Gurugram, industrialists based in Manesar said Thursday. According to residents, the area as of now is struggling due to weak infrastructure, poor sanitation and civic services even as the population has increased manifold.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday had announced the setting up of a municipal corporation in Manesar that would take care of the civic needs of IMT, Manesar and the urbanised villages around it as well as residential sectors adjoining it. Senior government officials said that work on setting up the new municipal corporation will start within the next 15 days. Industrial associations in Manesar said the proposed corporation would be a boon for the area as the infrastructure and maintenance would greatly improve. Manmohan Gaind, general secretary, Manesar Industries Welfare Association, said that Gurugram has expanded manifold and that agencies in the city are overburdened with work. “There is a need to have a separate agency to look after the development and upkeep of Manesar and adjoining area. It would boost business and also make decision making localised,” said Gaind. Pawan Yadav, president of the IMT industrial association, said this decision should be implemented at the earliest. “There is a large population of executives, industrial workers and migrants living in industrial areas as well as developing sectors and they will greatly benefit,” he said.According to former Manesar sarpanch Om Prakash Yadav, who has had the experience of working in the panchayat, block samiti and zila parishad of Manesar and Gurugram, the majority of the villages in the area have urbanised and a civic agency would be better suited. “The time has come for a change and it is important that the new corporation is empowered and given adequate resources for development,” said Yadav.The area to be included in the corporation has around 24 villages, including Manesar, Kasan, Shikohpur, and Panchagaon, which have a very large population, said Yadav. Amit Arya, media advisor to the chief minister, said that the objective of setting up the new municipal corporation in Manesar is to ensure better development of infrastructure, improved services to residents of the area and localised decision making by urban development bodies. “The work on implementing the decision has been initiated and it would ensure more resources for better development,” he said. While industrialists and residents of Manesar welcomed the decision, residents of developing sectors said that instead of clubbing these areas with Manesar, the government should set up a new corporation for sectors 58 to 115. “The new corporation for Manesar is welcome but the government should create a corporation for developing sectors as presently it is neglected. We have paid our EDC/IDC in Gurugram so there is no question of our area being clubbed with Manesar,” said Pravin Malik, president, Sare Home residents’ welfare association. Senior government officials, meanwhile, said the area of the present civic agency of Gurugram will be expanded while the corporation for Manesar will include Manesar and urbanised villages around. There is a possibility of including residential sectors beyond Kherki Daula under Manesar as well, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/manesar-to-have-its-own-municipal-corporation/story-58dDKMnWpiKcQCsPNOa4YO.html
12-11-2020||Gurugram||MCG plans cycle track along Gurgaon-Faridabad Road||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is planning to survey the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road for setting up cycle tracks along the stretch, officials said on Thursday.For the upcoming MCG House meeting on November 18, an agenda regarding this has been proposed by Mahesh Dayma, MCG councillor of Ward 30. In the reply section of the agenda list, the MCG answered that commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh has already directed officials to carry out a survey in Ward 30 for setting up cycle tracks.“Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and MCG, together, are working on setting up cycle tracks across the city. In this regard, work on the cycle track on Gurgaon-Faridabad Road has been taken up by MCG’s engineering wing. Our objective is to bring air pollution levels down through encouraging people to use non-motorised transport modes, such as bicycles, by creating the requisite infrastructure for it,” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG.The entire Gurgaon-Faridabad Road falling within Gurugram is located under MCG’s Ward 30, comprising localities of Bandhwari, Gwal Pahari, Ghata, Baliawas, Ullawas, Bahrampur, sectors 55, 56, 57 and 62.“The Gurgaon-Faridabad Road is the ideal location for setting up cycle tracks in Gurugram. It is wide enough to accommodate cycle tracks without compromising on the road width. In addition, the road has several slopes and hilly terrains which will make it a major point of attraction for cyclists across NCR. Hence, I included the stretch as one of the areas in my ward where cycle tracks need to be established on an immediate basis,” said Dayma.Dayma’s agenda also proposed construction of cycle tracks along Golf Course Road (GCR) and between Ullawas and Sohna, along the Aravallis.Dayma said that with the GMDA already having plans for constructing cycle tracks along GCR, and the MCG not in favour of constructing any concrete track in the Aravallis, the civic body is no longer considering these two options and solely focusing on assessing the feasibility of cycle tracks along Gurgaon-Faridabad Road.Around 11 kilometres of the 25 kilometres Gurgaon-Faridabad Road fall under Gurugram, while the remaining section falls in Faridabad. MCG officials will be surveying the 11-kilometre section between Khushboo Chowk and the toll plaza for assessing if cycle tracks can be installed there.“MCG and GMDA are looking at establishing cycle tracks across various parts of the city and undertaking assessment at multiple locations as part of this process. Increasing cycling infrastructure is not only important for health but also vital for safeguarding thousands of residents who choose this as a mode of transport every day,” said a senior MCG official.Last month, GMDA-MCG had opened the city’s first cycle track between Huda City Centre (HCC) and Subhash Chowk on Sohna Road. During a Raahgiri event, Singh had announced that the MCG will be building two cycle tracks from HCC towards Galleria Market and Vyapar Kendra, respectively, within the month.MCG also has plans for building a cycle track along St Thomas Marg, between Genpact Chowk on Golf Course Road and Kanhai traffic signal.Coincidentally, on Thursday, the GMDA also issued a tweet stating that according to their survey, 57% of citizens would cycle to work. As per a GMDA study, 12-15% of residents use cycle as a daily mode of transport on Gurugram roads every day.“Despite being a state highway, Gurgaon-Faridabad Road has a sizeable number of cyclists riding along the stretch. Hence, building cycle tracks is of great importance on this stretch as it will firstly ensure safe passage for thousands of cyclists and pedestrians, and secondly, also promote and provide an opportunity for others to use non-motorised transport for commuting,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, co-founder of Raahgiri foundation, a body promoting non-motorised transport.Raahgiri is working alongside the MCG and GMDA as a consultant for setting up cycle tracks across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-plans-cycle-track-along-gurgaon-faridabad-road/story-d4kcIXA4jcYOAqcoLWPGUJ.html

Police identified the suspect as Manoj Kumar of Gurugram’s Sadhrana and said he had been peddling drugs for at least 18 months in the national capital region (NCR). Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) crime, said, “The suspect had purchased the narcotics from a Nuh-based supplier and paid ₹75,000 per kg for the consignment. His plan was to sell it in small packets at 10 times the cost and had finalised deals with other peddlers in the city and in Delhi. We are checking his criminal record.” The suspect was produced before a district court that sent him to 14-day judicial custody, said police. During questioning, Sangwan said, he revealed the names of his associates and told police that his brother, Kuldeep Singh, was arrested on June 26 in possession of 112kg of marijuana. “He started smuggling marijuana after his brother’s arrest and has traded more than ₹20 lakh in the last two months. The drugs are smuggled from Odisha,” he said. A case was registered against him under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at Farukhnagar police station. In October, police had arrested three men in alleged possession of 107 kilograms of marijuana (ganja), estimated to be valued at least ₹20 lakh from Nuh based peddlers.

12-11-2020||Mumbai||Land deal with Anvay Naik: BJP’s Kirit Somaiya continues attack; Shiv Sena refutes claims||Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former MP Kirit Somaiya on Thursday continued to raise more questions in connection with purchase of the 9.35-acre land jointly by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s wife Rashmi and Sena leader Ravindra Waikar’s wife Manisha from interior designer Anvay Naik six years ago. Somaiya asked whether the political families had any business relations with Naik, who died by suicide with his mother in 2018. The Maharashtra Police recently reopened the case, leading to the arrest of Republic TV editor Arnab Goswami and two others on charges of abetting the suicide by allegedly not repaying his money. Rubbishing the claims, Waikar said the facts presented by Somaiya were already shown in his election affidavits and income-tax returns and there was no link between the deal and the reopening of the Naik suicide case. “It is just an attempt to make an issue out of nothing,” he said. Somaiya, who on Wednesday produced the documents of the deal in nine land parcels, presented copies of 7x12 extracts for 21 plots on Thursday. “The joint deal between Thackerays and Waikars proves they have business relations…There should not be any air of suspicion against the chief minister of Maharashtra and hence they should clarify. Secondly, why did Thackeray not make the deal public while reopening the Anvay Naik suicide case. Most importantly, why was the land deal not mentioned in the probe by Raigad police, when the suicide had relation with the financial crunch Naiks faced,” he asked, adding he was going to reveal more information related to the deal in the coming days. Also read: BJP demands probe into land deal between Thackerays, Naiks; Shiv Sena rubbishes claimsIn his election affidavit filed during Assembly polls in October last year, Waikar had disclosed the ownership in the name of his wife. According to the affidavit, the 9.35-acre land in Kolai village in Murud tehsil in Raigad was purchased on March 21, 2014 for ₹2.18 crore. The land owned with 50% ownership by his wife (and remaining by Rashmi Thackeray) appreciated to ₹4.35 crore in 2019. Although Somaiya has claimed to have furnished 21 land records, the affidavit has the mention of 30 land records. CM Thackeray’s affidavit filed in May this year for the legislative Council elections has similar details about the land owned by Rashmi Thackeray. A spokesperson for the Thackerays said Sena leader Waikar will speak on the issue. “Somaiya has been trying to misguide people. Whether nine records are produced or 21, the land size (9.35 acres) remains the same. We did not buy it from 21 sellers, but only from Anvay Naik. Somaiya has no business asking about the relation between Thackerays and us. Uddhavji is our party chief and head of the family and there was nothing wrong in purchasing the land jointly. Anvay had come to me through my secretary for the sale of the land. Neither me nor Thackerays knew him before it and the question of having any business relations does not arise,” he said. Waikar said they are ready to face any inquiry in the deal and Somaiya was targeting the Sena because they ensured that he did not get a ticket in the Lok Sabha elections last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/land-deal-with-anvay-naik-bjp-s-kirit-somaiya-continues-attack-shiv-sena-refutes-claims/story-BSS9AmQw15hFWkWskHrlZK.html
12-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sees dip in daily Covid-19 tests ahead of Diwali: BMC data||Ahead of Diwali, the number of Covid-19 tests being conducted in the city has gone down. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s data, 1.11 lakh tests were conducted in the first 10 days of November, compared to 1.41 lakh tests in the corresponding period in October. The city reported 7,274 cases from November 1 to 10, compared to 19,656 cases in the first 10 days of October. With a similar number (1.11 lakh) of tests in the first 10 days of September, the city had reported 16,168 cases. The positivity rate for the first 10 days was 6.54% in November, 13.91% in October and 14.30% in September.BMC has been conducting tests for Covid-19 since February 3, and the first case was detected on March 11. Mumbai became the first city in the country to liberalise testing guidelines starting July 7, to allow all citizens to get tested, irrespective of symptoms. However, as the festivities neared, BMC said it planned to conduct 20,000 to 24,000 daily tests. BMC has, since November 1, also started free testing centres at 244 locations in the city, wherein citizens can walk in daily between 10am and 12noon to test for free. However, the number has gone down to between 8,000 and 13,000 tests daily, down from around 13,000 to 15,000 tests daily in October. Of the total daily tests, the ratio of testing using rapid antigen kits is around 40%. Also read: Second Covid-19 peak in Mumbai to be less severe comparatively, says TIFRDr Kedar Toraskar, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said, “November has been better compared with other months, but we will have to continue testing. Our suggestion is that the number of testing should not go down but remain the same, if not increase.”On the other hand, Dr Shashank Joshi, another member of state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “The testing has increased in the past few months. But there are two probable reasons why the number may be going down – people are treating for Covid-19 without testing, which is not a good thing. Secondly, as cases are going down, people are not getting tested, assuming Covid-19 is gone. We need to continue with Covid-appropriate behaviour because cases may have gone down but Covid-19 is not gone.” The one lakh-test mark was crossed on May 6, three lakh on June 24, four lakh on July 14, five lakh on July 29, 10 lakh on September 20, and 11 lakh on September 27. The overall tests remained 11.15 lakh, as of September and the positivity rate stood at 18.15%. Until November 10, 16.48 lakh tests have been conducted and the overall positivity rate is 16.12%. Daksha Shah, executive health officer of BMC, said, “The effort from the administration is maximum. However, owing to Diwali, many with mild symptoms or asymptomatic patients don’t want to get tested. In the coming days, the daily testing figure will go up.” On Thursday, the city reported 858 cases taking the tally to 2,67,606. Nineteen deaths were reported taking the toll to 10,525. Further, 2,41,214 patients have been discharged post Covid-19 treatment in Mumbai. The city’s discharge rate is 90.13%. There are 15,117 active cases in Mumbai and fatality rate is of 3.93%. One hotspot that has shown signs of drastic improvement – Dharavi – recorded only two new Covid-19 cases on Thursday.

The government is attacking the farmers by promoting profiteering and hoarding.”Rathore said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has back-stabbed the farmers just for the benefits of corporate houses and industrialists for whom he is working and has damaged the agriculture sector too.“By hiking the rates of LPG, electric water charges, the government has further increased the financial burden on the people. The government should withdraw the hike in the prices in order to provide much-needed relief to the people” he added.“If the government fails to control the inflation and withdraw the hiked prices, the Congress will intensify its movement,” said Rathore.After the protest, HPCC also submitted a memorandum to the governor through Shimla deputy commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-congress-protests-against-rising-inflation/story-UlTrQ8OXbb5gpAv6yCDp8M.html

For the last six days, more than 600 people have tested positive for coronavirus and the number of deaths has also increased,” said Chauhan.He added that with the rapid increase in the infection, the healthcare facilities in the state have also started to collapse as Covid wards in IGMC and DDU, Shimla was full to capacity.In an all-party meeting presided over by the chief minister on March 21, Chauhan said that CPI (M) had explicitly warned the government that the pandemic could create a catastrophic situation. To tackle the situation, his party had suggested recruiting doctors and build infrastructure. He alleged that the government did not take it the suggestions seriously.He claimed that the government has collected more than Rs 84 crores from the public in the name of Covid and of this, it has spent only around Rs 25 crores.“This has clearly exposed the government’s preparedness to deal with the virus,” he said.“The government should immediately call an all-party meeting and work to tackle the terrible situation arising due to the pandemic. If it fails to act, the party will launch a stir,” said Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cpi-m-demands-to-set-up-experts-panel-to-deal-with-covid-in-himachal/story-IzH4YsTm3uro2AinFDRSCL.html

The union has strongly condemned the government’s double stance in terms of schools and Anganwadi centres.State president of Anganwadi union Neelam Jaswal said that it was the right decision to close government schools and on the same lines, the Anganwadi centres should also be closed.“Life and safety of Anganwadi workers and assistants working on nominal honorarium are being continuously put at stake in a health emergency like coronavirus. It has become clear from this that the government has no respect for Anganwadi workers who take every scheme of the government to the ground,” she said while adding that no decision has been taken regarding Anganwadi centres.She has also demanded that Anganwadi workers and assistants should be given security leave in view of the pandemic.“During the first wave of the pandemic, these activists and assistants, while in the field, had literally obeyed every order of the government and proved themselves to be true Covid warriors. Now, in the second wave too, workers serving in Anganwadi centres have been left alone to fight the virus. The government should also issue an order to close the Anganwadi centers in time for the safety of workers,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-hp-govt-shuts-down-schools-workers-now-demand-closure-of-anganwadi-centres/story-m0EsLpQDVzBNXM0QwZw1KL.html

In the meeting lasting for one-and-half hour, Jitendra Singh referred to Prime Minister Modi’s speech last evening after the declaration of election results in Bihar and other states and quoted the PM as saying that from Ladakh down south up to Karnataka, people have reposed their faith in the government’s agenda of development.While addressing the delegation, Singh said these elections assume special significance since this was the first electoral exercise after Ladakh became Union territory and in spite of the negative propaganda by the opposition parties, people of Ladakh have once again reposed unflinching faith in Prime Minister. He said Modi gave the highest priority to Ladakh and other hitherto neglected regions including North East and Island territories. Jitendra Singh informed that the Union ministry of science and technology is planning to set up a regional centre of CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research) in Ladakh. He said that the Modi government had granted Ladakh a university, a medical college and an engineering college. Speaking about the connectivity issue of the region, Singh said that with the opening of Atal Tunnel (also known as Rohtang Tunnel) and the under-construction Zoji La Tunnel the all-weather connectivity with this peripheral region will give a big economic and security boost to the region. And this became a reality only under the able leadership and unflinching will of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Union minister also referred to the Rs 50-crore special development package for Ladakh and said this was for the first time that any Central government had been so liberal in funding the various projects for the region. He said this will be the first of its kind roadmap devoted exclusively to the Ladakh region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/newly-elected-leh-councillors-meet-union-minister-jitendra-singh/story-Cvu2p8O3XpVqWrK4sf2RhL.html

Delhi BJP president Aadesh Gupta was also present at the inauguration event.In January, Gambhir had inaugurated a first-of-its-kind smog tower in Lajpat Nagar’s Central Market as a pilot project.Following positive response from people in that area, Gambhir decided to install more air purifiers in markets across East Delhi, the statement said.Also Read | Delhi’s air quality improves, may deteriorate again over Diwali weekendIn terms of technology, the new purifiers are more advanced and have additional features like high mast lights, it said.“I know that these air purifiers will not solve the problem completely but something has to be done. These air purifiers will have a major impact on people living in nearby areas,” Gambhir was quoted as saying in the statement.“I don’t believe that getting yourself advertised on every traffic signal is the solution to such a major problem which affects each and every Delhiite especially our elders,” he said.The East Delhi MP also questioned the banning of firecrackers only a few days before major festivals.“Why don’t they ban crackers throughout the year when they know the air quality of the city is so bad. Why ban them only before festivals,” he said.“They first gave licenses to traders for traditional and green crackers and then banned them as an ad hoc measure. This led to tremendous losses to the shopkeepers and traders in time of the pandemic. They should have made their policy clear from the very beginning,” Gambhir said.On November 5, the Delhi government banned the sale and use of all types of firecrackers in the city from November 7 to November 30.On Monday, the National Green Tribunal also imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the NCR from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying “celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases”.Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai had on Wednesday appealed to opposition to desist from making statements that provoke people against the ban on firecrackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gautam-gambhir-inaugurates-first-of-its-kind-giant-air-purifier-in-delhi-s-gandhi-nagar-market/story-ieERXDQtWBvXGcUYN6NSjL.html

The meeting lasted for over five hours at the residence of NC provincial president and close confidante of the Abdullahs—Devender Singh Rana.The Congress deliberated upon devising a strategy and pick common candidates for the ensuing district development council polls to brighten their poll prospects.Besides Devender Singh Rana, the meeting was attended by PDP general secretary and former MLC Surinder Choudhary and Congress spokesperson and former MLC Ravinder Sharma.“It was conveyed to Farooq Abdullah who is the chairperson of PAGD, by the Congress high command that the party wants to support like-minded secular parties like NC to strengthen the secular fabric of J&K and for the welfare of people of the Union territory and Ladakh,” said Devender Singh Rana.“In continuation of the communication of Congress high command received through J&K Congress president GA Mir, a meeting was held to chalk out a strategy to implement this on the ground because the time is less and there are some aberrations which have to be worked out,” he added.Rana added, “We had detailed discussion with Congress chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma and senior PDP leader Surinder Choudhary. We have tried to iron out certain issues. This is very preliminary because this is the first stage and the working modalities are work in progress at the moment.”Rana informed that the common candidates will be worked out for the DDC polls and that it was not a day’s work.Congress spokesperson Ravinder Sharma said, “We have started an adjustment process with the like-minded secular parties like NC and other political parties to ensure the victory of our candidates. We have discussed their suitability and there will be a broader formation wherein common candidates will be fielded.”PDP’s Choudhary said, “This alliance is not for elections only but to fight for the rights and issues of businessmen, transporters, casual labourers, daily wagers and traders”.He said that nothing was finalised about the candidates and for that more meetings will take place.Meanwhile, another round of PAGD meet that began around 10 am on Thursday was still on at Rana’s residence.He informed that the constituents were still deliberating upon candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-joins-pagd-bandwagon-for-j-k-district-development-council-polls/story-ZeGTURuTjQXDUreQ2Vp4oN.html

So they have jumped into the fray,” Mir said.Altaf Bukhari president of Apni Party said with the joining of a leader who has worked very hard for the mitigation of public grievances through the forum of Panchayat Raj is a good omen for the party.He said that Apni Party has believed in peoples’ empowerment and this political goal can be archived only by strengthening the Panchayat Raj institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-panchayat-conference-merges-with-apni-party/story-IDrw1cnUI4jA61TXQKrYEJ.html
12-11-2020||City||Housing societies in Pune say no to Diwali crackers to check Covid spread||Pune: A number of residential societies in and around Pune and Wagholi are looking forward to celebrate a smokeless and eco-friendly Diwali this year. The harmful effects of crackers to those suffering from respiratory ailments and possible rise in Covid cases have made them celebrate the festival without fireworks. The management of housing societies have also decided to keep a vigil on those who flout the safety steps by bursting firecrackers. The public notice put up at Windsor Avenue in Wanowrie reads: “Dear Windsorites. Please be informed that PMC has totally banned bursting of firecrackers in public areas and urge the citizens to strictly avoid bursting them at home too as the firecracker smoke is highly toxic and dangerous to Covid patients, whose lungs have been affected. With due concern for our own Covid affected and survived members, as well as concern for our senior residents, we request that this year we at Windsor Avenue celebrate a firecracker-free Diwali. We request parents to please sensitise their children about the perils of firecrackers not only on the Covid patients, but also on the environment.” Windsor’s former president Maithily Manakwad said, “Every year we need to celebrate a cracker-free, smoke-free and noise-free Diwali. In fact, every festival should be celebrated in an ecofriendly manner consciously choosing the well-being of earth.” Nikunj Sahu, chairman, Rose Parade Society at NIBM society said, “We had forwarded a notice to our members through social media ten days back and again issued a similar notice. The notice asks residents to not burst crackers and ban it completely in the larger interests of citizens’ health.” Daljit Goraya, secretary, Ganga Kingston Society said, “The cracker pollution would cause severe inconvenience to patients who are undergoing treatment at homes. Even the National Green Tribunal has recommended ban on cracker bursting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/housing-societies-in-pune-say-no-to-diwali-crackers-to-check-covid-spread/story-PtAR3HksnKVj1WIp8YvEPO.html

12-11-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: Plan to provide relief from traffic congestion fails to take off||Ghaziabad: Even as Ghaziabad suffers high pollution levels and traffic congestions due to festival rush, the district administration is yet to put in place its proposed “car-free zone” plan for 17 traffic hot spots. The traffic police said that they have not received any directions to decongest the hot spots. Commuters said that most of the major roads and markets in the district were packed to capacity with traffic. “I reached Navyug Market from Noida’s Sector 63 in over an hour through NH-9 and Vijay Nagar Link Road. There is a major traffic on NH-9, Meerut Road and also in old city markets. If there was any plan to regulate traffic, it has almost failed to give relief,” said Sachin Soni, a resident of Kavi Nagar. In the wake of rising pollution, the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) had last month identified 17 hot spots which suffer heavy traffic congestion leading to air pollution. The identified hot spots are ABES cut, Vijay Nagar crossing, Tigri cut, Santosh Medical crossing, Lal Kuan flyover, Atma Ram steel crossing near Vijay Nagar, Ghanta Ghar, Meerut crossing, Raj Nagar Extension crossing, Sihani Chungi, Old vegetable market, Sahibabad-Seemapuri crossing, Bhopra crossing, Site IV industrial area at Sahibabad, Loni crossing, Tila Morh crossing and Tronica City. In a press statement issued recently, the Ghaziabad administration said that they will be making up the 17 hot spots as “car-free zones” and also mentioned that their initiative was appreciated by the Union environment minister. When HT sought the “car free zone” plan from district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, he said that he has come up with three-pronged strategy. The administration has also planned common parking near 34 major markets, wherever possible. “We cannot restrict all the 17 hot spots. So, we have come up with three-pronged strategy. In areas of busy markets, we have identified spots for common parking and from there visitors can walk. So, we have come up with parking at four such places. At places where traffic cannot be stopped at all, we have decided to deploy more traffic police and civil defense personnel,” Pandey said. He further said that in other areas, the administration has requested residents for restricted movement. “This may include measures like provision of online shopping or home delivery of items. High-rises can depute one person to take up purchases of their items. Further, instead of many people going out, few can go to markets and can even resort to car-pooling. So, in this manner we can surely reduce traffic congestion,” the DM added. However, Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic), said that the traffic police department has not received any direction for the hot spots. “There is no traffic diversion at the hot spots as we have not received any directions so far. The common parking has come up at two places -- Nehru Yuva Kendra adjacent to Ambedkar Road and at Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground. These areas have big markets around them,” Kushwaha said while adding that areas in Indirapuram and Sahibabad do not need common parking. He also said that the “car-free” zone plan is being chalked out for Raj Nagar District Centre (RDC). “There is already a vehicle-free zone at RDC and we are planning to increase it till the Diwali festival. At other points in the city, we have deployed additional personnel to maintain smooth flow of traffic,” he said.Due to festive rush, the online traffic status at 5pm on Thursday showed that there were traffic snarls at major roads that included CISF Road and Chijarsi near Indirapuram; Vijay Nagar cut, ABES cut and Lal Kuan on NH-9; Ghanta Ghar, Chaudhary Morh, Meerut Crossing, Arthala, Mohan Nagar and Shyam Park, among others on GT Road. “Due to Dhanteras, there is almost two to three times traffic on roads. The situation becomes worse with roadside parking. Everyone is parking vehicles wherever they find space. Major affected roads are the ones of CISF Road, Kala Patthar Road, Mangal Bazar, Orange County road and also near Jaipuria Mall,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-plan-to-provide-relief-from-traffic-congestion-fails-to-take-off/story-aPynxXMEBFyPJCUaczb6JL.html
12-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi launches free e-vehicle service for transporting Covid-19 patients||Electric vehicles can now be hailed by non-critical coronavirus (Covid-19) patients in Delhi for transporting them to and from healthcare facilities, said the state government on Thursday while launching an app ‘Jeevan Seva’ for the same. Those who test positive will be shared a link through SMS or a QR code for downloading the app. Launched in collaboration with EVERA, the electric vehicles will be used as an ambulance to transfer patients to any healthcare facility for free. At the launch of the app, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said, “We are launching the Jeevan Seva app today to facilitate safe travel for Covid patients in home isolation. The service can be used for health check-ups, transfer for admission to a hospital, or purchasing health amenities. With this app, you will get access to an e-vehicle which will provide for free pick up and drop services. Each vehicle will be properly sanitised after every ride.”Once the app is downloaded, patients can book a cab after registering through OTP, by entering their pick up and drop location. The nearest cab will automatically be dispatched to serve. The service will be available 24*7.The trained drivers will comply with new safety guidelines such as wearing PPE kits and being well equipped with sanitizers. The cabin will be insulated as well. The process of booking the e-vehicle, calling the driver etc will be through the app, and the complete digital interface will mean a touch-free convenient drive for patients.Like any cab service, the app will capture the pick-up location of the person allowing the drivers to reach them quickly. Other than that, the GPS tracking will also allow supervisors to monitor the situation.The service will also free up the ambulances for the more critical cases. Co-founder and CEO of Prakriti E-mobility Nimish Trivedi said, “The Jeevan Seva app is the first ever initiative to help Covid patients to reach healthcare facilities in EV cabs while taking care of the patients and planet with its zero emission cabs. We are pleased to work with the Delhi government to launch this great initiative and hope that it will help us in fighting the ongoing pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-launches-free-e-vehicle-service-for-transporting-covid-19-patients/story-uIK1uaLDUtWYf0NxbjsZQI.html

12-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi: PM2.5 levels on Diwali will be lowest in 4 years if no crackers burnt, says SAFAR||The PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali is likely to be the “lowest” in the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt, a central government agency said on Thursday.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said pollution levels in Delhi during the Diwali period are likely to remain in the higher end of the “very poor” category in the absence of emissions due to fireworks.“Under ‘zero-firecracker’ scenario, the level of PM2.5 is likely to be the lowest in the past four years as not so calm surface winds in Delhi will help in dispersion (of pollutants),” it said.PM2.5 is particulate matter which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.SAFAR said stubble burning-induced impact on AQI is expected to increase from “negligible to moderate” in the next two days.A spike in PM2.5 in the early hours of November 15 is likely in case of fire-related emissions, it said.Also read: Deficient rain may have added to pollution spike“The transport-level winds are now north-westerly and will have high potential to transport biomass plume in the next three days, but the expected moderate surface winds in Delhi will not allow rapid accumulation of pollutants for a longer period,” it said.However, the air quality is expected to remain in the higher end of the “very poor” category and the lower end of “severe” category on Diwali night.SAFAR said moderate easterly boundary layer winds are likely on November 15 and November 16. Isolated rainfall under the influence of a fresh Western Disturbance is also expected by November 16.“These two factors will help in reducing the impact of any additional emissions and biomass plume,” it said.On November 5, the Delhi government banned the sale and use of all types of firecrackers in the city from November 7 to November 30.On Monday, the National Green Tribunal also imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the NCR from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying “celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-pm2-5-levels-on-diwali-will-be-lowest-in-4-years-if-no-crackers-burnt-says-safar/story-Ipgr4ps26f05OS0JU9cMYK.html

In such type of cases, assessees are requested to kindly ignore the Rateable Value indicated on the bill and make the payment of tax as per their own self-assessment on actual rent basis if the property is on rent or on the basis of old Rateable Value till the new assessment is finalised,” the official added.

Manjhi was the lone HAM MLA in the outgoing assembly.Later, talking to reporters Manjhi advised the newly elected lawmakers of the Congress to join the NDA for the progress of the state.“Nitish Kumar’s development plans are not much different from those of the Congress. Moreover, he has kept away from many issues that are not in the interest of the state. So, you can join us in the NDA and contribute to the development of the state,” Manjhi said.He was apparently hinting at Kumar distancing himself from contentious issues like Ram temple in Ayodhya and instant triple talaq.Also read | ‘Public is with us, it’s win for Grand Alliance’: Tejashwi Yadav in first comments after Bihar poll resultsManjhi had started his political career with the Congress in 1980.

When Kumar wanted the chair back, a defiant Manjhi initially refused but gave in to pressure.Kumar facilitated his return to the NDA just before the assembly elections to counterbalance another Dalit leader Chirag Paswan, who walked out of the ruling alliance in Bihar and went to the hustings alone.Manjhi’s party was given seven seats to contest from the JD(U)’s quota of 122, and the party did well winning four.The HAM leader said he will not become a minister in the new government headed by Nitish Kumar after having been the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/manjhi-elected-ham-legislature-party-leader-but-won-t-accept-ministerial-berth/story-Ilezod11utLvzefju6SLiK.html

12-11-2020||City||Pollution in Ghaggar: NGT orders three states, UT to submit report by January 31||Jalandhar The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is upset with the three states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and UT Chandigarh over their failure to implement the recommendations of the executive panel headed by justice Pritam Pal (retd) to control water pollution in Ghaggar river. The NGT also directed the chief secretaries of respective states and UT to hold a meeting within one month on the recommendations of the executing committee for meaningful prompt action and fixing accountability for the erring officers. The NGT has ordered that the four chief secretaries must meet at least once in a month to take stock of the situation, while the first such meeting may be held on or before November 30 and action must be taken and compliance report is to be submitted to the executive panel by Jan 31, 2021, while the committee will submit its consolidated report, and its own recommendations on or before Feb 28 next year. The NGT has fixed the next hearing on March 16, 2021. The NGT observed that HP, Haryana, Punjab and UT Chandigarh continue to contribute to water pollution, which is a criminal offence. It is a breach of public trust under public trust doctrine. “Water pollution is a serious threat to the health of the citizens as well as other living beings who consume the water and also to the food safety for growth of which the water is used for irrigation,” reads the order. The NGT added that if the state finds that they are unable to manage the sewage directly, there is no bar to other options being explored but there cannot be any justification not to comply with the mandate of law and protecting the health of the citizens in accordance with the constitutional mandate. “No action is being taken against the erring officers. It gives an impression that there is the collapse of Environmental rule of law. Who is to pay the cost of damage to the environment and public health of a large number of unidentified citizens and other living creatures? Is such cost being calculated? How officers responsible for damage by their inaction or otherwise are being dealt with. Should the state be held liable vicariously for such failure and failure to punish the guilty,” reads the order. NGT added that it had passing repeated orders and as many as six reports have been submitted by a monitoring committee headed by a former high court judge and a former chief secretary, clearly recording failure of the state authorities but the higher authorities are also conveniently ignoring their responsibility. Advocates for the authorities only maintain silence before this tribunal. “If the state itself fails in implementing the law, it is nothing but the breakdown of the system itself. Is this Tribunal to just remain a silent spectator for such gross failure or hold the highest authorities accountable by directing their prosecution for their criminal failure and indirectly being party to the crime against the law of the land? How the law of the land is to be meaningfully enforced? We expect answers to these questions from the states,” NGT warned.The monitoring panel gave recommendations for controlling pollution in Ghaggar river to pollution control bodies of the respective states and UT to upgrade the Sewage Treatment Plants in towns on the banks of Ghaggar river or install new STPs, besides it also recommended stopping untreated wastewater flowing into the river along with taking action against identified polluters, law violators and officers responsible for the failure for vigorous monitoring. The Ghaggar river originates from Himachal and passes through Haryana and Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pollution-in-ghaggar-ngt-orders-three-states-ut-to-submit-report-by-january-31/story-wwDGDDylEPlkt2TrT7Xm6K.html

He had been suffering from a condition called dilated cardiomyopathy due to which only 20% of his heart was functioning.The condition causes the heart to dilate reducing its pumping activity and inability to pump adequate blood to the body resulting in chest pain and breathlessness, reducing the ability to do routine life activities and can even lead to multiple organ dysfunction at a later stage.“The patient had a heart attack in January this year wherein two of his vessels were blocked, one was working only 10% due to which stenting had to be done and the second was working 30%. In June, the complaint increased, he experienced breathlessness even while resting and had fluid retention in legs. Investigations revealed that the patient had Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCMP),” said Dr Krishan.The patient had a reduced heart function and ejection fraction- 15-20% (ejection fraction of normal heart is 55–60%).The Cardiac Transplant Team from Max flew down to SMS Hospital, and retrieved the organ around 6.20pm.The police and traffic authorities immediately created a green corridor for transfer of the harvested heart in both the cities, ensuring safe transport of the heart within the stipulated time.Apart from the heart, the family also donated the kidneys, and liver of the 16-year-old.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/heart-flown-to-delhi-from-jaipur-saves-life-of-45-year-old/story-8Zn3VKJ8pGPGS8VesDsyOK.html

Altogether, 4,776 people took part in the survey from all eight districts in the north-eastern border state, including 1,238 from West Tripura district alone. In the West Tripura district, 41.76% of the respondents have developed Covid-19 antibodies -- the highest in the state.The district-wise break-up of the respondents, who have developed antibodies against the viral outbreak, is: Sepahijala (41.40%), followed by Gomati (40.50%), Dhalai (25.36%), Khowai (39.53%), South Tripura (37.06%) and North Tripura (22.09%). Also Read: As Covid-19 pandemic rages, global daily deaths surpass peak levels from AprilThe antibody tests are conducted periodically to assess extent of the spread of any disease. “According to the sero survey, the public in North and South Tripura districts have developed lower antibody levels. The West Tripura district has the highest antibody positivity rate in the state,” said state minister for law, Ratan Lal Nath. The present trend suggests that Tripura is comparatively better placed than other states in the north-eastern region such as Meghalaya, Manipur and Mizoram as far as Covid-19 outbreak is concerned. The authorities have managed to compile 99.45% of the database of the state government’s frontline employees, who are battling the Covid-19 pandemic, and another 98.73% staff in private healthcare institutions, as per the Centre’s directive, according to the government. The state government has made wearing of face masks mandatory in public places under the Tripura Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulations, 2020 amid a spike in fresh cases of the viral outbreak. A first-time violation of not wearing a face mask in public places will attract a fine of Rs 200 and Rs 400 for the repeat offence.The state government had started a drive to create awareness about wearing of face masks in public places in September and collected around Rs 99 lakh as fine from the violators to date. In September, a three-member Central medical team during their visit to Tripura had observed that social distancing norms and mandatory wearing of face masks in public places were being violated with impunity by a majority of the people.So far, Tripura has recorded 31,706 Covid-19 cases and 356 deaths related to the viral outbreak.

12-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: PMLA court rejects Deepak Kochhar’s bail plea||A special court, constituted under the Prevention of Money Laundering (PMLA) Act, 2002, on Thursday refused to grant bail to Deepak Kochhar, the husband of former ICICI Bank managing director (MD) Chanda Kochhar, in connection with a money laundering case.Earlier this week, Deepak Kochhar had moved a bail plea on two grounds. The first ground was failure of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to submit a charge sheet within the stipulated time frame of 90 days. The second ground was on the merits of the case and claiming his innocence. The court on Thursday heard arguments from Deepak Kochhar’s lawyers -- Vijay Aggrawal, Rahul Aggrawal and Ashul Aggrawal -- and the ED counsel, Hiten Venegaokar and Sunil Gonsalves.Also Read: Chanda Kochhar, 2 others named in ED’s money laundering chargesheetDeepak Kochhar’s lawyers pointed out that the charge sheet was yet to be filed even though the stipulated 90-day time frame had expired. The prosecution contended that the agency submitted a charge sheet before the registrar of the court two days before the stipulated 90-day deadline expired. The charge sheet contains voluminous documents that are kept in five trunks, pending scrutiny. The special court heard the arguments and rejected Deepak Kochhar’s bail plea on the ED’s failure to file the charge sheet within the stipulated 90-day deadline.The court will hear the plea on the merits of the case on November 23 after the Diwali vacation gets over.The ED took up the money laundering probe after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a case of corruption against the Kochhars over three years ago. The CBI had initiated the inquiry in 2017 against the couple after a whistleblower had alleged that ICICI Bank sanctioned credit facility of about Rs 3,250 crore to various corporate entities, which were in contravention to banking rules and policies. The CBI had filed a first information report (FIR) in January, 2019, where it alleged that six high-value loans worth Rs 1,875 crore were disbursed by ICICI Bank to Videocon Industries Limited (VIL) between 2009 and 2011. It was alleged that in 2009 the credit facility to VIL was extended in contravention of rules and policies by the sanction committee, which included Chanda as one of its members. A loan of Rs 300 crore was disbursed to M/s Videocon International Electronics Limited, a part of Videocon group of companies, on September 7, 2009. An amount of Rs 64 crore — out of the loan of Rs 300 crore -- was allegedly transferred to M/s NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL) by VIL on September 8, 2009. The ED, which investigated the allegations, claimed that VIL transferred the money to NRPL via Supreme Energy Private Limited (SEPL), which was later acquired by Pinnacle Energy, a trust owned by the Kochhar family. The agency claimed that NRPL was owned, controlled and managed by Deepak Kochhar. “The loan funds travelled from VIL to NRPL through SEPL, but two intermediary companies were brought in for the purpose of layering. The proceeds of the crime (Rs 64 crore) were utilised by NRPL to purchase properties,” the ED had claimed in its remand application while seeking Deepak Kochhar’s custody.“A residential property -- an apartment at CCI Chambers in Mumbai -- was purchased for Rs 5.25 crore on February 19, 1996 by Credential Finance Limited (CFL). CFL was a company, where VIL had substantial interest along with the Kochhars and the latter’s family members. CFL defaulted in repayment of a loan of Rs 4.7 crore availed from the State Bank of India (SBI) and for which the apartment was placed as collateral. VIL paid off the dues in 2009. Later, the ownership of the apartment was transferred to M/s Quality Appliances Pvt Ltd (QAPL), now known as M/s Quality Techno Advisors Pvt Ltd (QTAPL), a Videocon group company from CFL. On November 26, 2016, total shareholding of QTAPL was acquired by Quality advisors -- a family trust of Deepak Kochhar set up by Chanda’s mother -- for a nominal sum of Rs 11 lakh,” the agency further claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-pmla-court-rejects-deepak-kochhar-s-bail-plea/story-K3OHqseBOiqzmXrCj8Hn7H.html

Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Faridkot, on Thursday displayed the provisional merit list of candidates for admission to MBBS and BDS courses in the state’s 24 colleges under the NRI quota. “We have received only 40 applications for the first round of counselling. Seven candidates are children of NRIs, who originally belong to Punjab, while 33 are children of NRIs from other states,” says university registrar Dr Ruhee Dugg. “The reason for the low number of students opting for NRI quota MBBS and BDS seats is the high tuition fee. Students also have to account for other expenses during the five-year course, making it an expensive proposition,” says BFUHS vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur. MAIN SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR COLLEGES NRI quota seats are the main source of revenue for medical and dental colleges. A full course fee for an NRI quota MBBS seat is US$1.1 lakh (₹82 lakh) in all private and government medical colleges of the state. The fee for NRI quota BDS seat is US$44,000 (₹32.8lakh). According to the hiked fee structure this year, students of the government medical colleges of Amritsar, Patiala and Faridkot will pay Rs 7.8 lakh fee for MBBS, while students of Dayanand Medical College (DMC), Ludhiana; Adesh Medical University, Bathinda; and Punjab Institute of Medical Sciences, Jalandhar; will pay Rs 18.5 lakh for government quota seats and Rs 47.7 lakh for management quota seats. Sri Guru Ram Das University of Health Sciences, Amritsar, will charge Rs 47.7 lakh from both open merit and minority quota students. The fee for BDS courses in government colleges is Rs 3.9 lakh, while students in private colleges will pay Rs 7.6 lakh under the government quota and Rs 10.3 lakh under the management quota. SIMILAR TREND OVER THE YEARS Last year, of the 316 MBBS and BDS seats under the quota, 279 seats remained vacant after all rounds of counselling. In the 2018-19 session, 287 of the 309 NRI quota MBBS and BDS seats in the state had remained vacant. The seats were later merged into the general category. Nine medical colleges in Punjab offer 161 NRI quota MBBS seats. The number of BDS seats reserved for the NRI candidates in 15 dental colleges in the state is 176. The result of the first round of counselling for NRI quota seats will be declared on November 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nri-quota-seats-in-punjab-medical-colleges-go-abegging-due-to-high-fee/story-8HmRe5f2O0IMupCMWVF9bL.html
12-11-2020||Pune||Covid-19 triggers health infra boost in PMC||PUNE The Covid-19 pandemic has improved the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC’s) health infrastructure with increase in number of ventilators from zero to 71 in civic body-run hospitals, including maternity hospitals and state’s only infection control hospital, Naidu hospital. Naidu hospital which is still the state’s only permanent infection control hospital had no ventilator until March 2020, but now has ten ventilators. It was also the first hospital in Maharashtra to isolate and treat Covid-19 patients. Currently, there are 71 ventilators at hospitals which the PMC controls which include the ventilators that the civic body received under the PM Cares funds and also the ones at the jumbo facility at College of Engineering Pune, ground. The 71 include the 10 at Naidu hospital, 10 at Dalvi Hospital, 15 at dedicated Covid-19 hospital at Baner, 30 at the COEP jumbo facility and six which the civic body got under PM Cares funds and are currently at Sassoon General hospital, but will be returned as and when required by the civic body. Dr Anjali Sabne, health officer incharge, civic hospitals, said, “It is true that we got these ventilators in a very short period. We also got hundreds of doctors on board even if they are on a contractual basis and also filled in all the crucial posts during the pandemic.” Dr Abhiijit More, health activist and state co-convenor for the NGO Jan Arogya Abhiyan, said, “The civic body was not at all prepared for this pandemic in terms of health infrastructure and now due to the pandemic they were rather forced to do it which is not a good thing. However, PMC’s Kamala Nehru still does not have an ICU. All this despite the fact that Pune had witnessed a serious swine flu pandemic in 2009 and the civic body failed to learn any lessons from it.” Chetan Tupe, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA, said, “When we were in power in PMC, we had purchased the best of ventilators which were never put to use by the administration. They were left packed at Kamala Nehru hospital for years and later donated to Sassoon hospital by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It is not true that we did not get any machinery, but the problem was that the civic body did not get any expert doctors to operate the ventilators, which is why they could not be used and this problem persists.” Health infra boost in PMC (Figures as of November 2020) 10 at Dalvi hospital 10 at Naidu hospital 30 at COEP jumbo hospital 15 at Baner DCH 6 at Sassoon General Hospital (PMC got under PM Cares funds) 71 total ventilators||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-triggers-health-infra-boost-in-pmc/story-U8cf2sKgqan3myGdWbeV6L.html

12-11-2020||Pune||Pune’s jumbo facility sees rise in critical patients||PUNE With the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) giving up private hospital beds as per the state government’s decision, the city’s largest dedicated Covid-19 jumbo facility at College of Engineering Pune (COEP) ground is witnessing a slight increase in critical patients. The patients are being diverted to the jumbo facility instead of being sent to private hospitals under the PMC health scheme, and a few of them are coming to the centre at a critical stage which may have led to a slight rise in the critical cases, say doctors. The civic body now intends to keep all Covid-19 patients at one place. As of Wednesday, the facility has 22 patients on ventilators and ten in the intensive care unit (ICU) without ventilators. The November 6 figure was 19 patients on ventilators and 14 in ICU without ventilators. The jumbo facility has 600 beds, including 435 oxygen beds, 135 ICU beds without ventilators and 30 ventilators. Dr Shreyansh Kapale, director, Medbros, the agency which runs the facility, said, “It is true that we are witnessing a slight rise in critical cases which could be because those from private hospitals are being diverted to the facility, but we are also seeing a few cases wherein patients are coming late to the hospital and then end up in a critical situation.” PMC which runs the facility is paying the agency to provide manpower and services to Covid-19 patients. As per the contract, the civic body has to pay for at least 50 per cent of the beds reserved irrespective of whether they are occupied or not. Another civic official from the health department on condition of anonymity said, “We have to pay private hospitals under the PMC’s urban poor health scheme and also to the jumbo facility agency which will only put an additional financial burden on the civic body. The civic body aims to concentrate all Covid-19 patients at one place for which the COEP jumbo centre would be a primary option.” Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner, said, “It is true and worrying that we are seeing a rise in the number of critical patients at the jumbo facility.

Madan, 40, was sentenced at the Westminster Magistrates Court after admitting to one count of the criminal offence at an earlier court appearance, officials said on Thursday. Apart from the community sentence and prosecution costs, he must pay £600 (Rs 59,007) compensation to the victim and a £85 (Rs 8,365) victim surcharge. The Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC) was contacted by the victim who made a complaint after she paid £600 for inadequate advice and negligent service that led to her leave to remain application being rejected by the Home Office. Investigations showed that Madan did not possess the relevant authorisation, training or qualifications. Immigration commissioner John Tuckett said of the conviction, “Mr Madan allowed the complainant to put her trust and future in him. This was a serious offence given the amount of money involved and the impact on the applicant.” The OISC is an independent public body that regulates the provision of immigration advice and services in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/southall-punjab-origin-man-sentenced-for-wrong-visa-advice/story-6i2iEMSs9jrjHcrjyhgz8K.html
12-11-2020||Kolkata||Bengal: Anti-electrocution cells to be constituted to protect elephants||The West Bengal government has decided to constitute multi-departmental anti-electrocution cells to protect wild elephants in the state, officials said on Thursday.The decision in this regard was taken during a recent meeting in north Bengal between officials of the Power and Forest Departments, they said.The cells will comprise officials of the Forest Directorate, the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (WBSEDCL), district administration and police, besides local panchayat members, they said.“The cells will formulate preventive and mitigation strategies and monitor measures to prevent setting up of illegal electric fences.“During the meeting, it was also decided to identify and raise the height of sagging high-tension lines and cover certain electric poles near elephant corridors with barbed wires to prevent the pachyderms from leaning against them,” Chief Wildlife Warden V K Yadav said.Necessary vehicular support will be provided to the cells by the Forest Department or the WBSEDCL and each cell will have its own WhatsApp group for better coordination, he said.The Forest Department will identify corridors frequented by the elephant and the WBSEDCL will insulate the low-tension lines passing through such corridors with aerial bunched cables, Yadav said.The department will also set up electric fences with “low-voltage pulsating current” to prevent the elephants from wandering into human settlements, he said.Also Read: No pre-final tests for West Bengal class 10th, 12th students: Mamata BanerjeeThe WBSEDCL will thoroughly check why the circuit breakers for the high-tension feeder lines did not trip after elephants came in contact with them in the past, another official said.The tea garden managements may not be encouraging the setting up of illegal electric fences but there are several such fences near labour colonies that cause electrocution of the elephants, he said.The Forest Department will identify tea gardens adjacent to elephant corridors and the cells will ensure that the managements of the estates erect only low-voltage fences, the official said.As per the department, 25 elephants have died due to electrocution in north Bengal in the last five years, of which nine incidents took place this year.“The principal cause of deaths of elephants was found to be unauthorised extension of low-tension domestic power lines on the periphery of the forests and the use of electric fences,” Yadav said.Copies of the recommendations made at the meeting have been forwarded to the top state officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-anti-electrocution-cells-to-be-constituted-to-protect-elephants/story-9wu3ULLDhHdWtLz9O0UpDM.html
12-11-2020||City||Goa CM defends controversial infra projects again, disregards Kejriwal’s advice||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant on Thursday again defended three controversial infrastructure projects in his state that have had environmentalists up in arms while telling his Delhi counterpart, Arvind Kejriwal that he did not need his advice on the matter.The two leaders exchanged sharp words on the issue for a second day on Twitter on Thursday.There have been midnight protests against the double-tracking of a railway line from Goa to Karnataka as well as a highway expansion and a proposed power transmission line project that will pass through Goa’s oldest wildlife sanctuary, the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary in Mollem and Mollem National Park.Also Read: ‘Worry about Delhi first’: Goa CM Pramod Sawant’s advice to Arvind KejriwalThe projects will cost 170 hectares of forest land and around 55,000 trees. Activists fear the projects will destroy the sanctuary and the pristine Western Ghats ecosystem that it was designed to protect. They say the railway track was being doubled to expand the coal-carrying capacity from Goa’s Mormugao Port to north Karnataka. The railways and Sawant have allayed the fears saying nothing like this was being planned. “Doubling of Railway tracks is a nation building exercise. There is no threat to Mollem [Wildlife Sanctuary] & we will ensure it remains that way. We will not allow Goa to become [a] coal hub. Knowing your expertise in creating Center vs State issues, we will skip your advice,” Sawant said in a tweet.Kejriwal responded saying Sawant should listen to Goa’s people. “@DrPramodPSawant ji, you don’t need to listen to my advice but please listen to the voices of Goans. Shouldn’t Goans have some say in their own state? Is Central diktat more important than Goan voices?”Kejriwal earlier suggested the Centre was “forcing this project on Goa”, which prompted Sawant’s response.“Dear CM @ArvindKejriwal ji, we are making sure that there is no pollution issue in Goa and our Govt will ensure that our state remains pollution free. I am sure the people of Delhi also want the same in their beautiful state,” Sawant said.Dear CM @ArvindKejriwal ji, we are making sure that there is no pollution issue in Goa and our Govt will ensure that our state remains pollution free. I am sure the people of Delhi also want the same in their beautiful state. https://t.co/tUHU2wqmdVKejriwal earlier said Goans were opposing the railway double-tracking project. “Kindly hear their voice n #savemollem as they are lungs of Goa. I understand [the] Centre is forcing this project on Goa. Pl stand wid (with) Goans, say NO 2 centre n save Goa from becoming coal hub.”Kejriwal said it is not about Delhi’s pollution vs Goa’s. “Both Delhi and Goa are dear to me. We are all one country. We all have to work together to ensure there is no pollution in both Delhi and Goa,” said Kejriwal.Sawant was earlier quoted as saying that Kejriwal should look after his own state.On Wednesday, Sawant separately said the highest amount of coal was handled in 2017 when 14 million tons of coal was imported, which has since come down to around 9-10 million tons. “I have discussed this with the Union shipping minister that it should be further reduced. We will not cross those high levels again,” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/goa-cm-defends-controversial-infra-projects-again-disregards-kejriwal-s-advice/story-DP6e0xXxYQdnD90OEQyszK.html
12-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi high court vacates stay on reservation of 80% ICU beds for Covid-19 patients||The Delhi high court on Thursday vacated the stay imposed by a single judge on the reservation of 80% Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in 33 private hospitals in the national capital. “In view of the present situation and the spiralling situation that has radically changed in the last three months, the order of September 22, passed by the single judge, is vacated,” the court said.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government issued an order on September 12 asking 33 private hospitals in the city to reserve 80% ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. This order was stayed by the HC on September 22 on a petition by the Association of Healthcare Providers. Later, on October 9, a division bench of the court took up an appeal by the Delhi government, refusing to vacate the stay while adjourning the matter to November 27. The AAP government approached the apex court against these two orders of September 22 and October 9. The Supreme Court has refused to interfere with the HC order staying the AAP government’s instruction to private hospitals in the city to reserve beds. The high court also asked the state government as to what exercise it has carried out in reserving 80% ICU beds in 33 private hospitals, while stating that a September 12 notification to that effect is “outdated” and that “the situation on the ground is much more critical”.Also Read: Explain reason behind reserving 80% ICU beds for Covid-19 patients: HC to Delhi govt“What is the rationale behind selecting these 33 hospitals? What is the density exercise that you have conducted? Is it a random selection? What is the density exposure and how many of the hospitals have been reserved in the Central district of the city with the fourth sero survey report showing increase in the cases? How have the beds been divided?,” a bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad sought to know from additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain, who represented the Delhi government. ASG Jain submitted that three factors had been taken into account while choosing the 33 hospitals. He said they had the largest chunk of ICU beds (a total of 2,217). He said that the remaining 82 private hospitals in the city had 1,051 ICU beds, and they had also been told to reserve about 20%-40% of their ICU beds for Covid-19 patients.Jain contended that the 33 hospitals were also chosen because they were popular among residents, and were better equipped to segregate Covid and non-Covid patients as well as increase the number of ICU beds if required.He said that while there are 20 ambulances available to ferry patients to the Radha Soami Beas Satsang facility, 60 more ambulances are being offered by the Delhi government to transport patients from home to hospitals and from one hospital to another.However, appearing for the Association of Healthcare Providers, senior advocate Maninder Singh and advocate Sanyam Khetarpal said that the 33 private hospitals had already reserved 67% of their ICU beds for Covid patients. Singh said 50-55% of the ICU beds were required for non-Covid patients, including new ones and those already under treatment at these private hospitals.After hearing the submissions, the court said that no citizen with a health emergency should be made to run from pillar to post if there is a bed available in a hospital. It said that the Delhi government must feel the pulse of the city to cope with the situation, given that there has been a sea change in the ground reality since the September 12 order was passed.On Wednesday, the government informed the high court that around one in four of the 15,000 people tested in the latest serological survey in the capital showed prevalence of antibodies against Sars-Cov-2, indicating that the proportion of people with antibodies has remained largely unchanged from the previous round of the exercise. The court also asked the Delhi government as to whether there are nodal officers appointed to coordinate with the management of these private hospitals to check the availability of the beds.ASG Jain submitted that there are 33 nodal officers assigned to each hospital and there is one nodal officer per district. All of them collectively report to the special secretary, health, Delhi government, to look into the availability of beds.Following this, the court vacated the stay imposed by a single judge on the reservation of ICU beds on September 22 while stating that since the network of nodal officers is already in place, they can coordinate and change the order according to the situation.The bench asked the Delhi government to file an additional affidavit before the single judge and changed the date of the next hearing to November 26 from November 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-vacates-stay-on-reservation-of-80-icu-beds-for-covid-19-patients/story-oc1H5rrYQzeD6DfECJDc2K.html
12-11-2020||Delhi||Dhanteras 2020: Shaadi shopping, silver steal the show||Silver jewellery, trinkets, coins, minimalist designs, surge in demand of solitaire, this Dhanteras is all about these and trending among Delhiites. As the denizens gear up to celebrate Dhanteras, also known as Dhantrayodashi, wherein Goddess Lakshmi, along with Lord Kubera who is the God of wealth, jewellers in the city share what’s trending among the Delhi-NCR folks, as some even opt for wedding shopping amid the corona scare. Silver steals the showWhile it is considered auspicious to buy gold and other precious metals on Dhanteras, Silver is shining brighter in the market than the yellow metal. “Chandni Chowk has the best, and often the cheapest rates for metals in the market. Still demand for Gold is restricted to people who are looking to invest in wedding jewellery. For Dhanteras, Silver is reigning supreme; keeping with the tradition, people are coming to purchase silver utensils, hathdi and murtis,” says Naresh Bansal, who runs Bansal and Sons, a jewellery store in Chandni Chowk. Coins tinkleLoss of jobs, and less income made people dip deep into their savings during the pandemic. “People invest in precious metal from their savings. Ab savings nahi hain toh log kya hi lenge,” opines Shashank Bharadwaj, who runs Bhagwati Jewellery store in West Delhi and says mere 20% of his customers are opting to come to the store. He says silver, and occasionally gold coins, have found new takers. “Earlier people would purchase jewellery, but coins are very popular this time since they let people celebrate Dhanteras without burning a hole in their pocket,” adds Bharadwaj.Delicate is not just classy but affordable tooRaj Kumar, owner of Mayur Jewellers in Janakpuri tells us buyers are showing a keen interest in trendy silver jewellery since Gold is not within everyone’s reach. “We don’t see a lot of visitors to the store these days, and the ones who are coming, wish to purchase small, delicate silver trinkets like anklets, small pendants and earrings. We have a good variety of it too. Gold ke daam toh aasmaan chhu rahe hain, toh ab silver hi bik raha hai,” he adds. Shopping because there’s shaadi in the familyGaurav Nagi, director, Nagi Jeweller, Lajwanti Garden, says, “Bahut saari shaadiyan hai. There are pot of weddings happening and people are buying gold jewellery for that purpose. Jinke ghar do saal saal ke baad bhi shaadiya hain woh bhi abhi purshase kar rahe hain ki aage aur nah bad jaaye. Silver mein interest kam hain. Gold mein bridal jewellery zyada chal rahi hain jaise ki bangles, necklace, earrings.”Salespersons call up customers to get leadsA sales representative from Carat Lane, a jewellery store in Gurugram, says, “Earlier they used to be more walk-ins. Now, we call customers and get leads. Our business and sales have been good. Compared to last year, it is still good. In terms of designs, we are pushing for solitaire since the gold rate is very high!”Surge in demand of solitairesWith the gradual scaling up of the market, and with the festive season, the sentiment has completely changed, says Ageerika Hari, founder and chief designer, Vaitaanika-Inspire the jewel in you, Santushti Complex, Chanakyapuri. “The spend in jewellery has marginally increased, and a lot of people are actually showing interest in minimal designs over big chunky jewellery. What is selling right now is meenakari, diamond, rose gold, functional jewellery and silver jewellery. Post the reopening of the market, we saw huge interest in silver jewellery specially neckpieces and earrings and a combination of silver and diamond for rings. Also, the demand of solitaires has increased. We’ve seen women and men with set ideas of what they want in solitaire and what carat and what cut, and with serious buying and clear ideas it helps us jewellers to provide them with the best possible rings and sets,” she says.

Also Read: Nearly 48,000 new Covid-19 cases, 550 deaths push India’s tally to 86.8 lakh; active cases below 5 lakhASG Jain, along with additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, submitted they agree that the situation was different in September and one could have said that the government’s notification was “premature” then. But now the situation warrants more ICU beds with the increasing number of cases in the city, they argued. “Empower me (Delhi government) today to address the dynamic situation…We will take steps to complete the deficiency,” ASG Jain submitted. On Wednesday, the government informed the high court that around one in four of the 15,000 people tested in the latest serological survey in the capital showed prevalence of antibodies against Sars-Cov-2, indicating that the proportion of people with antibodies has remained largely unchanged from the previous round of the exercise. On a specific query from the court on Thursday, ASG Jain said 2,000 beds are currently functional in the Radha Soami Beas Satsang out of the 10,000 beds there because people are not willing to go there. The court sought to know as to which of the areas are most affected in the national capital and whether economically weaker patients are being diverted to the Radha Soami Beas Satsang facility from government hospitals due to the non-availability of beds. Radha Soami Beas Satsang is a Covid Care Centre for mild and asymptomatic patients operated by the Delhi government and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. “Have you set up helpdesks outside (government) hospitals? You say that you are running an ambulance facility. But how many patients…have been ferried and sent to the Radha Soami Beas Satsang facility (due to non-availability bed in government hospitals),” the court asked. ASG Jain said steps are being taken and the government will soon write to the lieutenant governor to conduct an immediate meeting with the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Monday. To this, the court said, “If you were conscious, you would have taken the steps. You are acting because you were prodded and pushed to do so. You are not aware of the situation which is the reason why you have opened everything under the sun.” The court would hear the matter later during the course of the day for the Delhi government to obtain instructions on the queries posed by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-asks-govt-for-rationale-behind-reserving-80-icu-beds-for-covid-19-patients/story-HbfeKUVRGucCzh7hN6Vv8K.html

The BJP on the other hand managed to win 74 of the 110 assembly constituencies it contested.Speaking about the electoral win, BJP leader and Bihar’s deputy chief minister Sushil Modi said that very few people get the chance to become chief minister for a fourth term and thanked the people for supporting the NDA alliance. “I thank the people of Bihar that they expressed their faith in NDA for the fourth time. It’s not ordinary. In Indian politics there are very few CMs whom people trusted for the fourth time,” he said.In all, NDA partners - BJP, JD(U), Vikassheel Insaan Party, and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) - together won 125 seats of the 243 assembly constituencies whereas the RJD-led Grand Alliance failed to cross the majority mark of 122 seats as it won on 110 seats.

The assault case was filed after a police team arrested Goswami on November 4 for allegedly abetting an interior designer’s suicide in 2018.The couple’s lawyer, Shyam Kalyankar, said they sought adjournment of arguments in the sessions court as they wanted to study the Supreme Court’s order granting Goswami bail in the abetment case on Wednesday. “If his arrest is declared illegal, then we have a better case.”Also Read: In TV studio after release from jail, Arnab Goswami dares Uddhav ThackerayKalyankar said their basic contention is that no case is made out against Goswami as the arrest was illegal. “We are relying on the video recorded to put forth our contentions.”The prosecution also filed a reply before the court, opposing Goswami’s bail plea. It said it shows that Goswami has no fear of the law and may influence witnesses in the case if he is granted protection.A woman officer on November 4 lodged a complaint against Goswami, Ray, their son, an unidentified man, and a woman under Indian Penal Code’s sections including the ones pertaining to assault to deter public servants from discharging their duties, intentional insult to provoke breach of peace and criminal intimidation.Goswami has rejected the charges saying they just protested against his “illegal arrest”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-adjourns-arnab-s-pre-arrest-bail-hearing-in-cop-assault-case/story-NWjopUZAslNJB4JzdHaEEL.html
12-11-2020||Chandigarh||Asked to clarify stand on Kashmir, J&K High Court Bar Association cancels election, forms ad hoc body||The Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association has cancelled its elections and formed an ad hoc body to run its affairs after the government barred it from going ahead with the polls. The Srinagar district administration on Monday ordered that no elections would be allowed till the Bar clarified its stand on whether it considers Kashmir a dispute or an integral part of India and also provided details of its registration. After a meeting on Wednesday, the Bar formed a 21-member ad hoc committee with senior member Nazir Ahmad Ronga as its chairman and put the poll process on hold. The committee comprised the candidates, former elected members and the election body. “It is hereby notified that post constitution of the ad hoc committee, the notification for conduct of elections stands recalled,” the Bar said in a statement signed by its election commission secretary Mudasir Gulzar Vakil. NOT A DISPUTE, EXPLANATION SOUGHT The body, which started its election process in September after the release of its incumbent president Mian Abdul Qayoom, who was detained following the revocation of J&K’s special status, deferred the voting scheduled on Tuesday after Srinagar district magistrate Shahid Choudhary asked it to first clarify its position for advocating the “peaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute”. “You are required to explain your position on the subject since it’s not in consonance with the Constitution of India, whereby J&K is an integral part of the country and not a dispute, and also in conflict with the Advocates’ Act,1961, which governs the subject,” Choudhary said, seeking an explanation from the association on November 9. STAND CONFORMS WITH CONSTITUTION : ASSOCIATION The bar body says that its stand is two decades old and in conformity with the Constitution. Association chief election officer Manzoor Ahmed Dar said the district magistrate has no jurisdiction or authority to prevent elections and the Bar body will file appropriate responses to the communication. “The Bar constitution provides for seeking a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue, which was incorporated more than two decades ago,” he said. “In our view, it is in conformity with the Constitution of India and is also in conformity with the stand taken by the Bar association before the Supreme Court in proceedings related to abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A,” he said. The Bar has tasked a senior advocate and a constitutional expert to file an appropriate response to the district magistrate. “A committee headed by senior advocate Zafar Ahmad Shah will look into the issues raised by the district administration on November 9,” the Bar statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/asked-to-clarify-stand-on-kashmir-j-k-high-court-bar-association-cancels-election-forms-ad-hoc-body/story-KuWdILZVKesMJ50Q3wTBOI.html

We are yet to reach a consensus, when the zoo cane be reopened, as a timeline will depend on the Covid-19 situation in Mumbai after the ongoing festive season gets over. Perhaps, the end of December can be a possibility. At present, all of Mumbai is open. It is up to the state government to take a call, when the zoo is ready to be thrown open to the public again,” said a BMC official. Precautionary measures include markings on the ground outside animal enclosures and before ticket counters in a bid to ensure that the visitors comply with social distancing norms. A public address system (PA) system will be in place for announcements to avoid overcrowding and notices and posters will be put up at various locations within the zoo premises to make the visitors aware about the viral outbreak. The BMC authorities are also constructing an aviary as part of their second phase of the zoo’s expansion plan.

12-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC forms squads to monitor Covid-19 guidelines violations around Diwali||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities have formed squads in each of the civic body’s wards to monitor violations related to the use of firecrackers and ensure that coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related protocols are not violated before and on the day of Diwali, which will be celebrated on Saturday (November 14).The BMC has decided to monitor areas, where air pollution is on the rise during this period, and divert the squads to check the source of poor air quality index (AQI), officials said.Earlier this week, the Maharashtra government advised the public to celebrate a firecracker-free Diwali this year because of the dual impact of pollution woes and the Covid-19 outbreak. The BMC on Monday banned bursting of firecrackers in public and private places in Mumbai except on the day of Diwali. Also Read: Don’t step out, celebrate Diwali from homes: Maharashtra CM Uddhav ThackerayFirecrackers can be burst on the festive occasion in residential areas and housing complexes. Revellers are allowed to burst only two variants of firecrackers such as sparklers and flower pots.The BMC has taken the call on a ban on firecrackers following due deliberations.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (AMC), BMC, said: “We have analysed the crowding pattern of Mumbai, and classified areas with high population density around markets and public places, where there can be a possibility of a large gathering and the predicted timing of that congregation. For example, Dadar market is likely to have more people during early morning, while Marine Drive may have more public in the evening. This information was shared with Mumbai Police. We have formed various teams in a bid to mobilise them in a ward to educate and motivate the public about following three Covid-19-related precautionary measures such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and using hand sanitisers. Any violation will attract a fine of Rs 200.” Kakani said that the civic body authorities had increased their workforce because of the festive season. “We have roped in officers and field staff from the licencing, insecticide and sanitation departments. We have deployed around 100 employees per ward, who are part of the newly formed squads. Besides, Mumbai Police personnel will also support us. In some of the wards, we have requested the police authorities to allow BMC employee to sit in their mobile police vans during patrolling,” he said.BMC authorities have also requested the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), which comes under the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), to share a daily air pollution report before and on the day of Diwali. “This will help us understand the air pollution spike in specific locations. We are in possession of the previous years’ data, which can be used for a compare and contrast,” Kakani added. Mumbai Police and civic body authorities would patrol across the city in a bid to ensure a ban on firecrackers, the BMC’s AMC said.“The use of firecrackers within the stipulated time frame in some residential areas and gated communities cannot be ruled out. However, we will invoke the provisions of the Bombay Police Act, 1951 and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973 and impose a fine against firecracker-related violations.Our aim is to make the public aware,” he said.“We will crackdown on the illegal sale of firecrackers at markets since only green crackers are allowed to be sold. The squads will check the illegal sale of firecrackers and their composition,” said Tanaji Kamble, spokesperson, BMC.HT has reported that an analysis of the chemical composition of green crackers, which are sold in Mumbai, has shown the presence of banned ingredients such as barium nitrate. Awaaz Foundation, a Mumbai-based non-governmental organisation (NGO), has conducted the analysis. In October 2018, the Supreme Court (SC) had banned the manufacture of traditional polluting firecrackers and the use of barium nitrate while directing the Centre to develop green crackers, which have 30% lower emissions of toxic gases, by using a new chemical composition. “Distribution and sale of firecrackers is licenced by the arms and ammunition department of the Mumbai Police and the BMC,” said Sumaira Abdulali, the head of the Awaaz Foundation.“These authorities are empowered to keep a tab on whether firecracker distributors are complying with the strict norms such as safety. Chemical composition of firecrackers, including green crackers, is required to be displayed on boxes,” she said.Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) authorities have washed their hands off on the ban on firecrackers. They maintained that their job was to monitor noise and air pollution, not use of firecrackers. MPCB would be recording noise across 10 locations in Mumbai. “The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) was tasked with the job of coming with a new formula for green crackers while the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) is responsible for giving green certification to these crackers. The SC order has been presumably complied with by both these bodies. However, Mumbai district magistrate is the licencing authority, while the BMC and Mumbai Police are the enforcement authority. Our mandate (MPCB) is related to keeping noise levels in check,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB.The district administration said Mumbai Police and BMC were the enforcement authorities under the Disaster Management Act, 2005; Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897; Explosives Act,1884; and violations of these rules would attract both a jail term and a fine..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-forms-squads-to-monitor-covid-19-guidelines-violations-around-diwali/story-9oAaeyXhEZbXQBZEl830gI.html

After an 11-day long stalemate, the community leader Kirori Singh Bainsla met chief minister Ashok Gehlot on November 11 demanding reservation in jobs and education. They have signed an agreement with the government.“We came to an agreement with the government last night, the community agrees with the settlement. We are vacating tracks, reinstalled all clips (on railway track) that were taken out. Gangman is checking the line, train service will resume soon. Agitation called off,” said Gurjar leader Vijay Bainsla.Gurjar agitators were seen repairing fishplates, that they had damaged, on a railway track in Bharatpur where they were protesting with their demand for reservation. Rajasthan government on October 26, 2018, passed a bill that increased the Other Backward Classes (OBC) quota from 21 percent to 26 percent. In December 2018, the Rajasthan government also approved one percent reservation for Gujjars and four other backward castes (OBCs). These communities are getting one percent separate reservation under the legal limit of 50 percent reservation meant for the most-backward category in addition to OBC reservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/gurjars-in-rajasthan-called-off-agitation-over-reservation-after-agreement-with-cm/story-lehy64MCkMyDdEwp6GvJeJ.html

The stolen cellphone was recovered from his possession. The police identified him by his first name Salman, and said he was a resident of Shaheen Bagh. “Salman was in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and worked as a private driver for six years, between 2011 and 2017. As he lost the job and could not find another, Salman returned to India. He started working as Gramin Sewa driver in Delhi but lost that job as well. Since he had no means to earn his livelihood, he resorted to crime,” said deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena.

12-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality improves, may deteriorate again over Diwali weekend||Showing an improvement from the previous day, Delhi’s air quality dropped to the higher end of the “poor” category on Thursday morning. According to the Central Pollution Control Board data, the air quality index (AQI) reading at 6am stood at 299. On Wednesday, the average 24-hour AQI reading was 344. The air quality had improved from the “severe” category to the “very poor” zone after six days.Air quality enters the “very poor” category between 301-400 mark and crosses over to the “severe” zone after exceeding 400. “Severe” air quality can cause health impacts among healthy people and significant distress among those with existing health conditions.Scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) credited the improvement in air quality to change in wind direction and improved speed.Also Read: ‘Red light on, Gaadi off’ campaign in Delhi extended till Nov 30Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said from Tuesday afternoon, the wind direction over Delhi changed from north-westerly -- from the direction of agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana bringing in smoke from farm fires -- to easterly.“Because of the wind direction change, we did not have stubble-burning smoke adding to the local sources and deteriorating the air quality on Wednesday. The average wind speed was 12kmph, which was enough to disperse the accumulated pollutants,” Srivastava said.He said on Thursday, too, the wind direction will remain easterly and there is a possibility of the AQI improving further into the better end of the “very poor” zone. But this respite will be short-lived as on the Diwali weekend (November 14), wind will slow down and change direction back to north-westerly.Meanwhile, IMD has predicted a misty morning for Thursday with a mainly clear sky during the day. The minimum temperature at around 6.10am was 11.8 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature is predicted to be 29 degrees Celsius.On Wednesday, the minimum temperature had dropped to 11.4 degrees Celsius, which was three degrees below normal and the maximum temperature was recorded at 29.9 degrees Celsius, which was one degree above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-improves-likely-to-deteriorate-again-over-diwali-weekend/story-RK0EfXlLgqe8j7CniipNxH.html
12-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: In search of lost time||He’s looking like an emissary from a different world — partly because of his dress. Sitting on a sidewalk in central Delhi’s Connaught Place, grey-haired Jagdamba Prasad is attired in a cotton dhoti and a khadi jacket. Looking around him, at men dressed in pants and shirts, he mutters, “I have never worn these kind of clothes.” Not that the elderly man is dismissive of western dressing, but “I have always been in dhotis and kurtas,” he explains, adding that his sons though have taken up “pant-bush shirt.”In his late 70s, Mr Prasad is visiting the city from his village near Ayodhya, in UP. His sons live in the suburbs. He himself is not new to Delhi. “I spent 50 years of my life here, as a paan seller.”He left for his village a decade ago, but still feels a strong connection to the city because of his friends. “One sells clothes here, and one runs a paan stall as I used to.”The gentleman talks of how he never wandered around Delhi during the many decades he spent here. But now, in the city for a medical treatment, he is strolling about and “spotting places that were once familiar to me.”Earlier in the day, for instance, he walked past a hotel outside which he used to sell paan “until I was kicked out from that spot during the Emergency (in late 1970s).”Reflecting on his Delhi years, Mr Prasad confesses that his time in the city was superior to his present life in the village. “Money brings happiness, and in Delhi I was earning well.” While in the village, in farming, “either your crop gets ruined by too much rains, or by unexpected hailstorms.”The idea of him returning permanently to the city is not viable though, “because you can’t start all over again at my age.” He shall take the bus back to the village in a happy mood, he says. Showing the label on the collar of his jacket, he says, “it’s new. I got it just days ago, from Khadi Bhandar in Connaught Place.”He now gets up and crosses a zebra crossing, heading to Janpath. He wants to see if the building outside which he used to set up his stall for a time still exists or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-in-search-of-lost-time/story-bV8ycSY4bGeFzjI1p8ULBJ.html
12-11-2020||Delhi||HT Spot Check: Crowds trample Covid-19 norms in Delhi’s markets||Despite new Covid-19 infections in the Capital spiralling, and experts urging people to avoid crowding, markets have swelled during the festive season. HT is conducting spot checks in different parts of the city to check whether social distancing norms and mask hygiene are being followed, and questioning the authorities about why they are being unable to put measures in place, and how they plan to address the problem. Need we remind you, the coronavirus disease has already infected over 450,000 people in the city, and taken more than 7,000 lives.What association saysSanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk traders’ association: “Although there is space on the main road, the by-lanes are extremely crowded. We have asked the district administration to remove encroachments from pavements. The administration is taking measures, but the problem is the high number of shoppers.”Nagrendra Tripathi, additional district magistrate (Central): “We have set up eight incident command posts, with six to eight civil defence volunteers, to urge people to maintain social distancing. We are issuing fines for violations and are issuing about 500 fines daily in the district.”DCP (North) Anto Alphonse: “We are working to ensure that there is no crowding. Our beat officers have placed barricades at different points to restrict random movement of shoppers and vehicles. We have banned the loading and unloading of goods during the day to avoid jams. All encroachments are being removed daily.” Ashok Randhawa, president, Sarojini Nagar mini market traders’ association: There has been a surge in the number of illegal hawkers. A senior district official, requesting anonymity: “All illegal vendors and hawkers have been removed from the market. We set up a test facility in the market two weeks ago.”DCP (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh: “Apart from the local police, paramilitary staff are also present to ensure no crowding in the market.

12-11-2020||Chandigarh||Won’t resume trains in Punjab with conditions, says railways||The impasse between the Centre and Punjab over resumption of train services continues with the railway ministry claiming that the state government has agreed to a ‘conditional resumption’ wherein only good trains will be allowed. The ministry said it will not resume any trains until the state government gives complete assurance of no interference along the tracks.”Even though the tracks have been cleared more or less we have been told some protestors are still loitering around. This is very unsafe and we can’t run trains till complete assurance is given of no interference. There are about 20 such locations where we have been informed of presence of some protestors...It would lead to unacceptable implications,” a senior official said. Trains have been suspended in the state for over a month from September 25 due to the agitation over farm bills, cleared by the Centre during the monsoon session of Parliament. Punjab is also facing critical shortage of coal stock across power plants leading to massive power cuts due to the prolonged suspension of goods trains by the railways. “Railways is ready to immediately resume both passenger and goods trains at the same time . However, assurance of safety of its operations and track clearance is being sought for resumption of services for both passenger and goods trains . It was being indicated that tracks were open for goods train only and not for passenger trains,” a railway ministry spokesperson said. Cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, however, said the railways were just making flimsy excuses to continue with the suspension of rail services to Punjab. “All train tracks in the state are clear, but they are still not resuming the trains because the Modi government wants to punish the farmers and the state government for opposition the farm laws. The farmers are exercising their democratic right by holding peaceful protests. The state government has repeatedly given assurance of security to railways, but they have not budged,” said Randhawa who is a part of the three-member panel of cabinet ministers holding talks with the protesting farmers. A joint team of state government officials and the director general of the Railway Protection Force was formed to review the situation in the state. Amid tussle between the Centre and the Punjab state government over allowing the passage of trains in the state, the Indian Railways has claimed losses of nearly Rs 1,200 crore in freight revenue with more than 2,225 goods trains suspended and 1,350 passenger trains cancelled and diverted till last week. According to railways’ data, nearly 70 trains are affected per day, in total 1,373 passenger trains have had to be cancelled and diverted leading to losses of Rs 45 crore due to cancellation of the passenger trains. Punjab farmers, meanwhile, have been invited to Delhi on November 13 to meet senior ministers in a bid to end the ongoing impasse between them and the railways, and restore train services in the state. The meeting is expected to take place between a delegation of the protesting farmers and defence minister Rajnath Singh, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways minister Piyush Goyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/won-t-resume-trains-in-punjab-with-conditions-says-railways/story-6fs3eDzleE15Rq5GZhMqxL.html
12-11-2020||Delhi||Deficient rain may have added to pollution spike||Acute dryness of the ground due to almost nil rainfall in the northern India plains could have contributed to the spike in air pollution in the region, experts said, even as weather men predict dry weather will continue for the next fortnight.Data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows that Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Western Uttar Pradesh, the areas worst hit by air pollution, have not received any rainfall since October 1, 2020, when the monsoon officially withdrew from northern India.Even Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, which usually receive good rainfall in the post-winter months, have rainfall deficiency of 78% to 99%. The higher reaches of these states received some snowfall in the last week of October and November.But the northern plains have not seen substantial rainfall since the last week of August. In September, the rain deficiency in the region hovered between 80% and 92%, resulting in below normal monsoon rains , forcing farmers to harvest their crops early. Experts attribute two reasons for the huge rainfall deficiency.First, said D S Pai, senior scientist at IMD, Pune, is the impact of La Nina, (little girl), a weather phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean. “La Nina brings good rain during monsoon but has opposite impact in the post monsoon period as it can prevent formation of cyclonic conditions in Bay of Bengal, which can reduce rains. And, we seeing La Nina impact in post monsoon period,” he said. La Nina has cooling impact on the sea surface in the Pacific unlike El Nino, which has a warming impact.Second, said IMD director general M Mohapatra, there were fewer western disturbances, caused by storm originating in the Mediterranean region that brings rain and in winter months snow to the north-western parts of India, this year.“We have not witnessed any major western disturbance so far ,” Mohapatra said.While the dry weather conditions have led to drought-like conditions in northern Indian plains, it has also contributed to a spike in air pollution because of the earth being drier. Particulate matter air pollution is driven by dust and dry weather conditions mean more dust that can be carried by the winds. “Moisture in the air and ground absorbs pollutants,” said a scientist with the Indian Institute of Technology, who was not willing to be named as he is part of a Central government environment committee. “In dry conditions, the surface dust from agriculture fields, alongside roads and semi-arid areas in Rajasthan is getting carried with the westerly winds and is contributing to smog like conditions in northern Indian cities.”Air pollution in the National Capital Region and nearby areas had been in the severe zone for the past six days with slight improvement on Wednesday with higher wind speed. Northern Indian cities and towns have experienced high levels of air pollution since the last week of October. The dry weather has also meant more forest fires in Himachal and Uttarakhand . Close to 250 forest fires have been reported from the two states, official said. Forest fires are generally reported from February to June, with a peak in May and June, the two warmest months in the Indian sub-continent. Maan Singh, nodal officer for forest fires in the Uttarkhand state forest department, said, “With the hilly regions not receiving any rainfall since mid September, forests have become dry and are prone to fire. Almost 100 incidents of forest fires have been reported since October 1.” A Himachal forest official said the state has reported about 150 such incidents.The long dry spell has also delayed sowing of winter crops in the region.Rakesh Takait, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union, a farmer group, said weather conditions are not conducive for sowing of crops in non-irrigated agriculture fields in of Punjab, Haryana and western UP. “Most farmers are waiting for a good shower to sow the winter wheat crop,” he said.Vijay Sastri, Uttarakhand spokesperson for Bharat Kisan Union, said, “The sowing season for winter crops starts from November in the hilly regions, but this year, due to lack of rainfall the farmers are still waiting. Farmers are also worried as no rains would mean poor harvest of horticulture crops.”  IMD has predicted sparse rainfall and snow in higher reaches of western Himalayas on November 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/deficient-rain-may-have-added-to-pollution-spike/story-D1efBmUPoBZuffMX1JzoLN.html

12-11-2020||Health:||New sero survey shows 1 in 4 exposed to Covid-19 in Delhi||Around one in four of the 15,000 people tested in the latest serological survey in the capital showed prevalence of antibodies against Sars-Cov-2, the government informed the Delhi high court on Wednesday, indicating that the proportion of people with antibodies has remained largely unchanged from the previous round of the exercise.The report also showed that a large proportion (43.5%) of people who had previously been diagnosed with Covid-19 remained sero-negative, a statistic that independent experts said underlined how such surveys were underestimating how many people had been exposed. WATCH | Covid update: Sputnik-V 92% effective; Pfizer challenge; Delhi HC on surgeAuthors of the report, however, said it was because antibodies take time to develop after contracting an infection and that they remain detectable only for a limited period. Researchers caution that absence of antibodies in infected people cannot be conclusive evidence that they are unprotected from the disease. Covid-19: What you need to know todayEqually, it isn’t clear how long and how strong a protection against Covid-19 such antibodies can offer. The prevalence of the antibodies among those sampled in the fourth round of the sero survey has gone up by minuscule 0.4 percentage points in a month-and-a half – from 25.1% in the first week of September to 25.5% in the third week of October. The authors of the study attributed the lack of an increase of sero-prevalence to “fewer infections reported in August” and “disappearing” antibodies.The findings of the October round of sero-prevalence survey report were submitted during the hearing in the Delhi high court on a plea seeking more aggressive testing in Delhi. During the hearing, the court censured the government for relaxing norms for public movement at a time when infections have “spiralled alarmingly”. The court asked the government to put in place a policy on controlling the “mind-boggling” rate of new cases. “No household has been left untouched,” a bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage“The rates in the city are mind-boggling. The number of deaths is in double figures every day. What’s with the Delhi government allowing all the un-lockdown when the cases are skyrocketing? Why have you opened everything? What are the strategies that you are following?” the court said.“Today, Delhi is beating the whole state of Maharashtra and Kerala hands down in Covid-19 infections. When the numbers are decreasing in all the states, then why numbers are rising only in your state? Either there is no control or there is lack of control,” the bench said.The seven-day average of daily new cases in Delhi has touched 7,148, and the Union territory has seen an average of 75 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week. Delhi currently accounts for the most daily cases in the country. And there are no Covid-19 beds available in private hospitals. In June-end , 22.6% of the 21,000 people sampled had antibodies. This proportion shot to 29.1% among the 15,000 people sampled in August, and then dropped to 25.1% among the 17,000 people sampled in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/new-sero-survey-shows-1-in-4-exposed-to-covid-19-in-delhi/story-FQL0ysy1o2k07khqs1u7QJ.html

12-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana’s efforts at saving girl child firmly on track||Haryana’s flagship “save the girl child” programme appears to be firmly on track despite a temporary setback when the sex ratio at birth (SRB) dipped to 914 in July, raising worry that touts offering gender detection services had become active again. As per the latest data of the ‘Beti Bachao, Beto Padhao’ programme, which chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar himself monitors, the cumulative sex ratio at birth (SRB) rose from 914 in July to 919 in October. This raised hopes about the state hitting last year’s annual SRB figure of 923, which is so far the highest.Last year, the state’s cumulative SRB till October was 920 when 2, 01, 030 female and 2, 18, 393 male children were born. This year, till October, the state saw births of 2, 07, 927 female against 2, 26, 359 male children. Haryana’s annual SRB in 2011 was 833 while it rose to 876 in 2015, and further improved to 900 in 2016. The annual SRB remained static at 914 in 2017 and 2018, and jumped to 923 in 2019. As per the 2011 census, the child sex ratio (CSR) of Haryana (children below six years) was 834 females for every 1,000 males, while the national CSR was 918.According to Dr Rakesh Gupta, IAS, and nodal officer for ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ campaign, there was a lull during the lockdown period, but later reports started pouring in that touts involved in sex determination activities were once again on the prowl. “We kept our fingers crossed during the lockdown, but from July onwards, we increased our surveillance and went after the touts,” he said. Sirsa has best SRBSo far, Sirsa is best performing district with an SRB of 947 (till October), while Jhajjar with an SRB of 880 is the first from the bottom. Among the districts with the lowest SRB (up to October) are Charkhi Dadri (885), Karnal (898), Mahendergarh (901), Jind (905), Rohtak (906), Palwal (909), Rewari (912), Gurugram (913), Faridabad and Yamunanagar (914 each). As per the data, Ambala district’s SRB up to October 2019 was 951 and this year during the same period it dipped to 919. On the other hand, Bhiwani district improved from 894 SRB last year till October to 923 during the corresponding period this year. Experts involved in this programme say that SRB fluctuates every month and the real picture emerges in December when the data of 12 months is calculated. Dr Gupta claims that “more than 28,000 girls have been saved in the wombs” ever since the campaign was launched in 2014. “We are confident that the SRB this year will be the same as last year. The analysis of the data every year points towards a rise in the SRB from October to March,” says Dr Gupta, pointing out how the health department teams while battling Covid-19 kept chasing the touts. Touts booked In five months between June and October this year, as many as 47 first information reports (FIRs) were registered under the PNDT (Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques) and MTP (Medical Termination of Pregnancy) Acts, as per the official data. In the first 10 months this year, 65 FIRs were registered against 61 FIRs during the corresponding months last year. In October, as many as 11 FIRs were lodged while in September, the number of FIRs was 17. In August, there were 10 FIRs, six in July and three in June in which over 2, 000 accused had been arrested. And a sizable number of the FIRs, Dr Gupta said, were lodged after the inter-state raids. A total 802 FIRs stand registered (450 under PNDT, 352 under MTP) till October since May 2015. Among the total FIRs include over 200 inter-state raids that includes the maximum of over 90 raids conducted in Uttar Pradesh, near 50 in Delhi, and over 40 in Punjab. Within Haryana, the highest 61 FIRs have been lodged in Sonepat and the lowest four in Charkhi Dadi in the past five years. “We register the FIRs only after the tout receives money from the decoy (a woman) after the sex determination test. We have nabbed the accused, who include repeat offenders, carrying the portable ultrasound machines of the size of a laptop,” said a key official of the programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-s-efforts-at-saving-girl-child-firmly-on-track/story-kqpoUqjCjpTv7SMJsKgwdO.html

12-11-2020||Chandigarh||21 Haryana districts ban firecrackers||With three days to go for Diwali, district administrations issued fresh directions banning sale and bursting of crackers in all districts where air quality was categorised ‘poor’ or worse in November last year. As many as 21 districts of the state fit the bill. Ban has been imposed in 14 districts of the national capital region (NCR), including Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Faridabad, Gurugram, Jhajjar, Jind, Karnal, Mahendergarh, Nuh, Palwal, Paniat, Rewari, Rohtak and Sonepat. The ban will remain effect from November 9 midnight to November 30.The district administrations of seven other districts, including Ambala, Fatehabad, Hisar, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Sirsa and Yamunanagar, have also imposed a ban on sale and bursting of fire crackers as the air quality of these districts was measured ‘poor’ to ‘severe’ on the air quality index (AQI) last year. Only Panchkula passed muster as its air quality was classified ‘moderate’ last November. The order has led to rampant confusion as the AQI of only district headquarters is measured and the state pollution control board does not have reports on the AQI of small towns and villages. On being asked how towns without Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) were taking a call on the ban, Haryana State Pollution Control Board member secretary S Narayanan said, “We have CAAQMS in all district headquarters. As we don’t have CAAQMS in all towns, the air quality of district headquarters will represent the entire district”.All Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) regional officers have been directed to initiate special drives to contain air pollution to prevent the Covid situation from aggravating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/21-haryana-districts-ban-firecrackers/story-vvqqkudzZEVHYg8XCP3dBM.html
12-11-2020||Mumbai||SC grants bail to Arnab amidconcerns over prompt hearing||The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the release of Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in a judgement that sought to protect the liberty of individuals, although both the promptness with which it heard the case, and the judgement itself came in for criticism. The court ordered the release of Goswami and two others in an abetment to suicide case dating back to May 2018, allowing the accused to be released from jail on execution of personal bond of Rs 50,000. The order came on separate appeals filed by the three accused against a Bombay high court order of November 9 refusing them interim bail.Watch: Arnab Goswami leaves from jail after getting bail from Supreme CourtGoswami was lodged at Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai after his arrest on November 4. The trio are accused in an abetment to suicide case filed in May 2018 by the wife of architect Anvay Naik who died by suicide that year and left a suicide note naming Goswami, Niteesh Sarda, and Farooq Sheikh, whose companies owed him money for services rendered. The apex bench said in its short order (following a long hearing): “We are of the view that the high court was in error of rejecting the application for grant of interim bail.” “We accordingly order and direct that Arnab Manoranjan Goswami, Feroz Mohammad Shaikh and Neetish Sarda shall be released on interim bail, subject to each of them executing a personal bond in the amount of Rs 50,000 to be executed before the Jail Superintendent. They are, however, directed to cooperate in the investigation and shall not make any attempt to interfere with the ongoing investigation or with the witnesses,” the court said.Senior advocate Harish Salve appearing for Goswami sought to paint a picture that his client was being targeted by the state . The bench of justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee were of the view that a person, whosoever it be, cannot be targeted by state and that constitutional courts are duty-bound to protect the liberty of citizens.“We are dealing with a person’s liberty. Across the country, if this court is not to interfere today, we are treading on a path of destruction of liberty....you may dislike a person’s ideology and challenge it but if this is what our States will do to nail persons, we have to put across this message to all high courts to preserve the liberty of citizens,” the bench said. The top court noted with anguish that in case after case coming before them, high courts are not exercising their jurisdiction.However, activists and lawyers said the same benchmark isn’t being applied to other cases. Advocate Sunil Fernandes said, “Very recently on October 29, the Supreme Court refused to grant interim bail on medical grounds to 81-year old Telugu poet and writer Varavara Rao, who is an accused in the Elgar Parishad case. Repeated bail pleas filed by him over the past 22 months have not resulted in any positive order from either the Bombay high court or the Supreme Court. Similar is the situation with regard to social activist Sudha Bhardwaj, another co-accused in the same case who is in jail since August 28, 2018.”Congress leader Milind Deora tweeted, “Henceforth, I hope the principle that bail is the rule & jail an exception applies to media trials & all urgent pleas — regardless of the accused’s background or profile,” Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti said while she agrees with the Supreme Court’s views on right to liberty, it has been selective when it comes to Kashmiris. “Agree with SCs outrage on right to liberty. But sadly this outrage has been selective as there are hundreds of Kashmiris & journalists languishing in jails on baseless charges. Forget court ruling they didn’t even get a hearing. Why no sense of urgency for their liberty?” Mufti wrote on Twitter.The prompt listing of the case, filed on Tuesday, also came in for criticism with Dushyant Dave, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president, writing to secretary general of the top court lodging a “strong protest” on “selective listing” of Goswami’s interim bail plea.“While thousands of citizens remain in jails, languishing for long periods while their matters filed before the Supreme Court are not getting listed for weeks and months, it is, to say the least, deeply disturbing as to how and why every time Goswami approaches the Supreme Court, his matter gets listed instantly,” Dave wrote on Tuesday.During Wednesday’s hearing, the bench also commented on the first information report (FIR) involved in the case, which, some experts said, weakens it (the FIR) . The court said, “in a matter of this nature where some amount is already paid and the person commits suicide due to financial stress will you hold the head of the company for abetment to suicide. In most companies work orders are given out as a labour contract... Will it not be travesty of justice to deny bail to such a person when his quashing petition is pending?”The court observed that the Bombay high court gave no findings on whether prima facie offence was made out . Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the Maharashtra government, pointed out that the investigation of the case is not before this bench, and that the Bombay high court order of November 9 allowed the accused to approach trial judge for bail which is to be heard on November 12. Sibal said: “In 99 out of 100 cases concerning personal liberty, I am on the other side.” Justice Chandrachud said: “All the more reason that what we do today will define what we will do in those 99 cases.”However, Sibal also added: “A Kerala journalist was arrested by Uttar Pradesh Police when he was going to Hathras to report. We came to this court under Article 32. The court said go to lower court. Petition posted after four weeks. Such things are also happening.” His reference was to Siddique Kappan, who was arrested on his way to Hathras to meet the family of the 19-year-old Dalit woman who died after being allegedly gang-raped in the district..The UP Police had arrested Kappan along with three others,claiming that they had links with Popular Front of India and its affiliate in Mathura.Appearing for Maharashtra Police and the investigating officer, senior advocate Amit Desai argued that the high court could not be blamed for not granting bail as it was hearing a habeas corpus petition. The HC noted that remedy of bail will be taken up by sessions judge on November 12 while posting the prayer for quashing FIR for consideration on December 10.The other accused represented by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Gopal Shankarnarayanan argued that the three persons named in the suicide note are unconnected and if this is the standard adopted, heads of all companies, even ministers will be in jail if employees and government servants die by suicide due to unpaid dues.Goswami on Wednesday evening walked out the Taloja jail in adjoining Raigad district, hours after the Supreme Court granted him interim bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sc-grants-bail-to-arnab-amidconcerns-over-prompt-hearing/story-xaT3QCNMqSLYV7GKnEKBWL.html

Dissatisfied over arrangements and alleging favouritism, the Panthers Party staged a walk out. In the run-up to district development council polls and panchayat and ULB bypolls, Sharma had held an all-party meet that was attended by the National Conference (NC), Congress, People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Panthers Party, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and BJP. Panthers Party chairperson and former minister Harsh Dev Singh said, “I walked out of the meet because they have not made any arrangements for the polls. Their returning officers don’t know, which documents are required and nomination forms have not been posted on the official website despite Thursday being the last date. At many places returning officers are demanding character certificates, which are not required in these elections.” Flagging security concerns, Singh said, “I have received threats from the Hizbul Mujahideen and BJP but they have withdrawn my security. This is true for other party leaders as well. In the meantime, mere BJP workers have been assigned 10 security personnel each.” PDP’s former MLC and general secretary Surinder Choudhary also raised serious objections over the entire was being conducted. “It appears the elections are being held for a single party. The authorities are not coordinating with other leaders.Security arrangements are almost negligible in Kashmir where numerous threats have been issued . Election material has also not been supplied to other parties nor were we consulted while announcing election dates,” he told the state election commissioner. Former Congress MLC and spokesperson Ravinder Sharma said, “Security is a major concern for all of us. It has been given to BJP only. Therefore, the election commission should intervene in the matter.” Jammu and Kashmir chief electoral officer HK Singh said apprehensions related to security of contesting candidates and political parties will be taken up with the government. “The lieutenant governor has been personally according top priority to these elections and security of candidates and political parties is being taken seriously.We shall also relay their apprehensions to the DGP and home secretary,” said Singh. “Wherever nomination forms could not be downloaded, candidates can approach their respective returning officers,” he said and denied allegations of favouritism as well. “Election authorities are an independent entity and question of favouring anyone does not arise at all. The election commission cannot be influenced,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/all-party-meet-for-ddc-polls-parties-accuse-ec-of-kowtowing-to-bjp/story-MAqIuJjprJeUeoyGtIPXKN.html

He also said that India should raise the issue of Tibet at the United Nations. “India should act on these two suggestions as soon as possible as the international scenario is favourable. The Dalai Lama is the most respected and revered spiritual leader in the world who calls India his Guru. India will also be honoured by honouring him,” Shanta wrote, noting that the 85-year-old spiritual had already received the Nobel Peace Prize and had been honoured by many countries.The senior leader said, “The massacre of Tibet, which prorogated Mahatma Buddha’s message of peace to the world, was the biggest tragedy of the 21st century. The Congress government committed a sin in allowing China to take over Tibet. Had India raised the question of Tibet in the United Nations, Tibet would have gotten strong support from the international community, especially the United States, and India would never have shared teh border with China.” “China poses a threat to the whole world and India faces the biggest threat as there have already been infiltration bids in Ladakh. Today, China is alone due to the Covid outbreak. We have got an opportunity to rectify the mistake committed in 1950. This is a greatest opportunity to isolate China internationally,” Shanta wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/shanta-bats-for-bharat-ratna-for-dalai-lama/story-ihtWbZjEn4LFswnWKybROI.html

The UT recorded nine deaths and 507 fresh coronavirus infections, taking the Covid count to 100,351 and death toll to 1,558. Officials said 326 people had tested positive in Kashmir and 181 in Jammu. Four persons succumbed to the disease in Jammu and five in Kashmir.Despite the tally breaching the 1 lakh-mark, government officials maintain the figures are not ‘particulary worrying’. Jammu and Kashmir commissioner secretary health Atul Duloo said, “Our mortality rate is 1.55% and positivity rate is 3.9%, while the country’s positivity rate is 7.2%,” he said. The total number of tests conducted in the UT has crossed 25.51 lakh. Duloo said, “Testing in the UT is double the national average.

It is, however, difficult to predict whether there is another wave in the offing. The government seems have come a long way in augmenting the infrastructure and required logistics and is geared up for any such eventuality. It now entirely depends on precautions taken by the people till a vaccine is available.”However, many doctors say the situation in the UT could be far worse as many patients were recuperating at home. “I know many people who receive treatment at home as they do not want to go to hospitals and Covid centres. However, the situation is better than what it was four to five months ago. Today, we know many things about the disease,” said a senior consultant, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-s-covid-counts-crosses-1-lakh-mark/story-2RaxSt9dpug2ZtbCYkjIHM.html
12-11-2020||Chandigarh||J&K to receive season’s first heavy snowfall over next 2 days: Weatherman||The meteorological department has predicted heavy snowfall over the next couple of days, which has put the J&K administration on high alert.As per the weatherman, the UT is likely to receive the season’s first snowfall on Friday. The meteorological department also issued a weather advisory to J&K’s top officials.“An active western disturbance (WD) is likely to effect the UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh from November 13 to 15. The system is likely to cause heavy rain and snow mainly in the upper reaches of Kashmir which may lead temporary disruption in air and surface transportation on the Jammu-Srinagar and Srinagar-Leh national highways,” said an advisory issued by MeT department.MeT officials said there could be dip in day temperature and increase in the night temperature.Following the advisory, the officials have decided to close traffic on all the routes, which could receive heavy snowfall. The government has already setup control rooms in Srinagar and other districts to monitor the situation. Last year the snowfall had caused disruption in the day-to-day lives and break down of the government services, especially electricity. Last year the Kashmir had witnessed the first heavy snowfall in the month of November, which had caused heavy damage to the apple growers. This time, the horticulture department has also issued an advisory to fruit growers and farmers.This year, the summer in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) was unusually dry. The western disturbance brought negligible precipitation and rainfall between July and October (monsoon) was 35% below normal. The Valley mostly owes its precipitation to the western disturbance — winds blowing from the Mediterranean Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-to-receive-season-s-first-heavy-snowfall-over-next-2-days-weatherman/story-QExJxjDZVvCDTEooLLmbqI.html
12-11-2020||Chandigarh||Class-10 exams commence in J&K amid Covid safety measures||The annual board examination for Class-10, conducted by the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education, commenced on Wednesday, with Covid safety measures in place, officials said. As many as 74, 858 students appeared in the exam from Kashmir valley while another 32,000 sat for the exam in the winter zones of Jammu. The authorities took care to seat students in keeping with the social distancing norms, in view of the pandemic, and also ensured the availability of hand sanitisers and temperature measuring devices at the centres. “The first paper was of mathematics and it went off smoothly. We had told all heads of institutions and superintendents of exam centers to strictly follow the Covid guidelines,” said Aijaz Ahmad, the board joint secretary (examinations), Kashmir. This year, the administration had substantially increased the number of centres to ensure distancing. “Out of the total 75,063 students who had registered for the exam, 74,858 appeared today. They were adjusted in 814 exam centres,” said Ahmad. In the winter zones of Jammu, around 32,000 students sat for the paper. “The students were made to sit in 331 centres. This year the number of centres was more owing to Covid,” said joint secretary (exam) of Jammu zone, Altaf Hussain. “Another 5,740 students of summer zones in Jammu appeared in Class 12 exams,” he said. The board examinations for Class 12 are also starting from Thursday in Kashmir. “Some 58, 514 students are expected to appear for the first paper at 625 centers,” said Ahmad. This year, the education authorities have given a 40% relaxation in the syllabus. “The students have to attempt questions worth 60% of the marks for which 100% weightage will be given. The relaxation has been provided as normal schooling suffered this year due to the pandemic and we could only rely on online classes,” said Ahmad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/class-10-exams-commence-in-j-k-amid-covid-safety-measures/story-02x1les7xHEolBYmJZd0UL.html
12-11-2020||Chandigarh||Gridlocks dampening festive spirit in Ludhiana||Heavy traffic jams have dampened the festive spirit in the city. Gridlocks can be seen at main and inner market roads at all times of the day now, leaving residents a harried lot.At places like Jagraon Bridge, Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road, Pakhowal Road, Link Road near bus stand, Gill Road and Southern Bypass, serpentine queues have become a common sight.The ongoing work of the national highway on Ferozpur Road has only added to the chaos. Also, due to a number of vendors setting up stalls on the roads in front of shops, the congestion has only increased. At many places, the Ludhiana traffic police have abjectly failed to take stock of the situation. They are seen struggling to manage the burgeoning traffic with no concrete plan in place. Madhur Mahindra, public relation officer of Canaught Place Market Association, Ghumar Mandi, said: “As festival season is on, the number of vehicles and visitors have increased. Police are towing away wrongly parked vehicles, but no efforts are being made to streamline the flow of traffic.”Surinder Kumar, a shopkeeper in Chaura Bazaar, said that despite surging Covid cases, people are not following safety protocols like maintaining social distancing.Jaspreet Singh, a resident of Sham Nagar, said city roads have become congested due to construction of the flyover. “The government should speed up ongoing construction work of flyovers in the city. It takes one hour to travel from Cheema Chowk to Samrala Chowk by car now due to traffic jams,” he said.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, traffic), Gurdev Singh, said 28 teams have been formed at police-station level who take rounds of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gridlocks-dampening-festive-spirit-in-ludhiana/story-hwWEFBirbt1ZxbDlgwnKgM.html
12-11-2020||Chandigarh||Ban goes bust as Punjab BJP workers burst crackers in Chandigarh||Celebrating the party’s win in the Bihar elections, Bharatiya Janata Party workers on Wednesday burst crackers outside the Punjab BJP office in Sector 37, in violation of the ban imposed by the Chandigarh administration.While the party’s senior leader justified it by stating the Punjab BJP workers were just following Punjab’s rules, the Chandigarh administration and police even failed to take note. “There is no ban on crackers in Punjab. Punjab ke worker ne Punjab ke anushasan ka palan kiya hai,” said Dinesh Kumar Sharma, BJP organisation general secretary for Punjab and Chandigarh. When questioned that the violation took place in Chandigarh, Sharma reasoned that when the celebrations took place at the Chandigarh BJP office on Tuesday, the local party workers had followed the rules and did not burst crackers.The authorities, meanwhile, were caught napping, even as a trader was booked for selling firecrackers in Manimajra.“I am not aware of it, and will get it checked,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. “I have checked with the station house officer concerned, but we have not received any complaint,” said Shruti Arora, assistant superintendent of police (ASP, South).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ban-goes-bust-as-punjab-bjp-workers-burst-crackers-in-chandigarh/story-PJVO7U1JWi3RP0A59gcB7M.html
12-11-2020||Chandigarh||Cracker ban: HC denies relief to dealers in Chandigarh||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday denied any respite to Chandigarh Cracker Dealers Association, which had challenged the UT administration’s decision to ban the sale and bursting of crackers in the city.Refusing to intervene in the matter, the high court bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli told the dealers to approach the administration instead with a representation of their grievance. The administration last week, after conducting draw of lots for allotment of 96 licences for the sale of firecrackers in the city, had decided to impose a blanket ban instead. The decision was taken to keep a check on the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic due to possible health complications arising from pollution caused by crackers.Cracker dealers had told court that pollution level (air quality index) in Chandigarh is less than 150, while in the adjacent Panchkula it is almost double, at 250. Despite this, the Haryana government has not imposed a blanket ban on firecrackers, and there is no such move in Mohali too. The dealers had sought quashing of the UT administration’s decision, or as an alternative, directions to pay compensation in lieu of losses suffered by them. The court was also apprised of the draw of lots conducted last week, and “when purchases were made by the traders, the UT in an arbitrary manner banned sale and bursting of crackers”. “The high court has asked the association to approach the Chandigarh administration with a representation. The decision on the representation is to be taken in a timebound manner,” said advocate BS Jaswal, who appeared for the dealers. The detailed order is yet to be released.Manimajra trader booked for selling firecrackersAfter invoking the Disaster Management Act, Chandigarh Police have registered the first case under it against a shopkeeper found selling firecrackers in ManimajraWhile carrying out checking in markets and various localities of the city, police found Shankar Singh of Gobindpura in Manimajra selling firecrackers at his shop on Tuesday, in violation of the ban imposed by the Chandigarh administration. He was arrested, but later released on bail. A case has been registered under Sections 188 (non-compliance of public order) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51B of the Disaster Management Act 2005 at the Manimajra police station. Though the offence is bailable, action under the Disaster Management Act is much stricter than under Section 188 of the IPC, which carries a maximum jail term of only three months. Section 51 of the Act provides for a jail term of two years in case anyone gets hurt and one year for mere violation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cracker-ban-hc-denies-relief-to-dealers-in-chandigarh/story-LXzpjagIfIGljcXvQquoyJ.html
12-11-2020||Chandigarh||Throwing caution to the wind, residents throng markets in Ludhiana||Despite surging Covid cases, residents are thronging markets in the city ahead of Diwali. At many places, safety protocols including social distancing and wearing masks are being ignored.Brimming with activity, overcrowded shops and showrooms are a common sight at all major markets in Ludhiana. At markets in old city including Chaura Bazaar, Kesar Ganj Road and Shahpur Road, heavy rush is witnessed from morning till late in the evening. Shoppers can be seen buying a variety of Diwali-related items including electronic lights, dry fruits, decorative items and sweets. Due to haphazard parking and encroachments, gridlocks are a common occurrence in the area and on connecting roads. Due to high footfall, parking in the old city markets remains a huge struggle.During a visit at 12.30 pm, traffic jams were witnessed on the roads near electronic market, and many four-wheelers were stuck for half an hour. Due to congested roads and two-wheelers parked on road sides, there is barely any space left to walk. Social distancing has also gone for a toss and shoppers were seen without masks.At one time, at least four to five customers are seen buying items from shops selling electronic items, wedding apparels, cosmetics, garments and crockery. Sushil Kumar, a shopkeeper dealing in electronic items, said, “I have been in the business for the last 20 years. Now, customers prefer to buy made in India lights and many are not ready to purchase Chinese products. Sales have picked up since last Sunday and we except to be able to clear the stock by Diwali.” The situation was no different at the Kesar Ganj Road market, which is a hub of wholesale dealers of dry fruits.At 1pm, customers were seen visiting the shops in large numbers and purchasing almonds, cashews, walnut and raisins, mostly as gifts for family and friends. There are over 35 to 40 shops in the market which deal in dry fruits and are visited by customers from all over the district. Manu Malik, a wholesale dealer of dry fruits, said, “People are buying dry fruits, but amid the pandemic, they have limited their purchases. Till last year, majority of the customers bought items in bulk, but this time, they are buying smaller amounts.” A similar situation was witnessed at other markets in the city including Ghumar Mandi, which is known for wedding apparels, cosmetics, artificial jewellery, kitchen utensils, electronics and footwear. After 3 pm, massive rush can be seen at the market. From clothes to electronics and decorative items to utensils, everything was in huge demand. Shoppers were seen struggling to park their vehicles. Amrita Mahajan, a customer, said, “Parking is always difficulty in absence of proper space. I had to buy decoration material and gifts for my relatives. First, it took me 15 minutes to find space to park my vehicle, and more than an hour to purchase the items as the shop was crowded. Nobody was following proper Covid safety protocols.” While majority of the shopkeepers said sales had picked up before Karva Chauth, even three days before Diwali, customers are purchasing only the essential items required to celebrate the festival. Pawan Batra, president of Ghumar Mandi Market Association, said, “Customers are visiting markets but with limited resources. People have cut down on buying luxury items and prefer purchasing essential items only. The pandemic has affected business heavily and every shopkeeper is expecting that sales will pick up by Diwali. Parking is also an issue here and there is a need to come up with parking lots at the entry and exit points of the market for convenience of shoppers.”Kipps Market in Sarabha Nagar, which is popular for its restaurants, food joints and bakery shops, receives high footfall in the evening. Customers are seen parking vehicles near residential areas when the parking lot in the market is full. Customers were seen purchasing cakes, chocolates and other gift items. At other markets in Model Town area, Pakhowal Road and Jawahar Nagar, the shopkeepers have decked up their shops and heavy footfall was seen after 2 pm. Shortage of parking space makes shopping a task, but people still prefer purchasing decorative items, gifts, electronics and cakes from these markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/throwing-caution-to-the-wind-residents-throng-markets-in-ludhiana/story-ZWv6ZoLJSfTl5C5SJDQDlM.html
12-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 Why have you not written for trials of homoeopathic medicines, asks Delhi HC||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought to know from the Delhi government why it had not written to the Central Council for Research in homeopathy (CCRH) for carrying out clinical trials of homoeopathic medicines for prevention and cure of Covid-19 despite requests from two doctors.A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad was hearing a plea by two homeopathic doctors, one based in Kerala and the other in West Bengal, seeking directions to the ministry and CCRH to allow doctors to treat Covid-19 by dispensing homeopathic medicines as supplement to allopathic ones if so desired by the patients.“Why are you resisting it? Obtain instructions on why you (Delhi government) have not written to CCRH,” a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad impleading Delhi government as a party in the case.The court issued notice to the Delhi government, which was accepted by advocate Jawahar Raja, appearing for the Delhi government.Appearing for the Ayush Ministry and Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), the counsels told the court that the Delhi government should be made a party in the case as the state government has to first clear the way for the clinical trial.In their plea filed through advocate Suvidutt MS, the doctors have also sought directions to the ministry and CCRH to carry out clinical trials on three sets of homeopathic medicines for treating Covid-19 infection.Appearing for the petitioner, advocate J Sai Deepak, told the court that his clients had written to the states of Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, West Bengal and Kerala, which account for the maximum number of Covid-19 cases, for carrying out the clinical trial, but they haven’t received any response.They said that they were informed in June by CCRH that the state governments have to approach it for clinical trials and it cannot go to the states. Subsequently, they wrote to the Delhi government in June itself to approach CCRH for clinical trials, however, no steps have been taken by it till date, the plea said.The matter would be now heard on November 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-why-have-you-not-written-for-trials-of-homoeopathic-medicines-asks-delhi-hc/story-j3FDMhWDjfRgjEZp5IQjAJ.html

12-11-2020||Delhi||After LSR suicide, DU’s struggling students open up about financial stress of digital divide||The death by suicide of a second-year undergraduate student of Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College last week after her struggle to continue classes online has brought out into the open the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on several students in top colleges struggling bridge the digital divide.Students and teachers across Delhi University’s campuses on Wednesday pointed to hardships arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, forcing bright students from the economically weaker sections to seek financial assistance to either pay their fees or get access to online education.A final-year BSc (Mathematics) student at a DU college, and a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Badaun district, said she has barely been able to attend class this academic session.“My father, who works as a sweeper in a factory, managed to get me a phone when I got admission into DU two years ago. The phone has become the only mode of education for me and three of my siblings. I can’t attend classes regularly because my siblings also use the same phone. This is my final year and I am extremely stressed about studies,” she told HT, asking not to be named. According to a survey conducted by the Left-affiliated All India Students Association (AISA) in May, around 42% students across DU were not able to access online classes amid the pandemic due to a lack of devices, poor internet connectivity, and inadequate finances, among other reasons. The undergraduate student from LSR, who died by suicide on November 3 in Telangana, was among the students who had responded to a student-led survey in the college in September, saying she did not even have a laptop to attend her classes.  Apart from the stress of catching up on her online classes, her parents said the student was stressed when the college announced that second-year residents would have to vacate the hostel because of a college policy introduced in 2019. Unnimaya R, general secretary of the LSR students’ union, said the college’s revised hostel policy, as per which only first year students can use the hostel accommodation from this year,  would affect around 120 students — of whom 50% belong to marginalised backgrounds.Students across campuses related with the hardships faced by the undergraduate student.DU colleges charge different annual fees ranging between Rs 4,500 to Rs50,000. Some minority colleges, including St Stephens and SGTB Khalsa, also have higher fee structures. A second-year BA (political science) student at a prominent college in DU’s North Campus college said: “My father runs a small salon in Uttam Nagar. He remained out of work for months due to the lockdown. His income is minimal even now. He is struggling to even pay the rent of his shop. My brother had also lost his job. It was not possible for my family to pay the annual fees of Rs12,000 this year. I had filled the fee concession request in my college, but it is taking time to process.”A 22-year-old MA (social work) student at DU, requesting anonymity, said her parents were not supportive of her decision to opt for further studies in 2019 after her graduation. “The Covid-19 crisis caused us to lose our only source of income and my family had to take loans to survive. There is no way they can support my education. It was impossible for me to submit my semester fee of around Rs13,000,” she said. A group of students from St. Stephen’s College independently initiated a fund-raising event on Monday and have so far received requests from over 150 students across colleges seeking assistance to pay their fees and to acquire devices to attend digital classes. The MA student mentioned above is one of them.Officials across DU colleges said they have been receiving distress calls and emails from students requesting fee waivers, scholarships, free laptops, and devices. Anju Shrivastava, principal of Hindu College, said they have received more than the usual number of requests seeking financial assistance this time. “Every year, we invite applications offering financial assistance to students. This year, we received 300 requests, which are more than the usual number. Many students expressed difficulty in paying the fee as their parents had lost jobs during the Covid-19 lockdown and the college responded to these requests,” she said.Miranda House principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda said her college has received 181 requests from students asking for fee waivers. “Our teachers and other interested donors will contribute to the Principal’s Fund for Needy Students, which will be used to help students. This is why we decided to extend the deadline for fee submission, so students could get the time needed for necessary assistance,” she said,.Jaswinder Singh, principal of SGTB Khalsa College, said they have received around 200 such requests. “We have divided the fees into two or three instalments for students according to their convenience,” he said. Experts said that efforts have to be made by faculty members and institutes instead of expecting your students to come forward and ask for help in order to avoid such incidents in the future. Educationist and former Dean of the Faculty of Education at DU Anita Rampal said that going forward, colleges have to find ways to help students in need. “Due to the Covid-19 crisis, more and more students are in need of financial assistance. Educational institutions have to be more proactive in checking in with their students and getting in touch with alumni and sponsors to help them for at least a year because students will be at the risk of being pushed out of the system due to the economic crisis arising out of Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lsr-student-suicide-online-push-leaves-many-students-behind/story-VSKnVtgsjMFT0ExRMTBz4K.html
12-11-2020||Delhi||Gangster on Delhi police’s most-wanted list nabbed after shoot-out||The Delhi Police arrested a gangster who featured on their “most-wanted” list on Wednesday morning, after a brief shoot-out that left him with a bullet wound on his leg. With the arrest of 38-year-old Hashim, the police said all “major” gangsters of the trans-Yamuna region are behind bars. Earlier in September, Hashim’s alleged friend-turned-foe, Abdul Nasir,had ended up in police net. The special cell, which nabbed Hashim, said they had received inputs last month that the suspect was planning a series of killings. “On Wednesday, we got to know that he would be visiting his girlfriend in Shahdara. So, we laid a trap outside the house,” said Pramod Kushwaha, deputy commissioner of police (special cell). Around 5.45 am, as Hashim emerged from the house and readied to ride away on his motorcycle, the police said they made a move on him and asked him to surrender, but he responded by firing at them. “He fired three rounds at us and we shot back five times. He was injured in his left leg and hospitalised,” said the DCP. The police team escaped unhurt. The police said they later learnt that the woman he was meeting was “one of his two-three wives”. One among top 10 men wanted by the Delhi Police, Hashim carried a reward of Rs 5 lakh from the police force. Kushwaha said Hashim belongs to Aligarh in UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gangster-on-delhi-police-s-most-wanted-list-nabbed-after-shoot-out/story-JMOr0cQpTAW0l0DYeGRc4K.html

12-11-2020||Delhi||Cases in Delhi continue alarming rise: 8,593 new infections reported||In yet another worrying sign for Delhi, the number of daily new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the capital touched another peak, with over 8,000 cases being recorded in a single day for the first time on Wednesday. The city is in the throes of a third wave of the disease, with cases rising by the day, and more hospitalisations taking place, with the Delhi high court stepping in and asking the state government for a plan to fight the virus.Delhi reported 8,593 cases as per Wednesday’s Delhi government health bulletin. However, the day also saw the highest daily test count, as well as the most RT-PCR tests conducted on a single day in the city. While a total of 64,121 tests were conducted, 19,304 of these were of the more reliable RT-PCR variety.The city also recorded 85 deaths due to the infection, the highest number of single-day deaths since June 16 when Delhi added 437 deaths to its total toll while reconciling old data. So far, 459,975 people have been infected in the Capital and 7,228 of them have died. The city saw a surge in the number of cases over the fortnight, recording over 5,000 cases each day except on a Sunday. On average, 6,898 cases were reported each day during the last seven days, compared to 5,536 the week before, and 3,941 the week before that. A committee headed by NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul had earlier predicted that Delhi could see around 15,000 cases a day during the winters. Covid update: Sputnik-V 92% effective; Pfizer challenge; Delhi HC on surge “When you compare the number of cases to the numbers during previous surge, you have to see that the government is testing a lot of people now. Yesterday, over 59,000 people were tested; only 17 to 18,000 people were being tested during previous peaks. I feel that the number of cases will likely go down in the next few days,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. “Apart from people being out and about during the festive season, the pollution levels have also been high. And, now there is enough evidence to show that pollution can not only lead to severe Covid-19, but also increase in transmission of the infection,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). She said small get-togethers with relatives during the festive season could potentially accelerate the transmission of the virus, as people are not as careful with following preventive measures when they are with family members. Despite the rising number of cases, the results of the fourth round of Delhi’s serological survey shows that there was an increase of just 0.4% between early September and mid-October in the proportion of people that had antibodies against the infection. “An increase of 0.4% means that four cases were reported for 1,000 population translating to 4,000 cases per million population during the one-and-a-half months,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at the Christian Medical College, Vellore. Along with the number of cases, the city also saw a spike in the number of deaths over the last week, recording over 80 deaths a day twice. The number of deaths is inching close to the highest 101, during the June-July surge in cases, when treatment protocols were still being decided. On average, 75 people died of the infection each day during the last seven days, as compared to 44 the week before. The case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of the people who die among those who test positive — remained at 1.57%. “The biggest reason for death due to Covid-19 is a drop in oxygen saturation. So, we have asked our centres to test the oxygen level of the patients undergoing COvid-19 test so that even if they do not feel other symptoms they can receive timely treatment,” said Jain on Wednesday during a press briefing. The doctors have previously warned about “happy hypoxia” associated with Covid-19 where the patient’s oxygen levels drop without any apparent breathing difficulty. Another concern that the government is facing is the shortage of ICU beds. With over 5,000 cases being reported over the fortnight, hospitals are filling up fast. As on Tuesday, 8,497 persons with the infection were admitted to hospitals. Almost 52% of the total 16,500 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 in the government and private hospitals in the city are occupied. And, 85% of the intensive care unit beds – with and without ventilators – are occupied. The government on Wednesday wrote to the centre to add 1,000 beds and 300 ICU beds in its hospitals. “We have written to the Centre to increase 1,000 Covid-19 beds and 300 ICU beds in its hospitals. We have also approached the Supreme Court to challenge the high court decision on reserving ICU beds in big private hospitals,” said Jain. The Delhi government in September had directed 33 big private hospitals to reserve 80% of their total ICU beds for the treatment of Covid-19. The matter was challenged by a hospital association in the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cases-soar-8-593-new-infections-in-capital/story-wENlydL0Jd9N4020D3rYWO.html
12-11-2020||Delhi||‘Why are you opening up everything?’: HC slams govt||The high court on Wednesday criticised the Delhi government for relaxing norms for almost everything, including public movement and gatherings, and wanted to know how the administration would handle the “alarming” rise in Covid-19 cases in the capital.Stating that the number of those infected is “mind boggling”, the court asked the government to submit a policy, if any, on controlling the rising cases. Delhi on Wednesday reported 8,593 cases.

The number of deaths is in double figures every day . What’s with the Delhi government allowing all the unlockdown when cases are skyrocketing? Why have you opened everything? What are the strategies that you are following?“You (Delhi) have seen the heights which no other state in the country has seen. Today, Delhi is beating the whole state of Maharashtra and Kerala hands down in Covid-19 infections. When the numbers are decreasing in all the states, then why are numbers rising only in your state? Either there is no control or there is lack of control,” the bench said, coming down on the Delhi government represented by additional standing counsel Satyakam.“We will present a detailed report to the court on actions being taken to control the current Corona situation. All the actions taken so far have been under the guidelines issued by Centre and after consultation with various experts.

The court said even the petitioner, advocate Rakesh Malhotra, had been infected and had to run from pillar to post to get a bed and later had to settle for a friend’s nursing home after his oxygen level dipped. Malhotra, who wanted tests to be ramped in the city, appeared through video from the hospital“There are children, elderly people at everyone’s house and there is no household left in Delhi which hasn’t been touched by the virus. When other states are locking up, either partial or in the weekend, what we see is the swarming streets of Delhi and the government has decided to throw its winds open and has allowed all gatherings,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-are-you-opening-up-everything-delhi-hc-slams-aap-govt/story-p6xDV71oLLLghovRCKBYlJ.html

This capacity includes ICU and non-ICU beds provided by Central Government hospitals, which have been of great help in tiding over the first and second surges during the months of June and September, 2020, respectively. However, the shortfall of around 4,900 beds, as per the projection of the Report-III of the Empowered Group-l, will have to be met by augmentation in both the central government and state government (hospitals).” Click here for complete coronavirus coverageAt present, there are 16,525 Covid beds across all hospitals in Delhi, of which 8,550 are occupied. There are 3,350 ICU beds, of which 2,838 are occupied, government records showed.

12-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi Riots: High court stays trial in conspiracy case after cops’ plea||The Delhi high court has stayed the trial in the conspiracy case related to the north-east Delhi riots after the police filed a plea challenging a city court’s order directing them to supply physical copies of the charge sheet to all the 15 accused.Issuing notice to the accused, Justice Suresh Kait said in his order on November 10, “Till further order, trial is stayed. However, the trial court is at liberty to decide any application whatsoever kind.” The matter has been posted for further hearing on December 15.In its plea filed through special public prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad, the Delhi police special cell challenged the legality and validity of the orders passed on September 21 and October 21 by additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat. Police said the document runs over 17,500 pages and the direction was passed in a “mechanical manner”.The court had on October 9 directed police to file fresh copies of the chargesheet after it was informed they “had inadvertently” put a document in it, containing details of some of the protected witnesses and its copies were supplied to the accused booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.It had directed the police to file fresh copies, redacting details of the protected witnesses and supply it to the 15 persons charge sheeted in the case and their counsel.On October 21, the court was informed by the investigating officer (IO) that he submitted 16 new pen drives containing the redacted version and accompanying documents. However, the court said both hard and soft copies of the fresh charge sheet should be given.The judge said it was not impressed with the IO’s submission, who had sought 15 days to get funds from the Delhi government to take out hard copies. The judge had directed the police to supply the documents at the earliest.Challenging these orders, the police said the mandate of law under section 207 of CrPC is to provide “copy” of each of the report/ statements/ document subject to reasonable exception. They said the law does not specify supply of “hard copy” or “soft copy” nor does it draw any distinction between them.The police had on September 16 filed a charge sheet against the 15 accused -- Pinjra Tod members and JNU students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha, Gulfisha Khatoon, former Congress Councillor Ishrat Jahan, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, Meeran Haider, Shafa-Ur-Rehman, suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, activist Khalid Saifi, Shadab Ahmed, Tasleem Ahmed, Salim Malik, Mohd Salim Khan and Athar Khan -- for allegedly being part of a larger conspiracy in the riots.Communal violence had broken out in north-east Delhi on February 24 left 53 people dead and 607 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-high-court-stays-trial-in-conspiracy-case-after-cops-plea/story-PrmGpRZvF8IsQIdY4cnRiL.html

12-11-2020||Delhi||Fix timelines for 24x7 water supply project: Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday reviewed the government’s 24x7 water supply and augmentation plan to ensure all neighbourhoods are connected with water supply in the coming years. In the meeting, Kejriwal told officials of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) that time frames would have to be fixed for all the projects. “This has to be ensured to provide relief to the people and prevent unnecessary expenditure of money. I will review the ongoing projects on 24x7 water supply across Delhi around the 15th of every month. The DJB officials will inform me about the monthly progress of work through presentations, including the progress of laying of sewer lines and rainwater harvesting projects,” Kejriwal said. DJB officials said Delhi will need about 1500 MGD water by 2031. “Efforts to provide water supply pipelines in Delhi’s colonies are continuing at a fast pace. So far, out of 1799 (colonies), pipelines have been laid in 1,622 colonies. In the next six months, these colonies will have a clean water supply from pipelines. Besides, water pipelines will reach the remaining 113 colonies by March 2022,” a statement issued by the government read. A total of 580 unauthorised and authorised colonies have been included in the water project, out of which 517 colonies have been connected with the pipeline network. The DJB said the remaining colonies will be connected by December 2021. “There are a total of 1799 colonies in Delhi. Out of these, 260 colonies are in East Delhi, out of which 256 colonies have been connected with a water network,” DJB stated. DJB chairperson Satyendar Jain cautioned officials against repeatedly digging arterial roads across the city in the name of repair work, to avoid any kind of inconvenience to public. “We should lay a proper sewer system wherever road construction is happening so that we do not end up digging up roads again and again,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fix-timelines-for-24x7-water-supply-project-kejriwal/story-3nohxG4LaRMXUh2FxVTJAJ.html

12-11-2020||Delhi||Chhath Puja banned in public places in Delhi||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has prohibited people from celebrating Chhath Puja in public places this year in light of the spike in Covid-19 cases in the national capital.Chhath Puja will begin on November 20. Every year, on Chhath, massive crowds, mostly those from Poorvanchal, congregate on the banks of Yamuna, and the roads along the embankment areas and open spaces to worship the setting and rising sun. The government usually make arrangements to facilitate the worshippers by deploying medical teams and security personnel, and installing lights, changing rooms, toilets, etc.This year, between October 28 and November 8, the government had floated more than 20 tenders for Chhath Puja arrangements in areas of Haathi Ghat ITO, Sarai Kale Khan, Old Railway Bridge in Geeta Colony, both sides of Hindol Canal, Dhobi Ghat in Ganesh Nagar, Talab Chowk Park in Mandawli, Qudsia Ghat, Yamuna Bazar Ghat, Yamuna Ghat Wazirabad, Pusta Gamri, Shiv Vihar and Gokalpur.These tenders now stand cancelled, said a Delhi government spokesperson. “In view of the persistent rise in Covid-19 cases in Delhi in the recent days, it has been decided that Chhath Pooja celebrations will not be allowed in public places and people may be advised to celebrate the festival at homes,” the DDMA, chaired by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, said in an order on Tuesday.All district magistrates and district deputy commissioners of police and others authorities have been told to ensure strict compliance of the order.In October, Durga Puja and Dussehra too were low-key affairs. Although the DDMA had allowed limited gatherings on paper, as the Covid-19 situation at that juncture was relatively better, the district administration and police did not issue permission to organisers and asked others to impose restrictions on access to venues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chhath-puja-banned-in-public-places-in-delhi/story-dqkTR6iVIWfOxgGBnKK40O.html
12-11-2020||Delhi||After 6 days, air improves to very poor||On Wednesday, Delhi finally took a deep breath and not choke -- thanks to improved wind speeds and a change in the wind direction, carrying pollutants away from the national capital.The air quality index (AQI), as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), on Wednesday rose to the ”very poor” category with a reading of 344, after a staying put in the “severe” zone for six days. On a scale of 0 to 500, any reading between 300 and 400 is deemed very poor, while those above 400 are considered severe. The AQI had touched 476 on Tuesday, in the upper reaches of severe zone. The CPCB, however, directed the stone crushers and hot mix plants to remain closed till November 17, to prevent any further deterioration in air quality. Scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) credited the improvement in air quality to change in wind direction and improved speed. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said from Tuesday afternoon, the wind direction over Delhi changed from north-westerly -- blows from the agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana bringing in smoke from farm fires -- to easterly. “Because of the wind direction change, we did not have stubble burning smoke adding to the local sources and deteriorating the air quality on Wednesday. The average wind speed was 12kmph, which was enough to disperse the accumulated pollutants,” Srivastava said. He said on Thursday, too, the wind direction will remain easterly and there is a possibility of the AQI improving further into the better end of very poor zone. But this respite will be short-lived as on the Diwali weekend (November 14), wind will slow down and change direction back to north-westerly. As the city inched into the severe-plus zone on Tuesday evening, with no clarity on the enforcement of measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), the Commission on Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas decided the task of implementing Grap be temporarily given to CPCB until the newly constituted commission develops a mechanism for Grap implementation. There was confusion among agencies after Centre issued an ordinance on October 29 to set up the new centralised agency with sweeping powers to monitor and act against sources of air pollution across five north Indian states. “After the Commission was formed, we did not have the legal mandate to hold meetings or enforce Grap. The Commission gave us the responsibility only yesterday and so we couldn’t take any measures on our own over the past few days,” a senior CPCB official said. Experts also expressed concerns over this lack of coordination among agencies at such a crucial time. “Pollution control and abatement has for long been caught up in legal and institutional jugglery. The current air pollution crisis is an outcome of inaction and regulatory failure. The new Commission has not just inherited the legacy of the problem but also the regulatory framework, in the form of laws and action plans. What needs to be recognised is that even today, big economic decisions are at odds with environment measures. This includes pushing for large real estate projects, continued support for private transport or legal subsidies for coal power stations,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-six-days-of-severe-air-delhi-breathes-a-little-easy/story-xq1YEzFTgYHJu8vr6pNU1O.html
12-11-2020||Delhi||BJP instigating people to burst firecrackers, alleges Gopal Rai||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday requested the opposition to join the government’s fight against pollution, saying unless the people of Delhi and political parties join hands, any action taken will not yield results. Addressing the media, Rai said, “We want to appeal to the opposition to support us in fighting pollution. I also want to appeal to the people to light lamps and not firecrackers; this fight is nothing without the support of the people.” “The two crore people of Delhi have to contribute and play their part to fight pollution. Our small contribution can create a big impact,” he said. Targeting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Rai alleged while the government had implemented a ban on firecrackers till November 30, which was later upheld by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), BJP leaders have been making statements to instigate the people of Delhi. “Instead of supporting the government on this step to prevent the rise in pollution ahead of Diwali, BJP leaders are instigating people, especially youngsters. The BJP or the Centre has done nothing to control pollution in Delhi. I request the BJP to at least not provoke people and negate the efforts being made by the Delhi government,” said Rai. Reacting to the minister’s allegations, BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said their leaders have said nothing to encourage people to burn crackers. “The allegation that BJP leaders are encouraging people to violate the cracker ban is a blatant lie. All we have said is that because the Delhi government had issued licences for the sale of green crackers (less polluting), hundreds of traders had invested in these and a sudden ban would make them suffer heavy losses. So, the Delhi government should partially compensate them,” Kapoor said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rai-says-bjp-instigating-people-to-burn-crackers/story-BUyCggesc7UoCLauKRPKgJ.html

A bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad was hearing a bunch of pleas in connection with the redevelopment of the Chandni Chowk area, including a suo motu petition initiated by the court on the basis of news reports that the project has been derailed. The redevelopment project was supposed to have been completed by May this year but was delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.On Wednesday, advocate Naushad Ahmed Khan, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, representing the PWD, told the court that he had filed a status report a day before but it has not been taken on record. As per that report, work was delayed because of encroachments, including a temple, in Chandni Chowk.He told the court that the main stretch of the market has been completed and only certain intersections remain to be finished while adding that work would be completed by December 31. He urged the court that even the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NrDMC) should be made a party to the case.Following this, the court directed the civic body to be impleaded as a party while also asking all local bodies, including the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) and the Delhi traffic police to file their respective status reports, indicating the work pending at their ends.The PWD, DJB, DUSIB, traffic police and the SRDC refused comment on the matter.The court also noted, “Though notices were issued to several authorities, not even one of them have filed their status reports much less coming prepared to the court with instructions”.It also rejected a plea by Delhi Gurdwara Sikh Management Committee (DSGMC) to allow parking near the Sis Ganj Gurdwara for devotees, while stating that if a policy has been put in place by the government, then it cannot be changed for anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-angry-over-delay-in-chandni-chowk-redevelopment/story-bjHMkKfAVueBSSKyCEY4LP.html

With the festive season now, buses have been increased by the Pune division of MSRTC. MSRTC has also geared up to ply maximum number of buses on various routes across the state and more than 350 extra buses have been sent from Pune. These buses include red ST buses, green and white striped Asiad buses, Shivneri air conditioned buses and the Shivshahi buses. There is a large demand for Shivshahi buses but the transport utility is facing shortage.“We are working round the clock to give service to passengers. For the last six to seven months the service was hit due to Covid-19 lockdown and there was hardly any revenue generation. Now is the time to run a maximum fleet of buses and get many passengers,” said Ramakant Gaikwad, MSRTC Pune divisional controller.Talking about shortage of Shivshahi buses, he said, “There are less number of Shivshahi buses as we are not taking contract buses to go on routes first. We are sending our buses first so that revenue is generated and later on if needed contract buses will be taken. But overall response to our bus service is satisfactory as of now. We aim to get maximum number of buses on routes during the Diwali festival.”Passengers are demanding more MSRTC buses since private buses are charging exorbitant fares in light of Diwali. Sangram Danve, a passenger at Swargate ST stand said, “I want to go to Nagpur to my home, but private buses are demanding Rs 4,000 as bus fare. And when I come to the ST stand there are less number of buses and all seats are already reserved. We want Shivshahi buses on long routes so that people can travel safely in affordable fares.”Special women squad to check illegal agents inside ST standsA special women squad has been deployed by MSRTC to check illegal agents inside the ST stand trying to lure away passengers. The squad will be monitoring for agents on the premises of the ST stand. “At all our major ST stands we have formed four women squads which will look out for illegal agents harassing or taking away passengers from our premises. Legal action will be taken against the offenders.” said Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-passengers-seek-more-shivshahi-buses-to-tackle-diwali-rush/story-8S7Gw5tg6QYXlTrJr2n7wL.html
12-11-2020||Election:||When Joe Biden received a letter from his relatives living in Nagpur since 1873||During his maiden visit to India in 2013, US President-elect Joe Biden had mentioned that he has distant relatives living in Mumbai. In 2015 in Washington, he reiterated that after becoming a Senator in 1972, he had received a letter from one of the Bidens in India and learned that his “great, great, great, great, great grandfather” George Biden was a captain in the East India Trading company and after retirement, decided to settle in India and married an Indian woman.Now that 77-year-old Democrat leader Biden is set to take oath as the 46th US President in January 2021 along with vice president-elect Kamala Harris who is the first South Asian woman to become the vice president of USA, everyone is interested to know about Biden’s distant relatives in India. The letter that Biden had received in 1972 was written by Nagpur-based Leslie Biden, whose grandchildren stay in Nagpur, and claim that their family has been living there since 1873. Leslie Biden was based in Nagpur and was the manager of the Bharat Lodge and Hostel, and Bharat Cafe in Nagpur, before he died in 1983. While reading the ‘Illustrated Weekly of India’ weekly issue of March 28-April 4, 1981, Leslie came across an article about the then US senator Joe Biden and decided to write a letter to the senator.“Leslie got in touch with Joe Biden through a letter sent on April 15, 1981. Joe Biden replied to Leslie through a letter dated May 30, 1981, said he was pleased after getting the letter from India and also discussed about the Bidens’ genealogy,” Leslie’s granddaughter Sonia Biden Francis, a Nagpur- based psychologist, told PTI.She added that Joe Biden’s victory in the US presidential election has made ‘Bidens in Nagpur and everywhere’ elated. Leslie Biden’s descendants live in Nagpur, Mumbai, the US, Australia and New Zealand.Read more | America is back, Biden tells world leadersSonia Biden’s elder brother Ian Biden, a former seafarer in the merchant navy, who also stays in Nagpur, said Leslie and Joe Biden shared information regarding a common ancestor John Biden and his wife Anne Beaumont.“Leslie and Joe Biden thanked each other for corresponding and committed to continue corresponding with each other. However, Leslie Biden’s health worsened and he died in 1983 at Nagpur. Leslie’s wife was unable to pursue the family tree further,” said Leslie’s granddaughter Rowena, who also lives in Nagpur.The Biden family showed the letters that they claimed were part of the correspondence between Leslie and Joe Biden. Asked if the ‘other Bidens’ would attend Joe Biden’s inauguration in January, the family members said they are extending their best wishes to the President-elect Joe Biden.So, it is not only Tamil Nadu’s daughter Kamala Harris with her love for dosas who has Indian roots. The President-elect Joe Biden has roots in India too, in the ‘orange city’.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/us-presidential-election/when-joe-biden-received-a-letter-from-his-relative-living-in-nagpur-since-1873/story-L1gH08XlbHy7hZxxwkjDLI.html
12-11-2020||Mumbai||For first time in 8 years, Maharashtra pollution board calls off annual pre-Diwali firecracker noise, smoke testing exercise||Even as there has been no reduction in availability of firecrackers in markets this year, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has decided not to go ahead with its annual pre-Diwali exercise to monitor noise and amount of smoke in firecrackers in 2020. The pollution control body, cited the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order published on Monday, that allowed cities like Mumbai with ‘moderate’ air quality (during November 2019) to allow the use of green crackers during major festivals this year and within a specific time-frame during each festival when fireworks could be used by citizens. MPCB with anti-noise campaigners Awaaz Foundation have been jointly conducting the firecracker testing study that calculates noise levels and for the past few years have also been detecting the quantity of smoke emitted by firecrackers sold in markets. Those fireworks violating noise norms or emitting large amounts of smoke are recommended to be banned by MPCB to the controller of explosives, Nagpur, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation. The monitoring study has been undertaken since 2005 on a biannual basis, but from 2012 onwards it was being done annually. The testing was annually done in an open ground in Rashtriya Chemical and Fertiliser (RCF) colony, Chembur. “It will not be possible to conduct the exercise this close to Diwali as by the time we send the recommendations, it would be time for the festival,” said SC Kollur, chief scientist, MPCB, adding that the firecracker testing this year was originally scheduled on November 5, but had to be cancelled in light of orders anticipated from NGT. “Also, the NGT order clearly indicates the availability of voluminous data for noise and smoke levels with the Central Pollution Control Board,” said Kollur. Awaaz Foundation said the exercise had been successful resulting in a reduction in noise levels of firecrackers from over 140dB to 126dB (close to the noise norms) and better enforcement of noise rules over the years. “It is disappointing that the testing will not be conducted this year for the first time in eight years. It has created public awareness and policy change,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation adding, that since firecrackers, which are still permitted for manufacture are used at other times of the year and all over the country, the results of the test extend beyond Diwali. “I hope the test will be held immediately after Diwali and will help inform how future celebrations are conducted until such time as manufacture of all crackers except green crackers are completely banned,” she said. Last year, three firecrackers were recommended to be banned by MPCB, including a pack of 16 sky shots (crackling delight from Ajanta Fireworks) which recorded 126 decibels (dB) (as loud as a thunderclap). A series of crackers (5,000 series) called Celebration Akira 5000 recorded 121.3dB, while a 1,000 series from Guru Fireworks recorded 113.6 dB. The testing last year also recorded noise levels from a green cracker (108.3 dB against the safe limit of 125 dB). Green crackers have 30% less emissions than traditional ones with no barium nitrate, a metal oxide that increases both air and noise pollution. The permissible limit for single crackers is 125dB, a series of crackers (ladi), has limits between 90 dB and 110dB depending upon the number of crackers put together. A PESO official said they would have to check whether the recommendations had been incorporated in their annual report. “However, such exercises create awareness and deterrence against the use of such noisy crackers. We are also able to differentiate between those banned crackers that used to be manufactured in China versus those made in Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu,” the official said. Meanwhile, Kollur added that MPCB will however monitor noise across all 27 municipal corporations at 158 locations in Maharashtra before and after Diwali, including 10 locations in Mumbai, during the Diwali period. “Guidelines based on the NGT order and air quality classification of cities and towns in Maharashtra will be shared with urban local bodies and state departments. They can decide on a restricted time frame for bursting crackers within their jurisdiction during Diwali and other festivals this year,” he said. FIRECRACKER TESTING RESULTS OVER THE YEARS In 2019: Three firecrackers were recommended to be banned by MPCB including a sky-shot (rocket), two series crackers (5000 series and 1000 series) all of which violated noise norms. In 2018: Two firecrackers, both series crackers (1000 series) were recommended to be banned for violating noise norms. In 2017: Two crackers - a single cracker (dyno bomb) and a series of crackers (10000 series) - violated noise norms and the state pollution control recommended banning both. There was also a rise in air pollution levels with dust and smoke from various rockets, bombs and new firecrackers being sold in the market. In 2016: The noisiest firecrackers was the 1000 series at 116.2dB and noise levels from single crackers (thread bombs, atom bomb, double knotted bomb) was highest for ‘thriller bomb’ (atom bomb) at a maximum decibel of 99.9 dB. In 2015: The noisiest series crackers were measured at 117 dB and single crackers were as loud as 113 dB (thunderbolt atom bomb). In 2012: 25 firecrackers were tested and all of them breached permissible noise limits.

12-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai teachers get schooled in Covid-19 preventive measures to keep students safe||As the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) gears up to reopen schools in the city, it is training its teachers under a new scheme, Safe Shala, based on the recommendations approved by the community medicine department of Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion hospital. The recommendations, running into 70 pages, are prepared by a student of Class 11 students from Singapore International School, Mumbai, for safety of students, once the state government gives directives to restart schools amid the pandemic. Since October 17, Sion hospital has started to train some teachers to sensitise them about the safety guidelines. As per the education department, 144 teachers from civic schools will be given training as master trainers who will be responsible to train other staffers from their schools. “Our community medicine department has taken the initiative. We have already started training civic teachers. We will also send these recommendations to private schools, but we are yet to decide if we will make it compulsory for private teachers to attend the workshops,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, dean, Sion hospital. The documents available with HT list out several recommendations, including checking health status of school bus drivers before staring pickups; screening children for symptoms before sending them to schools; cleaning restrooms every three-four hours, disinfecting classrooms and commonly touched surfaces such as lift, microphones. In case of secondary students, schools have to form a committee on public health; social studies should focus on the history of pandemics and vaccines; develop good health behaviours like social distancing; increase ventilation in classrooms where AC is not recommended; start staggered canteen timings for hostels; change in menu in hostel canteens to ensure raw and food from outside isn’t served. The letter written by Dr Seema S Bansode- Gokhe, head of the department of community medicine, Sion hospital, states: “We have found that Shivank (Master Shivank Menon) has diligently followed the guidelines of the WHO, government of India and ICMR while preparing the manual. It is recommended to all government and non-government schools may be interested to use it…” “These rules will be implemented in all civic-run schools. We have sent requests to private schools so if they want, they can participate in the workshops,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “This is the first set of guidelines for schools but there might be additional changes, once we take the final decision of opening up schools,” Joshi added. Arundhati Chavan, president of the Parents Teachers Association, said more than private schools, the civic and government-run schools will struggle more in implementing the rules. “Private schools have budgetary provisions, so they can implement the rules with proper sanitation. What about civic-run schools? There is a need for separate guidelines for such schools,” she said. In the city, 13,285 children below 19 years have been infected with Covid-19. Of these, 45 have succumbed to the infection. “Due to better immunity, children are less vulnerable to acquiring the infection. But we have to be careful,” said Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health expert, adding, “Firstly, the state has to be patient before deciding on opening up schools. Secondly, we need strict guidelines to be followed in schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-teachers-get-schooled-in-covid-19-preventive-measures-to-keep-students-safe/story-fnCsveQfNPGL0abVp6rmIP.html
12-11-2020||World||In ruins, Syria marks 50 years of Assad family rule||On November 13, 1970, a young air force officer from the coastal hills of Syria launched a bloodless coup. It was the latest in a succession of military takeovers since independence from France in 1946, and there was no reason to think it would be the last.Yet 50 years later, Hafez Assad’s family still rules Syria.The country is in ruins from a decade of civil war that killed a half million people, displaced half the population and wiped out the economy. Entire regions are lost from government control. But Hafez’s son, Bashar Assad, has an unquestioned grip on what remains.His rule, half of it spent in war, is different from his father’s in some ways, dependent on allies like Iran and Russia rather than projecting Arab nationalism, run with a crony kleptocracy rather than socialism. The tools are the same: repression, rejection of compromise, and brutal bloodshed.Like the Castro family in Cuba and North Korea’s Kim dynasty, the Assads have attached their name to their country the way few non-monarchical rulers have done.It wasn’t clear whether the government intended to mark the 50-year milestone this year. While the anniversary has been marked with fanfare in previous years, it has been a more subdued celebration during the war.“There can be no doubt that 50 years of Assad family rule, which has been ruthless, cruel and self-defeating, has left the country what can only be described as broken, failed and almost forgotten,” said Neil Quilliam, an associate fellow at Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa program.“Ruthless but Brilliant”After his 1970 takeover, Hafez Assad consolidated power. He brought into key positions members of his Alawite sect, a minority in Sunni-majority Syria, and established a Soviet-style single-party police state.His power was absolute. His Mukhabarat, or intelligence officers, were omnipresent.He turned Syria into a Middle East powerhouse. In the Arab world, he gained respect for his uncompromising position on the Golan Heights, the strategic high ground lost to Israel in the 1967 war. He engaged in US -mediated peace talks, sometimes appearing to soften, only to frustrate the Americans by pulling back and asking for more territory.In 1981, in Iraq’s war with Iran, he sided with the Iranians against the entire Arab world backing Saddam Hussein, starting an alliance that would help save his son later. He supported the US-led coalition to liberate Kuwait after Saddam’s 1990 invasion, gaining credit with the Americans.“He was a ruthless but brilliant man who had once wiped out a whole village as a lesson to his opponents,” former US President Bill Clinton, who met with Assad several times, wrote in his memoirs “My Life.”Clinton was referring to the 1982 massacre in Hama, where security forces killed thousands to crush a Muslim Brotherhood uprising.The massacre, one of the most notorious in the modern Middle East, left hatreds that fanned the flames of another uprising against his son years later.“A key element of the Assad regime’s survival has been: No compromise domestically, exploit the geopolitical shifts regionally and globally, and wait your enemies out,” said Sam Dagher, author of the book “Assad or we Burn the Country: How One Family’s Lust for Power Destroyed Syria.”Challenges and OpportunitiesBashar Assad borrowed heavily from that playbook after his father’s death in 2000. Unlike his father, critics say he repeatedly squandered opportunities and went too far.First welcomed as a reformer and modernizer, Bashar, a British-trained eye doctor, opened the country and allowed political debates. He quickly clamped back down, faced with challenges and a rapidly changing world, beginning with the September 11 attacks in America.He opposed the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, worried he would be next. He let foreign fighters enter Iraq from his territory, fuelling an insurgency against the US occupation and enraging the Americans.He was forced to end Syria’s long domination of Lebanon after Damascus was blamed for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Still, he tightened ties with Lebanon’s Hezbollah.Like his father, Bashar Assad elevated family to insulate his power — a younger, more modern generation, but one seen by many Syrians as more rapacious in amassing wealth.The Assad family’s gravest challenge came with the Arab Spring uprisings that swept the region, reaching Syria in March 2011.His response to the initially peaceful protests was to unleash security forces to snuff them out. Instead, protests grew, turning later into an armed insurgency backed by Turkey, the US and Gulf Arab nations. His military fragmented.With his army nearing collapse, Assad opened his territory to Russia’s and Iran’s militaries and their proxies. Cities were pulverized. He was accused of using chemical weapons against his own people and killing or jailing opponents en masse. Millions fled to Europe or beyond.For much of the world, he became a pariah. But Assad masterfully portrayed the war as a choice between his rule and Islamic extremists, including the Islamic State group. Many Syrians and even European states became convinced it was the lesser evil.Eventually, he effectively eliminated the military threat against him. He is all but certain to win presidential elections due next year in the shattered husk that is Syria.Still, Dagher said the war transformed Syrians in irreversible ways. An economic meltdown and mounting hardship may change the calculus.“A whole generation of people has been awakened and will eventually find a way to take back the country and their future,” he said.As US election results rolled in, showing Joe Biden the winner, memes by Syrian opposition trolls mocked how the Assads have now outlasted nine American presidents since Richard Nixon.“In my life, my fellow Syrians had to vote four times for the only president on the ballot, Hafez Assad. His son is still president. After migration to the US, I voted for six different presidents,” wrote Zaher Sahloul, a Chicago-based Syrian-American doctor who left Syria in 1989. “I wish that my homeland will witness free elections one day.”Hafez Assad’s legacy might have looked quite different had he not shoe-horned Bashar into succeeding him, Quilliam said.“It would not have been favorable, but Bashar’s legacy will overshadow Assad’s legacy and make it synonymous with cruelty, willful destruction of a great country, and the brutalization of a beautiful people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-ruins-syria-marks-50-years-of-assad-family-rule/story-rd9Dv4yDJ1TF2QfXM3SvVM.html
12-11-2020||World||Covid-19: States ramp up for biggest vaccination effort in US history||With a Covid-19 vaccine drawing closer, public health officials across the country are gearing up for the biggest vaccination effort in US history — a monumental undertaking that must distribute hundreds of millions of doses, prioritize who’s first in line and ensure that people who get the initial shot return for the necessary second one.The push could begin as early as next month, when federal officials say the first vaccine may be authorized for emergency use and immediately deployed to high-risk groups, such as health care workers.“The cavalry is coming,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” He said he hopes shots will be available to all Americans in April, May and June.Pfizer also boosted hopes this week, saying early data suggests its vaccine is 90% effective. But the good news came in one of the grimmest weeks of the pandemic so far. Deaths, hospitalizations and new infections are surging across the US — and turning up the pressure to get the vaccine effort right.In Philadelphia, the health department is counting how many health care workers and others would be among the first in line. In Louisiana, officials are planning a remote exercise this week to play out different scenarios exploring how the process might unfold.“If you get 10,000 doses, what are you going to do, versus 100,000 doses?” said Dr. Frank Welch, director of Louisiana’s immunization program.State and local officials are also planning for the likelihood that the first shipments will not be enough to cover everyone in high-priority groups.Similar preparations are happening at the federal level. Welch listened in last week on a “war gaming” session by the US Department of Health and Human Services.For the vaccination effort to get off the ground, state officials have been readying systems to track supplies and who has been vaccinated. That information will be fed into a national network and will be critical in giving federal health officials an up-to-date picture of vaccinations around the country.Providers such as pharmacies and doctor’s offices will also need to be able to look up records, so people do not have to return to the same place for their second shot. More than one vaccine could also become available, and doses cannot be mixed and matched.“We not only have to bring people back for a second dose, but need to make sure that we have very good records of which vaccine they received the first time,” said Dr. Jinlene Chan of Maryland’s health department.States already have immunization registries, which will be used for Covid-19.To better understand whether at-risk groups are getting vaccinated, the CDC wanted providers to report the race and ethnicity of the people they vaccinate. But pharmacies and other providers that do not always collect that information objected.“We have to be careful not to put too many administrative burdens on providers that are already stressed,” said Mitchel Rothholz of the American Pharmacists Association, an industry group.He said providers have been told they will have the option to leave that information out.Providers will also have to report vaccination information daily, which will be an adjustment for those that typically enter data weekly or every couple of weeks, state officials said.To help people find doses in their area, the CDC wants to put information on a vaccine finder website, which will be updated each day with the latest inventory.Supplying that inventory information might be a staffing strain for some providers, including a hospital in Utah that said it only has one person who currently enters the information, said Jon Reid, who manages state’s immunization registry.“And they don’t do it every day. They do it whenever,” Reid said. State officials in Utah plan to update the inventory, rather than having each provider enter it, he said.States are also working to expand the number of pharmacies, doctor’s offices and other providers that can administer Covid-19 vaccines, to ensure shots are conveniently available.But enrollment can be time-consuming, Reid said, because providers often need help filling out forms, getting technical systems working and going through inspections to ensure they can meet storage requirements. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 F).Given the hurdles, Reid does not expect smaller pharmacies to become Covid-19 vaccine providers.Because of the likely need for two doses given three or four weeks apart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering ways of helping Americans remember the second shot, including issuing cards that people would get with their first shot, akin to the polio immunization cards many older Americans remember carrying.Many people will likely need additional prodding.In a rural part of South Carolina, one community health center is planning multiple reminders, including text messages and calls from health workers.Still, “there will still be some that slip through the cracks,” said Ann Lewis, CEO of CareSouth Carolina, which runs the health centers.Distributing doses is another issue. The Pfizer vaccine, which could be the first to get the green light, comes in shipments of nearly 1,000 doses.“A minimum of 1,000 doses makes it very difficult to get smaller facilities vaccinated,” said Rich Lakin, director of Utah’s immunization program.Shipments might go to a hospital that is easily accessible to health care workers from multiple sites, Lakin said.“They may have to drive to that hospital to get the vaccine,” he said.In North Dakota, providers receiving fewer than 1,000 doses will have them shipped to a state warehouse that can maintain the ultra-cold storage.“We’ll break them down into the smaller quantities and then drive them to the provider,” said Molly Howell, the state’s immunization director.State and local health departments will break up and redistribute shipments of other vaccines, which are expected to require orders of at least 100 doses, for smaller providers that do not need that many. But even if distribution goes smoothly, officials worry people will not want the shots.“If there’s going to be any real challenge, to be honest with you, it’s going to be convincing folks to get the vaccine,” said Patrick Peer, who runs the Good Neighbor Community Health Center in Columbus, Nebraska.So far, states have received far less money than they say they need for vaccine distribution, and it’s unclear if any more federal help is coming. Public health groups estimate that an additional $8.4 billion is needed to pay for staff, data systems and outreach and supply costs.In rural Minnesota this fall, masked nurses in traffic vests reached into cars to give passengers flu shots. The drive-thru clinic was a way to social distance in the pandemic, but it also served as a test run for someday administering a Covid-19 vaccine.Carlton County has purchased mobile vaccination stations to prepare for similar mass clinics for the coronavirus. But county health officials are also suddenly dealing with a spike in cases, and many questions remain unanswered, including when a vaccine might arrive and how many doses there will be“It’s all kind of up in the air,” said Jenny Barta, a public health nurse specialist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-states-ramp-up-for-biggest-vaccination-effort-in-us-history/story-ZErIu9pAi0r56US6XjJJBM.html
12-11-2020||World||White House leaves stimulus to Congress after failed talks||The Trump administration is stepping back from negotiations on a new stimulus package and leaving it to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to revive long-stalled talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, according to people familiar with the situation.While the White House probably would consult with GOP lawmakers on details of a Covid-19 relief bill, it’s now unlikely to take the lead on talks, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The White House would only take over if negotiations have to be restarted completely, the people said.The White House didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.The move greatly diminishes the chances of a trillion-dollar or more stimulus for the US economy before January. President Donald Trump had committed to pursuing a large-scale stimulus after the election, even saying he would approve a $2 trillion bill, but has since focused on attempting to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s victories in battleground states.That leaves the negotiations at a stalemate, with neither McConnell nor Pelosi backing away from earlier positions -- even as the further spread of the coronavirus threatens to weaken the recovery from earlier pandemic-induced shutdowns.Powell’s CallFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that fiscal stimulus is “absolutely essential” to the US economic recovery. He has also said that even if spending proved more than necessary, it “will not go to waste.”Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had been leading negotiations with Pelosi, but they hit an impasse before Election Day, with the administration proposing about $1.9 trillion in spending, and Democrats at $2.4 trillion. A welter of policy issues, from aid to state and local governments to a Republican push for liability protections for businesses, had also prevented a deal.McConnell has continued to insist on a much smaller package of about $500 billion, pointing to signs of a continuing recovery including a slide in the unemployment rate. He has also pointed to encouraging news on a coronavirus vaccine.“The level at which the economy is improving further underscores that we need to do something at about the amount that we put on the floor in September and October,” McConnell told reporters. Democratic leaders “still are looking at something dramatically larger. That’s not a place I think we’re willing to go,” he said.‘Same Place’His office declined to comment about the White House role in the talks.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that the $2.4 trillion House-passed bill must be the starting point to any new stimulus talks, reinforcing the stalemate with the Senate.“We’re at the same place,” Pelosi at a news conference with Schumer. “Even more so with the pandemic because look at these numbers. Look at these numbers. Look at the predictions of the scientific community.”Pelosi didn’t respond to a question about whether she had spoken to anyone from the administration.One vehicle for at least some Covid-19 assistance is a vital spending bill that will be needed to avoid the federal government shutting down after Dec. 11, when current funding runs out. House and Senate negotiators are working on an omnibus package that would include appropriations bills for funding through next September.McConnell said this week he plans to talk to Pelosi about the funding bill soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-leaves-stimulus-to-congress-after-failed-talks/story-14gfru1P7tiOan2seo2ngP.html
12-11-2020||World||Can Marijuana help Joe Biden heal a divided nation?||After five states — Arizona, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota — passed ballot measures for marijuana use last week, the drug will soon be legal in some form for 70% of the U.S. population. A third of the country won’t even need a medical excuse. But that’s not the surprise.What’s more notable is that unlike in the past, all of this happened without much of a public uproar. To be fair, there have been bigger concerns on Americans’ minds these days. But this is the moment that cannabis companies and their investors have been waiting for: to be considered a legitimate industry rather than a hot voting issue. From here, the goal is to make weed every bit as normal as junk food, wine and other vices long found in stores across America.In order for the industry to flourish it needs the federal government’s help, and the prospects of that are suddenly looking better. Two-thirds of US adults are in favor of marijuana legalization — 91% if you include those who support it at a minimum for medicinal purposes, according to Pew Research Center. That’s more than the number of Americans who support abortion rights or who think human activity contributes to climate change.The partisan gap in attitudes toward pot is also shrinking, with more than half of Republicans saying it should be legalized. In the reliably red state of Mississippi, Initiative 65 — the less-restrictive of two medical marijuana proposals that were on its ballot — was criticized by Governor Tate Reeves as too “liberal” for “non-stoners”:And still it passed by 74%. As Joe Biden takes office in January and the makeup of Congress continues to reflect a divided nation, marijuana may end up being the one issue almost everyone can agree on.The increasing support for pot in red states bodes well for a Senate vote on the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act, which would allow financial institutions to legally do business with marijuana companies. It would be one of the most constructive developments for the industry short of legalizing weed at the federal level.Cannabis companies have reason to be hopeful that a new administration will also usher in other changes such as reclassifying or excluding marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act. De-scheduling the drug would leave states to decide how to handle pot, which may be more palatable to conservatives than attempting to change federal laws, Isaac Boltansky and Merrill Ross, analysts for Compass Point Research & Trading LLC, wrote in an Oct. 26 report. Marijuana is currently considered a Schedule 1 drug, right alongside heroin, in a category reserved for narcotics with the highest potential for abuse and dependence and with no accepted medical use. Examples of Schedule 2 substances are cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamine and oxycodone — some of them at the root of America’s opioid addiction crisis. For cannabis proponents, that just doesn’t add up. Removing cannabis from the CSA would provide a meaningful benefit to companies’ income statements:In fact, some of the biggest challenges in getting licensed weed businesses off the ground are around the regulatory hurdles and costly process of having to work piecemeal in expanding around the U.S. That’s helped the illicit weed market maintain a competitive advantage by undercutting prices. In California, where marijuana can be legally purchased, illegal transactions are still estimated to make up the overwhelming majority of sales.It’s no wonder that pot stocks — at one point the darlings of the market — have lost their exuberance this year. The so-called cannabis index has dropped 38%. In one example, beleaguered multistate operator MedMen Enterprises Inc. was forced to walk away from Virginia, where a limited but potentially lucrative medical marijuana market is just beginning to open up; its shares have slumped 73% this year.An unintended effect of squelching the market may be to drive cash-strapped cannabis companies into the arms of food and beverage giants, which are preparing to pounce on pot once laws become more lax. For brewers and tobacco companies, it may be the most promising growth avenue. That said, a bunch of upstarts getting swallowed by behemoths would seem to go against Democratic legislators’ efforts to level competitive playing fields through more aggressive antitrust enforcement. Everyday consumer products are a key way for cannabis companies to target a wider customer base than pot smokers. Canada-based Canopy Growth Corp., valued at $9 billion, wants to start selling drinks containing THC — the psychoactive chemical in cannabis — next year to compete with beer. Even though Canopy is backed by liquor conglomerate Constellation Brands Inc., it’ll be tough going up against Anheuser-Busch InBev AB, which controls 42% of the North American beer market.Bit by bit, things are moving in a positive direction for the industry, albeit slowly. Meanwhile, cannabis companies have strategically entered states where medical marijuana is allowed so that they’re ready to roll once recreational use for adults is made legal. For example, the more immediate winners of last week’s ballot measures include Curaleaf Holdings Inc., a $5.9 billion company that holds the No. 1 market share in New Jersey and No. 2 in Arizona, and Harvest Health & Recreation Inc., which gets 50% of its sales from Arizona, according to a Nov. 4 report by Pablo Zuanic, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. New York and Pennsylvania are expected to be next, with budget shortfalls caused by Covid-19 potentially incentivizing them to move faster on the issue.At the national level, if Biden is looking for common ground with Republicans, marijuana of all things seems like a reasonable place to start. The year 2020 truly is bizarre. (Corrects third-to-last paragraph to clarify that Canopy is based in Canada, with a U.S.-listed stock. )This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

12-11-2020||World||Hong Kong row: China has again breached law, says UK||The disqualification of four Hong Kong legislators constitutes another breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the island’s handover to China in 1997, the Boris Johnson government said on Thursday, and summoned the Chinese envoy to express “deep concern”.The Foreign Office said that the disqualification breaches both China’s commitment that Hong Kong will enjoy a “high degree of autonomy” and the right to freedom of speech guaranteed under Paragraph 3 and Annex I of the declaration.This is the third time since 1997 that China has breached the legally-binding declaration; the first was in 2016; the second in June 2020 when Beijing introduced the Hong Kong National Security Legislation, officials added. Sanctions may be considered with the UK’s allies.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said: “Beijing’s imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong constitutes a clear breach of the legally binding Sino-British Joint Declaration”.“China has once again broken its promises and undermined Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy. The UK will stand up for the people of Hong Kong, and call out violations of their rights and freedoms. With our international partners, we will hold China to the obligations it freely assumed under international law”, he added.On Wednesday, China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee decided that any Hong Kong legislator who promotes or supports Hong Kong independence, refuses to recognise China’s sovereignty over Hong Kong, seeks foreign countries to interfere in the affairs of Hong Kong, or endangers the national security of Hong Kong, will be in breach of the parliamentary oath and should be disqualified from membership of the Hong Kong Legislative Council.The decision led to the immediate removal of four elected members. All other pro-democracy legislators said they would resign en masse.According to the Foreign Office, Beijing’s move is part of a pattern apparently designed to harass and stifle voices critical of China’s policies; the new rules for disqualification are seen by London as providing a further tool in the campaign, with vague criteria open to wide-ranging interpretation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-row-china-has-again-breached-law-says-uk/story-UsyNcPmMlPhZnmavUF8K5H.html

That’s according to the International Organization for Migration. Only 47 people were rescued by the Libyan coast guard and fisherman and brought to shore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/74-migrants-drown-after-boat-breaks-down-off-libya-coast-un/story-TVVy5EQyz8S58f2W2w1MCP.html
12-11-2020||World||UK summons China envoy, declares Hong Kong treaty breach||The UK summoned China’s ambassador to protest the disqualification of pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong, a move it said breaks the joint agreement on political and legal conditions in the former British colony.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Beijing’s new law barring any Hong Kong lawmakers who don’t recognize Chinese sovereignty undermines the territory’s “high degree of autonomy” protected in the Sino-British agreement.“The UK will stand up for the people of Hong Kong, and call out violations of their rights and freedoms,” Raab said in emailed statement on Thursday. “With our international partners, we will hold China to the obligations it freely assumed under international law.”The UK said it’s the second time in six months, and the third since the 1997 handover, that it has accused China of breaking the terms of the treaty.It comes against a backdrop of heightened political concerns in Britain about China’s behaviour, ranging from measures to quell dissent in Hong Kong to alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, at the same time as growing Chinese involvement in key British infrastructure projects.Yet the move is unlikely to alter China’s stance on Hong Kong, especially if the U.K. takes no specific measures against the government. The Hong Kong branch of the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement China “strongly opposes defamatory comments by foreign politicians on the decision on Hong Kong.”Also Read | Xi Jinping challenges Joe Biden with move to snuff out Hong Kong dissentSanctionsUK lawmakers from across the political spectrum again called on the government to impose sanctions on Chinese officials, including against Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, whose government banished four legislators following the Chinese resolution this week.The resolution is the latest sign of China’s push to clamp down on dissent following anti-government protests last year. Beijing has since passed a series of measures asserting greater control over Hong Kong, first targeting democracy activists involved in street protests and now dissenters in democratic institutions set up under British colonial rule.But Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams declined to commit to sanctions on individuals involved in the crackdown.“We are constantly considering designations under our Magnitsky-style regime but it would not be helpful to speculate on the names under consideration,” he told Parliament on Thursday. Ministers are working within the United Nations to hold China to account for its “transgressions,” he said.UK Announces Law to Protect Key Assets From Foreign BuyersStill, China-skeptics in Johnson’s party are having an impact on the British policy toward Beijing. Earlier this year, they pressed the premier to ban Huawei Technologies Co. from the UK’s next-generation wireless networks, reversing an earlier decision to allow the company a role.This week, the government published a draft National Security and Investment Bill that would give ministers sweeping powers to intervene in foreign takeovers of British assets deemed a threat to national security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-summons-china-envoy-declares-hong-kong-treaty-breach/story-9OPwWQJOAqbmLONTql0fjN.html

Misinformation plays into existing anxieties and uncertainty around new (Covid)vaccines, as well as the new platforms that are being used to develop them,” said Heidi Larson, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who co-led the study.“This threatens to undermine the levels of Covid-19 vaccine acceptance,” added Larson, who is also director of the international Vaccine Confidence Project.The study comes as one of the major vaccine efforts showed promising results this week. Pfizer Inc said on Monday its experimental Covid-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on interim data from late stage trials. The data were seen as a crucial step in the battle to contain a pandemic that has killed more than a million people.In the misinformation study, 3,000 respondents in each country were exposed between June and August to widely circulating misinformation on social media about a Covid-19 vaccine. The remaining 1,000 in each country, acting as a control group, were shown factual information about Covid-19 vaccines.Also Read | Brazil resumes trials of Chinese Covid-19 vaccine candidateBefore being exposed to misinformation, 54% of those in the UK said they would “definitely” accept a vaccine, as did 41.2% in the United States. But after being shown the online misinformation, that number fell by 6.4 percentage points in the UK group, and by 2.4 percentage points in the United States.In both countries, people without a college degree, those in low-income groups and non-whites are more likely to reject a Covid-19 vaccine, the study found.Women were more likely than men to refuse a Covid-19 vaccine, but more respondents in both countries said they would accept a vaccine if it meant protecting family, friends, or at-risk groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-says-misinformation-could-prompt-people-to-turn-against-covid-19-vaccines/story-4vrJsiEcrIk0yQPgGkF8BM.html
12-11-2020||World||Google Photos to update pricing policy, caps free storage limit from June 2021||Come June 1, 2021, Google Photos would end their free storage services, as announced by Shimrit Ben-Yair, vice president of Google Photos, in tech giant’s official blog. The product was launched primarily as a picture and video storage cloud service by Google for its smartphone users. It later expanded to encompass a wide range of functionalities, namely, storage, management of pictures and videos, editing and memories of past events. While the free storage would not completely be scrapped, a cap on the maximum free storage space for high quality images and videos would be set at 15 gigabytes per account. This would imply that the users in need of more than 15 GB space for high quality content would be charged as per the costing and storage requirements.Google has also made it clear that the existing high quality content would be independent of this change next year.Considering that this is a big change given the magnitude of the users, Google has also assured that they have to make no decisions about the changes to the app presently. The company also said that the announcement is being made well in advance for the users to be prepared for the new costing policy. When a user, after June 1, 2021, nears their storage limit of 15 GB, Google services would notify the user of the same via the Google Photos application and follow up via email. As an estimate in the blog suggests, an average user would take a minimum of three years to reach the 15 GB free storage limit.As a reward to its loyal customer base, users of Google Pixel range of smartphones would be exempted from this change for buying Google’s own flagship smartphone. To enable customers to become accustomed to the new change, Google has also planned to introduce new tools that would help in managing and organising the storage space in Google Photos app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-photos-to-update-pricing-policy-caps-free-storage-limit-from-june-2021/story-vZmV9M6Iy6JE5zvbfg0W2H.html
12-11-2020||World||China’s military lays out technology roadmap to catch up with US by 2027: Report||China must apply cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence if it wants to transform its military into a modern fighting force on a par with those of other leading powers, according to new guidelines and comments from President Xi Jinping and other officials.The statements come from a booklet published this month by the state-run People’s Publishing House, in which senior officials, including President Xi, outlined the latest five-year plan for the country’s development.The military modernisation is being pushed by 67-year-old Xi, who besides heading the ruling Communist Party (CPC) and the Presidency is also the Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), which is the overall high command for China’s 2-million strong military.China this year approved about USD 179 billion defence budget, the second-highest after United States defence spending of USD 732 billion.According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) military expenditure figures, China defence spending in 2019 amounted to USD 232 billion.Recent key conclave of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) has finalised plans to build a fully modern military on par with the US by 2027.Also Read | China declines to congratulate Joe Biden, state media cautious about victoryBy the year 2027, which marks the centennial of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), China will build a fully modern military, a goal that is in alignment with the national strength and will fulfil the future national defence need, state-run Global Times quoted Chinese analysts as saying early this month.The Plenary session of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) headed by Xi, which held a four-day meeting, adopted his proposals for the formulation of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035.Analysts say China’s aim is to build an army that is on a par with that of the United States.In an article titled “Speed up the Modernisation of Defence and Military” from the booklet published by People’s Publishing House, Xu Qiliang, vice-chairman of the CMC, stressed the importance of smart technologies in modernising the PLA, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Thursday. Military analyst Ye Jianliang said that it is imperative for China to improve its military might to match its economic strength.The military had to be more proactive in designing how the war was fought, rather than just responding to conflicts, he said.“(China has to) keep pace with the developments of the times and emphasise the use of smart technologies to achieve interdisciplinary innovation,” Xu said.That would involve modernising military theories, formations, personnel and strategic management, he was quoted as saying.“Always bear in mind that (a nation) is in danger if it forgets about war or makes inadequate preparations for war,” Xu said.His comments were echoed in another article in the booklet, which said modernisation was essential to making an intelligent military, the Post report said.“A new round of scientific and technological revolution, industrial revolution and military revolution is evolving rapidly…it’s a global trend to build an intelligent military,” it said.The transformation process should be about creating a fighting force that is less labour-intensive and more focused on new technology, much of it home-grown, it said.Military analyst Ye Jianliang said in his article in the booklet that China’s defence capabilities do not match its status in the international community or its national security needs. “History has repeatedly proven that a strong nation can only be built with both economic and military power … when the ‘sword’ is not sharp enough, a nation may fall,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-military-lays-out-technology-roadmap-to-catch-up-with-us-by-2027-report/story-2AQv4c85AhN45w6rRnnFJM.html

The world’s largest gaming firm by revenue has benefited from healthy growth of paying users for video games in China and international markets. Its flagship game Honor of Kings reported a record 100 million daily active users in the first 10 months of 2020. Tencent made 38.5 billion yuan ($5.8 billion) profit for the three months through September. That was ahead of an analyst average estimate of 30.81 billion yuan, according to data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 29% to 125.4 billion yuan.The Chinese group has a solid pipeline of new games waiting to be released, including a recent testing launch of a mobile version of League of Legends in Asia.The company also saw a return to normalcy in advertising activity following the Covid-19 outbreak, with rapid growth in sectors such as education, internet services and e-commerce platforms.Its shares closed 4.72% up, against a 0.22% decline in the Hang Seng index.They rebounded from a 7% plunge on Wednesday - when Tencent celebrated its 22nd birthday - as investors dumped shares in Chinese tech companies following publication of draft anti-monopoly rules that also wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars off some tech giants including Alibaba.Tencent said revenue from its cloud and other business services, a potential future growth engine, were affected by the lingering impact of the pandemic, such as delays in project deployment and new contract sign-ups. “The year-on-year revenue growth rate was therefore lower than previous quarters, which we expect to be temporary in nature,” Tencent said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tencent-s-profit-surges-89-as-chinese-giant-rides-on-gaming-boom/story-V0GVGIY5uRR9bdRAYZtGSL.html
12-11-2020||World||US envoy insists pressure on Iran will persist under Joe Biden||The US special representative for Iran insisted Thursday a pressure campaign of sanctions targeting Iran would persist into the administration of Joe Biden, even as the president-elect has pledged to potentially return America to Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers.Elliot Abrams, who also serves as the US special representative to Venezuela, said sanctions targeting Iran for human rights violations, its ballistic missile program, and its regional influence would go on.That, as well as continued scrutiny by United Nations inspectors and American partners in the Mideast, would maintain that pressure, he said.Iran now has far more uranium than allowed under the deal since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018.The Mideast also has been roiled by tensions between Tehran and Washington, which pushed the two countries to the brink of war at the beginning of the year.“Even if you went back to the (deal) and even if the Iranians were willing to return, this newly enriched uranium, you would not have solved these really fundamental questions of whether Iran is going to be permitted to violate long-term commitments it has made to the world community,” Abrams told The Associated Press in an interview at the US Embassy in Abu Dhabi.Iran’s mission to the UN did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Abram’s remarks. Its politicians have increasingly discussed the possibility of the US returning to the deal, which saw Iran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctionsAbrams replaced Brian Hook as America’s envoy on Iran, who announced he’d leave his post in August after serving as the face of Trump’s maximum-pressure campaign.That effort has floundered internationally as the US and its Gulf Arab allies failed to convince the United Nations to stop an arms embargo on Iran from expiring in October. Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile, which would have been under 300 kilograms (660 pounds) in the deal, now stands at over 2,440 kilograms (5,380 pounds) , according to the latest report by UN inspectors.That’s potentially enough material to make at least two nuclear weapons, experts say, if Iran chose to pursue the bomb.Iran also is enriching uranium to as much as 4.5 per cent purity, higher than allowed under the accord but still far lower than weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent. Tehran abandoned all limits on its enrichment months after Trump’s pullout from the agreement, even as the deal’s other international partners China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Germany have tried unsuccessfully to salvage it.Meanwhile, Iran has begun construction at its underground Natanz enrichment site after a fire and explosion it described as “sabotage” struck its advanced centrifuge assembly plant in July.Abrams described the construction as “another Iranian challenge” to the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA), the UN agency that Iran still allows to monitor its nuclear sites. He also criticized Iran for its slow response in allowing the IAEA to investigate a suspicious site outside of Tehran where it discovered particles of uranium of man-made origin.Iran long has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, the IAEA has said Iran “carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device” in a “structured program” through the end of 2003.“Iran denies that it ever had a nuclear weapons program,” Abrams said. “Therefore, it can’t now say, well, things you found from 2003, were part of our old nuclear weapons program. They’re caught in their own lie.”  Abrams mentioned US citizens still imprisoned by Iran, who activists and their families insist are chips in future negotiations. He also said the United Arab Emirates’ normalisation deal with Israel also put new pressure on Iran, especially as the US plans a USD 23 billion arms deal for Emiratis to purchase F-35 stealth fighter jets and drones.“I hope that next year the leverage that we’ve built up through our sanctions program is used (with) any form of pressure including, for example, Iranian fears about a developing relationship between Israel and Arab states in the region,” he stated.  “All of this pressure should be brought to bear to get Iran to change its conduct.” In the 1980s, during the Reagan administration, Abrams worked in the State Department and convinced the sultan of Brunei to deposit USD 10 million in a White House-controlled Swiss bank account to aid Nicaragua’s Contra rebels despite a Congressional ban. But the White House later put the money into the wrong account in a clerical error, as investigators later discovered.Abrams, now 72, ultimately cooperated with those investigating the so-called Iran-Contra Affair and pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges. Then-President George HW Bush pardoned him in 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-insists-pressure-on-iran-will-persist-under-joe-biden/story-75V0kQKNoHR1EurLVw0RuO.html

Talks will continue in London over the weekend and will take place in Brussels next week,” EU spokesman Daniel Ferrie told AFP.Negotiations between London and Brussels have been snagged on the same issues for months, mainly fisheries and ensuring the “level playing field” to maintain fair competition between UK and EU firms.An EU diplomat closely following the talks said that despite their intensity, “nothing has changed” and that the UK had even backtracked on earlier compromise positions.“The deal will have to be done in Brussels next week, otherwise there is no deal,” the diplomat warned, circling an EU video summit next Thursday as the deadline.Read | Brexit, Covid-19 and climate colluding to raise UK food pricesTime is short since both the EU and UK parliaments must ratify the pact by January 1, when a post-Brexit transition period comes to a close.Any deal would have to go through detailed legal drafting in time for a vote of European Parliament on December 16, although this date could theoretically be delayed.“There needs to be something... or there will be nothing at all,” the diplomat insisted, but a European source said that “as of yet”, Brexit was not even on the summit agenda.As talks pressed on in London, senior UK minister Michael Gove told the British parliament that “progress is being made, but divergences remain.”On Saturday, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said that whilst an agreement is likely, “it is quite possible that this could fall apart and we don’t get a deal.“If we can’t get a deal done it will represent an extraordinary failure of politics and diplomacy,” he added.bur-arp/dc/bmm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-talks-go-into-next-week-with-eu-and-uk-divided/story-ISAnXtWqeGMimESH1k54JM.html
12-11-2020||World||UK first country in Europe to cross 50,000 Covid-19 deaths||The UK has become the first country in Europe to cross the grim milestone of 50,000 Covid-19 related deaths as Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, “we mourn everybody who’s gone”.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19As per the official figures released by the government, 1,256,725 people have tested positive for the virus after 22,950 new cases were recorded this week. A further 595 fatalities due to the deadly viral infection on Wednesday took the death toll to 50,365, making the UK the fifth country in the world to cross the 50,000-mark after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. “We’re not out of the woods yet. Every death is a tragedy, we mourn everybody who’s gone and our feelings are with their families and friends,” Johnson said.“It is a global pandemic whose effects, whose treatments, whose implications for the economy, all those have been becoming clearer as the months have gone on,” he said. The grim death toll comes as news of a possible new effective vaccine being ready by the end of the year hit the global headlines earlier this week. However, Johnson has previously warned that it is still “very, very early days” for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. “It is still some way off. And we absolutely cannot rely on this as a solution,” he said, urging people to continue to follow the strict lockdown rules in order to keep the rate of infections in check. Meanwhile, the UK government has been expanding its mass testing capabilities, with an initial pilot in the city of Liverpool being expanded to further cities and also for students on university campuses wanting to travel back home for Christmas after lockdown is lifted from December 2. “We are absolutely committed to using the latest testing technology to make asymptomatic testing available in more areas,” said UK Health Minister Lord James Bethell. “It is right we’ve taken a dual-track approach to evaluating this technology – by piloting them in the field so we can understand how to best make these tests available, and by getting our world-leading academics and clinicians to undertake rigorous evaluation of their ability to detect the virus. I’m delighted that both are already demonstrating that lateral flow tests can be the reliable, highly sensitive technology we need to help get this virus under control, and return to as close to normality as possible,” he said. Lateral flow tests are rapid turnaround tests that can process Covid-19 samples on site without the need for laboratory equipment, with most generating results in under half an hour. As part of the UK government’s strategy for testing the effectiveness of this new technology, these new tests are being piloted across England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-first-country-in-europe-to-cross-50-000-covid-19-deaths/story-2wEP9EPieM43se8CL9bToJ.html
12-11-2020||World||Italian hospitals face breaking point in fall coronavirus surge||Dr. Luca Cabrini was certain his hospital in the heart of Lombardy‘s lake district would reach its breaking point caring for 300 Covid-19 patients. So far, virus patients fill 500 beds and counting.Italy, which shocked the world and itself when hospitals in the wealthy north were overwhelmed with coronavirus cases last spring, is again facing a systemic crisis, as confirmed positives pass the symbolic threshold of 1 million.“We are very close to not keeping up. I cannot say when we will reach the limit, but that day is not far off,’’ said Cabrini, who runs the intensive care ward at Varese’s Circolo hospital, the largest in the province of 1 million people northwest of Milan.The hospital expanded its 20-bed ICU ward to 45 beds during Italy’s deadly spring peak. It had 38 patients last weekend, and Cabrini was preparing to set up beds in an operating theater this week, “something we would have preferred to avoid.”As dire as Italy’s ICU situation is once again, it’s not critical care that is most worrying doctors during the pandemic’s autumn resurgence. It’s sub-intensive and infectious disease wards caring for less gravely ill patients, who are often younger and sometimes require care for longer periods.The Italian doctors federation called this week for a nationwide lockdown to forestall a collapse of the medical system, marked by the closure of non-emergency procedures. The Government is facing tougher criticism than in the spring, when the health crisis was met with an outpouring of solidarity.As of Wednesday, 52 per cent of Italy’s hospital beds were occupied by Covid-19 patients, above the 40 per cent warning threshold set by the Health Ministry. Nine of Italy’s 21 regions and autonomous provinces are already securely in the red-alert zone, above 50 per cent virus occupancy, with Lombardy at 75 per cent, Piedmont at 92 per cent and South Tyrol at an astonishing 99 per cent.Lombardy, Italy’s most populous and productive region, is again the epicenter of Italy’s pandemic.The region’s hospitals are responding by reorganizing wards in a bid to avoid shutting down ordinary care, as happened spontaneously during Italy’s first deadly coronavirus spike. Still, hospitals in Lombardy and neighbouring Piedmont — designated red zones by the government last week — have closed surgical, pediatric, and geriatric wards to make room for Covid patients. Veneto, still a lowest-tier yellow zone, is preparing to cancel all non-urgent procedures this week.“We must continue to offer at least a minimum of services to all the other pathologies,” Cabrini said. “If we close our emergency room, it means a population of 1 million people will be without urgent care. We cannot let that happen.”Doctors regret that a tougher line wasn’t held this summer, when infections dropped. Instead of consolidating the gains, Italians headed to the beaches, setting the stage for the fall surge. Restrictions like curfews “could have been enacted earlier to try to stem the expansion of the pandemic,” said Filippo Anelli, head of the Italian Doctors’ Federation. But the government waited until the upward curve was irrefutable.The situation has been complicated by the fact that the partial lockdown imposed on five Italian regions allows for more freedoms than during Italy’s near-total 10-week lockdown in March and April. As a result, ordinary maladies and traumas continue to fill emergency rooms, even as the government acknowledged recently that it has lost count of coronavirus outbreaks and is not able to trace the chains of transmission.The average age of coronavirus patients being hospitalized in Italy has gone down this fall, even if the most severe cases winding up in ICU wards are still among the elderly. At the same time, the average hospital stay has lengthened. Dr. Massimo Puoti, head of infectious disease at Milan’s Niguarda hospital, said that was partly due to delays in getting access to tests and a days-long wait for test results, meaning patients often were admitted at a more advanced stage of infection.Nationwide, virus hospitalizations rose 68 per cent from Oct. 19-25, a whopping total of 12,006 admissions over seven days, just as the Italian government moved to close restaurants and bars at 6 p.m., and completely shutter theaters, gyms, and swimming pools.Hospitals are now struggling to find enough trained specialists, especially anesthesiologists for critical care units, and other medical personnel to cover for doctors and nurses under quarantine after falling ill or being exposed.Health officials are especially concerned because the virus is no longer contained to northern Italy but is spreading to the south, with its more fragile health care system. And Italy’s new epicenter, spanning from Varese to Milan, finds itself again getting walloped by the pandemic this fall after only the briefest of respites this summer.“Imagine a narrow and high tsunami that dramatically fractured, as if during a war, the health resources in these provinces,’’ Dr. Puoti said, describing the deadly coronavirus peak that wreaked havoc on Italy’s Bergamo, Cremona and Lodi provinces in March and April.“Now what we are experiencing is a wave that is a little different. A little less tall and more wide, with volumes that risk being even higher than we had in March,” he said.To take pressure off Milan’s main hospital, Niguarda has taken over a module at a field hospital in the city’s old convention center that reopened in late October.Varese’s Circolo Hospital has already distributed less critical patients to two smaller hospitals in the same district — something that wasn’t necessary in the first outbreak — and Dr. Cabrini has appealed to regional authorities to find beds elsewhere so non-virus patients can continue to receive treatment.“There are still people who don’t believe that the second wave has arrived,” Dr. Cabrini said. “But I see the river of people who are arriving in the emergency room. If we don’t turn this around, and if people cannot get treated not only in Varese, but in Turin and Milan, then our backs are to the wall.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-hospitals-face-breaking-point-in-fall-coronavirus-surge/story-LzAN8qEpeDi6YldaZVctBM.html
12-11-2020||World||Dozens of fake Bolsonaros are running in Brazilian elections||Running for office in Brazil’s municipal elections this weekend are, in no particular order, Adilson Bolsonaro, Aldo Bolsonaro, Angela Bolsonaro, Fernanda Bolsonaro, Zezinho Bolsonaro, Junior Bolsonaro, Maclaiten Bolsonaro, Cabo Ramos Bolsonaro, and Wesley Bolsonaro.None of them are related to the Bolsonaro, the president, Jair, and in fact none of them are actually even named Bolsonaro. But in a sign of just how wildly popular his Trump-ian brand of conservative politics is in many parts of the Brazilian hinterland, scores of candidates are tacking Bolsonaro onto their registered names appearing on ballots this Sunday. In all, more than 70 politicians have adopted it.“His popularity is growing every day,” said Jair Sousa Silva, a former evangelical pastor who’s running under the name Jair Bolsonaro for a city council seat in a town in the Amazon. “When I’m asking for votes from my brothers of faith, I’m known as Brother Jair, Pastor Jair, and also Jair Bolsonaro.”The real Jair Bolsonaro is polling better nationally than he ever has before. Yes, his detractors blame him for bungling the medical response to the pandemic, which has claimed more than 160,000 lives, but his administration’s decision to fork over large Covid relief checks to one third of Brazilians has cut into poverty and shored up his support. Sunday’s elections, with all the Bolsonaros and Bolsonaro allies on ballots across the country, will serve as something of a referendum on the president two years before he faces re-election.There’s nothing illegal about borrowing a celebrity’s name to create a political nickname in Brazil. There’s a long tradition of it here, a country where politics often have a certain zany flair to them. Lula -- as the leftist leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was known to everyone, was a popular one years ago, and to this day appears on a smattering of ballots across the country.Even as the government phases out the emergency payments that have boosted Bolsonaro’s popularity this year, many candidates are still trying tag along after the president. Most of them are disputing elections in smaller cities where government financial help has played an outsize role in the economic recovery.The few exceptions are family members who are running in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, including Carlos Bolsonaro, the president’s son who seeks re-election as a Rio councilman.“Bolsonaro’s name is very powerful here, I really believe it will help me get elected,” Joao Claudio “Bolsonaro” Tozzi said in an interview. A construction worker, he is running for the city council of Goioere, a small town in the southern state of Parana which gave the president more than 68 per cent of votes in 2018.In daily live transmissions this week, Bolsonaro has been endorsing some of those candidates, but it’s unclear whether his support will make a meaningful difference or not. While there are few electoral surveys for city counselors, candidates for mayor who have received the president’s explicit support are trailing in opinion polls. Among them are Rio de Janeiro Mayor Marcelo Crivella, running for re-election, and Celso Russomanno, who’s trying to unseat current Sao Paulo Mayor Bruno Covas.‘Ronald Trump’Brazil’s electoral legislation allows candidates to pick a nickname by which they’re widely known. The process is rather subjective, however, making room for unusual ballot names including “Ronald Trump” or “Donald Trump Bolsonaro”, two real candidates this year.“In theory, the electoral court could demand proof of those claims, but as no one disputes them, those types of nicknames are validated,” said Henrique Neves, a former judge with Brazil’s top electoral court.Brazil’s fragmented political system with about 40 different parties, many of them regularly rebranding themselves, also puts emphasis on strong individual contenders or celebrity candidates. Bolsonaro himself got elected by the Social Liberal Party, ditched it months after taking office, and has so far failed to created his own party, the so-called Alliance for Brazil.With his popularity being tested during the municipal elections, the president has said he doesn’t care if someone uses his name in the ballots.“There are more than 550,000 candidates around the country; It’s impossible to keep tabs,” Bolsonaro recently told supporters in front of his official residence. “Some of them are hoping to win votes with my name and that’s OK.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-fake-bolsonaros-are-running-in-brazilian-elections/story-PJybBCsifi0M206m0GiCuN.html
12-11-2020||World||Pakistan’s air force film, featuring a dogfight in ‘eastern sector’, premieres in China||A Pakistani movie showing the JF-17 fighter aircraft jointly developed with China and referencing a dogfight with Mirage-2000s flown by the Indian air force premiered in Beijing on Wednesday.The first Pakistani film to be released in China in decades, Parwaaz Hai Junoon (The Soaring Ambition) will be released in theatres on November 13.Its release comes in the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan in May 1951.China’s official media noted a comparison made in the 2018 movie between the JF-17 – a fourth generation fighter aircraft jointly developed between China and Pakistan – and the French-made Mirage-2000, deployed by the Indian Air Force and used during the Kargil war in 1999.A dogfight early in the movie shows Pakistani air force fighting three Mirage-2000s, which had flown in from the eastern sector.Later in the movie, Pakistani fighter pilots are also shown carrying out strikes against the Taliban.“In one of the film’s highlights a JF-17, a fourth-generation fighter jointly developed by China and Pakistan, makes a surprise appearance,” the nationalistic tabloid Global Times said in a report on the movie premier.“In the movie, a teacher at the air force academy asks students to compare the JF-17 with Mirage 2000 in class. A student answers that the JF-17 has three advantages including flexibility and safety and is complimented by the teacher,” the report said.The movie’s release comes in the backdrop of worsening Sino-India ties amid the ongoing border friction in eastern Ladakh.Chinese official media has hailed the release as a sign of close ties between China and Pakistan.Pakistani ambassador to China Moin ul Haque, who attended the premiere, was quoted as saying that more Pakistani films and TV dramas will be released here to help Chinese people better understand Pakistani culture and strengthen the two countries’ friendship.The agreement to bring the film to the mainland was signed in April 2019 at a China-Pakistan economic and trade cooperation forum during the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.Chinese state media reports highlighted that The Soaring Ambition will be the first Pakistani movie to be released in China in several decades.Bollywood-made Hindi movies, despite strained Sino-India ties, have an audience in China.The Aamir Khan-starrer Dangal, for example, was an unexpected hit in China in 2017, making more than $200 million and becoming the highest-grossing non-English movie here.A handful of low-budget China-Pakistan film collaborations are underway, the entertainment portal, Variety.com, reported in October.The report said that The Journey, announced at a Shanghai Cooperation Organistion (SCO) Film Festival at a ceremony with actor Jackie Chan in attendance, tells the stories of real-life Chinese businesses participating in international trade with Pakistan through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor – part of the Belt and Road Initiative - Beijing’s multi-billion dollar package of infrastructure projects in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-air-force-film-featuring-a-dogfight-in-eastern-sector-premiers-in-china/story-kY4d1OaNUY8BDhYTSEIv8L.html
12-11-2020||World||WhatsApp under scrutiny as Germany probes messaging apps||Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp and other messaging services will be investigated by German regulators, who will check how they handle users’ personal information and whether being able to send messages between different providers could boost privacy.Germany’s Federal Cartel Office said on Thursday it opened a sector inquiry into messenger services, citing possible violations of consumer protection law. It said the probe may also help regulators “gain insight” into whether enabling apps to send messages to each other could prompt users to choose services that do more to protect privacy.“It is questionable whether and to what extent these services protect personal data,” Andreas Mundt, the regulator’s president, said in the statement. The probe will “also examine whether and to what extent improved interoperability could play a role in, for example, the consumers’ choice of suppliers which offer better data protection.”WhatsApp is the most used messaging app for Germans using Android devices with more than 7 million daily users, according to Statista. Facebook’s Messenger follows with 2.8 milion daily users and Microsoft Corp.’s Skype has some 1.8 million daily users.Facebook declined to immediately comment on the investigation.WhatsApp only shares limited information with Facebook companies to help identify users and doesn’t share data that would aid ad targeting on Facebook. The company said it will only share such data if it has approval from Irish privacy regulators, who govern Facebook’s business in Europe.Facebook was last a target of the Federal Cartel Office over an antitrust investigation that focused on how the social network tracks users’ web use. Facebook earlier this year lost a court challenge to the 2019 ruling that ordered it to stop freely collecting and using data and combining it with users’ Facebook accounts without their consent.The authority broke new ground by using antitrust law to tackle data privacy. It has no power under consumer law to order a company to stop certain behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whatsapp-under-scrutiny-as-germany-probes-messaging-apps/story-XtOZbPFxCa9MKWJVLJ2UgP.html
12-11-2020||World||Xi Jinping challenges Joe Biden with move to snuff out Hong Kong dissent||President Xi Jinping effectively neutered the most democratic institution under China’s rule, sending a message to Joe Biden that no amount of pressure will prompt him to tolerate dissent against the Communist Party.China’s top legislative body on Wednesday passed a resolution allowing for the disqualification of any Hong Kong lawmakers who aren’t deemed sufficiently loyal. Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s government immediately banished four legislators, prompting the remaining 15 in the 70-seat Legislative Council to resign en masse.“This move makes it clear that dictatorship has descended onto Hong Kong and that Chinese Communist Party can eradicate all opposing voices in the legislature,” Fernando Cheung, one of the lawmakers, told Bloomberg News. “There’s no more separation of powers, no more ‘one country, two systems,’ and therefore no more Hong Kong as we know it.”The resolution is the latest sign of China’s determination to rein in dissent in the wake of anti-government protests last year calling for meaningful elections in the semi-autonomous territory. Beijing has since passed a series of measures asserting greater control over Hong Kong, first targeting democracy activists who hit the streets and now going after dissenters in democratic institutions set up under British colonial rule.Lawmakers began tendering their resignations on Thursday, according to Radio Television Hong Kong. Claudia Mo, a prominent pro-democratic voice during last summer’s protests, showed up to resign wearing a black t-shirt -- a garment favored by demonstrators -- and carrying a yellow umbrella, which became the symbol of Occupy protests in 2014.China has already shown disdain for the Legislative Council, bypassing it in June to impose sweeping national security legislation that undercut the “one country, two systems” framework that had long attracted investors to the financial hub. The Group of Seven nations accused China of violating the terms of its handover agreement with the UK, while the Trump administration revoked many special privileges granted to the city and sanctioned more than a dozen senior officials who oversee the territory.Beijing’s latest move was not met by any street protests, which have mostly dissipated amid pandemic-era social distancing restrictions and the enactment of the national security law.Biden’s win presents an opportunity to reset relations between the world’s two biggest economies, even though the former vice president called Xi a “thug” on the campaign trail and has vowed to “fully enforce” laws punishing Beijing for eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy. Yet China’s move on Wednesday doesn’t leave him many options for a detente, particularly given how the city has long sat at the crossroads of Western democracy and Communist rule.Western governments including the UK and Australia condemned China’s move while US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien warned of new sanctions in a statement Wednesday evening. China’s powerful Liaison Office in Hong Kong, however, released a statement saying the opposition’s resignation wouldn’t change the government’s mind.China on Thursday called foreign governments’ criticism “wanton accusations” and said it was normal for public servants to pledge allegiance in other countries.The NPC’s move “is conducive to safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests and Hong Hong’s long-term stability, security and prosperity,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing, saying Beijing firmly supported Hong Kong authorities.A ‘Sad Day’“With this decision, China shows that it doesn’t care about the West, about the U.S.,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University’s government and international studies department, who has written several books on Chinese politics and foreign policy. “It’s going to be very hard for Biden to relax the U.S. policy on China and Hong Kong. How can you relax the sanctions? It’s a very sad day for Hong Kong.”The decision of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee is “conducive to the long-term peace and stability, as well as prosperity and development of Hong Kong,” Chairman Li Zhanshu said at the close of its two-day meeting. Offenses included supporting Hong Kong independence, refusing to recognize China’s sovereignty over the city, asking foreign countries to intervene, failing to uphold the territory’s Basic Law or pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and “engaging in any other acts that endanger national security,” said Lam, Hong Kong’s leader.“We need to have a political body that’s composed of patriots,” Lam said at a briefing on Wednesday, echoing similar statements from China’s top agencies overseeing Hong Kong. She dismissed concerns that Hong Kong would have a “rubber-stamp” legislature if the pro-democracy members resigned, saying she welcomes “diverse opinion.”The lawmakers disqualified Wednesday -- Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung -- were among the body’s more moderate members, and not known proponents of independence. They were among 12 candidates barred in July from seeking election for, among other things, vowing to “indiscriminately” vote down legislative proposals, a reference to the opposition’s plan to exercise a constitutional provision that would force Lam to resign if her budget failed to pass.Pressed on whether she was seeking to ban parliamentary delay tactics common to legislatures around the world, Lam said “it’s all a matter of degree” and pledged to “respect the check-and-balance responsibility” of the body.“They want to turn the Legislative Council into the National People’s Congress,” pro-democracy lawmaker James To said as the opposition vowed to resign at an evening briefing on Wednesday. Lawmakers held hands and chanted protest slogans, including “Hong Kong, add oil -- Together we stand.”Prior to the decision, the Hong Kong government had postponed an election for the Legislative Council for a year citing coronavirus concerns. The decision on Wednesday means that authorities will now be able to effectively oust any lawmakers who stand in the way of Beijing’s agenda, according to Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and author of “City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong.”“It means, effectively, the end of meaningful opposition in Hong Kong and the acceleration of the integration of Hong Kong into the mainland party-state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-challenges-joe-biden-with-move-to-snuff-out-hong-kong-dissent/story-VcKvllFNhu7vxM9FGuxDmM.html
12-11-2020||World||Taiwan reaches out to Joe Biden in hope of repeating 2016 Trump call||Taiwan is hoping to repeat a convention-breaking telephone call with the incoming US president, in defiance of warnings from China.Taiwan’s government is in discussions over arranging a phone call between President Tsai Ing-wen and Joe Biden, foreign minister Joseph Wu told lawmakers in Taipei on Thursday.“On the topic of congratulating the U.S. president-elect, we will do it in the most appropriate way,” Wu said. “We are communicating about this. We are considering various ways, including a phone call, to congratulate the new president.”Four years ago, Donald Trump took a congratulatory call from Tsai, the first time a US president-elect had spoken to a Taiwanese head of state since Washington broke ties with Taipei in 1979. The Communist government in Beijing, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory despite never having controlled the island, dismissed the call as a gimmick.Asked by lawmakers if a Biden refusal to take Tsai’s call would represent a diplomatic setback for Taiwan, Wu said any call would have no bearing on the health of ties with the US.Tsai was among the first to congratulate Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on their election victory, saying in a tweet that she looked forward to working together to further strengthen US-Taiwan relations and contributions to international society.Biden’s acceptance or refusal of a phone call with Tsai will go a long way to clarifying whether he plans to continue the Trump administration’s tough stance on China -- or show greater deference to Chinese sensitivities, especially in his dealings with Taipei. While Biden offered to deepen ties with Taiwan in an op-ed in the largest US-based Chinese-language newspaper last month, he has stopped short of offering specifics on which parts of Trump-era China policies he would change.Biden spoke to the leaders of Japan and South Korea on Thursday, reassuring them of his commitment to maintaining security alliances with both countries. While the US doesn’t formally recognize Taiwan as a country, Washington is the democratic island’s main security backstop against Beijing’s ongoing threats of invasion.The Trump administration last week agreed to sell Taiwan four Reaper drones, the latest in almost $5 billion of military sales announced over the past few weeks designed to make Chinese strategists think twice about attempting to capture the island. The sales come as China’s air force continues to pile pressure on Taiwan, with regular sojourns into the island’s Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-reaches-out-to-joe-biden-in-hope-of-repeating-2016-trump-call/story-fnlZAv4L6p02sZ03PUt4zJ.html
12-11-2020||World||US witnessing the longest Covid-19 upsurge and why it will go longer||The United States has been reporting record high coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic, but this time the wave is stronger and longer than what the US witnessed in march-April or in June-July.The trajectory of Covid-19, as experts have projected, will continue moving higher with the onset of winter. Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19As per the Johns Hopkins University data, the US recorded 135,290 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, resulting in a hike in seven-day average to a record 123,448 cases. The average deaths reported in the country has also gone above the seven-day average of 1,000 since August 20 for the first time. The upsurge in the Covid-19 cases in the US began in mid-September and is now running in its ninth week, a wave longer than that of tragical March-April and hard June-July. The situation has been aggravated by pandemic fatigue as Americans are making less effort now to follow social distancing rules. The third wave that began from a higher base of cases has also led to an overwhelming amount of hospitalisations. The rise in Covid-19 related hospitalisations started more than seven weeks ago, which has been the longest in the country uptil now.On Tuesday, states like South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Nebraska and Illinois recorded the highest current hospitalisation per capita. Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico and Colorado reported single-day record cases.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-witnessing-the-longest-covid-19-upsurge-and-why-it-will-go-longer/story-InbvtgxC8C9Vzzh6Gg36AI.html
12-11-2020||World||Study shows why masks with exhalation valves do not slow Covid-19 spread||Scientists have used high-speed videos of air flow to show why masks with exhalation valves do not slow the spread of Covid-19. The researchers from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US created the videos which show airflow patterns through masks with and without exhalation valves.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 “When you compare the videos side by side, the difference is striking,” said NIST research engineer Matthew Staymates, corresponding author of the study published in the journal Physics of Fluids. “These videos show how the valves allow air to leave the mask without filtering it, which defeats the purpose of the mask,” Staymates said. Exhalation valves, which make masks easier to breathe through and more comfortable, are appropriate when the mask is meant to protect the wearer, the researchers said. For instance, valved masks can protect workers from dust at a construction site or hospital workers from infected patients, they said. Staymates created two videos using different flow visualisation techniques. The first video was created using what is known as a schlieren imaging system, which causes differences in air density to show up on camera as patterns of shadow and light. With this system, exhaled breath becomes visible because it is warmer, and therefore less dense, than the surrounding air. Staymates created the second video using a light-scattering technique.Also Read |  Zydus Cadila completes phase 2 clinical trial in Covid-19 patients with Hepatitis C biological therapy PegiHep He built an apparatus that emits air at the same velocity and tempo as a resting adult, then connected that device to a mannequin. As a stand-in for exhaled droplets, the air carries water droplets in a range of sizes typical of the droplets that people emit in their breath when exhaling, speaking and coughing. A high-intensity LED light behind the mannequin illuminates the airborne droplets, causing them to scatter the light and show up brightly on camera. In contrast to the schlieren video, this video shows the movement of droplets in air. The droplets escape unfiltered through the valve of an N95 mask. The use of a mannequin and a mechanical breathing apparatus allowed Staymates to observe airflow patterns while holding steady the breathing rate, air pressure and other variables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-shows-why-masks-with-exhalation-valves-do-not-slow-covid-19-spread/story-IjdVFZGBm1W34Ntl49ZDlJ.html

His crime under Pakistani law? To call himself an Ahmadi Muslim, whose creed is ‘love for all, hatred for none’. Does my right honourable friend agree with me that hatred preached in Pakistan ends up on the streets, and it is in the interest of our own security that His Majesty’s government should make clear to Pakistan that state-supported persecution must end?” asked Ahmad Khan.Pakistan has been slammed for its treatment of minorities, who continue to face persecution in the hands of government authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-urges-pakistan-to-assure-fundamental-rights-of-citizens/story-wZCbX7KTxgD7nyikzYze8O.html

12-11-2020||World||Study reveals smell, taste changes act as early indicators of Covid-19 community spread||Self-reports of smell and taste changes can be earlier markers of the spread of the novel coronavirus than indicators based on hospital emergency room (ER) consultations, according to an international team of researchers.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 The team’s study, published in the journal Nature Communications, noted a decline in self-reports of smell and taste changes as early as five days after lockdown enforcement, with faster declines reported in countries that adopted the most stringent lockdown measures. “In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, many governments have taken drastic measures to prevent their intensive care units from becoming overwhelmed with patients,” said study co-author John Hayes, professor of food science at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in the US. “Our research suggests that an increase in the incidence of sudden smell and taste change in the general population may indicate that Covid-19 is spreading,” Hayes said. The researchers believe the findings could help decision-makers take important measures at the local level, either in catching new outbreaks sooner, or in guiding the relaxation of local lockdowns, given the strong impact of lockdown on economic and social activities.Also Read |  ‘Lockdown’ is Collins Word of the Year 2020 In the study, the scientists used data from the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research survey -- a global, crowd-sourced online study deployed in more than 35 languages. The team also particularly assessed data from the French government -- which beginning on May 7, 2020, has been categorising various geographical areas of the country as red or green, depending on their Covid-19 prevalence. Compared to green areas, they said the red areas were characterised by higher active circulation of the virus, higher levels of pressure on hospitals and reduced capacity to test new cases. The researchers then compared data from France with data from Italy and the UK, each of which implemented lockdown measures at different times and with different levels of stringency. “Our primary aim was to test the association between self-reported smell and taste changes and indicators of pressure in hospitals, such as Covid-related hospitalisations, critical care resuscitation unit admissions and mortality rates, for each French administrative region over the last three months,” said Veronica Pereda-Loth, a study co-author from the Universite Paul Sabatier Toulouse III in France. “Our secondary aim was to examine temporal relationships between the peak of smell and taste changes in the population and the peak of Covid-19 cases and the application of lockdown measures,” Pereda-Loth said.Also Read | Serum Institute completes phase 3 trial recruitment for Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine The study found that smell and taste changes were better correlated with the number of Covid-19 admissions to hospitals than France’s current governmental indicators, which look at the ratio of ER consultations for suspicion of Covid-19 to general ER consultations. According to the scientists, the peak onset of changes in smell/taste appeared four days after lockdown measures were implemented. In contrast, they said the governmental indicator based on ER consultations peaked 11 days after the lockdown. “Our findings are consistent with emerging data showing that Covid-19-related changes in smell and taste occur in the first few days after infection,” Hayes said. “They suggest that self-reports of smell and taste changes are closely associated with hospital overload and are early markers of the spread of infection of SARS-CoV-2,” he added. The scientists believe potential outbreaks and the short-term efficacy of a lockdown could be monitored by tracking changes in smell and taste in the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-reveals-smell-taste-changes-act-as-early-indicators-of-covid-19-community-spread/story-kZbKn0x8DXa5joxQEiaHAJ.html

The local government has already asked bars and other establishments to close early in the regional capital’s nightlife district.On Wednesday, Japan reported at least 1,546 new cases, nearing the high in August. Shares of Japanese stay-at-home stocks rose in Tokyo, with videogame and e-commerce stocks gaining while railways declined.‘Large Increase’Parts of the country where the weather remains relatively mild are already seeing upticks. The capital of Tokyo reported the largest figure in nearly three months on Wednesday, while Osaka reached a fresh high.“This could be the beginning of a sharp increase in infections,” said Norio Ohmagari, an infectious disease specialist advising Tokyo authorities, at a local government meeting. “We need to be on alert.”Japan has drawn attention from other nations for its ability to control the spread of the virus without mass-testing or enforced lockdowns. Despite two previous flareups, deaths and serious cases remain low, and hospitals haven’t been pushed to capacity. Life had been returning to normal, with sporting matches resuming, workers returning to offices and a successful campaign encouraging domestic travel.But in recent weeks, officials have expressed concern over the increasing variance of infection clusters, with cases rising in nursing homes, hospitals and schools.

The amount includes sales made on November 11 – called Singles Day in China – and during a three-day period between November 1 and 3.Along with JD.com, Alibaba racked up around $115bn in sales across their platforms during the Singles Day shopping event.Official media reported that e-commerce giant JD.com also scored big in the period, with sales topping 243.1bn yuan ($35.76bn) between November 1 and November 11 afternoon.This year’s event comes in the backdrop of the recovering Chinese economy, which had taken a battering because of the Coronavirus pandemic followed by the worst floods in decades.China seems to have broadly controlled the pandemic despite sporadic cases of small Covid-19 clusters that have broken out in cities like Urumqi and Qingdao.State media reported that the massive sales on Singles Day indicate a fast recovering economy.“At the shopping peak, 583,000 orders were made in a single second on Tmall, setting a new online shopping record,” official news agency, Xinhua reported late on Wednesday.More than 800 million shoppers, 250,000 brands and 5 million merchants participated in this year’s shopping spree, according to a statement by Tmall, Alibaba’s international e-commerce arm.“Notably, sales of JD’s fast-delivery grocery business soared a staggering 50-fold compared with the same period last year, while its sales of 5G smartphones spiked 11 folds,” the Xinhua report said.Sales of imported products for new mothers and babies on JD doubled year on year and mobile phones offering optimal gaming experience grew by 160%.“We have found that an increasing number of overseas brands chose to enter the Chinese market by opening their first store on Tmall Global,” said Liu Peng, president of Tmall Import and Export.Expecting a soaring demand for foreign goods, Tmall Global imported a huge variety of products from over 100 overseas farms, ranches, and wineries, including 1,000 tonnes of milk from Uruguay, 2.6 million bottles of French wine, and 2 tonnes of cubilose from Malaysia.About 25,000 overseas businesses from more than 220 countries and regions have participated in this year’s shopping spree on Tmall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-singles-day-online-sales-touches-record-high/story-capyqbfCiUFyUefSFfI9zJ.html
12-11-2020||World||Erdogan’s economy U-turn sparks market euphoria, some doubts||After more than two years of confrontation, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signaled a cease-fire with international investors, pledging to support his new economic managers with market-friendly policies.Erdogan on Wednesday followed the ouster of the central bank chief and the departure of his son-in-law as economy czar in recent days with a commitment to contain inflation while putting Turkey on a sustainable growth path. Turkish assets soared, as investors saw a possible green light for interest-rate increases to stabilize a currency that has lost almost half its value against the dollar since May 2018.“Evidence has been rapidly accumulating that Turkey is eager to execute a dramatic shift in policy making back toward a more orthodox framework,” said Phoenix Kalen, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. “We believe that the central bank will implement a substantial interest-rate hike” next week, possibly as much as 4 percentage points to 14.25%.The currency gained 4.6% against the dollar on Wednesday. It’s headed for its biggest weekly gain in more than a decade even after retreating 0.6% on Thursday. The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index extended its winning streak to a ninth day, led by a surge in banking shares, which helped push Turkey’s benchmark gauge to an all-time high.Erdogan’s remarks mark a dramatic U-turn from an approach that has hammered Turkish markets the past two years. Shortly before he was sworn in under a new constitution with near-total authority in 2018, Erdogan promised to take full control of monetary policy to implement his unorthodox view that lower interest rates promote slower inflation.It didn’t work out, especially under the weight of the global recession spawned by the coronavirus pandemic.Currency InterventionsTo support the sinking lira, Turkish banks sold more than $100 billion this year alone, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. The effort saw net foreign-exchange reserves fall by more than half to $18.4 billion while money borrowed from banks under short-term swaps reached tens of billions of dollars. The lira touched consecutive record lows last week, extending 2020 losses to over 30%.The remarks by the 66-year-old president who has led the country since 2003 reflected those pressures. “Like everywhere else around the world, in our country it is the central bank’s job to determine and implement policies needed to curb inflation,” he told lawmakers from his AK Party.Erdogan’s comments capped a tumultuous stretch that began when he ousted central bank Governor Murat Uysal early Saturday after a series of interest-rate increases failed to stem the lira’s decline. On Sunday evening, Berat Albayrak announced his resignation as treasury and finance minister on Instagram, citing health reasons.Still, there were doubts about Erdogan’s change of heart and how long it will take before his electoral priorities might cause yet another policy reversal.“Can a leopard really change its spots?” said Nigel Rendell, a senior analyst at Medley Global Advisors. “There will be a significant degree of skepticism about what Erdogan has said, which will temper some enthusiasm.”Market ConfrontationErdogan’s battle with markets began in earnest in 2018, a year when he was sworn in with additional powers and appointed Albayrak to the top economy position. The appointment was soon followed by a diplomatic row with U.S. over accusations against an American pastorin Turkey. The president blamed a shadowy “interest-rate lobby” for speculative attacks against the currency as the lira plunged.Erdogan wasn’t completely unaware of the transactions involving Turkey’s foreign reserves, but the crunch came after he sought an explanation from the central bank for its September decision to raise the benchmark one-week repo rate to 10.25%, according to officials familiar with the matter.Ensuing conversations with former Governor Uysal and other top officials including Agbal allowed Erdogan to get a fuller picture of the FX liabilities and how they compared to net reserves, they said, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.Litmus TestThe president’s support is critical for new central bank Governor Naci Agbal, who will face a credibility test at his first Monetary Policy Committee meeting on Nov. 19, and new Treasury and Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan. With Erdogan saying he won’t interfere, optimism has grown that Turkey will allow interest rates to rise to offer a sufficient inflation-adjusted return.Agbal has begun meeting top banking executives to tell them he was appointed with a mandate to lower the inflation rate, which is just under 12%, people familiar with the meetings said, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.Even before Erdogan’s speech, Agbal and Elvan have been doing the rounds to convey market-friendly messages to Turkish businesses while they prepare for the rates decision.To be sure, Erdogan’s career saw previous attempts to appease investors, which proved short-lived. Even in Wednesday’s speech, he repeated his widely discredited view that lowering interest rates will also lead to lower inflation.“Erdogan’s priority is to consolidate support and maintain the popularity of his party,” Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist at the Economic Policy Research Foundation in Ankara, said by phone on Wednesday. “He is a pragmatic leader and the economy management appointed by the president are unlikely to act independently. His arguments are aimed at preventing the economy, which is badly hurt by the pandemic, from deteriorating further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-s-economy-u-turn-sparks-market-euphoria-some-doubts/story-rbYBxLzjn0VuU0WgM6oT8J.html
12-11-2020||World||Turkey reaffirms Russian-made defense system plans despite US objections||ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey’s defense minister has reaffirmed the country’s plans to use a Russian-made missile defense system it purchased despite continued objections from the United States.Defense Minister Hulusi Akar told a parliamentary budget commission Thursday the military is continuing its checks and preparations of the S-400s as planned.Washington is strongly against NATO member Turkey’s acquisition of the Russian anti-aircraft system and kicked Turkey out of its F-35 fighter jet program, saying the S-400s are a threat to the stealth fighter jets and wouldn’t be interoperable with NATO systems.Akar said Turkey is prepared to discuss with the US its “anxiety” over the interoperability of the S-400s and the F-35s. “Our offer for a joint working group is still on the table,” he said, in comments carried by the official Anadolu news agency.Turkey was making components for the F-35 and had planned to purchase 100 of the stealth fighters.Also Read: Putin brokers deal to end Karabakh war, brings Turkey into Russian CaucasusThe US has also warned Ankara that it risks US sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act if the S-400 system is activated. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to take a tougher stance on the issue.Turkey tested the missile defense system in October for the first time. The US Department of Defense condemned the test “in the strongest possible terms.”Ankara argues it was forced to buy the Russian system because the US refused to sell the American-made Patriot system. The Turkish government also points to what it considers a double standard, as NATO member Greece uses Russian-made missiles.“We will use the S-400 system in the same way that other NATO member states with existing S-300 systems use them within the NATO alliance,” the defense minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-reaffirms-russian-made-defense-system-plans-despite-us-objections/story-wP3ItobFNIRoiB1qyyYexK.html
12-11-2020||World||Joe Biden’s path back to the Iran Nuclear Deal won’t be easy or fast||America’s European allies have struggled to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive after President Donald Trump quit the accord more than two years ago. Joe Biden’s election victory won’t provide a quick resuscitation.Biden said during the presidential campaign that Trump’s Iran policy weakened US national security and left Tehran closer than ever to being able to build a nuclear bomb. He vowed to get on the phone with allies on “day one” to begin rebuilding strained ties and said he’d give Iran a “credible path back to diplomacy.”But Iran’s mid-2021 presidential election, as well as likely continued Republican control of the US Senate, will put the brakes on quick, substantive action, according to US and Iranian diplomats and analysts. In addition, Biden has signalled that his priorities starting January 20 will be on the economy and getting the coronavirus pandemic under control.“I am not optimistic at all that in the short term anything significant will happen between Iran and the Americans,” Saeed Laylaz, an economist and former adviser to ex-President Mohammad Khatami, said in an interview. “It’s not impossible, but it will be extremely difficult.”Nuclear watchdogs and security analysts aren’t the only ones focused on what Biden could accomplish: Oil markets are betting on some easing of tensions by summer 2021 that will free the way for Iranian crude to return to global markets by year-end, Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Advisors, said on Bloomberg TV last week.Also Read: Biden will prioritise defence and security partnership with India, says Obama-era officialOn Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani -- who leaves office next year after staking his political legacy and reputation on the nuclear accord reached during the Obama administration -- referred to Biden as “the new man who’s arrived” and had campaigned on returning to the accord. “If they stick to their responsibilities they can choose the new path,” he said.But uncertainty about Rouhani’s successor, and the potential that elections could lead to a much harder-line government, will probably temper Biden’s enthusiasm to get something done quickly.In addition, while presidents generally have some leeway on foreign policy, a Senate under Republican control would mean lawmakers would demand assurances on Biden’s Iran policy before they confirm his nominees, said Richard Goldberg, a former National Security Council official under Trump.“Any effort to rejoin the Iran deal and build on it will be intensely scrutinized in Congress and among domestic critics,” said Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East Fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund.If Biden pursues a rally-the-allies approach to Iran, that will likely include close consultations with everyone from Israel to the U.A.E., which aren’t likely to be as accommodating as European partners.Pressuring Biden to take the first step may be tough after the Trump administration spent four years highlighting the threat from Iran, which the U.S. sees as sowing turmoil across the Mideast and accused of hacking American voter data before the election.Iran’s actions since the US quit the 2015 nuclear deal -- including its decision to ramp up uranium enrichment -- have in some ways bolstered the Trump administration’s arguments.The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday that Iran’s uranium stockpiles have grown eightfold since the US quit the deal, and it now has enough supply to create three bombs if it enriches the material to weapons grade. Iran says its moves are reversible if the US returns to the accord, and it has continued to host IAEA inspectors and meet the other requirements of the nuclear deal.IIran has signalled its requirements for reviving the multinational deal.Its negotiators would want to see an authentic effort by Biden to not only scrap Trump’s approach but show that the US had a long-term commitment to the accord, said a source close to official foreign policy circles in Tehran who didn’t want to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.An Iranian official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Biden would have to return to the nuclear accord without condition, compensation to Iran would have to be on the table and the US would have to guarantee that it won’t invoke a “snapback” of United Nations sanctions as the Trump administration has tried to do.Biden could take some smaller moves that would reduce the pressure on Tehran without committing the US to a full-fledged detente. He could, for instance, ease the transfer of humanitarian aid to Iran, especially as the coronavirus batters the country’s health-care system, said Naysan Rafati, the International Crisis Group’s Iran analyst.The US can also try to help Iran gain access to a long-sought loan from the International Monetary Fund, he added. But even that would engender heavy scrutiny by Republicans, who are wary of providing funding to a government long listed by the US as a state sponsor of terrorism.That’s especially true now that the first of the accord’s “sunset” provisions, which expire at fixed dates, has already passed. An international ban on Iranian arms purchases lapsed in October and other restrictions built into the accord expire in less than five years.The short time horizon of the 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers prompted Biden to say he wants to expand on the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.Iranian officials, while broadly welcoming Trump’s defeat, have repeatedly said that the original terms of the deal can’t be renegotiated.“I don’t see Iran being willing to walk that path,” said Adnan Tabatabai, co-founder and chief executive officer of the Bonn-based Center for Applied Research in Partnership with the Orient, adding that Iran would be “allergic” to any mention of a “JCPOA-Plus”.A final hurdle could still come from Trump, as his team works to restrict options for the incoming administration. The administration has been working to create a layer of hard-to-reverse sanctions that could initially hobble Biden’s efforts.“The Trump administration’s approach now is to add more and more threads to this spider web and hope the next guy has a hard time washing them away,” said Rafati, the International Crisis Group’s Iran analyst. “There’s very little in here that’s totally irreversible. But these are harder to undo because you have to make the case that terrorism is no longer a concern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-path-back-to-the-iran-nuclear-deal-won-t-be-easy-or-fast/story-oLlZycXDylzgyjklHfwyhN.html
12-11-2020||World||With few legal wins Trump team hunts for proof of fraud||During a Pennsylvania court hearing this week on one of the many election lawsuits brought by President Donald Trump, a judge asked a campaign lawyer whether he had found any signs of fraud from among the 592 ballots challenged.The answer was no.“Accusing people of fraud is a pretty big step,” said the lawyer, Jonathan Goldstein. “We’re all just trying to get an election done.” Trump has not been so cautious, insisting without evidence that the election was stolen from him even when election officials nationwide from both parties say there has been no conspiracy.On Wednesday, Trump took aim at Philadelphia, the Democratic stronghold that helped push President-elect Joe Biden over the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the race. The president accused a local Republican election official Al Schmidt, of ignoring “a mountain of corruption & dishonesty.” Twitter added a label that said the election fraud claim is disputed. Trump loyalists have filed at least 15 legal challenges in Pennsylvania alone in an effort to reclaim the state’s 20 electoral votes. There is action, too, in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Michigan.Read more | Georgia to re-count presidential election ballots by handIn court, his lawyers must walk a precarious line between advocating for their client and upholding their professional oath. Legal ethicists and pro-democracy activists have questioned the participation of lawyers in this quest, as Trump clings to power and President-elect Joe Biden rolls out his agenda.“This may be an attempt to appease the ego in chief, but there are real world consequences for real people that come out of that,” said Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt, a former Justice Department elections official.“The attempt to soothe the president’s ego is not a victimless crime.” Schmidt told CBS’ “60 Minutes” that his office has received death threats simply for counting votes.“From the inside looking out, it feels all very deranged,” Schmidt said in an interview that aired Sunday. “Counting votes cast on or before Election Day by eligible voters is not corruption. It is not cheating. It is democracy.” Untold voters, however, are accepting Trump’s claim about a rigged election and are donating to his legal fund.A law firm involved in the election suits, Ohio-based Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, appeared to take down its Twitter feed Tuesday after it was inundated with attacks. The firm declined to address questions from The Associated Press about the feed in a statement issued Wednesday that said it had a long history of election work. A second firm, Jones Day, said it was representing not the Trump campaign but the Pennsylvania GOP, in litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court over the three-day extension to accept mail-in ballots. Nationally, the strategy is being run by Trump allies such as Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney; political operative David Bossie, who is not an attorney; and Jay Sekulow, a lead lawyer during the president’s impeachment trial this year. Bossie recently tested positive for Covid-19.Read more | Joe Biden moves forward without help from Donald Trump’s intel teamElection law expert Rick Hasen said he would expect to see top-drawer Supreme Court litigators involved, such as two former solicitors general, Paul Clement or Theodore Olson, if Trump had a strong case.“There are certain names of elite lawyers that signal to the Supreme Court that something is serious,” said Hasen, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. Instead, “the campaign announced that it was putting Rudy Giuliani and David Bossie in charge.” The low point of the effort undoubtedly came Saturday, when Giuliani held a news conference outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia just after the race was called for Biden. Standing in the shadow of a sex shop and a crematorium, just down the road from a state prison, Giuliani called a disgruntled poll watcher to the microphone to discuss the “shenanigans” in the city. Political observers tuning in from nearby Trenton, New Jersey, immediately recognised the man as a convicted sex offender and perennial candidate for office.In another head-scratching moment, as the campaign tried to stop the vote count in Philadelphia last week, a judge tried to get to the bottom of a Republican complaint over observer access in the room where election workers were processing mail-in ballots.Read more | US Presidential Election 2020: Donald Trump wins Alaska, his electoral college tally goes up to 217“I am asking you as a member of the bar of this court, are people representing the Donald J. Trump for president (campaign) … in that room?” US District Judge Paul S. Diamond asked.“There’s a nonzero number of people in the room,” campaign lawyer Jerome Marcus replied. Diamond made the two sides forge an agreement and threatened to charge them with contempt if they didn’t keep the peace. Some of the suits filed on Trump’s behalf appear to be hastily thrown together, with spelling errors (“ballet” for “ballot”), procedural mistakes and little to back up their claims. Judge have been skeptical. In Michigan, Judge Cynthia Stephens dismissed one filing as “inadmissible hearsay within hearsay.” When Trump’s lawyers appealed, the next court kicked the filing back as “defective.” The campaign has so far scored just one small victory, allowing their observers to stand a little closer to election workers processing the mail-in ballots in Philadelphia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-few-legal-wins-trump-team-hunts-for-proof-of-fraud/story-Z8Hmp7NchoEZH4lX4B1AOI.html
12-11-2020||World||Biden names chief of staff, signals reliance on trusted, moderate aides||US President-elect Joe Biden has named Ron Klain, a decades-long associate, as his chief of staff, signalling he will rely on a close circle of known and trusted aides, all moderates.Klain was Biden’s first major personnel announcement as the president-elect forged ahead with putting together his team for taking charge on January 20, undeterred by President Donald Trump’s refusal to acknowledge defeat and extend the incoming administration time-honoured transition protocols.“Ron has been invaluable to me over the many years that we have worked together, including as we rescued the American economy from one of the worst downturns in our history in 2009 and later overcame a daunting public health emergency in 2014,” Biden said in a statement.“His deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again.”Klain has been with Biden since his days in US Senate. The president-elect was serving his seventh six-year term when he was elected as President Barack Obama’s deputy. A Harvard law school alumnus, Klain served as chief of staff to Biden as vice-president and led the Obama administration’s response to the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic in the US, as the “Ebola Czar”. Klain’s selection was seen as a signal that moderates in the Democratic party, who have been the president-elect’s natural constituency, will have the upper hand in the administration even if progressives were able to wrest major concessions in terms of policy and personnel, as feared by some in India.New Delhi should breathe easy a little, observers said after Klain’s appointment. But they cautioned that a better understanding of the incoming administration’s impact on India will have to await other key appointments such as secretary of state, secretary of defence and the national security advisor.Susan Rice, a former national security adviser and US ambassador to the UN, is a frontrunner for secretary of state as are William Burns, a former deputy secretary of state, and Anthony Blinken, also a former deputy security of state and the Biden campaign’s foremost surrogate on foreign policy.Michele Flournoy, a former deputy secretary of defence, is the top contender for the top defence position in every speculative list of Biden’s cabinet.And Blinken leads every list for NSA.Indian officials have had close and long working relationships with all four, according to many past and present diplomats who have dealt with them, and they look forward to engaging with them, confident of their understanding of and support for ties with India, specially at a fraught time such as this.In an outreach to the Indian American community on the occasion of the Indian Independence Day past August 15, Blinken, who was the Biden campaign’s chief spokesperson on national security and foreign policy issues, had said that cooperation between the two countries should “extend even beyond the region to the world as large”. He had gone on to assert that the Biden administration will support a larger role for India in international institutions — including a permanent seat in a reformed UN Security Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-names-chief-of-staff-signals-reliance-on-trusted-moderate-aides/story-HpCIQ4Tzhs8VfCgsQLlPXN.html
12-11-2020||World||Saudi king points to Iran as top threat in annual speech||Saudi Arabia’s King Salman slammed rival Iran and hailed his country’s efforts at combating the coronavirus and stabilizing oil supplies in an annual speech delivered early Thursday.The speech, which outlined the country’s policy priorities and achievements, was delivered virtually by the 82-year-old monarch to the advisory Shura Council in the presence of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.On foreign policy, he stressed that threats from Iran remain a top concern. He accused Iran of supporting terrorism and fuelling sectarianism in the region.Although the king made no mention of it in his speech, another issue facing the kingdom next year will be its relationship with a new US administration led by President-elect Joe Biden. The Saudi leadership has strongly favoured President Donald Trump’s maximum pressure policy against rival Iran.The king stressed the necessity of “finding a radical solution to ensure Iran does not acquire weapons of mass destruction.”“Saudi Arabia affirms the danger of the Iranian regime’s regional project,” he said.The kingdom is at war with Iranian-backed Houthi fighters in Yemen. The conflict has killed thousands and created the world’s worst humanitarian disaster.During his presidency, Trump blocked a Congressional effort to end US military assistance in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen and defended the Saudi crown prince in the face of scathing criticism over the killing of writer Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in late 2018.A full day after statements began pouring in from world leaders, the king and Crown Prince Mohammed congratulated Biden on his election win in separate cables late Sunday, noting the “deep historical relations” that exist between the two nations — even as Trump refuses to publicly concede.In his remarks, King Salman also reaffirmed his support for an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital, though he also welcomed efforts aimed at bringing an end to the decades-long conflict. He spoke as neighboring UAE and Bahrain are normalizing relations with Israel in moves condemned by the Palestinians.Domestically, Saudi Arabia is in midst of economic recession this year due to the pandemic.Saudi Arabia’s main source of revenue — its oil exports — have plunged significantly due to a drop in crude prices. The government projects the gap between spending and revenue to reach $79.5 billion this year.“The kingdom has worked and is still working to ensure the stability of oil supplies to the world in a way that serves producers and consumers alike ... despite the coronavirus pandemic and its repercussions on global oil markets,” King Salman said.He praised the country’s for its presidency this year of the Group of 20 nations that represent the world’s wealthiest countries, a point of pride the kingdom has stressed repeatedly. Saudi Arabia will host leaders of the G-20 later this month for a virtual summit that is expected to focus heavily on global efforts to fight the coronavirus.The king also thanked the Saudi public for adhering to instructions and mask mandates to curb the spread of the virus as new confirmed cases there have gone down in past weeks. He noted the government has spent $70 billion this year, in part to boost health care and help cover private sector wages. The government is covering all virus-related medical costs for residents of Saudi Arabia, including those in the country illegally.Some 10.6 million lower income Saudi citizens also rely on monthly cash assistance from the government’s so-called “Citizen’s Account.” The average monthly support for a family is around 1,050 riyals, or $280.King Salman’s reign since ascending to the throne in 2015 has been marked by sweeping social transformations, as well as the swift rise to power of his son, the crown prince.In the latest move, the monarch last month appointed a woman as assistant speaker of the 150-member Shura Council for the first time. Women hold 30 seats in the chamber.Ayham Kamel, head of Eurasia Group’s Middle East division, said the change reflects efforts at social liberalization. Kamel said there is also an effort to allow the Shura Council to become a platform for managed debate, although it has limited powers to push for changes without prior blessing from the royal court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-king-points-to-iran-as-top-threat-in-annual-speech/story-wZ8aWobayeN1k5AuwNsrWL.html
12-11-2020||World||US hints at more sanctions on China over Hong Kong||The United States on Wednesday slammed China for the recent disqualification of four Hong Kong opposition lawmakers and said that sanctions will continue to be imposed on “those responsible for extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom”.According to an official statement issued by National Security Advisor Robert C O’Brien, “Beijing’s recent actions disqualifying pro-democracy legislators from Hong Kong’s Legislative Council leave no doubt that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has flagrantly violated its international commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and its promises to the people of Hong Kong, including those under the Basic Law.” He further said that “One Country, Two Systems” has become merely a “fig leaf covering for the CCP’s expanding one-party dictatorship in Hong Kong”. “The United States will continue to utilize all the powers granted under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, and the Executive Order on Hong Kong Normalization to identify and sanction those responsible for extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom,” he added.Earlier, four Hong Kong opposition lawmakers were disqualified with immediate effect after the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) passed the resolution, South China Morning Post reported.Following this, all Hong Kong’s opposition lawmakers resigned together in the protest of China’s top legislative body’s resolution, which gives local authorities power to unseat politicians without having to go through the city’s courts, Hong Kong Free Press reported.Democratic Party lawmaker Wu Chi-wai, convenor of the pro-democracy bloc slammed Beijing resolution as “ridiculous” and said the decision signaled Beijing complete abandonment of the Basic Law.“Hong Kong, from today onward, can no longer tell the world that there is ‘one country, two systems’,” Wu said.The lawmakers unseated on Wednesday were the Civic Party’s Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu, Kwok Ka-ki and Dennis Kwok, alongside Kenneth Leung of the Professionals Guild, who were previously barred from running in the now-postponed Legislative Council elections, originally slated for September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hints-at-more-sanctions-on-china-over-hong-kong/story-uS9yTFEUQijn4XUSEDUXoM.html

Officials had said previously that nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated, some of them forcibly, from vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.Rescue teams were deployed to flooded areas in Rizal province near the capital, Adm. George Ursabia, the coast guard chief, told DZBB radio.From the Rizal town of Rodriguez, resident Yolanda Laude called the radio station to ask to be rescued. “We’re all on the roof. The water has risen high and reached our second floor. We’ve been here on the roof since 3 am, there are six families on our roof,” she told DZBB, which asked for details of her location.In Pasig city in metropolitan Manila, Carla May Juico and her family went up to the third and last floor of their house as the waters rose during the night. Now, the water has reached the third floor. “We’re thinking of going to the roof. We’ll asked to be rescued,” she told DZBB by phone.Marikina city Mayor Marcie Teodoro said the fierce winds knocked down power lines overnight, leaving many areas without power and internet connection. Heavy rains also flooded many areas and the Marikina River was swollen.“There are many areas that historically don’t get flooded but now, they are swamped like the city hall,” he told DZBB radio.Typhoon Vamco had maximum winds of 130 kilometres per hour (80 mph) with stronger gusts Thursday morning. It was moving west-northwest at 30 kph (19 mph) and would soon leave the main Luzon Island for the South China Sea.Flooding in 32 villages and a few landslides were already reported on Wednesday from the typhoon, and disaster officials said a man died and three other people were missing, without immediately providing details.The government’s main disaster-response agency had pleaded to the media to relay typhoon alerts in northeastern areas devastated by the earlier Typhoon Goni, saying the agency’s messages could not be sent by cellphones due to damaged telecommunications systems.Goni, one of the strongest tropical cyclones in the world this year, left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed more than 270,000 houses and shanties, many along coastal villages. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It’s also located on the so-called Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-ravaged-northeast-philippines-pummelled-by-new-storm/story-oR8FF1J97ikJikQrQxkuhI.html

The company is now preparing data to send to the trial’s Data and Safety Monitoring Board, an independent panel of experts.If a statistically significant number of participants received the placebo, that would mean that the vaccine is effective against the virus.Since cases are rapidly rising in the US, more than 53 participants will become ill with Covid-19 by the time the announcement is made, according to CNN.Meanwhile, Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, said on Wednesday that Pfizer’s promising outcomes are good news for Moderna as well.Fauci mentioned that Pfizer’s results from the never-before-approved mRNA technology were better than expected.This came after the coronavirus vaccine developed by drug giant American Pfizer and German biotechnology firm BioNTech was more than 90 per cent effective at protecting people from infection as compared to placebo saline shot, according to an analysis.This was regarded as a ‘historical moment’ by Kathrin Jensen, head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-expecting-to-announce-results-of-covid-19-vaccine-by-end-of-month/story-QOcReOQI6Dbitr4Ge5W25L.html

12-11-2020||World||President-elect Joe Biden names Ron Klain as White House chief of staff||US President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday announced the appointment of Ron Klain, his longtime aide, as White House chief of staff. In this capacity, Klain will oversee the executive office of the President and serve as a senior advisor. In addition to supporting the president-elect, Klain will work to build a diverse, experienced and talented team to help President-elect Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris meet the urgent challenges facing the country, a media release said. “Ron has been invaluable to me over the many years that we have worked together, including as we rescued the American economy from one of the worst downturns in our history in 2009 and later overcame a daunting public health emergency in 2014,” said Biden. “His deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again,” Biden said. Klain was most recently a senior advisor to the Biden for campaign and has previously served Biden in a number of roles including as his chief of staff when he became vice president. Klain is also known for his role as the White House ebola response coordinator at the height of the public health crisis. Klain said, “It’s the honor of a lifetime to serve president-elect Biden in this role, and I am humbled by his confidence. I look forward to helping him and the vice president-elect assemble a talented and diverse team to work in the White House, as we tackle their ambitious agenda for change, and seek to heal the divides in our country.”  At the conclusion of his work coordinating the US response, President Obama said that Klain had taken on “a challenge that many called insurmountable, and, in leading the team responsible for tremendous progress, helped remind the world what makes America exceptional.” Earlier, in addition to his work with then-vice president Biden, Klain served as chief of staff for vice president Al Gore, chief of staff and counsellor to attorney general Janet Reno, and staff director of the senate democratic leadership committee. Klain was also associate counsel to president Clinton and in charge of judicial selection. Through his work on the judiciary committee, and in the executive branch, he has played a role in the selection or confirmation of eight Supreme Court justices. Serving as an advisor on several presidential campaigns, Klain has worked for Obama and Clinton, and democratic presidential nominees Al Gore, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Klain graduated from Harvard Law School, was an editor of the Harvard Law Review, and won the Sears Prize for highest grade average in 1985. He was a summa cum laude graduate of Georgetown University, where he serves an Adjunct Professor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-elect-joe-biden-names-ron-klain-as-white-house-chief-of-staff/story-S8bHXYvfFkoden2rFTKq6J.html

12-11-2020||World||Nawaz Sharif crosses Army’s redline in battle with Imran Khan. Pushback begins||Pakistan’s army, its most powerful institution that has directly ruled the country for large parts of its seven-decade history, has been coming under sharp attacks from a coalition of opposition parties as they amp up their pitch against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The anti-government alliance, Pakistan Democratic Movement, or PDM, was minted by 11 parties in September that pledged to hit the streets to mobilise people against PM Khan. But the parties, who they accuse of being installed by the military in the 2018 election, soon enough widened its attack to aim at the army also. But it had been hesitant to name the army brass, opting for the more ambivalent term, ‘establishment’ to refer to the military and other institutions who have lent their support to Imran Khan.Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who had adopted a shrill pitch right from the beginning when he famously alluded to the military as the “state above the state”, however, went a step further at last month’s rally in Pakistan’s eastern city of Gujranwala where he directly targeted army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.“Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, you packed up our government, which was working well, and put the nation and the country at the altar of your wishes,” Sharif told the gathering via a video link from London, according to a Reuters report. It was billed as the largest rally in the country since the 2018 elections, attended by tens of thousands of people. Sharif, Pakistan’s three-time prime minister whose Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is the main opposition party, also named Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the chief of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence handpicked by Gen Bajwa. Also Watch | PM Modi gives stern message to China & Pakistan at SCO summitPakistan watchers in New Delhi believe the army tried to get back at Sharif via his daughter Maryam Sharif’s husband Mohammad Safdar when the military arm-twisted the police to arrest him from his Karachi hotel. But the move backfired after the Karachi police threatened to go on leave to protest the military abducting its chief to force him to order Safdar’s arrest. Gen Bajwa had to order an inquiry.On Tuesday, the military announced that the inquiry had faulted a number of intelligence officers and troops for acting “overzealously”. The military said officers from Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) and ISI sector Headquarters, Karachi were under increasing public pressure to act for the desecration of Mazar-e-Quaid, a reference to the PML-N leader’s visit to the mausoleum of Mohammad Ali Jinnah where he led a crowd in chanting: “Give respect to the vote!” The slogan is viewed as a criticism of the military.Maryam Sharif and her father have rejected the military report. “Inquiry report on Karachi incident is a cover-up scapegoating juniors & shielding the real culprits. Report “Rejected”,” tweeted Nawaz Sharif.That Gen Bajwa had to order an inquiry into the Karachi incident and then release what the army claims were its findings, Pakistan watchers in New Delhi said, indicated the pressure that the army had come under.“The open discussion and criticism of the army’s role in governance have implications for the establishment as it puts the legitimacy of its authority at risk,” said one of them, pointing how Nawaz Sharif and his daughter’s public criticism had brought the debate on civil-military relations on the streets.Indian counter-terror officials who track Pakistan’s security establishment indicate that the pushback from the military appeared to have started. One immediate fallout of the army flexing its muscles was the statement by Bilawal Bhutto, chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party, to distance himself and the PDM from Sharif’s pointed criticism of the army.In an interview to BBC, Bilawal Bhutto said he was “shocked” when he heard Nawaz Sharif name the army chief and the ISI boss in his October speech.“It was a shock for me because, typically, we don’t talk like this at rallies. But Nawaz heads his own party and I can’t control what he says, just like he can’t control what I say,” Bilawal said, according to Pakistani newspaper Dawn. “During the all-parties conference, there was a debate on whether the blame should be laid on one institution or the entire establishment,” Bilawal said, adding that “it was decided that a single institution would not be named, the establishment would.”Analysts, however, point out that the army - even if on a back foot for the moment - still had a few things going for it. For one, it enjoys a far better reputation than all the political parties put together and targeting it could be counter-productive.An Indian counter-terror official said he expected the criticism from the PDM to become more nuanced and milder, particularly since it has over the decades made deep inroads in Pakistan’s political parties. Already, PML-N’s Balochistan chapter leader Lt General Abdul Qadir Baloch and former chief minister Sanaullah Zehri have quit the party and castigated the PDM for targeting the ‘establishment’.Even the hardline religiopolitical parties such as Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) are severely compromised and maintain close links with the establishment. “More importantly, its multitude of terrorist proxies is the ultimate weapon against anyone who crosses the line and doesn’t take corrective steps,” said the counter-terror official.Nawaz Sharif has stood his ground so far but analysts indicate that he faces a serious limitation due to his peculiar circumstances. He was ousted from power in 2017 on the Supreme Court’s orders and has been staying in London after being allowed to receive medical treatment abroad.The mantle of taking the battle to the army has fallen on daughter Maryam Nawaz who is rapidly emerging as the lead face of the opposition, an official said. She can relate well to her constituents, has demonstrated courage in calling a spade a spade and is careful in her public addresses to project that she is shouldering the PML-N’s burden on behalf of her father, a recognition of the country’s patriarchal and feudal society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-battle-with-imran-khan-nawaz-sharif-crosses-army-s-redline-pushback-begins/story-gmSgesCOQ1mXlLOWdxjv9N.html
12-11-2020||World||Texas becomes 1st state to surpass 1 million Covid-19 cases||Texas became America’s first state Wednesday with more than 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases, as sporting events were canceled and the border city of El Paso added mobile morgues in anticipation of virus deaths overwhelming hospitals for weeks.Texas leaders gave no indication of forthcoming restrictions as the state passed the grim milestone and recorded more than 10,800 new cases on Tuesday, which set a new daily record and is the highest since July. The virus that is surging throughout the US has been unsparing across Texas: The top county official in Fort Worth is pushing to halt youth and school sports, and medical tents were set up outside hospitals for the first time in the rural Panhandle.“We were certainly hoping we would be in a bubble and not have to go through the things that larger communities were having to deal with because we were in — quote — rural Texas,” said Cory Edmondson, president and CEO of Peterson Health in Kerrville.“But that quickly came to a halt, and we realized we’re not immune to this,” said Edmondson, whose hospital in the Texas Hill Country now often has more than 10 Covid-19 patients admitted, double the usual number.State health officials Wednesday reported 6,779 patients in hospitals, a spike of 609 in one day — one of the highest one-day bumps since the state started keep track.Texas has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases and more than 19,300 confirmed deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Only Illinois has averaged more new cases than Texas over the past two weeks.Texas recently surpassed California, the most populous state, in recording the highest number of positive coronavirus tests. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.A spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he was relying on “data-driven hospitalization metrics” and that the state was working to help areas with rising caseloads. Abbott has not held a press briefing about the virus since September, when he announced that he was lifting more restrictions on restaurants and gyms.“The reality is, Covid-19 still exists in Texas and across the globe, and Texans should continue to take this virus seriously and do their part by social distancing, washing their hands, and wearing a mask,” Abbott spokeswoman Renae Eze said.In El Paso, where more than 1,000 virus patients are hospitalized, local officials have shut down tattoo parlors, hair and nail salons and gyms — all steps that are beyond what Abbott has allowed. The state is fighting the move that Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton says is “oppressing” the border county of about 840,000 people, but local officials won a brief reprieve Wednesday when the Texas Supreme Court refused to make an expedited ruling.El Paso County officials this week announced plans to add four additional morgue trailers, bringing the total number there to 10.Disruptions to college football programs in Texas are also mounting, with more games postponed or cancelled. The latest came Tuesday when No. 5 Texas A&M had its game this week against Tennessee rescheduled for Dec. 12 after Texas A&M reported at least three players or staff members tested positive. The University of Texas-El Paso also announced that it would move a Nov. 20 home game against Alabama-Birmingham to Midland — more than 300 miles (480 kilometers) away — because of the surging number of cases along the border.New cases around Dallas climbed above 1,200 for a third consecutive day, prompting the county’s top elected official to urge more residents to work from home.“We are staring down the barrel of the largest spike we have seen to date in Covid cases,” Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said.In rural Kerrville, Edmondson said his 124-bed hospital has been able to manage the uptick in cases but worried that numbers could worsen. He described a fatigue within the nine counties his hospital serves with the virus and restrictions.In Lubbock County, home of Texas Tech University, health officials reported a surge of nearly 3,400 new cases last week. That is nearly 80% of the number of cases reported over the same span in Harris County, which has a population 16 times larger, and hospital tents were being set up in the area, alarming local officials.“’We know how to do this. Please. I can absolutely assure you that never in my career did I think we would be deploying field hospitals to Lubbock, Texas,” Lubbock City Manager Jarrett Atkinson told television station KCBD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-becomes-1st-state-to-surpass-1-million-covid-19-cases/story-u8qG9s6R715zkJqCFEvzaJ.html

By another calculation of coronavirus mentioned as a cause in death certificates (in all settings, including those outside hospitals), the figure has already crossed 60,000.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new milestone indicated that the UK is “not out of the woods”, despite news this week about the Pfizer vaccine: “Every death is a tragedy. I do think we have got now to a different phase in the way that we treat it.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverageThe UK is now the fifth country in the world to register more than 50,000 deaths, after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. The cumulative figure of positive cases in the UK is 1,256,725, with 22,950 registered in the last 24 hours.Labour leader Keir Starmer, who has been critical of the Johnson government’s handling of the pandemic, said the latest death figures were a “grim milestone,” adding that the government owed it to the families of those who have lost their lives “to get on top” of its response to the second wave.New sero survey shows 1 in 4 exposed to Covid-19 in DelhiChaand Nagpaul of the British Medical Association said: “This is a point that should never have been reached. Today’s figure is a terrible indictment of poor preparation, poor organisation by the government, insufficient infection control measures, coupled with late and often confusing messaging for the public.”Meanwhile, the National Health Service is working on a plan to vaccinate on a large scale if the Medicines and Health products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) approves the Pfizer vaccine in the near future. Football stadiums, town halls and conference centres in England are among centres of the mass vaccination plan that includes a priority list of the vaccine recipients.Covid-19: What you need to know todayJune Raine, MHRA chief executive, said: “The safety of the public will always come first. A Covid-19 vaccine will only be approved once it has met robust standards of effectiveness, safety and quality.”Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, added: “This is one of the most important, if not the most important, vaccination programme we’ve done for decades. If I can help with this in some evenings and weekends, doing some extra vaccinations sessions myself, then I’m going to.”Johnson’s spokesman said the prime minister would be happy to receive the vaccine: “Any vaccines which are determined for use will undergo a vigorous series of safety checks, they will be absolutely safe for the public to use. And the prime minister would therefore, of course, be very happy to take the vaccine himself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-with-more-than-50-000-lives-lost-uk-records-highest-death-toll-in-europe/story-OYKrfLpuh28NrmGurzVJFJ.html

We didn’t quite understand it at first, but we then realised that we were the target,” Chaaya told France’s BFMTV.“We were panicking and feared there could be a second explosion. We left the cemetery... and everyone went their separate ways.”Mohammed Belmaziz, another eyewitness, said amid the pandemonium and screams he saw one person whose face was “covered in blood”.Roads leading up to the cemetery in central Jeddah were blocked by Saudi traffic police, according to an AFP photographer at the scene.While condemning the “shameful” attack, the embassies of the countries involved in the commemoration lauded “brave Saudi first responders who assisted those at the scene”.The European Union delegation in the kingdom also thanked Saudi emergency services, while urging local authorities to hold a “prompt and thorough investigation” of the attack.- ‘Extreme vigilance’ -The French embassy in Riyadh has urged its nationals in Saudi Arabia to exercise “extreme vigilance” since the attack at the Jeddah consulate on October 29, the same day a knife-wielding man killed three people at a church in Nice in southern France.Several countries are marking the 102nd anniversary of the armistice signed by Germany and Allied countries to end the war.Macron has vigorously defended the right to publish cartoons viewed as offensive by some, including caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed.The Charlie Hebdo cartoons were shown by French history teacher Samuel Paty to pupils in a class on free speech, leading to his beheading outside Paris on October 16 following an online campaign by parents angry over his choice of lesson material.Macron’s stance angered many Muslims, prompting protests in several countries at which portraits of France’s president were burnt, and a campaign to boycott French products.Regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia -- home to Islam’s holiest sites -- has criticised the cartoons, saying it rejected “any attempt to link Islam and terrorism” but stopped short of condemning the French leadership.Riyadh also “strongly” condemned last month’s attack in Nice.On Tuesday, Macron hosted a summit of European leaders to plot a joint approach on combating Islamist radicalism after four people were killed in a shooting rampage in the heart of Vienna last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covered-in-blood-bomb-strikes-wwi-memorial-at-saudi-cemetery/story-fd37MqwrcGX1jsZMFBHsFI.html

Prof Zafar Iqbal and Prof Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki (brother-in-law of Saeed) were awarded 16 and one-year jail terms in two cases,” a court official told PTI.He said that the two other JuD leaders -- Abdul Salam bin Muhammad and Luqman Shah -- were indicted in more terror financing cases.The court directed the prosecution to present its witnesses on November 16.The suspects were presented in the court in high security and media was not allowed to enter the court premises during the case proceedings.Last week, the ATC Lahore convicted JuD’s Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki, Zafar Iqbal and Muhammad Ashraf in two more cases of terror financing registered by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police.Zafar Iqbal and Muhammad Ashraf have been given a collective imprisonment of 16 years each under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Makki has been sentenced to one-year imprisonment in a case with a fine of Rs 170,000.In September last year, the ATC Lahore handed down over 16 years imprisonment to Prof Zafar Iqbal and Hafiz Abdus Salam bin Muhammad and one-and-a-half-year sentence to Makki in a terror financing case.In February last year, Saeed had been sentenced to jail for 11 years on terror finance charges by an ATC in Lahore.The ATC sentenced Saeed and his close aide Zafar Iqbal to five-and-a-half years each in two cases. A total of 11 years sentence will run concurrently. Saeed is serving his term in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. He was arrested in July last year.The CTD of Punjab police had registered 23 FIRs against Saeed and his accomplices on the charges of terror financing in different cities of the province.Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for Lashkar-e-Taiba which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.The US named Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10-million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice.He was listed as a terrorist under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-jails-spokesperson-of-hafiz-saeed-led-jud-for-32-years-in-terror-financing-cases/story-TJozIVYYeLMF7ab9mzXB3N.html

Both sides, despite being longstanding allies, disagreed over key topics from trade and security to the fight against climate change.The EU is expected to invite Biden soon to videoconference talks in an attempt to give new impetus to the trans-Atlantic alliance.“You can rest assured that we are ready to engage fast with the new administration,” Borrell said. But he also alluded to the political problems remaining in the U.S. where Trump has yet to concede defeat. Biden is steadfastly pushing forward with preparations for his presidency.“We still have to wait until (the) 20th of January because as you know very well it is a quite long transition ahead. Let’s hope it is not going to be a bumpy transition,” Borrell said.Trump has variously stunned and disappointed the Europeans — most of them members of the NATO military alliance that America leads — by slapping tariffs on EU exports and pulling out of the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-says-looking-forward-to-better-ties-with-us-under-joe-biden/story-XVhfjQvJMzeOu50Gb4MVaN.html

The NGO had just finished distributing life vests and masks to the passengers to begin transferring them to safety when the flimsy boat split in two, throwing them into cold waters.Rescuers pulled out 111 people, including two infants, alive and recovered five bodies.Open Arms spokesperson Laura Lanuza told The AP that the NGO has asked Italian and Maltese maritime authorities for the immediate evacuation of six people in serious condition, including two babies and their mothers and a pregnant woman. Lanuza said the NGO had already rescued 88 migrants the night before and was headed to a third distress call.Wednesday’s shipwreck was the second recorded this week in waters north of Libya, a key transit point for migrants from Africa and the Middle East. On Tuesday another 13 migrants died, including a child, the UN said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-dead-111-rescued-in-mediterranean-migrant-shipwreck/story-P1RC1aCpQe9RIO8HXBSrbM.html
12-11-2020||World||Brazil resumes trials of Chinese Covid-19 vaccine candidate||Brazil’s health regulator on Wednesday authorized the resumption of large-scale clinical trials on a potential coronavirus vaccine developed by a Chinese company just over a day after shutting the test down.The initial decision by Anvisa led to a storm of complaints that the action was more political than scientific.The agency had cited an “adverse, serious event” that occurred on October 29 as the reason for halting the trials on Monday night, but said Wednesday it now “has sufficient elements to allow vaccination to resume.” The potential CoronaVac vaccine is being developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac and in Brazil would be mostly produced by Sao Paulo’s state-run Butantan Institute.Adversaries of President Jair Bolsonaro said they suspected the suspension was motivated by the president’s oft-stated wariness of China and his political rivalry with Sao Paulo’s governor, though Anvisa officials insisted the decision was based purely on technical issues and complained they hadn’t been given sufficient initial information about the case.Anvisa “continues to monitor the investigation of the outcome of the case in order to define the possible causal relationship between the unexpected event and the vaccine,” its statement added on Wednesday. It did not specify what sort of event had occurred.About 10,000 volunteers are taking part in phase three testing of the Sinovac candidate, one of several potential vaccines under trial in one of the nations hardest hit by Covid-19.Temporary halts of drug and vaccine trials are relatively common; in research involving thousands of participants, some are likely to fall ill. Pausing a study allows researchers to investigate whether an illness is a side effect or a coincidence. Last month, two drugmakers resumed testing of their prospective coronavirus vaccines in the U.S. after they were halted earlier.Bolsonaro has repeatedly cast doubt on CoronaVac’s prospective effectiveness, and last month rejected it, saying Brazilians would not be used as guinea pigs. He celebrated Anvisa’s suspension on Tuesday, saying it showed that “Jair Bolsonaro wins again.” Bolsonaro didn’t immediately comment following Anvisa’s decision on Wednesday to restart the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-resumes-trials-of-chinese-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/story-bzTXGglVLnk9xHIGa63xdM.html
12-11-2020||World||UK becomes 5th country to exceed 50,000 coronavirus deaths||The United Kingdom on Wednesday became the fifth country in the world to record more than 50,000 coronavirus-related deaths, a level that one of the nation’s leading doctors says “should never have been reached.”Figures from the British government showed that 595 more people in the country died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus, the highest daily number since May. The figure took the U.K.’s total death toll from the pandemic to 50,365.The U.K, which has the highest virus-related death toll in Europe, joins the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico in reporting more than 50,000, according to a tally maintained by Johns Hopkins University.The U.K.’s overall death toll is widely considered to be far higher than that as the total reported only includes those who have tested positive for the virus and doesn’t include those who died of COVID-related symptoms after 28 days.Like other nations in Europe, the U.K. is experiencing a resurgence of the virus and has imposed new restrictions to curb infections over the past few weeks. England is currently in the midst of its second lockdown, which is due to expire on Dec. 2.Following the news about the death toll exceeding 50,000, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the U.K. is better equipped to handle outbreaks than it was during the first wave in the spring, when the country reported more than 40,000 deaths.In addition to the prospect of a vaccine or vaccines against the coronavirus coming through in the next few months, Johnson cited far more widespread testing. Last week, the government started its first city-wide testing program in the northwest England city of Liverpool. It is planning more widespread testing around the country over the coming weeks, including of university students in early December ahead of their return home for Christmas.“It is a global pandemic whose effects, whose treatments, whose implications for the economy — all those have been becoming clearer and clearer as the months have gone on,” said Johnson, who was hospitalized in April after contracting the virus.In Wednesday’s daily update, the British government also said that another 22,950 people tested positive for the virus. While the number of new cases is much higher than 24-hour statistics recorded in the summer, daily confirmed cases appear to be stabilizing, or at least, growing far more slowly.Because of time lags, most scientists expect the number of people being hospitalized and dying to continue rising for weeks, even after the number of confirmed infections do start going down.“Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue, and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures — and the sacrifices we are all making — is seen and is reflected in the data,” said Dr. Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England.Under the terms of the current lockdown in England, non-essential places such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, golf courses, gyms, swimming pools, entertainment venues and stores selling items like books, clothing and sneakers, must remain closed until at least Dec. 2.Unlike the U.K.’s spring lockdown, schools and universities in England are remaining open this time, as are construction sites and factories.In a visit to a supermarket in southeast London, Johnson said that “hopefully” the four-week lockdown in England will be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is “as normal as possible.”Whatever happens in the near-term, there are calls for a public inquiry to assess a range of issues that many think have led to more deaths in the U.K. than should otherwise have occurred, from problems with the testing program to shortages of personal protective equipment at the outset of the pandemic, as well as the high death rates in care homes and within ethnic minority groups.“Today’s figure is a terrible indictment of poor preparation, poor organization by the government, insufficient infection control measures, coupled with late and often confusing messaging for the public,” said Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, council chair of the British Medical Association, a union for doctors.“This is a point that should never have been reached.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-becomes-5th-country-to-exceed-50-000-coronavirus-deaths/story-ZYoutQ5aBQVdP0pEvZM2eI.html

Its infection rate has declined to 525 cases per 100,000 people from highs of more than 800.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-travelling-to-spain-from-high-risk-nations-to-submit-negative-pcr-test-on-arrival/story-PvA42sqozNoaheMd0s3GFJ.html
12-11-2020||World||America is back, Biden tells world leaders||US President-elect Joe Biden said on Tuesday he told world leaders calling to congratulating him that “America is back”, signalling the country’s return to increased global engagement in a reversal of President Donald Trump’s isolationism driven by his ‘America First’ motto.“I’m letting them know that America is back. We’re going to be back in the game,” Biden said in his first news briefing after his election. These were also Biden’s first remarks aimed at foreign nations, some of whom have welcomed his election such as the UK, France, Germany and India, while others such as China, Brazil and Russia haven’t. Moscow has said it wanted President Trump to exhaust his legal options.Biden repeated his message to the world in a tweet later: “When I’m speaking to foreign leaders, I’m telling them: America is going to be back. We’re going to be back in the game.”Biden has spoken with leaders of five countries over the past two days, all close and traditional allies of the United States: Canada’s Justin Trudeau, France’s Emanuel Macron, Germany’s Angela Merkel and UK’s Boris Johnson and Ireland’s Michael Martin. He will be speaking to more over the coming days.Biden ran on the promise of restoring America’s role and leadership in global affairs. “And in order to lead again, we must restore our credibility and influence,” said his vision statement for his presidential campaign. “From day one of a Biden administration, other countries will once again have reason to trust and respect the word of an American president.”Biden also sought to allay concerns at home about roadblocks being placed by the Trump administration in the smooth transfer of power, as is the tradition.But he said the president’s refusal to concede was an “embarrassment, quite frankly” and it “won’t help his legacy”.Biden’s transition team was already at work and the president-elect said he expected to name “at least a couple” of members of his cabinet before Thanksgiving, November 26.The Trump administration has refused to engage with Biden’s transition team, blocking funds and denying intelligence briefings among other things. And the president has continued to press allegations of election fraud and file lawsuits, none of whom have had any serious impact. He has also insisted in falsely claiming he won the election.Secretary of state Mike Pompeo, a close ally of the president, took it further. “There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,” he told reporters at a briefing. He sought to walk it back later, faced with growing blowback. “We’ll have a smooth transition and we’ll see what the people ultimately decided when all the votes have been cast,” he said on Fox News when asked if he was joking earlier.President-elect Biden laughed off Pompeo’s partisan remarks at his own news conference. He had had very reassuring calls with world leaders. He described their response — “very fulsome and energetic” and added “I feel confident that we’re going to be able to put America back in a place of respect that it had before”.Tackling Covid-19 and climate change figured in Biden’s conversations with all leaders, according to a readout issued by the transition team. Under Biden, the US could rejoin the Paris Accord on tackling the climate crisis, though it was not mentioned. US ties with NATO and EU came up in discussions with Macron, Merkel and Johnson.Biden and Macron also discussed Iran’s nuclear programme. No details were available but the French president had personally tried hard to persuade Trump to not leave the Iran deal, which he did.Biden’ vision statement had indicated the possibility of resurrecting the deal. “If Tehran returns to compliance with the deal, President Biden would re-enter the agreement, using hard-nosed diplomacy and support from our allies to strengthen and extend it, while more effectively pushing back against Iran’s other destabilising activities,” it had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/america-is-back-biden-tells-world-leaders/story-ciDMnK9SrPdV6z8jFkBPbP.html
12-11-2020||India||PM Modi underlines centrality of Asean in India’s Act East policy||India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) on Thursday emphasised the need to build on convergences and synergy to maintain peace and security in the Indo-Pacific, against the backdrop of China’s growing assertiveness across the region. The situation in the South China Sea, where China is engaged in disputes with several Asean members, and all regional issues of concern figured in the discussions during the Asean-India Summit that was co-chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc. Vietnam is the current chair of Asean. “India and Asean share a vast maritime space in the Indo-Pacific and Asean is at the centre of this space. There is great convergence and synergy between our visions of the Indo-Pacific as articulated in the Asean outlook for the Indo-Pacific and India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative,” said secretary (East) Riva Ganguly Das of the external affairs ministry. “We seek to build on this convergence for maintaining peace, security and sustainable development of the Indo-Pacific and ensuring security and growth for all in the region,” she told a news briefing after the summit. While addressing the summit, Modi underlined the centrality of Asean in India’s “Act East” policy and said a cohesive and prosperous Asean is also central to India’s Indo-Pacific vision. He called for strengthening convergence between India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and Asean’s outlook on Indo-Pacific to “ensure a free, open, inclusive and rules-based” region. PM Modi announced a contribution of $1 million to the Covid-19 Asean Response Fund and reiterated New Delhi’s offer of a $1-billion line of credit to support connectivity between Asean states. He also called for an early review of the Asean-India Trade in Goods Agreement. Asked specifically if China’s aggressive actions, which have affected both India and Asean states, had figured in the summit, Ganguly Das said all regional issues of concern were discussed, including the situation in the South China Sea. “Both Asean and India agreed on the importance of maintaining and promoting peace, stability and security in the South China Sea, and reaffirmed the importance of upholding international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) while ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight above South China Sea and ensuring unimpeded lawful commerce,” she said. The Asean leaders acknowledged India as a long-term friend and partner and the country’s contributions towards promoting regional peace and stability. In the field of digital and physical connectivity, the two sides agreed to consider a report by Jakarta-based think tank Economic Research Institute for Asean and East Asia (ERIA) on extending the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway to more countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-underlines-centrality-of-asean-in-india-s-act-east-policy/story-4DV5MklpIRhoghpTRMsvfL.html
12-11-2020||India||Lucknow, on a sweet high!||Online intra-city delivery, dry fruits, perishable sweets and immunity booster delicacies remain in demand, this Diwali. During the pandemic year, life remains unpredictable but the festivities refuse to slow down.

This is saving us from hassle of delivery as many are working from home and beneficiary can use it as per their choice,” said Vikas Malik of Danbro by Mr Brown. With immunity a big thing these days, buyers are preferring items like power seeds cookies. “Natural sweetener-based delicacies like Bakhlawa, super-food cookies, and dry-fruit based items are in demand. But, people are buying smaller packs due to reduced budget,” he adds. Ravindra Gupta of Chhappan Bhog tells that as the festival approached the retail clients have finally started buying. Many visited personally and are taking order on online-App or courier route. “There are surely few who are not ordering while many have limited their quantity but rest are ordering and gifting as it’s a tradition.

12-11-2020||India||India-Nepal launch construction of 3rd integrated check post to boost trade||India and Nepal on Thursday launched the construction of a Rs 147.12-crore integrated check post (ICP) at Nepalgunj to streamline and boost cross-border trade, weeks ahead of a visit to Kathmandu by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla to take forward bilateral ties. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal and Nepal’s urban development minister Krishna Gopal Shrestha witnessed the groundbreaking ceremony to mark the beginning of construction of the ICP, which will smoothen cross-border movement of cargo trucks by bringing customs and immigration facilities under one roof. This will be the third ICP on the India-Nepal border and similar facilities at Birgunj and Biratnagar were operationalised in April 2018 and January 2020. India has also built ICPs on the borders with neighbours such as Bangladesh and Pakistan. Goyal announced the Indian government will take up the construction of a fourth ICP at Bhairahawa in Nepal with Indian funding. The modalities for this project and the implementing agency are under consideration, he said. The ICP at Nepalgunj will have export and import cargo handling facilities such as warehousing, refrigerated cargo facilities, medical, plant and animal quarantine areas, and amenities for drivers and passengers. It will also have extensive security systems, including CCTV cameras, round the clock power backup, and waste water treatment facilities. “The facility is envisaged to promote systematic approach to cargo handling and, therefore, will result in saving of time and inconvenience to visitors and reduce overall transaction costs for cross-border trade and commerce,” the Indian embassy in Kathmandu said in a statement. The portion of the ICP on the Nepalese side will be built on 61.5 hectares by a Pune-based company under the supervision of state-run RITES International Ltd. The construction period is two years. A portion on the Indian side is being built at Rupaidiha by Lands Ports Authority of India and the work started in May. More than 10% of the construction has been completed. During the construction period, the Nepalgunj project is expected to create local employment and boost the economy through supply of raw materials and items from Nepal’s markets. The creation of advanced cross-border logistics and infrastructure facilities over the past three years has boosted connectivity and mutually beneficial trade and people-to-people ties, the Indian embassy said. Shringla is expected to visit Nepal during November 26-27, close on the heels of a two-day trip to Kathmandu last week by the Indian Army chief, Gen MM Naravane, to take forward ties that were rocked by a border row earlier this year. Both countries had been working behind the scenes to put the bilateral relationship back on an even keel against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff in the Ladakh sector. India-Nepal ties were hit in May after defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a key border road to Lipulekh region, which is claimed by Nepal. Kathmandu responded by issuing a new map that showed Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, all controlled by India, as part of Nepalese territory. This exacerbated the border row. This will be Shringla’s fifth foreign visit in the aftermath of pandemic-related travel restrictions. He visited the Maldives this week, and has also travelled to Bangladesh and Myanmar in the neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-nepal-launch-construction-of-3rd-integrated-check-post-to-boost-trade/story-cpbd3yvuvHqA8fgBo8wRVM.html

In the ongoing third wave of the infection, the Capital has been adding 70-80 deaths per day on an average. This is the first time that the toll breached 100-mark. Even in June-July, when the Capital was under the grip of the first wave, the maximum number of deaths didn’t reach beyond 95. On June 16, 93 people died of Covid-19. In the last 24 hours, Delhi recorded 7,053 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday, a day after its daily Covid-19 tally breached the 8,000-mark. While the number of new infections reported on Thursday was lower than that of Wednesday, the number of people who were tested also decreased. On Wednesday, 64,121 tests were done, according to the government’s bulletin. On Thursday, 60,229 tests were conducted. The positivity rate in Delhi now stands at 11.71 per cent. Over 26,000 people are under home isolation now.Delhi has been witnessing an uptick in the number of cases with the onset of winter and pollution since the last week of October. The ongoing season of festivities has added to it as social distancing norms are being flouted and markets are almost back to their pre-Covid bustle. On Thursday, the Delhi High Court allowed the AAP government to reserve 80 per cent of beds in the intensive care units of the private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said the situation in the national Capital is fairly dynamic and the state has to be “much more alive” to the circumstances. It also noted that the government is doing everything under the Sun to “unlock things”.“Eighty to ninety per cent cases are recovering at home. Our home isolation policy was a successful model and had it not been implemented, it would not have been possible to handle such a massive surge in Covid-19 cases we are seeing today,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-covid-19-death-toll-in-24-hours-breaches-100-mark/story-Y6GoQWV63LhAPx3VM3nJQK.html

They have also agreed to have another round of the meeting soon,” Srivastava said.

12-11-2020||India||Odisha rights commission asks cop to pay Rs 5 lakh for filing false case||Nearly four years after two youths were arrested on trumped up charges of murdering a 19-year-old in Bargarh district, the Odisha Human Rights Commission asked the investigating police official to pay Rs 2.5 lakh compensation to each of the youths for misutilisation of his power that led to the two remaining in jail for about eight months.The Commission chairperson Justice BP Das and member Asim Amitabh Dash in their order said continuance of the police official was detrimental to the interest of general public as well as threat to common citizens.“Fairness and effectiveness in policing is important to anyone concerned about police work, police supervisors, policy makers and administrators. Yet we find a decorated police officer is lacking in these qualities. The officer brought immense embarrassment to the police organisation by forcing two persons to confess to a crime that they had not committed,” the OHRC said, asking the investigating official Prakash Kumar Karna to pay Rs 2.5 lakh each to Halu Gurla (26) and Raghab Naik (26), the two who were arrested in the case.During the 2019 Independence Day, Karna was awarded President’s Police Medal for gallantry.Jitu Dandasena, a 19-year-old youth of Piplipali village under Paikmal Police station of Bargarh district had gone missing from his home on December 7, 2016. An FIR was lodged by the man’s father on December 25. Paikmal police station inspector Prakash Kumar Karna who investigated the case arrested two men - Halu Gurla and Raghab Naik - in June 2017 on charges of murdering the boy and destruction of evidence though he could not find the body.The police official then filed a chargesheet in the local court on the basis of statement of the two accused under section 164 of CrPC, extra-judicial confession and identification of the spot in front of witnesses. The investigating police officer then got the two accused to confess that they had killed the youth and buried the body in the riverbed.However, the body could not be recovered.But Dandsena, who was allegedly murdered by the two youths, reappeared in a dramatic fashion at his home in May 2018. He revealed he was attacked by the two youths on December 7, 2016 and had become unconscious in the attack. He told his family that after gaining consciousness, he went to New Delhi where he worked in a catering firm instead of returning back home. He then shifted to Kolkata and started working in a band party. There he met an ice-cream seller who telephoned his family members about him.The youths then approached the OHRC complaining about the lackadaisical attitude of the police in investigating the case that violated their human rights.While castigating Karna for his lack of professionalism by turning a missing persons case to one of murder before recovery of the body, the OHRC said he might have used extra-judicial methods to get confessions out of the accused. “Extraction of a confession self-implicating a person in an offence which he has not committed shows the amount of pressure, may be physical or psychological, undergone by the victims and looking at the conduct of the investigating official, we do not rule out the extraction of confessional statement by means of physical assault and use of force during police custody. Otherwise, a person cannot self-implicate himself in a case where in trial, it may take him to the gallows,” the human rights panel said. Karna is now working as inspector in Kuchinda police station of Sambalpur district.The panel also took exception to the way the sub divisional police officer, the supervisory officer of the case, handled the whole thing. But it did not impose any penalty as he had retired from service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-rights-commission-asks-cop-to-pay-rs-5-lakh-for-filing-false-case/story-aqYlE8ZchNIrLxVw6jqPHI.html
12-11-2020||India||‘Only 12,270 votes’: What RJD’s new figure claims||The Rashtriya Janata Dal, which has been alleging foul play since the day of counting, on Thursday quoted Election Commission data to show that NDA was ahead only by 12,270 votes. Alleging that the administration machinery was deployed to make NDA win, the party said on the basis of only 12,270 votes, the administration ‘helped’ NDA win 15 seats. “To believe these numbers, check the 15 seats which were lost by a thin margin,” the RJD tweeted on Thursday. NDA को कुल वोट मिला- 157,00728महागठबंधन को कुल मिला- 156,88458कुल वोट का अंतर- 12270मात्र 12270 वोट के अंतर से प्रशासन ने एनडीए को 15 सीट ज़्यादा जीता दी। इस आँकड़े पर विश्वास करने के लिए कम मार्जिन से हारने वाली 15 सीटें और भाजपा आयोग के आँकड़े देख लीजिए। pic.twitter.com/AhpCErpLopFor the first time after the election results were declared late on November 10, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav offered his reaction. “I thank Bihar’s people. The mandate favoured Mahagathbandhan, but the Election Commission’s result was in NDA’s favour. This hasn’t happened first time. In 2015 when Mahagathbandhan was formed, votes were in our favour but BJP made back door entry to gain power,” Tejashwi said.On the day of the counting, several Congress and RJD leaders had alleged many Mahagathbandhan candidates were not given certificates though the Election Commission told them they had won. Later, they were told they lost. Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi were calling up district magistrates to not let Mahagathbandhan’s count go over 110, the party had earlier alleged. The Grand Alliance finished at 110, while the NDA alliance managed 125 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-12-270-votes-what-rjd-s-new-figure-claims/story-4svoS02me0XpcBT5YwZMJO.html

Statements issued by Biden’s transition team over the past two days said the president-elect had so far spoken on the phone with the leaders of France, Germany, Ireland, the UK, Australia, Japan and South Korea. Responding to a question at the weekly news briefing on a call between Modi and Biden, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said it would “happen in due course at a mutually convenient time”. He noted that the Prime Minister had congratulated Biden through a tweet on November 8 and also appreciated the president-elect’s contribution to strengthening India-US relations in his former capacity as vice president. Modi had also conveyed that he “looks forward to working with [Biden] to take India-US relations to greater heights”, Srivastava said. Srivastava said the foundation of the India-US relationship is strong and the comprehensive global strategic partnership between the two countries has bipartisan support from the Republican and Democratic parties in the US. “It has also been seen that every successive US president and administration has raised the status of these relations,” he said. Modi had tweeted separate congratulatory messages to Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris, the first woman and the first Indian American person to be elected to the position. Also Read | Groundwork done, Modi govt all set to deal with incoming Biden administration “Congratulations @JoeBiden on your spectacular victory!

Your success is pathbreaking, and a matter of immense pride not just for your chittis, but also for all Indian-Americans. I am confident that the vibrant India-US ties will get even stronger with your support and leadership,” Modi added. Biden’s outreach to and contacts with world leaders has been affected by the lack of cooperation from the outgoing Donald Trump administration, which has refused to accept the results of the US elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-biden-call-will-happen-in-due-course-external-affairs-ministry/story-Upphs7Ml7zWTHzcoNO5HjO.html
12-11-2020||India||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in war of words with Goa’s Pramod Sawant over Mollem track doubling project||A war of words took place on social media between the Chief Ministers of Delhi and Goa over Wednesday and Thursday, with Arvind Kejriwal accusing his Goan counterpart of ignoring local voices under “the Centre’s diktat”, in return being accused by Dr Pramod Sawant of doing “divisive politics”.The spat began on Twitter on Wednesday after Delhi Chief Minister responded to a news portal’s tweet citing Sawant, a BJP member, as saying that “Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should first fix issues of pollution in his area before getting worried about Goa.”There has been an ongoing feud in Goa between the ruling BJP and Kejriwal’s AAP over environmental issues.Responding to the news portal’s tweet, Kejriwal said, tagging the Goa CM, “It’s not about Delhi’s pollution vs Goa’s pollution. Both Delhi and Goa are dear to me. We are all one country. We all have to work together to ensure there is no pollution in both Delhi and Goa.”His Goan counterpart replied, “Dear Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal ji, we are making sure that there is no pollution issue in Goa and our government will ensure that our state remains pollution-free. I am sure the people of Delhi also want the same in their beautiful state.”The spat spilled over to Thursday when the Delhi CM raised the issue of a Railway track doubling project, which will pass through Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, and asked him to save Goa from becoming a “coal hub”.“It is heartening to hear that Dr Pramod Swanat ji. (But) Goans are opposing (the) double tracking project. Kindly hear their voice and save Mollem as they (sic) are the lungs of Goa. I understand the Centre is forcing this project on Goa. Please stand with Goans, say NO to Center and save Goa from becoming (a) coal hub,” tweeted Kejriwal on Thursday morning.The Goa CM replied to this by accusing Kejriwal of being an expert in “creating Center vs State issues”, and said the state will skip his advice.“Dear Arvind Kejriwal ji, Doubling of Railway tracks is a nation-building exercise. There is no threat to Mollem and we will ensure it remains that way. We will not allow Goa to become a coal hub. Knowing your expertise in creating Center vs State issues, we will skip your advice,” tweeted Sawant.Taking the matter further, the Delhi CM asked Sawant to listen to the local people’s voice as they have a “say in their own state”.“Dr Pramod Sawnat ji, you don’t need to listen to my advice but please listen to the voices of (the) Goans. Shouldn’t Goans have some say in their own state? Is Central diktat more important than (the) Goan voices?” Kejriwal asked.Replying, Sawant said, “Our feet and ears are firmly on the ground Arvind Kejriwal ji. Please stop your divisive politics of Center vs State. We are ONE NATION! Thank you.”As per reports, Goa residents have been protesting against the state government for allowing the expansion of a railway line through the protected areas in Mollem to increase the coal-carrying capacity of its Mormugao Port.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-in-war-of-words-with-goa-s-pramod-sawant-over-mollem-track-doubling-project/story-RWSU1bOPN9v9HQppmXvNaL.html
12-11-2020||India||‘Iconic structure’ planned near Yamuna as part of Central Vista project||The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) on Thursday announced a design competition to construct an “iconic structure” on the bank of the river Yamuna as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project to commemorate 75 years of independence.The structure would be part of the New India Gardens or the Nav Bharat Udyan that is proposed to come up on 20.22 acres on the western bank of Yamuna. It is expected to be unveiled to the public by August 15, 2022.A CPWD proposal dated November 12 said the structure so built must “realise the grand vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, symbolising emerging New India with equitable growth opportunities, rooted in values of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwaas and representing the aspiration of clean India, free from poverty, corruption, terrorism, communalism and casteism”.“The structure will be part of a complex that will also have facilities for entertainment and to showcase “India’s rich historical and cultural heritage,” the proposal stated.To be sure, the master plan submitted by Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd — the architecture firm that has been tasked with developing the Central Vista — included the construction of the New India Gardens near the Yamuna river, though the firm will not be involved in its construction.HCP has been tasked with redeveloping the Central Vista avenue, which includes building a new Parliament complex, also by August 15, 2022.According to the CPWD proposal, the new structure must come up on the central axis — which starts at the Rashtrapati Bhawan, moves on the central line between North and South Blocks and Rajpath and culminates at India Gate — thereby extending the axis from 2.9km to 6.3km.“Under the Master Plan, the Central Vista Axis will be extended from the present 2.9 km to 6.3 km from ridge to river. On the eastern side, it will culminate at the western bank of River Yamuna. This will restore the original design envisioned for the Central Vista,” the proposal stated.The Nav Bharat Udyan will be open to the public and will also have facilities such as the “Sphere of Unity”, “Milestones Walkway”, “Journey of India”, “Tech Dome”, “Amphitheatre” all of which are meant to showcase India’s heritage and scientific advancement and “to symbolise unity in diversity and aspirations of the New India”.The CPWD proposal mandated that only such material and technology should be used to build the structure that would endure like “Ashoka’s edicts, Iron Pillar in Qutub Minar complex etc.”As per the rules of the design competition, any Indian citizen or organisation is allowed to participate. It will include architects, architectural firms, students, student groups, architectural or planning schools / colleges and other institutions across India, or any combination of the above. All submissions have to be made by December 11 while the winners will be announced in the last week of December 2020.“The structure should be iconic in design and represent the national capital. For example, at present India Gate erected by the British in the Central Vista in the early 20th century prominently signifies Delhi. The proposed iconic structure being built in independent India should now become a new symbol of the national capital,” CPWD’s proposal said.The structure can be a tower or a sculpture or any other form besides a building that can be occupied, according to the rules.The maximum permissible height at the proposed site as per colour coded zonal map prepared by Airports Authority of India is 134 metres from the present ground level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iconic-structure-planned-near-yamuna-central-vista-length-to-double/story-UhTc80n4LDWgBetAZ1zVdO.html

The notice has been sent to global Vice President of Twitter, people familiar with development said. It also termed the mistake as an “deliberate attempt to undermine the will of sovereign Parliament of India” which had declared Ladakh as a Union Territory of India with its headquarters in Leh.Ministry in its notice sent to global Vice President of Twitter has mentioned that showing Leh as part of Jammu and Kashmir is a deliberate attempt by Twitter to undermine the will of sovereign Parliament of India which had declared Ladakh as a Union Territory of India with its headquarter in Leh. A Twitter spokesperson said they have responded to the letter and shared a comprehensive update with the government. “Twitter remains committed to partnering with the Government of India and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to serve the public conversation. We have duly responded to the letter and, as part of our correspondence, shared a comprehensive update with the latest developments regarding the geo-tag issue,” the spokesperson said. This goof-up adds to series of mistakes that Twitter has recently done in geo-tagging. Earlier, Twitter had shown Leh as part of China after which secretary, Ministry of Electronics & IT had written to Twitter CEO raising an objection. In response, Twitter had rectified the error. But it has not yet corrected the map to show Leh as part of Union Territory of Ladakh, the ministry said.Recently, a parliamentary committee reviewing India’s privacy bill observed that Twitter’s explanation on showing Ladakh as part of China was inadequate.

12-11-2020||India||‘BJP uses everything to win elections’: Akhilesh Yadav alleges irregularities in Bihar polls||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday alleged irregularities in the Bihar Assembly polls and claimed that the opposition Grand Alliance was poised to win the election but “could not do so at the last moment”.“We wanted to talk about the irregularities done with us (in Uttar Pradesh), but a more serious one has happened in Bihar. Tejashwi Yadav was poised to make his government but could not do so at the last moment. All those who have faith in democratic values are unhappy today and asking if this is how elections will be fought,” he told reporters here.Yadav claimed that with only 14,000 more votes, the opposition alliance would have emerged as victorious in Bihar. “The Bihar election was more nail-biting than the US (presidential) polls. I do not know which trick the BJP used. This is the speciality of the BJP,” the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said.He said elections today have become mathematics.“The BJP uses everything to win elections. I can give an example and also play a video to prove as to how all the officials, from the DM to police, were involved (in Uttar Pradesh). At some places, even during the checking of the body temperature while the voters were going in to cast their votes, they were threatened that such a temperature would be shown which would directly shift them to a hospital and ambulances were also deployed,” Yadav said.He asserted that the SP would not leave the path of development come what may and claimed that the party’s schemes were being repackaged by the current BJP-led government.“I can say it on record that we had given farmers and women pension. Maximum bank accounts and bank branches were opened during the SP regime and online transfer of money had also started, but this government only indulges in publicity and we will also do the same now,” Yadav said.He also hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh for its claims of giving 50 lakh jobs, asking it to name the departments where these jobs were provided. He also asked what happened to the claims of investments worth over Rs four lakh crore in the state, as claimed by the government.“When the time comes, we will bring a scheme and spell out the details of where we will be giving jobs to youngsters,” the SP president said.At least three farmers of Ayodhya also spoke at the press conference and recounted their problems at the hands of officials over land acquisition in their villages for the Sri Ram Airport and development of Ayodhya.They alleged that the officials were harassing them for signing the agreement under which their land is being acquired at very low rates. They also said they met Chief Minister Adityanath over the issue, after which the atrocities of the officials went up.Assuring all possible help from his party to the farmers of Dharampur, Ganja and Kutia gram sabhas who recounted their problems, Yadav said the government is taking land for a pious work and needs to show a big heart and revise the circle rate as there is never any dearth of money for it to serve people.He said the compensation amount for the farmers of these villages should be six times more than what they are being offered.Citing the example of the Agra-Lucknow expressway, the SP leader said the land for it was acquired after giving compensation to the satisfaction of the farmers.

12-11-2020||India||Rajasthan: Gurjar stir over reservation called off||A major Gurjar organisation on Thursday called off its 11-day agitation over reservation in jobs and education after reaching a consensus with the Rajasthan government, a community leader said.The protesters had been squatting on a rail track in Bharatpur’s Bayana affecting traffic on the Delhi-Mumbai rail route.They had also blocked the Hindaun-Bayana road.The Gurjars vacated the railway track early Thursday morning after the agreement with the state government was read out to them by their leaders, police said. Gurjar leader Vijay Bainsla said the fish plates uprooted by the protesters had been put back in place. A fish plate is a metal bar bolted to the ends of two rails to join them together in a track. “We came to an agreement with the state government... Community has agreed to the settlement. We are vacating the track. Trains will resume soon,”.The Gurjar Aarakshan Sangarsh Samiti has agreed to the government’s proposal of giving Rs. 5 lakh compensation and a government job to a family member of those who died in police action in the different agitations over the years, granting regular pay scale to 1,252 candidates who have completed a two-year probation in government jobs, and withdrawal of police cases against protesters.  The government has also agreed to implement the agreement reached between the two sides in February 2020 apart from constituting a committee for pending recruitment, and approving more beds in girls hostel in Jaipur.Meanwhile, mobile internet services, which were suspended in parts of the state due to the agitation, were restored following the announcement to call off the stir. After a marathon meeting with a ministerial group on Wednesday, the Gurjar delegation, including Col Kirori Singh Bainsla, met Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.However, the delegation had said on Wednesday night that they would take a decision on calling off the agitation at the protest site in Bayana. “A consensus has been reached over the demands with the state government. We have trust that the government will work on the agreement. However, we will take a decision on the calling off of the agitation at the protest site,” Vijay Bainsla had said after the meeting.On October 31, a delegation of the Gurjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti held discussions with a Cabinet sub-committee in Jaipur, in which a consensus had emerged on 14 points but it was not accepted by Kirori Singh Bainsla and his supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-gurjar-stir-over-reservation-called-off/story-rxnxEZrglRceWxXROXXhJP.html
12-11-2020||India||Court allows video medical check-up for jailed activist Varavara Rao||A division bench of the Bombay High Court has directed the government of Maharashtra and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to arrange for a video medical consultation by doctors of Nanavati Hospital for 81-year-old Telugu poet P Varavara Rao, in jail since 2018 in connection with the Elgar Parishad case. The court directed that the consultation should take place on Thursday or on early Friday morning, and that the report should be submitted to the court on November 16. The court also directed doctors from Nanavati hospital and the state that if they were unable to ascertain Rao’s medical condition then they should visit Taloja jail or arrange for some doctor to check up on the activist. The bench, comprising justices AK Menon and SP Tavade, was also hearing a writ petition filed by P Hemlatha, Rao’s wife. Senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for Rao, informed the court that there was an urgency to hear the petition because a co-inmate of Rao from Taloja prison had talked to Hemlata on Wednesday and informed her that Rao’s health was deteriorating fast. The NIA, in its affidavit, confirmed that the health of Rao was not good but the doctors at Taloja jail were regularly checking his condition and providing all necessary treatment. In light of these facts, Jaising sought Rao to be transferred back to Nanavati Hospital from Taloja prison. “There is a legitimate apprehension that Rao will lose his life if he continues to be kept in Taloja jail. The court was not informed about Rao being shifted out of Nanavati Hospital to Taloja jail. No medical report has been submitted after July 30,” argued Jaising. “Condition of detention cannot be cruel, inhuman and degrading. But it is in the case of Rao. It is violating his rights under article 21 and 32 of the constitution. If he dies in jail it will be a case of custodial death,” said Jaisingh. The lawyer then sought an interim order to get Rao back in Nanavati Hospital and also to constitute an independent board of doctors to assess the condition of Rao and submit its report in the court. To a question by the bench on “why not have a board before shifting to Nanavati Hospital”, Jaising responded “Taloja prison does not have the wherewithal”. Jaising went on to criticise the affidavit filed by NIA and said, “It does not mention his current health condition but only talks about his crime and UAPA. The NIA has not done its homework while preparing the affidavit. It seems the affidavit is intended to prejudice the court.” Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for the NIA, and chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare however refuted the allegations of Jaising and said that the doctors at Taloja jail were regularly keeping a check on Rao’s condition. Thakare also submitted a medical report of November 12 wherein it was stated that all checks had been conducted in consultation with Nanavati hospital doctors. Singh further added that the agency was concerned about the health of Rao and hence had him shifted him to Nanavati hospital based on the request of the family of Rao. He added that the family had been given video calling access to Rao as and when they had requested it, hence the allegations by Jaising were not valid. Rao was first taken to JJ Hospital on May 28 after he fell unconscious, but was discharged on June 1. The family had alleged that Rao was discharged in a hurried manner to obstruct his bail plea. “He was not normal at the time of discharge. While Sodium normal range was 134-145, he attained only 133 and potassium normal range was 3.5 to 5.0, he attained only 3.55, according to the hospital record. But, later on June 2 it was proved that all this – admission in hospital, getting a normal report, getting him discharged – was part of conspiracy by the police. June 2 was the date of hearing on his bail application on health grounds in the NIA Special Sessions Court and police argued against his bail showing this hospital “normal” report. The judge accepted that and refused bail on June 26,” the family had then issued a statement Rao continued to show signs of delirium and after voices were raised from various quarters, Rao was admitted to JJ Hospital again on July 13. Later he was shifted to St George’s Hospital after he tested positive for Covid-19. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) also intervened and issued notices to the Maharashtra government asking it to ensure Rao is taken care of and adequate medical facilities are arranged. It had also asked for a report on Rao’s health.

The latest to celebrate the connection is Perumapalayam village in Erode district of Tamil Nadu which is proud of Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases expert, internist and epidemiologist who has been appointed to the American President-elect’s 12-member Covid-19 transition advisory board.Gounder’s father, Raj Gounder was born into a poor farming family in this village and later migrated to the US in the 1960s. According to his family members, Raj Gounder studied under street lights and is the first graduate of the village. After his death in 2014, the family set up the Raj Gounder Foundation in his hometown to support education for children. Celine Gounder, 43 had come to the village last in 2018. Accompanied by her husband Grant Wahl, a sports journalist, she inaugurated a smart classroom facility at her father’s alma mater- Modakurichi Government Boys School.On Tuesday night, Gounder spoke to her second cousin Devaraj Nallasivam on a video call about how the team hasn’t officially spoken to the American press but she was swamped with interview requests from Tamil news outlets. “Celine wishes her father could see that she has been given such an important responsibility,” said Nallasivam who is also secretary of the Foundation. “At least one family member visits us every year to maintain close ties. The entire village gathers at our home and Celine speaks a few Tamil words.” Besides supporting her father’s school, the trust also provides daily meals to an adjacent special school that includes children with autism and other developmental disabilities. “Since schools are closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have been delivering groceries to their homes,” said Nallasivam.Gounder is currently a faculty at the school of medicine in New York University. In 2015, she volunteered as an Ebola aid worker in Guinea and is an expert commentator on Ebola, Zika and opioid abuse epidemics for American news outlets.American politician and New York City public advocate, Jumaane William tweeted that he received guidance from Gounder to develop the Covid-19 police responses and now, “the nation can benefit”. She studied TB and HIV in South Africa, Ethiopia and Brazil between 1998 and 2012. “She is service oriented,” says Nallasivam. “She also conducts research on genetic diseases in our village during her visits.” Gounder’s aim is to work for underserved populations through the public health system.Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami congratulated Gounder and another Indian-origin American Vivek Murthy for being part of the virus taskforce. With good wishes pouring in from Tamil Nadu and also questions about her last name-- a caste name (a politically influential community in the AIADMK), Gounder said her father had changed his name from Natarajan to Gounder as Americans had difficulty pronouncing it. My name is part of my history and identity, “even if some of that history is painful,” tweeted Gounder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/celine-gounder-member-of-biden-s-covid-19-taskforce-runs-trust-for-kids-in-dad-s-tn-village/story-CKaR3kVqW2potIflYAcNgP.html
12-11-2020||India||Russia to consider India’s request for speedy delivery of S-400 air defence systems||Russia will attempt to comply with any Indian request to expedite the delivery of five S-400 air defence systems, with the first batch scheduled to be handed over to New Delhi by the end of 2021, a Russian diplomat said on Thursday. The two countries are also close to finalising a deal for Ka-226 multi-purpose helicopters that will ensure the highest possible amount of localisation of components in line with the Make in India and AatmaNirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiatives, Russia’s deputy chief of mission Roman Babushkin said. The $5.4-billion deal for the S-400 air defence systems is being implemented according to schedule and the first batch will reach India by the end of next year. “If there is a request from the Indian side to expedite [the] S-400 [delivery], we will be ready to do our best to satisfy this requirement,” Babushkin said. Also Read: Escalation of India-China tensions will hit regional stability; need to negotiate settlement: RussiaThe India-China border standoff has spurred calls from some quarters for seeking the expedited delivery of the air defence systems despite the possibility of US sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). India made the first payment of $850 million for the S-400s last year and New Delhi and Moscow have worked out a comprehensive system to insulate payments from US sanctions. Babushkin said India and Russia are very close to finalising the deal for supplying 200 Kamov Ka-226 helicopters, 140 of which will be produced in India with “maximum possible level of localisation”. The $2-billion deal is “at the final stages of consideration”, he added. The two sides are also negotiating the contract for the production of more than 700,000 Kalashnikov AK-203 assault rifles by a joint venture and advanced cooperation on the Su-30MKI jets, T-90 main battle tanks, frigates, submarines and missiles. Russia will have a large presence at the Aero India 2021 expo in Bengaluru and is also working towards the early implementation of an agreement on joint production of spare parts for Russian-origin military harware. Besides partnering India to supply military systems such as the BrahMos cruise missile to third countries, Russia is working on a mutual logistics support agreement and on strengthening maritime cooperation, including in the Indian Ocean, Babushkin said. Referring to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad that includes India, Australia, Japan and the US and the Malabar naval exercise by these four countries, Babushkin said Moscow has no doubts about New Delhi’s approach for promoting “inclusive maritime, connectivity, disaster management, blue economy and humanitarian cooperation in the Indian and Pacific Oceans”. However, the understanding of the Indo-Pacific strategy among member states of the Quad is different, and a “comprehensive, all-inclusive, open-minded and forward-looking dialogue” is required on the issue, he said. Russia is also opposed to “restricted security blocs and imposing forced changes in supply chains for geopolitical reasons,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-to-consider-india-s-request-for-speedy-delivery-of-s-400-air-defence-systems/story-GfTHsRVMB4JOEivinm9gZL.html

It directed the government to close firecracker shops and penalise those who violate the ban.The court asked the government to give wide publicity to content on ill-effects of bursting firecrackers during the pandemic via electronic and print media.Also read | Delhi’s air quality improves, may deteriorate again over Diwali weekend“The court agreed with the contentions that the pollution from the crackers would escalate the spread of Covid-19 and that was precisely why many other states have banner firecrackers,” said Prakash.The court backed the argument that since people were frequently using alcohol-based sanitisers, bursting of crackers during Diwali would pose an additional threat.“Moreover, physical distancing is not possible during the celebrations. Children and senior citizens are more vulnerable since it is not possible to identify people who are already affected by the virus,” Prakash said.Advocate general B S Prasad told the court the government had not so far taken any decision on banning firecrackers. He added necessary steps would be taken as per the National Green Tribunal’s guidelines.The court posted the case for the next hearing on November 19 when the government has been asked to file a report on the measures taken to implement the ban and the penalties awarded to the violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diwali-telangana-high-court-orders-ban-on-sale-bursting-of-firecrackers/story-WLhP1BoF5U1HlsznCSbIRM.html

Nobody was injured in the attack even as the windows of one car were completely smashed. The attackers also waved black flags and raised “go back” slogans.Ghosh, who was on a three-day tour to North Bengal, blamed the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers for the attack even as it insisted it was staged.“Such attacks are not new to me. Several of my cars were vandalised in the past. The TMC is scared of our growth. It knows that its days are numbered. These attacks cannot stop the BJP,” Ghosh said.Tourism minister Gautam Deb denied TMC’s involvement in the incident. “The attack was staged because the BJP wants to stay in the limelight. Our party does not believe in violence.”Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar condemned the incident. “No political leader should face such attacks. This is deplorable,” Dhankhar said.BJP’s state youth wing president Saumitra Khan said they will stage demonstrations in all towns against the attack.Minister Firhad Hakim said whoever is involved in the incident will face action. “I condemn the attack but our party is not involved in this.”Kuntal Banerjee, additional superintendent of police, Alipurduar, refused to comment on the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stones-thrown-at-state-bjp-chief-s-convoy-in-north-bengal-black-flags-shown/story-sEw1WV6wAh7kuLUMtZunFK.html
12-11-2020||India||Uttar Pradesh set to get 18 new air quality monitoring stations||The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has begun the process of setting up 18 new Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) in eight cities of the state.Five such air quality monitoring stations will come up in Agra, one each in Mathura and Firozabad, two each in Lucknow and Kanpur besides three each in Varanasi and Prayagraj. One station will also be set up in Gorakhpur, said UPPCB regional officer (Prayagraj) Pradeep Kumar Vishwakarma.The move comes when air pollution in different cities of the country and the state are at an all-time high.At present, the state has 25 Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations in 13 cities, including four each in Ghaziabad, Lucknow and Noida, three in Meerut, two in Greater Noida, besides one each in Agra, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Kanpur, Moradabad, Muzaffarnagar and Varanasi, he added.All 18 new air quality monitoring stations would be set up on land provided by UPPCB. Five of them would come up with funds provided by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change and 10 from funds provided by the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). The one in Gorakhpur would be set up through UPPCB’s own resources, officials said.The UPPCB member-secretary, on behalf of the board, has already invited international bids for these high-end 24x7 monitoring stations, which would be connected to a data centre to come up at the UPPCB headquarters in Lucknow and provide real-time data regarding the Air Quality Index (AQI) at any given moment, Vishwakarma added.UPPCB officials said the plan was to award a single bidder the responsibility of “supply, installation and commissioning” of all 18 air quality monitoring stations in these eight cities where in they would have to depute one technician at each site to manage it besides a project officer and a data processor. The responsibility of managing these stations would be awarded to the bidder for a period of five years, they added. As part of the initiative, one daylight and night visible data display system will also be installed near the station to display air quality readings. AQI is a tool for effective communication of air quality status to people in terms which are easy to understand. It transforms complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number (index value), nomenclature and colour. There are six AQI categories, namely good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor and severe. Each of these categories is decided based on ambient concentration values of air pollutants and their likely health impacts, known as health breakpoints.Air quality sub-index and health breakpoints are evolved for eight pollutants — PM10, PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), ammonia (NH3) and lead (Pb) — for which short-term (up to 24 hours) National Ambient Air Quality Standards are prescribed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-set-to-get-18-new-air-quality-monitoring-stations/story-8HMCBzVXJYluBLbqmccDsO.html
12-11-2020||India||Mumbai court gives bail to Rana Kapoor’s daughter Roshni in Yes Bank case||Amagistrate court here on Thursday granted bail to Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoors daughter Roshni Kapoor, an accused in the Yes Bank fraud case linked to DHFL, after she appeared before the court in response to summons issued to her.Roshni Kapoor was summoned by the court last month in connection with the case. She is one of the eight accused named in the charge sheet filed in the case by the CBI.Roshini Kapoor was granted bail by a magistrate’s court, her lawyer Subash Jadhav said.In June this year, the CBI filed the charge sheet against Rana Kapoor and others under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act and Indian Penal Code.However, the charges of corruption were dropped by the special CBI court as the prosecution did not obtain the sanction needed to prosecute under the PC Act.Thus, the case was shifted to the magistrate court for trial.The magistrate court last month accepted the charge sheet filed by the CBI and issued summons to all the accused who are not arrested in the case, including Roshni Kapoor and four other companies DHFL, Belief Realtors Pvt Ltd, RKW Project PVT Ltd, DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd.Responding to the summons, Roshni Kapoor appeared before the magistrate court and sought bail.As per the central agency, in return for investment in Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) debentures by Yes Bank, companies controlled by Rana Kapoor and his family members allegedly got undue benefits.The scam started between April and June 2018, when the Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of the scam-hit DHFL, the CBI has alleged.In return, DHFL promoters (Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan) allegedly “paid kickback of Rs 600 crore” in the form of loans to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, a firm controlled by Kapoor’s wife and daughters, it has claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-court-gives-bail-to-rana-kapoor-s-daughter-roshni-in-yes-bank-case/story-2Mka0DfEPOHUeV8fM3jJNM.html

It was just a matter of time before he surrendered. He was left with no other option but to give up arms,” the top police officer said.Chandranathan said the militant had earlier narrowly escaped twice this year in encounters with the state police.Also Read: Four days on, hope fades for families of those trapped in Assam’s Kopili hydel project“We had missed him twice this year. In the latest encounter, one of his bodyguards was injured but he had escaped unhurt,” the police chief said.There are five-six pending cases against Rajkhowa and the Meghalaya Police will pursue legally to get him for trial in the state, he said.“We are bringing him here for the heinous crimes he had committed, including murder and extortion,” Chandranathan said.Rajkhowa had contacted his wife in Assam and directed her to get the Army involved for his “safe” surrender as he did not trust the Meghalaya Police, a source told PTI.While the Army was discreetly transporting Rajkhowa and his four other aides to Assam in civilian vehicles after their surrender, the Meghalaya Police stopped them in East Garo Hills district around 6 pm on Wednesday evening, he said.“It is then that Rajkhowa reportedly told a senior police officer that he had earlier thought of surrendering but decided against it because every time he came across the police in Garo Hills, an exchange of fire would ensue,” the source said.He admitted to having been present during the Bolbokgre encounter in Rongara area of South Garo Hills district two weeks ago and said Bangladesh was no longer a safe haven for him, the source said.Born Manoj Rabha in Assam’s Goalpara district, 50- year-old Dhrishti Rajkhowa alias Bura Dada is believed to have personally trained several top insurgents in the Garo Hills region in jungle warfare, besides providing several militant outfits with arms and ammunition in exchange for money.The Meghalaya government had formed a 10 company- strong counter-insurgency force, Special Force (SF) 10, in 2014 to fight the militants. Since then, it has neutralised several top insurgents in the region, including Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA)’s self-proclaimed ‘commander-in-chief’ Sohan D Shira in February, 2018.Rajkhowa had narrowly escaped death during Shira’s encounter as he had gone to a stream for a bath, the ULFA (I) militant told the Meghalaya Police on Wednesday evening, as per the source.He, along with four other ULFA (I) militants, surrendered before an Army team from Assam at Dilsengre village near the India-Bangladesh border and laid down an AK- 81 assault rifle, two 9 mm pistols and 107 cartridges.Of late, militancy in Meghalaya was largely concentrated in the Garo Hills region. However, many GNLA insurgents have laid down arms following the deployment of SF-10 commandos in the region.Other militant outfits like ANVC, ANVC-B and the UALA have signed a peace agreement with the Meghalaya government, while Khasi Hills-based group HNLC, with a cadre strength of less than 20, is considered largely inactive and has not been involved in subversive activities for many years, sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-ulfa-militant-s-surrender-marks-end-of-insurgency-in-meghalaya-dgp/story-G6zsMqKOvaimvkwfPuXPDK.html

So far, there has been no adverse impact reported during the trials in India. SII has announced the completion of the enrolment of participants in phase 3, which is also the final phase of trial. But this is not the end. The Pune-based pharma company will soon move to produce other vaccine shots.In an interview to Washington Post, Adar Poonawalla has revealed that he has put $250 million of his family’s fortune. In the interview, Adar has said his father Cyrus Poonawalla, who is known as the vaccine king of India, was one of the early critics who doubted where putting so much money won’t be much of a gamble. “He said: ‘Look, it’s your money. If you want to blow it up, fine.’” Adar Poonawalla recounted his father’s first reaction. In the interview, Adar has also busted two vaccine myths: one, there will be one successful vaccine candidate which will ensure immunity for a definite period of time, two, the world will be immunized two, three years. He said it won’t be done until 2024, and there will be no one vaccine. The immunity period that a vaccine could assure is still darkness, Adar has said.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Adar decided to go all out. According to his plan, after Covishield (the Oxford vaccine), there will be at least one vaccine every quarter. The Poonawallas have floated a new company as well — Serum Institute of Life Sciences which will focus on research and development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-you-want-to-blow-your-money-up-what-adar-poonawalla-s-father-told-him-before-he-took-covid-19-vaccine-gamble/story-WmtmhJ1hbNwFnT2A3ehkkO.html
12-11-2020||India||‘No impediment in correcting DOB in records of birth,’ says Bombay High Court||Observing that there is no legal impediment in correcting the date of birth, recorded in the Register of Births and Deaths, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court has directed the Registrar of Births and Deaths at Nagpur to correct the date of birth and maiden surname of a Dombivli resident.“After going through the rule (Rule 11(1) of the Maharashtra Registration of Births and Deaths Rules, 2000), we find that a clerical or formal error made in the register can be corrected by the competent authority upon the satisfaction that such error has genuinely occurred,” said the bench of Justice RK Deshpande and Justice Pushpa Ganediwala, while allowing the belated claim of Dombivli resident Archana Tamhane.The 67-year-old had approached the Registrar of Births and Deaths at Nagpur for correction in her date of birth and maiden surname, as the US administration had denied her a green card due to discrepancies in her maiden surname and the date of birth, as recorded in her birth certificate and in her school and employment records.She had applied to the Registrar on February 6, 2020 complaining that her maiden surname was wrongly recorded as “Kotawat” in her birth certificate, instead of “Kotwal” and her date of birth was recorded as January 23, 1954, instead of January 24, 1954.The Registrar rejected her application on March 24, 2020, stating that her claim for change in the date of birth cannot be entertained; this compelled her to approach the high court.Tamhane’s counsel, advocate AD Mohgaonkar, submitted that there was no legal prohibition on correcting date of birth in the register. He pointed out the provision contained in Rule 11(1) of the Maharashtra Registration of Births and Deaths Rules, 2000 allows corrections in date of birth.Responding to the petition, the Registrar agreed to correct the maiden surname of the petitioner. He, however, strenuously opposed the prayer; taking a stand that relevancy is attached to public record under Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act. Besides, the Registrar also relied on the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on June 30, 2015 and instructions issued by the Maharashtra health department on November 17, 2015, to the effect that date of birth recorded in the register cannot be corrected.HC refused to accept this stand, especially in view of the Rule 11(1), and held that the rule allows corrections in date of birth as well. The bench said the petitioner was born in the early hours on January 24, 1954, and therefore it is obvious that her date of birth is wrongly recorded in the register as January 23, 1954, and directed the Registrar to make the corrections in her birth record and issue her corrected birth certificate.As regards the delay on the part of the petitioner in approaching the Registrar, the bench said no time limit was prescribed under the Rules for making the corrections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-impediment-in-correcting-dob-in-records-of-birth-says-bombay-high-court/story-GCD2y21sBRGKVSaW5qt9LM.html

12-11-2020||India||India, Philippines to sign deal on BrahMos missile during summit next year||India and the Philippines are looking to sign an agreement on the BrahMos cruise missile during a planned summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Rodrigo Duterte next year, making the Southeast Asian country the first customer for the weapons system developed jointly by New Delhi and Moscow. A team from BrahMos Aerospace, the New Delhi-based India-Russia joint venture that produces the weapons system, is expected to visit Manila by December to sort out a few remaining issues for the deal to supply the missiles to the Philippines Army’s first Land Based Missile System Battery, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Thursday. “The BrahMos team is expected to iron out a few kinks and address some small issues so that the deal can be signed during the upcoming summit. Everything else has been worked out,” one of the people cited above said. Though dates for the summit between Modi and Duterte are yet to be finalised, the meeting is expected to be held in February. Several other agreements, including on cooperation between India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and its Philippines counterpart, ICT, and air rights, are also expected to be signed during the meeting, the people said. India and the Philippines were initially expected to sign a defence cooperation and procurement agreement, which would have covered the BrahMos deal, during the virtual meeting of the joint commission on bilateral cooperation co-chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Teodoro Locsin Jr on November 6. However, the signing couldn’t go ahead as planned because of a formality, the people said. “One of the signing authorities wasn’t available and it was only a formality,” said the person cited above. Hindustan Times had first reported in December last year that the Philippines was set to become the first country to buy the BrahMos cruise missile system. Though both sides were keen on finalising a deal earlier this year, the matter was hit by developments related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Russia’s deputy chief of mission Roman Babushkin also said on Thursday that India and Russia plan to gradually increase the range of the BrahMos and begin exporting the missile to “third countries, starting with the Philippines”. The Philippines Army zeroed in on the BrahMos after extensive trials and much of the negotiations had revolved around the cost of the system and financing for the deal. The supersonic cruise missile with a range of about 500 km will equip the Philippines Army’s first Land Based Missile System Battery, which was raised and activated in October last year. The Philippines Army expects this battery to be fully ready and for all the equipment to be acquired by 2024. According to the plans, the battery will be fully capable of defending the Philippines against external threats by 2028. However, some of the recent discussions have focused on the $100-million line of credit offered by India to the Philippines for defence purchases, particularly because of Manila’s perception that the amount should be increased, the people said. The Philippines side has also noted that India has offered larger lines of credit for defence equipment to other Southeast Asian countries, the people added. India has been in talks with several countries, including Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, over the past few years to sell them land and sea-based versions of the BrahMos. A BrahMos team visited a state-run shipyard in Surabaya in 2018 to assess the fitting of the missile on Indonesian warships. In recent years, the Philippines has concluded several deals with India for personal protective items or bulletproof gear and armour plating for military vehicles. During Modi’s visit to the Philippines in 2017, the two sides signed an MoU on defence industry and logistics cooperation to provide a framework for the development, production and procurement of defence hardware.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-philippines-to-sign-deal-on-brahmos-missile-during-summit-next-year/story-4a2IiARMr9EFEU2d8FKqDK.html

12-11-2020||India||How ULFA-I top commander surrendered after a 9-year-long effort by army officer||The untiring efforts of an officer of the Indian Army’s military intelligence (MI) wing for the past nine years came good following the surrender of outlawed United Liberation Front of Assam-Independent’s (ULFA-I) deputy commander-in-chief (C-in-C) Drishti Rajkhowa in neighbouring Meghalaya on Wednesday. Rajkhowa alias Manoj Rabha, an expert in rocket propelled grenade (RPG), was ranked next to ULFA-I C-in-C Paresh Baruah. His surrender, along with four other cadres, and laying down their arms and ammunition is likely to be a rude jolt to the separatist outfit, which has been fighting for Assam’s sovereignty since 1979. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had banned the insurgent group in 1990 citing it as a terrorist organisation.“Rajkhowa has been a loyal functionary of the organisation for many years. His surrender was the outcome of circumstances and was done with permission from the outfit. The health condition of his wife was also an important factor that led to the surrender,” Baruah told local TV channels in Guwahati over the phone from an undisclosed location abroad. MI sources said one of its Lieutenant (Lt) Colonel (Col) had managed to establish contact with Rajkhowa and his wife in 2011, when the officer was posted as a Captain in Shillong. Rajkhowa was promoted as deputy C-in-C by Baruah in November 2011 soon after a split in the outfit, when ULFA chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and several other senior cadres decided to give up arms and engage in talks with the government. “He (the officer) maintained contact (with Rajkhowa) during his posting in the north-east and gradually developed a rapport with him over the last nine years at his own personal risk and safety,” MI sources said. The officer kept persuading Rajkhowa over the years to give up arms and join the mainstream in a bid to help his native state and its people. The officer managed to make the breakthrough because of the rapport he had developed with Rajkhowa’s immediate family members. Rajkhowa relented and agreed to surrender also largely because of his wife’s worsening health condition. An elaborate plan was put in place for the surrender exercise. The inputs were shared with the Assam-based 21st Mountain Division of Indian Army through director-general of MI (DGMI) on Tuesday (November 10)Rajkhowa contacted the officer and reiterated his decision to surrender along with four of his bodyguards. He requested for safe passage in an MI vehicle and under Indian Army’s protection from his hideout -- near the India-Bangladesh at Baghmara in Meghalaya’s South Garo Hills district -- till Guwahati. “The input was shared with DGMI and further communicated to the Indian Army’s Eastern Command headquarters in Kolkata. The officer coordinated the operation, which was launched at 2 am on Wednesday (November 11), to take Rajkhowa into military custody and pave the way for his surrender,” MI sources informed. The operation lasted for around 12 hours. ULFA-1 cadres turned over an Avtomat Kalashnikova (AK)-81 assault rifle, two magazines and two pistols to the security forces. “This operation is a game-changer as far as the north-east insurgency is concerned. The officer deserves kudos for his relentless pursuit. He managed to persuade Rajkhowa to surrender at great personal risk. He is worthy of special mention and recognition,” the MI sources added. Rajkhowa, who was based in neighbouring Bangladesh, was responsible for carrying out several operations in the past years and was also the main conduit of providing arms to several active militant groups in the volatile north-east region. His surrender is expected to further weaken Baruah, who is believed to be based in China’s Yunnan province, and frequently travels to several nations in south-east Asia.Rajkhowa’s exit from the outfit could prompt others to follow suit, as the insurgent group is believed to be left with only around 200 hardened cadres. Indian Army officials followed the protocol and handed over Rajkhowa to Meghalaya Police authorities, who turned him to Assam Police on Thursday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-ulfa-i-top-commander-surrendered-after-a-9-year-long-effort-by-army-officer/story-CDulPcJFY6mWiCkofyE4YM.html

The phone, which the accused used to call the bike-seller, was also a stolen one, the police said. The accused has been arrested from North 24 Parganas district, around 30 km north of Kolkata. A senior officer of the Kolkata Police’s detective department said that Chandradeep Singh, 34, a doctor with a state-run hospital, wanted to sell his motorbike. He gave an advertisement for it on an online selling platform. Thereafter, he received a call from the accused Gouranga Kirtania who showed interest in purchasing the motorbike. On October 2, the duo met at Jadavpur in south suburban Kolkata. Kirtania wanted a test drive to which Singh readily agreed. “But the accused, on the pretext of taking a test drive, fled with the motorbike. When Singh realised that he has been duped, he lodged a complaint with the Kolkata Police,” said the officer. Investigation revealed that the SIM card from which Kirtania called the doctor belongs to a rickshaw puller, who stays in Dum Dum in the northern fringes of the city. Interrogating the rickshaw puller, police learnt that Kirtania had hired his rickshaw a few days ago. “He took the rickshaw puller’s mobile phone on the pretext of making a call and stole the SIM card. The rickshaw puller realized it much later,” said a senior police officer. The mobile number was put under surveillance and it was found that Kirtania was using it from another mobile. Police tracked Kirtania and he was arrested earlier this week. “Interrogation further revealed that the phone from which he made calls was also stolen. The bike was also recovered,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-steals-rickshaw-puller-s-sim-card-later-uses-it-to-dupe-bike-seller/story-AjfxfNjKrL6rsbfwZGrCEL.html

An announcement on reopening schools will be made later based on the situation,” the government said based on the feedback received from parents.After chief minister K Palaniswami said on October 31 that schools and colleges would be allowed to reopen from November 16, DMK president M K Stalin hit out at the government for its “hasty” announcement.The leader of the opposition had said that a decision on reopening schools should be taken only in January 2021 after analysing the pandemic scenario. A section of parents also expressed apprehension over starting classes for 9-12 since the pandemic had not faded yet and extent to which students could adhere to measures against the spread of virus in schools. As on November 11, a total of 7,50,409 people had tested positive for Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu out of which 7,20,339 recovered. While 18,655 was the number of active cases, the death toll stood at 11,415.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-in-tamil-nadu-to-remain-shut-govt-puts-reopening-plan-on-hold/story-CCUqqL5LHFhA9eQLolMYMI.html

Mr Modi’s actions have turned India’s strength into its weakness,” Gandhi tweeted on Thursday. He attached a news report along with the tweet which talked about the state of India’s economy.In an article in Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monthly bulletin released on Wednesday, an official said that India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is likely to contract by 8.6 per cent for the July-September period, which means India will enter into a recession for the first time in history in the first half of this fiscal with two successive quarters of negative growth due to the Covid-19 pandemic. India has entered into recession for the first time in history.

Jeena was shifted to Delhi’s Sir Gangaram Hospital a few days ago when his condition deteriorated. Offering condolences to his family, BJP state president Bansidhar Bhagat termed him a ‘very energetic and young’ party member and MLA of the party. “He was always active in organisation activities. Due to his dynamic personality, he was popular among all sections of the society. His passing away has left a void...Our prayers are with his family members,” said Bhagat. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat also offered his condolences to Jeena’s family through social media. He said, “A few weeks ago, I had visited him when his wife passed away. He was one of the few active MLAs in the assembly and always worked for the development of his constituency.Our prayers are with his family and we all stand with them at this moment of grief.”Following his demise, BJP has cancelled its Diwali celebrations in the state. Jeena’s wife had died only recently following a heart attack.

12-11-2020||India||Parliamentary committee to prepare report on atrocities and crimes against women||The parliamentary standing committee on home affairs will discuss atrocities and crimes against women on November 18 and call Union home ministry officials to discuss the matter before preparing a report on the subject. The panel is taking up the matter in the backdrop of a 19-year-old Dalit woman’s alleged rape and murder in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras that provoked outrage. The woman’s family alleged the state police forced her cremation, triggering protests. Also Read: Hathras case: CBI likely to question former SP, SDMThe 19-year-old woman from Hathras died in a Delhi hospital after the assault. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case against the prime accused, Sandip Singh. He along and three others, all from the upper castes, are in jail. They were named by the victim before she died on September 29. The committee, according to officials, will meet a number of women groups and legal experts before finalising its report. The panel may ask for stricter measures to tackle this menace. A few months ago, the committee also discussed the issue of “Rising Crime in Delhi and NCR”, with a sharp focus on crime against women and incidents of burglary in the national capital. The rape and murder of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in 2012 in New Delhi led to the passage of a tougher law against sexual violence that provides for the death penalty for rape as well. But that did not stop crimes against women. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, 88 rape cases were reported on an average daily in 2019. Many experts believe that these figures might not portray the actual ground situation as many cases of violence against women are not reported due to social stigma attached to rape. The home ministry panel, led by Congress leader Anand Sharma, will also take up national security, intelligence coordination and counter terrorism, police training, modernisation and reforms, prison conditions and its infrastructure and reforms, development activities in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, and the management of Covid-19 pandemic and related issues at a later stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliamentary-committee-to-prepare-report-on-atrocities-and-crimes-against-women/story-sWvm9PiqdMRp9lqX5dJXlL.html

The 49-year-old is likely to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which heads the coalition government in the state. Daimary’s resignation came ahead of elections to the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC). On Monday, senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had told journalists that the Rajya Sabha MP would be joining BJP soon. Addressing journalists on Wednesday, Daimary accused BPF of being an obstacle in implementing the Bodo peace deal signed by the Centre earlier this year with four factions of the rebel outfit National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) and other Bodo groups in order to bring lasting peace and development in the four districts under the Bodo Territorial Region (BTR). “BPF is not keen on implementing the accord, which it also signed. I don’t want to become a part of that. I am officially resigning from the BPF and will take a decision on joining a national party soon,” he said. Elections to BTC, which was ruled by BPF was scheduled in April this year, but the entire BTAD was placed under Governor’s rule the same month as polls couldn’t be held due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The BPF leadership has been unhappy with BJP for placing BTC under Governor’s rule and differences between both ruling partners have sharpened in recent months. BPF has 12 MLAs in the state assembly. Election to BTC is expected to be held next month and if Daimary joins BJP, it will be a big boost to the party. BPF is yet to make any statement on Daimary’s resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-assam-ruling-bpf-s-working-president-quits-party-likely-to-join-bjp/story-yITuq18R4XM342SMXKCamJ.html

How did we manage to lift the ban on coal mining, which they could not do during their time? How come the Covid numbers are the lowest today in our state? How are these 40 MLAs supporting us today? Why did the Public Index of 2020 rank us as the second best governance (governed) state in the country today?” the CM asked.Later, Sangma took to Twitter and announced the resounding victory against the opposition’s motion on Wednesday night.“The members of the Opposition had moved a no-confidence motion against the present government in the autumn session that was put to vote in the House.

While the state government is only complying with the orders of the National Green Tribunal, and has imposed the ban only in cities where the air quality index was either poor, very poor or severe last Diwali, losses to the firecracker business are hard to be missed. In the state capital alone, firecracker traders are staring at losses to the tune of Rs 20 crore. “As per the state government’s order, we have cancelled all firecracker and related licences in the city,” said Lucknow district magistrate Abhishek Prakash. Varanasi administration has also gone ahead with a complete ban on sale and bursting of firecrackers from midnight of November 9 to midnight of November 30. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma has cancelled all licences to sell firecrackers with immediate effect.Also read | Confusion over firecracker ban in Assam during DiwaliThe traders call the decision “unjust”.“We are not opposing the ban. But why couldn’t this have been done earlier? The ban has come just ahead of Diwali when traders are ready with their stock.

This year, Gupta said, traders were anyway selling only green crackers — the ones made as per the directions of the Supreme Court. “Not all firecracker traders are well off. There are many who have taken loan from the market. The (ban) order will certain push many traders to the verge of bankruptcy,” he added. Mahesh Gupta, general secretary, Lucknow Cracker Traders’ Association, said, “Either we should be allowed to sell crackers or we must be compensated by the state government.” “Our officer-bearers will meet the CM and divisional commissioner to present our case,” said Satish Mishra, another office-bearer of cracker traders’ association. He said, “I don’t know why only firecrackers are being targeted while major pollutants such as construction sites, thermal power plants, cement industries and vehicles plying on road are not banned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-bans-firecrackers-this-diwali-traders-stare-at-huge-losses/story-lSNnOJxjGrttlmPFTTOqdM.html

12-11-2020||India||BPRD guidelines for police: No arrests unless necessary, no calling senior citizens for questioning||The Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD), a think-tank under the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), has asked police departments across the country not to make arrests as a regular act or for the sake of routine issues. The bureau has suggested that a person should be first served a notice of appearance and when he/she fails to comply with it, then police should go ahead with the arrest. The think-tank has issued elaborate “guidelines or draft Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for safeguarding persons to be arrested or detained by police authorities against custodial violence” to all police departments in the country.The guidelines, which were issued last week, have strictly advised police authorities to follow the procedure while making arrests, or while dealing with people in their custody. Also Read: In TV studio after release from jail, Arnab Goswami dares Uddhav ThackerayIt has said that the guidelines are aimed at restoring “a sense of security among the public and regaining the diminishing faith and confidence of the public in police”. Police officials have been advised against torturing a person in custody or compelling a person to give testimony or evidence that may incriminate him or her or testify against any person. “Do not subject any person in custody to torture, beating or cruel treatment. Ensure not to detain anyone for a prolonged period in the name of interrogation as this may amount to wrongful confinement and illegal detention,” the guidelines, reviewed by HT, have said. The advisories assume significance in the wake of torture of a father and his son -- P Jayaraj (51) and J Bennicks (31) -- in police custoday in Tamil Nadu (TN) in June. The incident had occurred under the jurisdiction of Sathankulam police station in TN’s Thoothukudi district. Jayaraj had died on June 22 and Bennicks the following day.The guidelines have directed police personnel to ensure that when they are going to make any arrest, they must wear visible name tags and their names should also be recorded in a police diary. An arrest memo of the arrestee must be prepared, mentioning date, time and place of arrest. The memo must be signed by at least one reputed local witness and countersigned by the arrestee. The guidelines have advised the authorities that, according to the provisions in the law, they cannot summon any male below 15 years of age or above 65 years of age or a woman to a police station for the purpose of questioning. “They shall be questioned at their place of residence,” they have added. For women, the guidelines have stated that police cannot arrest any woman after the sunset and before the sunrise unless under exceptional circumstances. The directives have asserted that abuse of powers of arrest has a chilling effect on society. The bureau has said it also erodes the credibility of the law-and-order mechanism and creates a chasm between the police and the society. The think-tank has pointed out that once a person is arrested, “the onus of safety, security and health of a person lies entirely on the police” and it should take utmost care to ensure that human rights of persons in police custody are not violated. “The arrestee should be interrogated in an appropriate manner with the aid of scientific methods of interrogation and investigation and without the use of violence,” it has said. “The Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973, contains provisions granting power to police to arrest or detain an individual in the process of investigation of crime and/or maintenance of order. The provisions enumerate the conditions in which arrest/detention can be made, along with the procedure for arrest or detention. These powers, when used indiscriminately, lead not only to abuse of the procedure, but also result in the violation of the fundamental rights of the citizens as enshrined in the Constitution of India. Indiscriminate arrest by the police and custodial violence, while the individual is in police custody, are serious issues that need to be dealt with utmost sensitivity at the highest levels of the police leadership with a view to put a complete stop to such repugnant practices,” the guidelines have said. “No police agency, without the constructive support of the society, can ever successfully achieve its objectives of crime control, maintenance of order,” it has added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bprd-guidelines-for-police-no-arrests-unless-necessary-no-calling-senior-citizens-for-questioning/story-PXTO0qcTCikvLyKTr7V58M.html

The request came after the family of Goswami, who hails from Assam, met Sonowal over alleged inadequate security cover for the journalist. “Talked to Maharashtra CM Udhav Thackeray ji and requested him for adequate security arrangements for renowned journalist Arnab Goswami,” Sonowal tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. “I talked to him as Mr Goswami’s family members approached me and intimated that there is not enough security provided to him,” he added. The editor-in-chief of Republic TV, who was in judicial custody in Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai for a week in connection with an abetment to suicide case, was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Sonowal had earlier condemned Goswami’s arrest and had demanded his immediate release. “A black day for India democracy. I strongly condemn the assault on senior journalist Arnab Goswami by Mumbai police. Vendetta politics should be stopped and freedom of press should be maintained in Maharashtra by releasing Mr Goswami immediately,” the CM had tweeted on November 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cm-reaches-out-to-thackeray-seeks-better-security-for-arnab/story-FeDNvLgZq0Wav0mIQE3HgJ.html
12-11-2020||India||Local train services resume in Bengal after 7 months, social distancing norms flouted||Local suburban train services resumed in West Bengal from Wednesday after a gap of more than seven months, even as social distancing norms to keep the Covid-19 infection at bay took a back seat, prompting authorities and railway passengers to demand more trains in the coming days. Railway authorities said that in all 696 trains were operated on the first day with nearly 85% of the trains running during peak hours in the morning and in the evening to cater to the rush. The resumption of train services came as a relief for lakhs of passengers living in towns and villages in the adjoining districts as they need to travel to Howrah and Kolkata every day for a living. Hawkers, however, have been barred from boarding the trains for the time being. “It is indeed a big relief for people like us who need to go to Kolkata for a living. I am going to Kolkata after more than seven months. I had lost my job during the pandemic. Now I can again look for a job once I go to Kolkata,” said Sarala Das, a resident of Lakshmikantapur in South 24 Parganas district who used to work as a maid. While separate entry and exit gates were demarcated for passengers moving in and out of the stations, police and railway security personnel ensured that none entered the station without wearing masks and without a thermal screening test. Queues were maintained at ticket counters and at the platforms too. But as the day progressed and the crowd swelled social distancing took a back seat on most platforms. Swarms of people could be seen jostling for space in various stations. Trains also got over crowded. Passengers could be seen occupying even those seats, which were supposed to be kept vacant to maintain distance among the passengers. “None of the seats were vacant and people were standing too. Hardly anyone maintained the social distancing norms inside the compartments even though nearly all passengers were wearing facemasks. It would be helpful if the railways can increase the number of trains,” said Pinanki Debnath, who boarded a train from Barasat to reach Kolkata. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday urged the railway authorities to run more trains to cater to the rush. More trains would help to disperse the crowd and reduce the chances of the Covid-19 infection, she said. The Calcutta HC on Tuesday had directed the state to explore whether local trains could be suspended over the coming weekend as it coincides with Kali Puja and Diwali. The court pointed out that the crowd during the Durga Puja this year was much less compared to previous years with one of the reasons being absence of local trains. “The state should consider whether it may be fit in the best of interest of all to suspend the operation of local trains on November 14 and 15 and on the day of Jagadhatri Puja or to manage the number of trains in such a manner that people do not find it convenient to come to Kolkata or travel to other places. The state is left free to make appropriate arrangements with the railway authorities in such regard,” the HC said in its order. With the resumption of local trains and lakhs of people coming to the city, the Kolkata Metro also increased the number of its trains by around 25% from Wednesday to cater to the rush.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-train-services-resume-in-bengal-after-7-months-social-distancing-norms-flouted/story-sLs1Yt93ujAwaubRVadZQP.html

The unveiling of the life-size statue will happen via video-conferencing, according to JNU Vice Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar. The ceremony will take place at 6:30 pm, the university said in a statement on Sunday. The unveiling of the statue will be preceded by a programme on Swami Vivekananda.“Swami Vivekananda is one of the most beloved intellectuals and spiritual leaders India has been fortunate to produce. He enthused the youth with his message of freedom, development, harmony and peace in India. He inspired citizens to take pride in Indian civilisation, culture and its industrious spirit,” the JNU Vice Chancellor said in a statement.The prime minister is also scheduled to inaugurate two future-ready Ayurveda institutions in Gujarat and Rajasthan on Friday.He will inaugurate the Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda (ITRA) at Jamnagar in Gujarat and the National Institute of Ayurveda (NIA) at Jaipur in Rajasthan on November 13 via video conferencing, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said on Wednesday.The potential role of Ayurveda in the management of the Covid-19 pandemic will be the focus of this year’s ‘Ayurveda Day’ observation, the PMO said in a statement.The Ayurveda Day is being observed every year from 2016, on the day of Dhanwantri Jayanti.

12-11-2020||India||Govt to regulate OTT, online news platforms||The Union government brought streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hotstar, and news websites under the ambit of the Information & Broadcasting ministry for regulation, issuing a notification that will now allow the latter to draft rules that could have a far-reaching impact on popular channels of digital content. In the case of streaming services, this creates a level playing field between linear TV and so-called over the top (OTT) services, and should prevent a rash of objectionable content that some smaller and newer companies in the space have been distributing, but it also raises the spectre of censorship. In the case of digital news, this means companies in the space will be treated akin to print and electronic media companies. To be sure, in both cases, much will depend on the rules drafted. The change was made through the amendment of Allocation of Business Rules and announced through a gazette notification dated November 9 by the Cabinet secretariat. The amendment brought “film and audio visual programmes by online content providers” and “news and current affairs content on online platforms” under the ministry of information and broadcasting’s domain for regulation.According to officials and experts, this is a precursor to the government approving future rules – either through legislation or endorsement of self-regulatory mechanisms. “There is no road map yet on what these regulations will be,” said an official in the ministry said, while asking not to be named.This official, however, pointed to previous remarks by the minister Prakash Javadekar, who has advocated for rules for problems such as fake news.At present, there are no laws or autonomous bodies that have a say on the sort of content on streaming services or news websites – complaints regarding these had largely been dealt by the communications and IT ministry with laws such as the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code being invoked. Traditional media such as films, entertainment and news television channels and newspapers are covered under mechanisms such as government’s Central Board of Film Certification, the independent Broadcasting Content Complaints Council, the cable and television act, and Press and Registration of Books (PRB) Act.“It is unclear what sort of regulations might be announced because there are core distinctions between how production and distribution is carried out. For instance, in cinema you require a censor board certificate before release. In the case of television channels, you don’t need that – a channel just has to be licensed. There is a post-broadcast censorship with a three-strike rule under the cable and television act,” said Apar Gupta, executive director at the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF).According to Gupta, one of the directions at least the regulation of online news media could take has been hinted in a pending legislation: the PRB amendment bill, 2019. “This will broadly bring them at par with print periodicals such as newspapers. Today’s move seems to be an early hint. There was previously an internal division on the matter of jurisdiction within the government but now clear authority has been provided to the information and broadcasting ministry,” he said.Hints about such a move were also evident in the government’s submissions to the Supreme Court during a hearing in September to challenge the broadcast of a purportedly communal TV segment by Sudarshan TV. In an affidavit by a Union I&B ministry official, the government said if the court sought to regulate the media, then it should first do so for digital media, and not electronic media, since the former have a faster and wider reach. The ministry will now need legislative backing to exercise the authority it gained by Monday’s notification. “There will need to be laws which will come in the future. The only clear indication today is that the information ministry will be the nodal ministry for these laws, and exact regulations will need to be seen,” Gupta added.The PRB amendment bill, if cleared, could require news websites to follow a similar process with registration of their periodicals as newspapers are presently required to with the Registrar of Newspapers of India. The bill also prohibits the appointment of a foreign national as an editor and replaces the provision of a jail term with a fine for publishers involved in printing of unlawful content.Separately, the Union government in August, 2019 amended foreign direct investment (FDI) rules to set a 26% limit for digital news websites in India, the same as for newspapers. On streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney Hotstar, the government has previously pushed for a self-regulatory mechanism, the official quoted in the first instance said. These companies formulated a self regulation code that the information and broadcasting ministry rejected due to what it saw as conflict in interest in the advisory panel, news reports said in September.The code proposed by the OTTs prohibited content, including that which deliberately and maliciously disrespected the national emblem or national flag, any visual or story line that promotes child pornography, any content that maliciously intends to outrage religious sentiments, content that deliberately and maliciously promotes or encourages terrorism, among other measures.Spokespersons of Amazon Prime, Netflix and the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) did not respond to requests for a comment on the latest gazette notification. Some producers who have released titles on such OTT platforms said the move could put them at a disadvantage. ”This desperation for control of free speech and expression does not augur well. I am currently very disappointed,” filmmaker Hansal Mehta told PTI.Former information and broadcasting secretary Uday Kumar Varma said the step was long overdue. “Some people thought because the content was coming on internet, it should become part of IT ministry. I suppose they have taken the decision based on content. News and entertainment content are both part of I&B’s mandate. So irrespective of platform or medium, for instance, even today, the news if it comes on radio, TV or DTH, it is part of I&B’s mandate. It is an extension of that and to that extent logical,” he said. In the Sudarshan TV case, the ministry told the top court that there is a need to first appoint a committee of persons as amicus before laying down guidelines with respect to the regulation of hate speech in media.(with PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-regulate-ott-online-news-platforms/story-JGd9C2zEKHZ9Rgiug3d9XM.html

12-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||There isn’t much information available on India’s Covid-19 vaccine game plan. We do know — HT’s Saubhadra Chatterji broke that story — that there is a vaccine committee. We also know that this committee is speaking to several vaccine developers. And we know that states have been asked to prepare a list of people who should be prioritised for a vaccine shot. There are several unanswered questions, though.Infosys chairman and former Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) head Nandan M Nilekani wrote a two-part article detailing how he thinks India should go about it, but, again, it isn’t known whether the government is thinking along those lines, or whether the people in charge have even read Nilekani’s article. I am not sure (and this is based on my own interactions) that these people are as informed of the pandemic as they should be. A long career in India’s sprawling and bureaucratic health system, or a medical degree of some vintage, don’t matter as much as an open mind, the ability to read and understand current literature on Covid, and then synthesise what that means in the Indian context. The US has Dr Anthony Fauci; we have a man who thinks the influenza and Covid viruses are from the same family. It’s the reason I recommended — Dispatch 108, titled A Million and a Manifesto, on July 18, shortly after India crossed the million-case mark — that the country appoint a Covid Commissioner. But I digress.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageThere are four aspects involved in vaccinating a population.The first involves identifying and procuring a vaccine. Sure, if you are a country such as the US, you can launch a program like Warp Speed, funneling billions of dollars into companies developing vaccines; but even otherwise, it makes sense to secure supplies by striking deals, private bilateral business agreements, with companies developing the vaccines. The UK and the EU have such agreements. As have many other countries. India doesn’t, and is largely dependent for vaccines on a WHO initiative, Covax, but not all vaccine developers are part of this equitable access platform; Pfizer, for instance, isn’t (and its vaccine will likely be the first one available). India should aggressively pursue bilateral agreements, and use as a hedge, like many other countries plan to, the vaccine doses it will be eligible for under Covax. The next few years are going to be about vaccine stockpiles — most of the initial vaccines may be two-shot ones; people may need annual vaccination — and India should get serious about building its own.Covid update: Sputnik-V 92% effective; Pfizer challenge; Delhi HC on surgeThe second involves funding. India needs to figure out who is eligible for a free vaccine, and who pays. The easier, but more expensive option, is to underwrite the costs of vaccination for the entire population — something that could cost tens of billions of dollars. And at least for the first few years (I’m not sure anyone has thought about this), till a one-shot-lifetime-protection vaccine is developed, this staggering amount of money may have to be spent annually. The government could also consider providing the vaccine free only to people who need it (say, those covered by the Public Distribution System), and make others pay for it.The third involves distribution. Here the government should do the smart thing and tap the expertise of those who do this best — companies in the consumer products business such as ITC, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Parle, the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, and others. These companies are in the business of ensuring their products are available in remote corners of the country. Some even deal in perishables, and some others in products that require refrigeration.The last involves administration. This is perhaps the most complex part of the exercise, but also the one where India has a very good template — the general elections, down to the neighborhood election booths. Just like government employees, usually school teachers, are drafted to man the polling booths, health care workers from government and private hospitals should be asked to staff the vaccination booths. The national elections, conducted in phases, in just the span of a month-and-a-half, provide the perfect template for a national vaccination drive. People know which their booths are; go there, present some ID (even a phone number will do, or a name and thumbprint in the extreme case of someone who has no ID at all), be vaccinated, get a receipt to that effect, and perhaps one of those indelible-ink marks on a finger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-466vokbAwyi4EUsmRy7ZLI.html
12-11-2020||India||Harsh Vardhan asks 7 states to focus on effective management of Covid-19 cases to reduce deaths||Union minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday advised seven states, including Maharashtra and Uttarakhand, to focus on enhanced testing, especially in districts with higher Covid-19 positivity and places of large gatherings like markets and workplaces.Vardhan, who interacted with chief ministers, state health ministers, principal secretaries and additional chief secretaries of Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura Meghalaya and Goa through video conferencing and urged them to focus on effective clinical management of Covid-19 cases to reduce deaths in the first 24, 48 or 72 hours.Highlighting the state specific areas of concern that would require focussed attention, he noted that although the active cases have come down in Maharashtra, it continues to have a large active Covid-19 caseload with a high fatality rate of 2.6 per cent, which increases to 3.5 per cent in and around Mumbai, the Union Health Ministry said in a statement.The case fatality rate in Uttarakhand is higher than the national average at 1.64 per cent.Also, active cases are on the rise in the recent days in Manipur. Higher positivity in the state is indicative of hidden transmission, Vardhan said.Forty per cent of the total deaths were recorded in just the last one month in Goa, which is a cause of concern, he underlined.With 70 per cent of cases concentrated in Aizawl, Mizoram is seeing a further rise in active cases; Tripura and Meghalaya are witnessing higher deaths in the active age groups of 45-60 years, which are preventable, the Union health minister highlighted.Vardhan appreciated the relentless services of several Covid warriors and the frontline workers who have handled the situation on the ground with grit and determination without showing signs of fatigue.  He further stated that as on date, there were only 4.09 per cent of active cases on oxygen support, 2.73 per cent of the active cases in ICU and a minute 0.45 per cent on ventilator support, the ministry said in the statement.He, however, stressed on the need to be vigilant in the coming winter and the long festive season, which could threaten the gains made against Covid-19.To stop the chain of transmission, he stressed on the importance of ‘Jan Andolan’ initiated by the prime minister.Elaborating on the steps taken by the government to promote ‘Jan Andolan’ among the masses, he added that “Covid appropriate behaviour is the most potent social vaccine”.Vardhan advised the states to focus on higher testing, especially in districts with higher positivity, mandatory testing of symptomatic negatives by rapid antigen test, focus on high risk groups and vulnerable populations for SARI/ILI surveillance, which can give an indication of infection, proper follow-up and monitoring of those in home isolation, especially the vulnerable group.He also highlighted the importance of widespread IEC campaigns so that people in home isolation can reach hospitals in time for effective clinical management, and efforts to be made to reduce deaths in the first 24, 48 or 72 hours, which was high in many states and districts, the statement stated.Vardhan also indicated towards the need for higher testing in areas like marketplaces, workplaces, places of gatherings.       The chief ministers and state health ministers shared a brief snapshot of the actions taken for containment, surveillance and treatment of Covid-19 cases along with the best practices of their states.  Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat stated that they have mounted a comprehensive multimedia IEC campaign for encouraging Covid appropriate behaviour.Challans have been given to 1.4 lakh for faulting on social distancing, and 4.5 lakh on mask negligence. In the later case, the defaulters were given four masks each to promote mask wearing behaviour.  Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope informed about the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign in the state where house-to-house surveys and monitoring of home isolation cases and SARI/ILI patients were undertaken. Of the 5.7 lakh surveyed, 51,000 Covid-19 positive cases were identified.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan advised the states to focus on three areas that include the need to suppress and break the chain of transmission; keeping mortality less than 1 per cent and the need for prolonged behaviour change.  To ensure these, he advised for quick and aggressive testing, targeted testing at marketplaces, workplaces, religious congregations which have the potential to become super-spreader events, followed by quick tracing; all close contacts to be traced in the first 72 hours; at least 10 persons to be traced for every positive person.He also advised to increase the proportion of tests through RT-PCR against RAT and to mandatorily test symptomatic negatives from RAT tests by RT-PCR.  For ensuring the second point, he advised quick hospitalisation, ensuring adequate infrastructure in hospitals, focus on avoidable deaths in the first 24, 48 or 72 hours; focus on vulnerable population groups; and review hospital wide fatality figures, the statement said.To ensure adherence of Covid appropriate behaviour, he advised strong campaigns involving MPs, MLAs and local influencers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harsh-vardhan-asks-7-states-to-focus-on-effective-management-of-covid-19-cases-to-reduce-deaths/story-HxxcCaeSu7PTe07xJDRocM.html
12-11-2020||India||Conrad Sangma’s govt defeats Congress’ no-confidence motion in Meghalaya||The no-confidence motion moved by the opposition Congress against the Meghalaya Democratic Alliance government led by Conrad K Sangma was defeated by a voice vote on Wednesday amid an uproar.Making the announcement to wrap up the day’s proceedings, Meghalaya assembly Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh said, “The Nos have it and the no-confidence motion is lost.”The motion was put to vote after the Leader of Opposition Dr Mukul Sangma announced that the opposition has taken a collective decision not to withdraw the no-trust motion because the government seems to be not willing to come clear on the various allegations.All 40 ruling MLAs voted against the no-confidence motion except the lone Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement (KHNAM) legislator, Adelbert Nongrum, who decided to neither support the government nor the opposition.During the debate on the no-confidence motion, the opposition Congress launched a scathing attack against the MDA government for its alleged failure to protect the interest of the state with specific reference to illegal mining and transportation of coal, corruption in the power department, law and order, among others.“To sum up, the government has failed to protect the interest of the state. How much time do we want to give this government which is robbing the state?” Dr Sangma asked.In response, chief minister Conrad K Sangma said that the opposition should be magnanimous enough to accept that development is taking place and realise the need to support the present state government for its endeavours.“If we have failed, as alleged by the opposition, how come there is no abduction of civilians - from 210 cases during their time to zero today? How come we managed to lift the ban on coal mining, which they could not do during their time? How come the Covid numbers are the lowest today in our state? How are these 40 MLAs supporting us today? Why did the Public Index of 2020 rank us as the second best governance (governed) state in the country today?” Conrad asked.On the alleged illegal mining and transportation of coal, the CM categorically maintained that there is no illegal movement of coal and that all transportation is taking place legally with proper documents. “In fact the revenue that is coming in has been manifold (from the seized coal),” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conrad-sangma-s-govt-defeats-congress-no-confidence-motion-in-meghalaya/story-jhaWbFHT3BtasG3YSqLQBK.html
12-11-2020||India||Development only basis for politics now; women BJP’s silent voters: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Wednesday that results of the Bihar assembly polls and bypolls across states have proved that “development” will be the only basis for politics in the 21st century and credited women for powering the The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) political fortunes as its “silent voters”.Addressing BJP workers at a thanksgiving programme in Delhi following the electoral victory, Modi also attributed the National Democratic Alliance’s(NDA)win in Bihar to its mantra of “sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas” and also launched a veiled attack on the West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress, saying those who cannot challenge the saffron party democratically have resorted to “murdering” its workers to realise their goals.Assembly polls are due in the first half of 2021 in West Bengal, a politically crucial state where BJP hopes to come to power for the first time by ending Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s 10-year old rule.Modi also said that the NDA will serve Bihar under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and every BJP member will leave no stone unturned to help it realise its resolve of development in the state.In his address, the Prime Minister launched a stinging attack on “family parties and family-oriented parties”, saying their “web” could be seen from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and that they are the “biggest threat” to Indian democracy.In a clear attack on the Congress, he said a national party has also fallen into the grip of a family and asked youngsters to associate themselves with the BJP to serve the country.The Prime Minister chose the celebratory atmosphere at the BJP headquarters to underscore the party’s growing strength across the country, a day after its stupendous show helped the NDA pip a resurgent RJD-led alliance to the post, even as it notched up impressive wins in bypolls across states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh among others.Referring to the poll results, he said they have broadened the verdict delivered by the people in the Lok Sabha polls in favour of BJP for its development work.Modi further said his government has undertaken several reforms and launched development as well as welfare initiatives for the people during the Covid-19 pandemic, when many big countries had also got bogged down by the virus spread.The BJP is the only national party in which the poor, dalits, and other deprived sections of society see their representation, he said, adding that it is the only national party that represents and caters to aspirations of every section and region of the nation. Modi said the party’s rise from “two rooms and two seats” to its dominance in national politics, and has clearly shown that people will give only those a chance to serve the country who work honestly for the nation’s development.Those who do not understand it are losing their deposits in polls, he said, an apparent reference to the Congress’ poor show in these polls.The BJP’s model of “good governance” was visible during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said, asserting that people’s vote for the party have shown their support to the measures taken by his government to deal with the pandemic. Everyone must be wondering when he will speak on the Bihar poll results, Modi said smilingly in the middle of his speech before adding that the only mystery formula behind the NDA’s win in the state, where exit polls had mostly predicted a loss for it, was its mantra of “sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas”.Development work, trust, and aspirations and pride of Bihar have won in the state, he said. Terming the Bihar polls results as “most special”, he noted that the BJP is the only party which has seen its tally increase despite being in power in the state for three terms and added that it has performed spectacularly in states like Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat despite ruling them for long.  With pollsters crediting woman voters’ preference for the BJP-JD(U) alliance for its win in the hard-fought battle, Modi said India’s “nari shakti” (women power) are the BJP’s “silent voters” being discussed by experts. From rural to urban regions, they have played a key role in the BJP’s good show in polls everywhere, he added.Turning his attention to West Bengal, he raised the issue of alleged political murders targeting saffron party members.“People in some parts of the country think that they will realise their goals by murdering BJP workers. I will appeal to them to see reason... I need not warn them as people will do this. Polls come and go, win and loss happen but this killing game cannot work in a democracy. This ‘maut ka khel’ cannot get you votes. They should see the writing on the wall,” Modi said, without naming any party.The BJP has been accusing the TMC of resorting to killing its workers to terrorise its members, a charge the state’s ruling party has rejected.The Prime Minister asked people to take due care while celebrating Diwali and follow the mantra of “vocal for local”, a push for local products.He also hailed the Election Commission, security forces and local administration for the successful conduct of elections, saying India’s polling process is a pride of every Indian.Amid a festival-like atmosphere with the crowd chanting ‘Modi hai to mumkin hai (Modi can make it possible), BJP president J P Nadda earlier said at the event that people of Bihar have put their stamp of approval on Modi’s work to deal with Covid-19 and help poor during the pandemic.He also said Bihar has chosen ‘vikas raaj’ over ‘goonda raaj’, ‘DBT raaj’ over ‘loot raaj’ and LED over lantern. With the party’s Bihar poll wins being first under Nadda, who had taken over the helm in January this year, Modi lauded his leadership and asked the large number of party workers present at the headquarters to join him in raising slogans in his support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/development-only-basis-for-politics-now-women-bjp-s-silent-voters-pm-modi/story-SdrkdYS7gwhGEVBV9BI4FP.html

His German Shepherd, Major, is going to be the first rescue dog in the White House. Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has been making strong points for the adoption of indie puppies. And now, many celebrities including cricketer Shikhar Dhawan and actors Randeep Hooda and Raveena Tandon have adopted strays and rescue dogs, more so since the pandemic broke.   No ruff days on the trail when I have some Major motivation.A post shared by  Joe Biden (@joebiden) on Oct 5, 2020 at 3:22pm PDTHenri A Fanthome, owner of an architecture firm, adopted a female rescue Lila in 2014, who now has puppies of her own. “She took to me very naturally. I was warned that she might show separation anxiety or depression, but none of that happened. When I was bringing her home, she kept licking my head, and does so to this day. She adapted to me and my house instantly, and made friends with other dogs in the park where we go for walks,” he shares, adding that Lila helped him discover some things about his own personality, too. “Earlier, I would always put others first, giving them so much leeway as to walk all over me. But when Lila came along, I drew the line. She made me visible, made me notice these things,” he reveals. Adopting rescue pups also brings a sense of gratification, of giving back to nature. Shubha Sinha, homemaker, who adopted Pyaari around three years ago, says, “We were told she is two years old by the volunteer working with the shelter. She mostly looks like a breeders’ reject who was dumped after she was done serving her purpose. It took her a lot of time to trust people. Except for the three of us, she wouldn’t go near anyone. She isn’t the fittest or the healthiest girl and a lot of physical work goes into taking care of her but I guess there is a sense of happiness that comes with it. We feel that at least we could give back to the society in some way and our life isn’t just about us.”Corporate communications specialist Ankita Dasgupta, who adopted Sikander in 2018, says both her family and the pet have come a long way in adapting to each other. “Initially, my parents were very distressed because he used to pee everywhere including on the beds and used to constantly want to eat. He did not give cuddles and was a bit of a recluse. We have all come around changes now. He gives morning cuddles and seeks out our company and has colony friends,” she says.There are volunteers who work tirelessly to help find abandoned pets and strays forever homes. Seeing a trend, Ruchi Gupta, who volunteers at two animal NGOs, shares that the abandonment rate of pedigree dogs has increased post the pandemic. “This has also impacted the adoption of indie dogs. People want young pedigree puppies below the age of three years,” she says, adding that people look at what breeds are in trend before adopting. “Earlier it was Pugs and Labradors. Now people want Shih Tzus and Huskies. More German Shepherds are being abandoned now. Vidhi Malla, a communications consultant has four rescues at her home and has facilitated the adoption of many “children” as she calls them. She has dealt with cases where the pups have been adopted and abandoned multiple times. “My youngest, five-year old Toto got adopted but was returned after six months. It was an extremely difficult time. It has been three years, but she is still scared of strangers or walking on the street,” shares Malla and lists out certain challenges in getting dogs adopted. “A lot of people prefer breeds; the adoption of desi dogs is very difficult. People have very specific demands in mind – a certain age and kind of puppy,” she adds.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/major-hope-for-rescues-as-white-house-s-first-rescue-pup-to-be-reinstills-faith-in-forever-homes/story-zFyPpLzDN0VDTuifeUWFrO.html
12-11-2020||Editorials||Students need help. DU must step up | HT Editorial||On November 2, an undergraduate student of Delhi University (DU)’s Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College for Women died by suicide. Her family said the girl took the drastic step because she had to return home to Telangana after classes were suspended due to Covid-19 and her parents, who work in the informal sector, could not afford a laptop for online classes. She had also received a message from the college, asking her to vacate hostel accommodation. She knew her family could not pay for expensive private hostel facilities.With Covid-19, students have been under tremendous stress, across different educational tiers, because of the abrupt transition to digital learning. In India, thousands of poor students see education as a passport to better lives and social mobility, and this sudden disruption has put an extra financial burden on their families. Indian campuses also lack adequate counselling services, and the pandemic has exposed how this lack of a support system can impact students, especially those who come from marginalised backgrounds and have little to no support systems and mentoring facilities at home.This year, as a report in this newspaper revealed, many DU colleges have received more than the usual number of applications for fee waivers from students, indicating the depth of the crisis. DU colleges have said that they are scaling up their outreach programmes. While this is an excellent step, eight months into the crisis, they should have put in place a system to ensure digital devices, internet connections and counselling services for vulnerable students. DU has access to funds, a strong alumni base and human resources; colleges should leverage these effectively and ensure that students tide over this crisis with minimum pain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/students-need-help-du-must-step-up-ht-editorial/story-ULwmZFLZXfC5ALoVKzYSJM.html
12-11-2020||Editorials||On China, stick to the redlines | HT Editorial||India and China continue to inch forward in their attempts to bring an end to their continuing border confrontation — or at least reduce tensions before winter sets in fully, and postpone a solution until next spring. If the latest news reports are to be believed, negotiations are moving slowly along an upward incline. Beijing had first argued Indian troops should withdraw from their forward positions along the Chushul ridge in return for Chinese troops doing nothing at all. It has since moved to the view that an Indian withdrawal would be matched by a Chinese pull back to their original positions at Finger 8 of Pangong Tso — but minus India’s right to patrol up to Finger 8.This is a positive development — the Chinese at least accept they have to walk back from their present positions if they expect the same of the Indians. But there remains a yawning gap between what Beijing is offering and what New Delhi should be prepared to accept. One, there is no question of India returning to its status quo ante position without China, at a minimum, doing the same. Two, given that China is the aggressor, it should be trying to restore trust and India need not fully reciprocate every Chinese action. For example, a residual monitoring post along Chushul ridge or increased patrolling rights between Finger 4 and 8 would be reasonable given Beijing’s trampling of earlier border agreements.India should also stick to its economic approach of reducing dependence on China. There is no reason for India to enable large-scale Chinese digital presence in its economy, especially when there is zero confidence that China would not misuse India data or shutdown systems if it penetrated the core of India’s 21st century economy. Steps to reduce the Chinese presence in government procurement and infrastructure should continue. The merits of slowly reducing the Chinese economic footprint and positioning India as an alternative manufacturing site are overwhelming, even though this transition will take time, as indicated by the surging sales of Chinese-made cellphones during the Diwali season. India and China must and should continue to seek to decouple from each other along the border, but Delhi must stick to its redlines. At the same time, it should continue with the economic decoupling, which will inflict the greatest pain on China and be crucial to India’s future economic path.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-china-stick-to-the-redlines-ht-editorial/story-8Dyq1YfsUhCm4kpCOeiR8K.html
12-11-2020||Editorials||The rise of Asaduddin Owaisi||In one of the more surprising dimensions of the Bihar outcome, Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen — originally a small party with roots in the Old City in Hyderabad — has won five seats in the assembly. Mr Owaisi has been making a concerted effort to expand his party’s base in Bihar’s Seemanchal region, particularly Kishanganj — which has an overwhelming Muslim majority — for over five years now. It won a by-poll in the region last year, but has emerged as a major force this time around. Mr Owaisi is a controversial figure. While he speaks the language of constitutionalism and seeks rights for Muslims and other marginalised groups, his party has often engaged in extremist rhetoric and even hate speech. But what explains his growing popularity, with his party winning seats in places as varied as Maharashtra and Bihar? Muslims in India, after the trauma of Partition, have been sceptical of solely identity-based political formations and have invested their lot with secular formations and stuck to the democratic mainstream. But the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has led to greater alienation — the inability of the older “secular” parties to fight the BJP, and increasing disillusionment with these forces, has also led to a search for alternatives. Those criticising Mr Owaisi for “cutting” the votes of other Opposition parties are doing a disservice to Indian democracy, for he is as entitled to participate and contest elections as any other formation. On his part, Mr Owaisi must consistently ensure that his party remains wedded to the plural, peaceful, democratic, constitutional path and doesn’t engage in minority communalism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-rise-of-asaduddin-owaisi/story-QsjmAZG6pBjFpUwTGxjCmM.html
12-11-2020||Editorials||The BJP marks its dominance||In the past year, there has been increasing commentary over the declining political fortunes of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This view gained ground due to electoral setbacks or the party’s failure to form the government in a set of states (Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Delhi); protest movements against the government’s measures (for instance, the citizenship-related protests); the economic contraction and the humanitarian distress caused by the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19; and the desertion of allies (for instance, the Akali Dal over the farm bills). But the results in Bihar — where the BJP has emerged as the senior partner in the National Democratic Alliance and will hold the real levers of power — and in by-polls across the country — the BJP won 41 of the 59 seats where elections were held — shows, once again, how observers got it wrong. The BJP has decisively reinforced its dominance in Indian politics.Both in Bihar and in the different states, which saw by-polls, local factors played an important role in shaping results. In by-polls, incumbent governments have an edge. And there has, indeed, been an increasing trend towards voters separating their choices in state and national polls. All of this should introduce a cautionary note in reading the results. Yet, there is no doubt that the BJP’s success indicates that the party still enjoys the support of vast segments of the electorate. This can be attributed to three key factors. The first is obvious — Prime Minister Narendra Modi evokes trust. This trust appears to be based on voters judging the PM’s intent — for instance, few blame him for imposing the lockdown, and recognise that it appeared the best option at that time — and appreciating the government’s welfare delivery. While the provision of homes, toilets, gas cylinders, and income transfers to farmers were recognised as factors in the 2019 win, not enough attention has been paid to the welfare measures introduced in the wake of the pandemic, from free ration to distribution of gas cylinders at no cost to benefits for the vulnerable. The second factor is the lack of faith voters still have in the Opposition’s ability to deliver better governance or resolve everyday issues. And finally, it is a testament to the BJP’s formidable organisational network, feedback systems, and the ability to ensure its narrative reaches every home that explains its success. The party has shown once again that its inroads are far deeper than often assumed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-bjp-marks-its-dominance/story-AqI9ftDQTN62k2ubXsQs6J.html
