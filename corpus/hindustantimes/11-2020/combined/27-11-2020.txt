27-11-2020||News||On liberty, ensure equal and speedy justice to all||Under the Constitution, the Supreme Court (SC) is tasked with upholding fundamental rights and interpreting laws to ensure consistency in decision-making by the High Courts (HCs) and subordinate courts. Yet, on occasion, there have been divergent views and interpretations by judges. The consequences for litigants seeking justice range from delays in cases pending in HCs and subordinate courts to inconsistent decisions leading to multiple challenges till cases are settled. Since the judges of the Indian apex court, unlike the United States (US) SC do not sit together, the conflicting views of India’s SC benches are resolved only by referrals of such conflicts to larger benches. In the past decade, successive Chief Justices have routinely constituted Constitution Benches (of five or more judges) to speed up pending references and bring about legal clarity. The recent debate about the apparently conflicting views from different benches on issues of liberty is being erroneously portrayed by some as an example that the court does not speak with one voice in matters of liberty or on equality in access to justice and Article 32 of the Constitution. Article 32 ensures the right of direct access to SC to ensure the enforcement of fundamental rights. In recent years, SC has intervened in Article 32 petitions, often in Public Interest Litigations dealing with the rights of individuals in instances relating to free speech, the criminalisation of homosexuality and privacy. However, in the past few decades, a practice was developed in SC to routinely decline to entertain Article 32 petitions in the first instance, and send litigants to HCs under Article 226. The power of HCs to entertain writs being much wider, and not limited to grievances of deprivation of fundamental rights alone, was thought to be the preferred remedy. Contemporaneous to the recent utterance of the Chief Justice to limit Article 32 petitions, was the case of Arnab Goswami. It was heard during the Diwali break, and arose out of a challenge to an interim order declining to grant him interim bail. Interim bail sought in writ jurisdiction, though legally tenable, is rarely granted, especially when remedies of bail under the relevant law are available. Though the SC rarely interferes with interim orders, being a matter of personal liberty, it granted him release from custody. For the ordinary litigant, who anxiously waits to get his matter listed, it is not the grant of relief to Arnab Goswami that is the issue, but the apparent fast-tracking and listing of his petition during the Diwali vacation. The principle of equality is a fundamental right, and there cannot, and ought not to be different standards for access to the court depending on who you are. For a lay person, the two issues — one, whether Article 32 petitions ought to be discouraged when HCs, being constitutional courts are equally empowered under Article 226, and, two, simultaneous interference in a case where an HC had declined interim relief under Article 226 — have become obfuscated subject to differing interpretations. The pressing issue which the Arnab Goswami case throws up is that there is a need to ensure equal and speedy access to justice for all litigants, particularly in matters relating to personal liberty. The need for speedy justice delivery has so far been primarily addressed in the commercial sphere with the establishment of commercial courts, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and increased tribunalisation of justice delivery. However, the focus on liberty has not received adequate attention from the executive which continues to frame harsh and restrictive laws to restrict liberty. Even within the judicial process, there are concerns that speedy and equal access to justice, where an individual’s liberty has been curtailed, is not always accessible. We have come a long way from the technological limitations since March 2020. There is a systematic reopening of physical hearings of courts in many parts of the country. Yet, there are valid concerns among those whose cases have not been heard till date and who continue to languish in custody, as they are not covered by suo motu directions of release from custody by SC and HCs (in light of the pandemic).In 1989, in the Ayya Alias Ayub v. State of UP case, SC had recognised that liberty being precious, matters seeking bail or habeas corpus have to have priority over all others. This philosophy and the precedent of Arnab Goswami’s case must now be cast in stone and pervade through the corridors of not only SC, but of each and every court in the country. Liberty is our most basic right. The ordinary citizen looks to the courts as the only resort for redress for their anguish and agitation at the harshness of the State’s agencies. The trend of the last few decades, which have witnessed increasing enactment of laws providing for reverse burden at the stage of bail and more stringent laws and punishments, constitute an assault on the right to liberty. It is only the courts that can curtail such repeated incursions on liberty by State agencies to ensure that Article 21 of the Constitution retains its glory as it did in the libertarian decade of the 1980s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/on-liberty-ensure-equal-and-speedy-justice-to-all/story-fnWwHvOepjpsd1x95fd2xJ.html

Saund was re-elected to the US Congress twice - in 1958 and again in 1960.Meanwhile, a Chandigarh-based family is basking in the quiet glory of its ancestor’s connection to the US Congress. Saund’s grand-nephew Gurpreet Singh who is president of the Institute of Sikh Studies, Chandigarh, and the Global Sikh Council, grew up hearing about him.It’s no wonder that Gurpreet lent support to the Biden-Harris campaign. He says, “I am a democrat by conviction. It’s a part of our DNA as we are inclusive people.”“When Taya Dalip went to the US, Indians had no voting rights. They could not even lease land. He had to wait for seven years to enter the Congress after getting citizenship and when he did, he won against the formidable Republican candidate Jacqueline Cochran, who was a decorated pilot during the World War-2,” he says.“Taya Dalip campaigned vigorously for the Blacks the right to vote. When he stood for Congress, he did not seek the help of bigwigs in Washington as he did not want to lose his autonomy. He was a hands-on fellow. He would fly back to California over the weekend, tour his constituency, meet the constituents and tell them what had happened in the Congress and what he thought about it and what was his stand,” he adds.On Harris’ victory, he says, “Nowadays, the world has become a village but there are so many divisions. I hope she takes up minority-rights and humanitarian issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/remembering-the-first-indian-origin-congressman-dalip-singh-saund/story-rlCCCQx2SxgCibuDJ9qngN.html

ATS, which wrote to SAFEMA (Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators) authority, seized ₹1.55 crore, three vehicles, flats and open plots among others of 13 accused who were arrested for running a lab which produced the drug mephedrone, also known as MD and meow-meow. ATS seized 146kg of the drug worth ₹58 crore. An ATS officer said that maximum properties seized belonged to Mohammad Tanvir Abdul Aziz Paryani, a man with links to gangster Dawood Ibrahim’s gang.In September 2019, the Vikroli unit arrested two accused on the eastern express highway with 9kg of mephedrone. After interrogating them, ATS busted a factory in Panvel which was being used as a lab to manufacture MD. Officers learnt that the drug was being supplied to Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and neighbouring districts. A total of 13 accused – Abdul Razzak Kadar Shaikh, Irfan Badar Shaikh, Suleman Badar Shaikh, Jitendra Sharad Parmar alias Asif, Naresh Madan Mhaskar, Sardar Uttam Patil, Juber Lalmohammed Momin, Mohd Salim Abdul Hamid Memon, Kais Kuresh Sidhiqui alias Kaisuddin, Avesh Akbar Khan, Mohammed Tanvir Abdul Aziz Paryani, Mohammad Wasim Abdul Latif Shaikh, and Mustafa Zulfikar Charaniya alias Guddu – were arrested in the case.A financial investigation was conducted, which revealed that the accused had purchased several properties with money from the sale of drugs. ATS seized ₹1.55 crore after conducting searches at the residences and offices of all the accused. Officers also seized three vehicles and cash deposits in 15 bank accounts in the names of the accused. A plot at Shirala in Sangli district was found in the name of Sardar Uttam Patil.Additionally, a flat in Panvel worth ₹35 lakh, an open plot at Apate, Panvel worth ₹12.72 lakh and another plot worth ₹32.93 lakh in the name of accused Kais Kuresh Siddiqui.

27-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s air quality improves on Friday but continues to remain in ‘poor’ category||The city recorded a marginal improvement in air quality on Friday owing to an increase in wind speed, but the pollutant-measuring indicator was still in the ‘poor’ category at 218. On Thursday, Mumbai had recorded an AQI of 252 (poor). On Friday, Mumbai had the worst AQI among four cities – Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Pune – where the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) monitors air quality. The high speed winds had helped in improving Delhi’s air quality to the satisfactory category. Borivali and Mazagaon recorded very poor AQI at 328 and 307, respectively. Chembur (286), Malad (283), Bandra-Kurla Complex (273), and Colaba (201) were in the ‘poor’ air quality category. While the remaining locations recorded moderate air, Navi Mumbai had the cleanest air with the AQI at 80 (satisfactory). AQI levels are categorised from 0-50 as good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate, 201-300 is poor, 301-400 is very poor, and above 401 is severe. “The wind direction was northerly, and slightly speedy winds were witnessed between Thursday night and Friday morning, leading to ventilation. The winds, which were calmer, shifted to northeasterly to easterly during the day, allowing air mass to get accumulated close to the surface again,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. SAFAR has predicted an AQI of 208 (poor) for Saturday. The concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 was 96 microgrammes per cubic metre (µg/m3) on Friday against the safe limit of 60 µg/m3, while the PM10 levels were 172 µg/m3 against the safe limit of 100 µg/m3. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily air quality bulletin, Mumbai recorded an AQI of 182 (moderate), which was an average reading of 16 locations. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature in the suburbs was 34.2 degrees Celsius and in south Mumbai was 33.8 degrees Celsius, both a degree Celsius above normal. The minimum temperature was close to the normal mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-air-quality-improves-on-friday-but-continues-to-remain-in-poor-category/story-HCwdTsW0vlWjsFLyV6lsKP.html

Dhotre informed the same during a meeting with the officials of state-owned BSNL and other telecom department officials. “The 4G mobile towers would be installed in border areas along the Nepal and China border in Chamoli, Champawat, Pithoragarh and Uttarkashi districts,” informed Dhotre. “Out of the 28, sites for 22 mobile towers have already been acquired while the installation of mobile towers at 11 sites is already on,” he said. The minister said that the mobile towers once installed, “will help the para-military forces posted in those border areas to be in touch with their family members.” “It would also help the people of those areas to get services like telemedicine and tele-education. It will also help in promoting tourism in those areas,” said Dhotre. Also read: IndiGo asks passengers to carry RT-PCR report to fly to MaharashtraHe also directed the authorities to improve the mobile connectivity on the Char Dham route. The development of installing mobile towers has come amid reports of villagers of border areas, especially near the Nepal border, using Nepalese SIM cards for mobile connectivity due to poor or absolutely no service of the Indian service providers. Later in the day, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat announced setting up of a robotics centre in Dehradun for the development of robotics and to attract youth. The announcement was made during the foundation laying event of Software Technology Parks of India’s (STPI) Dehradun incubation centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/28-4g-mobile-towers-to-rise-in-uttarakhand-s-border-areas-to-boost-connectivity/story-npfNAhTzfMGcBRkQ1tjlhO.html
27-11-2020||City||Nothing concrete done to control Buddha Nullah pollution, finds NGT team||Finding no progress in the upgrade of sewer treatment plants (STPs) that are meant to reduce pollution in the Buddha Nullah, the monitoring committee of National Green Tribunal (NGT) warned the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) of a higher penalty if corrective steps are not taken.The committee, during its visit to the city on Friday, told MC that if it fails to stop the flow of sewer water into Buddha Nullah by March 2021, it may have to pay ₹10 lakh for each drain every month as penalty. At least 16 drains converge into the highly polluted Buddha Nullah from different parts of the city. In all, the MC may end up paying ₹3 crore a month, they warned.The six-member NGT committee was led by chairman Justice Jasbir Singh (retd) and Justice Pritam Pal (retd). Former Punjab chief secretary SC Agrawal, former Haryana chief secretary Urvashi Gulati, environmentalist Sant Balbir Singh Seechewal, and technical expert Dr Babu Ram, who is also a former member secretary of Punjab Pollution Control Board, are part of the committee.The committee members raised doubts over the working of the real-time monitoring system installed in Jainpur village to check the pollution in Buddha Nullah. Committee member Babu Ram said that against an suspected BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of 250, the system showed a reading of 40. The committee collected samples from the site to cross check the facts. Other projects inspectedThe team inspected different ongoing projects, including the Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETP) for dyeing industry on Bahadurke Road, carcass utilisation plant, modern slaughterhouse and micro-forests being set up on the banks of Buddha Nullah. They also directed the SPVs of the Focal Point and Tajpur Road dyeing cluster to commission their CETPs by December-end. The committee praised MC chief Pardeep Sabharwal and the additional commissioner (income tax) Rohit Mehra for the 10 micro forests being set up on the banks of the Nullah. The authorities said they have planned 300 such forests for the city.Committee chairman Justice Jasvir Singh (retd) said, “It is good that the MC is working on the construction of a carcass plant and slaughterhouse. However, nothing concrete has been done to reduce the pollution of Buddha Nullah. If the MC fails to stop flow of sewage from 16 points, it will have to pay ₹10 lakh a month for each drain, as the NGT’s past orders.”‘₹15 crore wasted’Justice Jasbir Singh further said that five green bridges were established with the help of central pollution control board (CPCB) at a cost of ₹15 crore for bioremediation of polluted water in the Nullah in the past. But the bridges are now lying defunct as the MC failed to maintain them. ‘Nullah cannot be covered’Slamming the proposals being submitted by different industrial organisations, seeking the covering of the nullah for construction of buildings on the same, Justice Jabir Singh said, “Buddha Nullah cannot be covered and NGT will not allow the same. We should rather work to reduce pollution in the nullah.” ‘Establish carcass plant by Feb or face ₹1 lakh per month penalty’Ludhiana: With the MC delaying the competition of carcass utilisation plant being established at the cost of ₹7.98 crore in Noorpur bet area, the monitoring committee directed it to complete the project by February 2021 or pay ₹1 lakh a month as penalty till the project is complete. The project was to be complete by August this year but the deadline was extended to December due to the lockdown. The plant is being establish so that the ‘Hadda-Rodi’ being run on the banks of Sutlej can be closed. The skinners dump the waste in the river which adds to the pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nothing-concrete-done-to-control-buddha-nullah-pollution-finds-ngt-team/story-REMgteImqEawhrfXcgsPOL.html
27-11-2020||Gurugram||Woman drugged, gang-raped in Udyog Vihar hotel, four suspects on run||A 27-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped by four men in a prominent hotel in Udyog Vihar after she was given a drink laced with sedatives on November 24, police said. The victim, a resident of Delhi, complained to the women police station, on November 25 following which a case was registered against the four suspects. Police said they were yet to arrest anyone in the case. Panhkuri Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (crime against women - west), said that the victim has an event management company and was invited for a birthday party by a group of friends. “The victim has alleged that she met the suspects in one of her events and they had befriended each other and were in touch for the past many days,” she said. Police said the suspects invited her for a birthday party and offered her drinks, following which she fell unconscious and she was taken to a room and raped. “She has alleged that when she tried to resist, they threatened her and assaulted her when she tried to flee after gaining consciousness. The victim in her statement said the men even tried to console her the next morning when she raised an alarm. They later threatened her of dire consequences if she narrated her ordeal to anyone,” said Yadav. A case under sections 376 D (gang rape), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 323 (assault) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Women west police station. Police said a team has been formed and raids were being conducted at suspected locations to arrest the suspects.The victim’s statement under section 164 was recorded in Gurugram’s court on Thursday, where she did not mention incident of rape, instead she merely said she was called for a family birthday party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-drugged-gang-raped-in-udyog-vihar-hotel-four-suspects-on-run/story-t1W835To3xNsYjrkKoBNOO.html
27-11-2020||Gurugram||Air quality back in moderate, Manesar sees satisfactory air for first time this month||The air quality in the city improved significantly on Friday and entered into the moderate category of the air quality index, for the first time in seven days week. On Friday, Gurugram’s air recorded 107 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily AQI bulletin. This is down from 276 (indicating poor air) the previous day. Gurugram on Friday remained the least polluted among major NCR cities, although significant improvements in air quality were seen across the region, with Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Noida all recording moderate air as well. The neighbouring township of Manesar, on the other hand, saw satisfactory air for the first time this month, recording 79 on the CPCB’s AQI bulletin. Experts and officials said this was due to strong winds blowing from north and north-west of Delhi, which touched up to 16kmph in some parts on Thursday afternoon. “Manesar, which lies west of Gurugram, has seen favourable influence of winds. If you look at cities to the east, they would have been less influenced by these winds. Like Ghaziabad, which recorded the highest AQI of 166,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist. Delhi meanwhile, recorded 137 on the AQI, while Noida was at 125 and Faridabad at 134. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality improved significantly owing to strong winds during both day and night. The strong winds — highly favourable for dispersion of pollutants — will continue. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from north-west with wind speed touching up to 18 kmph in the afternoon/evening and mainly clear sky on November 27.” Official forecasts peg Gurugram’s AQI for Saturday at 226, in the poor category.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, said that cleaner winds are now blowing into the NCR region from the north and north-west, especially since farm fire counts have significantly shrunk this week. “Stubble burning season is now behind us. If farm fires were still ongoing, we would have far worse pollution levels,” Singh said, adding that air quality is likely to deteriorate further by early next week, with wind speeds expected to drop to about 6kmph per hour. The minimum temperature of Gurugram settled at 10.5 degrees Celsius on Friday, lower than the previous day’s reading of 11 degrees Celsius. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 25 degrees Celsius on Thursday, more than 24 degrees Celsius the day prior. Increased penetration of sunlight and clear skies helped push up the daytime temperature, with dispersal of pollutants occurring through the afternoon, as evidenced by data from the city’s official air quality monitors. At Vikas Sadan, for example, the concentration of PM2.5 pollutants was at 167ug/m3 at 10am, but had cleared up to 48ug/m3 by 4pm. At the official monitor in Sector 51, which typically records higher pollution levels than any other monitor in Gurugram, the concentration of PM2.5 fell from 138ug/m3 at 11am to 56ug/m3 at 5pm, with this specific monitor recording an average AQI of 92 for the day (in the satisfactory category of the AQI). As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast, the maximum temperature will hover around 25 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature is expected to stay at 10 degrees in Gurugram, throughout the next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-back-in-moderate-manesar-sees-satisfactory-air-for-first-time-this-month/story-HA7PXNtUGR8XL8L4HkqrnI.html
27-11-2020||Gurugram||Police remove barricades on Gurugram-Delhi Expressway after reports of congestion||Gururgam and Delhi police on Friday eased checking of vehicles at the Sirhaul border on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway to prevent traffic congestion after more than two kilometres of traffic jam was reported from both sides of the carriageway, said the police. The barricades were removed during the peak hours in the morning on Friday after vehicles started piling up on the stretches due to the security checks in view of farmers’ Delhi Chalo protest march. A 2km-long traffic jam was witnessed on both sides of the expressway, following which senior officers visited the spot and directed the police personnel to remove the barricades. Traffic snarls were also reported from borders connecting Delhi with Kapashera, Sirhaul, Aya Nagar and Mandi in the morning. The police said the traffic flow eased after the barricades were removed. The borders connecting Palwal, Nuh, Rewari and Rajasthan reported a smoother flow of traffic as the vehicular movement was low as compared to other days, said the police. Astha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said, “There was a jam at the border on both sides on Friday morning, after which we spoke with Delhi Police and decided to remove the barricades. “The commuters had to face inconvenience during the morning hours, but experienced a smooth drive in the evening. The police teams continued to periodically check vehicles throughout the day,” she said. According to the police, no violence was reported from any of the 13 borders of the state connecting either the national Capital or Rajasthan. Nishant Kapoor, a daily commuter to Gurugram, said, “The police should have checked only the suspected people or vehicles carrying more than two people. They were checking the identity of all commuters and, therefore, it took more than five minutes to check each vehicle, due to which the traffic piled up on the stretch.” Another daily commuter to Delhi, said that the traffic congestion at the Sirhaul border is a daily affair. “The stretch witnesses congestion, weather or not there is barricading. This stretch is one of the most congested for daily commuters,” said Ankita Singh. The police said no tractor trolley or a large groups of people were seen crossing the border. Nikita Gehlot, the deputy commissioner of police (Manesar), said that they had deployed extra forces on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway as they were suspecting framers to take that route. However, no protestors were seen on the stretch.“We had removed all the barricades by 4pm and the extra force was sent back. There were no trenches dug by the Gurugram Police at any borders unlike other districts to control farmers from entering the national Capital,” she said. The police said they had deployed 928 personnel at 123 checkpoints across the city connecting the nearby districts with the state and national capitals. The Gurugram Police regularly coordinated with the Delhi Police to streamline vehicular movement throughout the day. Meanwhile, traffic crawled in many parts of Delhi on Friday after Delhi Police closed several border points with Haryana in view of the protest march. The Tikri, Dhansa and Jharoda Kalan borders, which connect Haryana, were closed for traffic movement due to the demonstration and commuters were asked to take alternative routes, said Delhi traffic police officials. Vehicles were also diverted from Mukarba Chowk and GT Karnal Road. Taj Hassan, special CP (traffic), said the traffic situation was chaotic on the highways passing through Singhu and Tikri borders. “These two are main arterial roads, so the traffic was bound to be impacted,” Hassan said. In contrast, border routes connecting Delhi and UP were less affected. “Since there was checking at all border points, traffic movement remained slow throughout the day,” said Hassan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/police-remove-barricades-on-gurugram-delhi-expressway-after-reports-of-congestion/story-1RGgMlsYPASPndzvR6iVpL.html
27-11-2020||Gurugram||District gears up for massive testing drive, focus will be on providing timely results, says CMO||Gurugram district administration stares at the mammoth task of conducting at least 10,000 tests this Saturday — as part of a mass testing drive for Covid-19 — with officials anxiously waiting to take on the challenge of having to deliver the result of all such tests in 48 hours in order for the drive to be effective.The drive, officials said, was aimed at timely identification of suspected cases, which in turn would help in flattening the new infection curve.As per the district health bulletin, with 698 new infection reported on Friday, the count of active cases reached an all-time high of 6,463. The addition of four new deaths also took the Covid-19 toll to 278. Of the active cases, 455 are admitted in hospitals, while 5,996 are home isolated. The total tally of Covid-19 cases by Friday had touched 47,951, beyond the state projection of 43,000 for November. Considering this unprecedented surge in number of cases and to break the transmission chain, the district health department has decided to hold a mass testing drive on Saturday. The department will target high-risk areas — with test positivity rates between six and 10 percent, such as Patel Nagar, Laxman Vihar, Om Nagar, Feroze Gandhi colony and Gandhi Nagar. It will also cover Sadar market and wholesale market in Khandsa. The department will also hold camps in the community centre in these areas where everyone can get tested. Camps will also be held at 33 Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHC) and PHCs in rural areas.Following the state health department’s directive, the department will administer 80% tests through gold frontline Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), while the remaining will be through rapid antigen tests. RT-PCR test results are to be delivered in 24-48 hours. Timely test results play a critical role if excessive volume of samples are collected in a day. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of the district, held a meeting on Friday with private diagnostic labs that would run the tests for samples beyond the capacity of the government lab. “Almost 2000 RT-PCR tests can be run at the government lab if machines are operational 24x7. We have decided to run two RT-PCR machines 24x7, for the next two days for testing 4,000 samples, while the remaining 6000 or more samples will be given to four labs, who have signed MoUs with the state health department on testing the samples at Rs 900 each,” said Yadav. The government lab in Civil Hospital, sector 10 will be running tests 24x7 on Saturday and Sunday to deliver timely test results, added Yadav.The big private labs, on the other hand, have also made strategic changes to handle the volume of samples coming from Gurugram and other districts. Dr Rishabh Rajput, director -Covid-19 lab, Modern Diagnostics, said that they are expecting more than 10,000 samples from Gurugram and other districts. “The teams have been told to work in double shifts for the next two days. We already have a staff of 150 people. Lab technicians will be incentivised for double shifts. Additional manpower has also been outsourced to assist in testing and making entries of positive cases in the Indian Council of Medical Research portal. The target is to give test results in 48 hours,” said Rajput.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-gears-up-for-massive-testing-drive-focus-will-be-on-providing-timely-results-says-cmo/story-pU4rEKVTO79KC4ZHKcbtvO.html

Apurva Kumar Singh, principal secretary, town and country planning department, who conducted the inspection on Thursday with senior HSVP officials, issued the order to suspend Bhoop Singh, executive engineer, after finding that the work on the project was running way behind schedule. Last week, a Gurugram court had directed the city police to register a case against HSVP officials for making inflated payments to the contractor in the matter. Bhoop Singh was in-charge of the work on this site, the order issued by Singh said. In 2014, the state government had announced the construction of Country Club for residents in sector 56 and HSVP had given the contract to a private firm for Rs 11.88 crore. The deadline to complete the project was 15 months but the deadline was extended repeatedly and the project remained incomplete despite inflated payment to the tune of Rs 19.60 crore, officials claimed. The suspension order (a copy of which HT has seen) issued by the principal secretary observed that it was shocking to see that there was no noticeable physical progress on site in the work for over one year since December 2019, when the undersigned (principal secretary) visited the site. Even after Unlock five, the executive engineer has failed to take interest in his work and had become complacent and uncaring towards his duties, it said. “The executive engineer, HSVP, will be placed under suspension with immediate effect,” the order stated, adding that a special audit will be conducted of the works under the charge of the executive engineer concerned, with regard to release of funds, utilization reports, and physical progress reports of all major works (above Rs 2 crore each) be audited for last two years. Bhoop Singh was also transferred to Rohtak. Jitender Yadav, administrator, Gurugram, HSVP, when asked about the matter, confirmed the development but did not comment on the matter. “Action has been taken against the official concerned,” he said. Bhoop Singh, executive engineer, HSVP, did not reply to calls and messages by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-executive-engineer-suspended-after-inspection-of-country-club/story-brrzb0Sg1OL5GnZZxwOusM.html
27-11-2020||Gurugram||Nearly 25,000 frontline workers identified for priority Covid vaccine shots||Gurugram health department has identified at least 24,971 frontline health care workers in the district for priority vaccination against Covid-19, officials said on Friday. Of these, 4,623 individuals work across 56 health care facilities in the district — including at 19 primary health care centres, the civil surgeon’s office, polyclinics, dispensaries and warehouses. About 20,328 others work at various privately-run hospitals and clinics in Gurugram, as per data provided by the health department.With vaccine delivery expected to commence early next year, officials said they are preparing for a scenario in which demand outstrips supply. “We have to prioritise who gets the vaccine. Both central and state governments have clarified that frontline health and sanitation workers will be the first beneficiaries. All districts in the state are in the process of identifying them, so sufficient availability of doses can be secured for the first phase of this campaign,” said Naresh Garg, district immunization officer, Gurugram. Of the 25,000 odd workers already identified, the health department will further prioritise those over the age of 60 or have co-morbidities. “The most vulnerable workers will be the first to receive the vaccine,” said Garg. Across the state, a total of 97,000 workers in the public sector, and another 170,000 in the private sector have been identified as of November 27, data with the health department stated. The second phase of immunization may cover other vulnerable groups such as policemen and the elderly, department officials said.However, officials said, a significant portion of private facilities in Gurugram are yet to submit details of their staff. As per official data, there are at least 325 registered private health care facilities in Gurugram, including 87 general hospitals, 132 clinics, 130 multi-specialty hospitals and six super-specialty hospitals, in addition to several smaller practices. “But we have received details from only 260 facilities so far. Gurugram is a hub of private health care, so the number of frontline workers in the private sector is expected to be much higher, possibly the highest for any district in the state,” said a health department official, preferring anonymity.Confirming this, Garg said that the department is making efforts to reach out to more private facilities through organisations such as the Indian Medical Association and other professional bodies. “We can’t force anyone to send us their details. It is entirely voluntary, but it is definitely recommended that all facilities provide us with their staff numbers. Everyone is eligible to receive the vaccine, from doctors to sanitation workers, nurses, ambulance drivers and so on. We are also reaching out to proprietors of radiology clinics, skin clinics and other private practices through the appropriate professional associations,” Garg added. Other preparations for vaccine delivery that are in progress include augmentation of cold-chain points and vaccine delivery infrastructure. The health department had, in October, started taking stock of available cold chain equipment (CCE), such as walk-in freezers, walk-in coolers, ice-lined refrigerators and temperature-monitoring devices, which are used in the storage and transportation of vaccines. Though officials did not provide numbers from their assessment, they clarified that a report had been sent to the state government with details. Gurugram is one of four proposed regional vaccine stores in Haryana, which also supplies doses to Faridabad, Mewat, Palwal and Jhajjar. In order to accommodate doses of the vaccine as they make their way to other districts, health department officials said they would need to increase the number of cold-chain points, where vaccines can be stored at required temperatures, to maintain their integrity. There are 33 such points in the district (out of 659 in Haryana), of which 19 are in urban areas and 14 in rural areas. “The state government has received allocation for additional cold-chain equipment and will further distribute it among the districts. We are in the process of exploring locations which can be turned into cold-chain points, but it is a bit early to comment on where they will be created. We will definitely try to augment storage capacities at our existing primary health care centres, which are cold-chain points themselves,” Garg said.A district task force on Covid vaccine delivery is expected to meet on December 1, under the aegis of the deputy commissioner, Gurugram, to plan the next course of action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nearly-25-000-frontline-workers-identified-for-priority-covid-vaccine-shots/story-ftlOw5jD7l3P8lOlK18GhN.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Delhi’s greatest qawwal||This winter marks the fifth death anniversary of Meraj Ahmed Nizami, the great qawwal of the sufi shrine of Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya.The news of Meraj’s passing had gone completely unrecorded. Now, in this season of losses, one may as well commemorate the loss of one of the most accomplished, if little-known, figures of contemporary Delhi.As the elderly patriarch of Nizami Khusro Bandhu family, Meraj was among a very few classical qawwals left in India. He rendered Persian sufi verses most fluently in the old tarz, or melodies. This frail erudite supremely elegant man lived most modestly, in a one-room house near the aforementioned 14th century shrine.Meraj’s grandfather’s grandfather was the “shahi gawayya (royal singer)” in the court of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal. Ustad Tanras Khan, founder of the Delhi Gharana, taught music to Zafar. His lineage is traced to Mian Samad bin Ibrahim, the leader of the Qawwal Bachche, a group formed by Amir Khusrau that is believed to comprise the world’s first qawwals.Khusrau, a court poet to Delhi Sultanate kings, was closely associated with the evolution of Hindustani classical music. A disciple of Hazrat Nizamuddin, he is buried close to his tomb. The two graves are separated by a marble courtyard, the venue where Mian Samad’s descendants have been offering qawwalis throughout centuries, right down to Meraj, and now his sons, among other qawwal families. Maintaining a steady intimacy with the classics, Meraj had a personal repertoire of poetry that came down to him from his ancestors. He used to sing Rumi’s Masnavi fluently, in its original Persian version, a rare feat among qawwals. Like sufi singer Abida Parveen, his ability to add girah was legendary. Girah is a special aspect where verses from various poems are seamlessly woven into one single qawwali. For instance, if Meraj sang a Khusrau poem, which has lines in Persian and Purabiya, he would manipulate the composition by bringing in Kabir Das or Bedam Shah Warsi in the Purabiya portion, and Rumi or Jami in the Persian segment. It was Meraj who introduced Kabir Das’s dohas, Meera’s bhajans and Bulleh Shah’s kafis in the sufi dargahs.Always dressed in pyjamas, achkan and topi, Meraj was, artistically, a snob and a qawwal had to be truly skilled to earn his respect. Professionally, he didn’t care for money, more focused on keeping his form’s purity.He might not have been a popular name among the masses, but it is said that every time a scholar from the West landed in India to research on qawwali, he/she headed straight to Meraj. The structure of Regula Burckhardt Qureshi’s seminal book on qawwali, “Sufi Music of India and Pakistan”, is entirely presented through Meraj’s repertoire and performances.Meraj lies buried in the Panj Peeran Qabristan, walking distance from his home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-delhi-s-greatest-qawwal/story-5UaKb13LKV73JEuqouE8wK.html

27-11-2020||Chandigarh||Can’t assume cop will favour ‘friend’ in probe: HC to doctor booked for cheating||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that it cannot be assumed that public servants will manoeuvre a crime investigation in favour of people in their social circle.The high court bench of justice Sant Parkash made the observation while dismissing a plea with allegations against former Chandigarh director general of police (DGP) TS Luthra and former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) special director Rakesh Asthana by a city-based doctor, Mohit Dhawan.Dhawan had sought transfer of a probe into a cheating case registered against him on September 21 to outside the Chandigarh Police’s jurisdiction or any other agency. He was booked in two cheating cases, one in 2018 on the complaint of Gertrude D’Souza, a US citizen, who had got a dental implant procedure done at his clinic in 2017, and another in September this year on the complaint of another woman, Enid Nayabundi, from Nairobi, Kenya.Dhawan alleged that he was a victim of malice, vendetta and extortion, unleashed by Asthana, who was known to D’Souza, while Nayabundi was instigated by D’Souza into lodging another complaint.The court observed that allegations of close proximity of former CBI special director with D’Souza were mere assumptions and not substantiated by any material on record.The high ranking police officer was never posted in Chandigarh. Him only having graduated with D’Souza’s husband from same university/college in 1982 will not necessarily lead to any inference that he was instrumental in getting the investigation conducted in a biased manner, the bench added. Besides, the complaints being sent to the officials on their personal email IDs or the two parties being friends on social media websites did not give rise to any presumption of mala fide, the court said.As of Luthra, the court said, he was transferred out of Chandigarh way back in 2018. HC also dismissed claims of the doctor that the second complaint was manipulated by D’Souza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/can-t-assume-cop-will-favour-friend-in-probe-hc-to-doctor-booked-for-cheating/story-tntXpBiATsMD3FIPIeWdvO.html

After receiving the letter from the council on Thursday, principals of many schools held a meeting with staff members on Friday, and asked them to make necessary arrangements to conduct the exam.Earlier, students of different classes used to sit together on dual benches. But, due to the pandemic, school authorities have to accommodate students according to the size of the room by maintaining a distance of two metres. School principals also said that only 10% students attend classes daily and most are opting to attend online classes.A principal, requesting anonymity, said, “We have over 1,400 students in Class 11 and 50 classrooms. We can accommodate a maximum of 15 to 20 students in one room and need more space to conduct the exams. We have only dual benches and will face shortage of furniture. We also need extra staff for examination duty. We will inform the district education officer so that teachers of other schools can be deputed.”Navdeep Romana, principal of government senior secondary school, multipurpose, held a meeting with staff members on Friday to prepare a seating plan to conduct the exam. “We have around 3,300 students in Classes 9 to 12, of which 1,200 are in Class 12. It will be a major problem to accommodate students in classrooms while maintaining social distancing. We have only around 40 classrooms and need more space. We will also require more teachers to conduct the exam,” Romana said. SCERT director Jagtar Singh Kulria, said, “We have received requests from parents to conduct the exams for Classes 9 to 12. Proper guidelines have been issued to district education officers, secondary and elementary, and school principals to conduct the exam while adhering to Covid safety norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-scert-to-conduct-exams-for-classes-1-to-12/story-NwTmKxKDVDfHl10nEr2yiJ.html

One side of the bridge (Ludhiana to Delhi in Khanna) will be closed for traffic for nearly two months due to soil settlement. The sudden bend in the road was posing a threat to commuters after some complained of losing balance over the wheels, due to an uneven road. According to the NHAI project director Virender Kumar, the excavation work is on to find out the possible cause of the damage. “We cannot comment on the reasons behind the settlement (road bending). The exact cause would be ascertained only after digging of the earth during repair work,” said Kumar.Divulging the details, the company’s site in-charge Hitesh Dhawan said that the bridge has been closed due to settlement (caused sudden road bending). We have closed one side of the bridge for repair work and soon it be completely closed for traffic. “The repair work will take at least one-and-a-half month,” said Dhawan.He blamed the dumping of garbage underneath the bridge and the resultant mice menace to be the reason behind the settlement. “For the past one year we have been writing letters to the Khanna Nagar Council to remove the garbage dump, but no action has been taken so far. The mice have led to the disturbing of soil which is suspected to have led to the settlement (caused a bend) in the bridge,” said Dhawan.On the other hand, the council of engineers has condemned the constriction company for poor workmanship. Er, Kapil Arora, president of the council of engineers said, “The entire stretch and other flyovers located at Samrala Chowk in Ludhiana as well as Sirhind are also in poor condition.” Meanwhile, Khanna Nagar Council’s executive officer Charanjit Singh said, “We have a dump underneath the bridge at Samrala Road.

The Union home ministry had earlier in the day blamed the Delhi government for the increase in Covid-19 cases, adding that despite ‘repeated exhortations’, it did not take any steps to enhance testing capacity, specifically for RT-PCR tests which have remained static at around 20,000 tests.In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, the ministry added, “While there were regular advertisements on achievements of Delhi Government, including on dengue prevention and control, no ads on Covid appropriate behaviour were to be seen. The people, at large, were also not apprised about this through regular outreach measures.”Also Read: Delhi is conducting more Covid-19 tests compared to rest of India, says JainThe AAP said in a statement said it is extremely unfortunate that the Centre has decided to play dirty politics in this critical hour. “The affidavit seems to have been drafted by a BJP spokesperson rather than by the Union government which is meant to work in collaboration with the states at the time of a pandemic. The affidavit is also factually incorrect,” it said.The Arvind Kejriwal-led party reiterated Union home minister Amit Shah’s promise to provide 750 intensive care unit (ICU) beds within 72 hours during a meeting held on November 15 by pointing out that only 200 beds were provided till date. “The central government has deprived Delhi of all funds, provided to other state governments during this epidemic, on the flimsy premise that Delhi is a UT. Therefore, we hope that the central government will do something concrete for Delhiites rather than play the blame game,” AAP added.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicDelhi for the past few weeks has once again emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot in the country.

Their counsel Pardeep Rapria told court that the farmers who were to be released on Friday were asked to deposit ₹50,000 and ₹1 lakh as personal surety by the executive magistrates concerned to secure the release. Such big amounts are not even sought from those booked for serious crimes, he had told court adding that from where would farmers secure this amount for their release.

The farmers’ counsel, though, could not give any document substantiating his claims before the court. The court was hearing a plea alleging illegal detention of 100 leaders who had to go to Delhi to participate in protests. It had supplied a list of 30 leaders too.

27-11-2020||Chandigarh||50 FPOs from Haryana get Centre’s support under new scheme||As many as 50 farmer producer organisations (FPOs) from Haryana have got the central government’s support under the new FPO scheme. “However, if Haryana government pitches for promoting beekeeping and do the handholding for FPOs, then the Centre will support the initiative under the beekeeping and mission and FPO scheme,” a top agriculture ministry official said after the inauguration. The honey FPO programme of National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED) was inaugurated by Union minister of agriculture NS Tomar on Thursday. The federation has initiated the formation and promotion of FPOs of beekeepers and honey collectors in five states of West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The official said beekeepers of Haryana had formed a FPO in December, 2007 under the overall supervision of National Bee Board and Haryana horticulture department. The FPO having about 2,250 members has an annual average honey production of 7,000 metric tonnes. Under the new FPO scheme, the national level project management advisory and fund sanctioning committee had allocated 2,200 FPO clusters, including 50 for Haryana, for 2020-21. FPOs formed under the small farmers agri-business consortiums aim at increasing incomes of small and marginal farmers through aggregation and development of agri-business. While speaking at the inauguration, Tomar said beekeeping is highly predominant in the unorganised sector comprising mainly of the rural population. “Despite having a huge potential of honey production in the country, the beekeeping industry is still underdeveloped. The adoption level of beekeeping is also quite less due to various constraints like technical, institutional, trade, seasonality, quality, operational, quality, etc. NAFED will address these issues by acting as an intermediary and filling up the gaps between the elements of the beekeeping supply chain and also ensure price remuneration to farmers,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/50-fpos-from-haryana-get-centre-s-support-for-beekeeping/story-Ha05ll2uTkZwj8m8h54bxH.html

27-11-2020||India||Centre in SC blames Delhi govt for rise in Covid cases, says no steps taken despite exhortations||The Centre on Friday blamed Delhi government for rising Covid-19 cases in the national capital and said that despite “repeated exhortations” it did not take steps to enhance testing capacity, particularly for RT-PCR, which remained static at around 20,000 tests for a long time. The Centre said that Delhi government was well aware that the confluence of winter, festival season and pollution were likely to witness a surge in cases and this foreknowledge ought to have led to strict enforcement and Information, Education and Communication (IEC) measures being instituted well in time but this was not done. In its affidavit, filed before the top court, the Ministry of Home affairs (MHA), said “while there were regular advertisements on achievements of Delhi Government, including on dengue prevention and control, no ads on Covid appropriate behaviour were to be seen. The people, at large, were also not apprised about this through regular outreach measures”. It said, “That despite repeated exhortations in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases, the Delhi Government did not take steps to enhance testing capacity, particularly for RT-PCR, which remained static at around 20,000 RTPCR tests for a long time”. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R S Reddy and M R Shah took the Centre’s affidavit on record and observed that “Things are going from bad to worse but no concrete steps are being taken. States will have to rise above the politics. All states will have to rise to the occasion,” the bench said while posting the matter for further hearing on December 1. The Centre said that despite issuing several elaborate and exhaustive guidelines for containment and prevention of the infection and for ensuring proper treatment of Covid patients, Delhi government saw its first wave of Coronavirus infection in the month of June-July and the union government immediately had to take pro-active and pre-emptive steps to control further spread of Covid-19. The Centre pointed out that to deal with the shortcomings, which lead to a massive increase in the Covid infection and the increasing strain on the capacity of medical infrastructure in the hospitals of Delhi, the Union Home Minister Amit Shah was constrained to call another meeting on November 15 to review the situation in the national capital. It said that even now, “after it was committed that GNCTD would increase ICU (non-ventilator) beds by around 2,680, the Chief Minister, vide its letter dated November 19, 2020 addressed to the Union Home Minister, has expressed his inability to enhance ICU beds in the Delhi (State Government and private) hospitals by more than around 912, and has asked the Central Government to create the additional 1,700 ICU beds”. It said that several meetings were held by cabinet secretary, union home secretary and health secretary with all concerned officials of Delhi government, municipal bodies and others to review the status of Covid-19 management and it was emphasised that all steps be taken to contain the situation in Delhi.The Centre pointed out that despite constant monitoring by the MHA about scrupulous compliance of the directions by Delhi government various short-comings, going into the root of the matter, were noticed in the implementation of the program. It said that thereafter a series of review meetings chaired by the Union Health Secretary were held from July 8 to November 13 and several issues were regularly emphasized to the Delhi government. The affidavit highlighted the shortcomings which include conversion of more beds into oxygenated/ventilator supported beds, strict perimeter control of containment zones, and more testing and especially through the RT-PCR method, to ensure that COVID positive persons are detected early and medical response can be given. The Centre said that several other issues which were flagged in the review meetings include that Delhi must monitor requirement of ambulances and other infrastructure so that no patient remains untreated and responded to and in view of the approaching festival period, marriage season and winter climatic conditions, GNCTD shall act proactively and thoroughly act according to the guidelines. “In addition, Cabinet Secretary also reviewed the Covid situation in 08 States/UTs including NCT of Delhi which constitute of 62 per cent of the nationwide active cases and 61 per cent of the total deaths, through Video conference on November 11”, it said, adding that it was emphasized on strict implementation of guidelines for COVID and rigor of containment measures. Detailing the shortcomings found on the part of Delhi government, the Centre said that no effective preventive steps to contain the infection were taken despite the recommendation of high power committee headed by Dr V K Paul, member NITI Ayog, which said that Delhi should plan for a surge of around 15,000 cases per day and accordingly provide for about 6,500 ICU beds. It said that the Delhi government did not take any timely measures to increase the ICU beds from the present level of around 3,500, thus causing a sudden pressure to come on the health and medical infrastructure in Delhi. The Centre said that even patients who were under home isolation were not properly traced and/or their contacts were also not traced effectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/centre-in-sc-blames-delhi-govt-for-rise-in-covid-cases-says-no-steps-taken-despite-exhortations/story-5KBKGKyZeap54C2p8w8gUJ.html

It was later that the farmers were allowed by authorities to enter Delhi and hold peaceful protests at the Nirankari ground in Burari.On Thursday, farmers faced water canons and broke police barriers at Punjab’s border with Haryana to push towards the national capital.The AAP stands in support of the farmers’ demands, the party’s Punjab in-charge and Tilak Nagar MLA Jarnail Singh said.“Till these three dark laws are not rolled back, the farmers will continue their protest, and the AAP stands in support with them,” he said.The farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which came into effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind’s assent.Though the central government has maintained that the laws will bring better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture, farmers have expressed apprehension that the legislations will pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.AAP Burari MLA Sanjeev Jha, who along with party volunteers has gone to the Singhu border to receive farmers, earlier in the day met Delhi Police officials and asked them to ensure farmers do not face any hardships during their demonstration at the Nirankari ground in his constituency.Jha said that he also met farmers’ representatives and assured them that he will try his best to ensure farmers do not face any kind of problems.AAP spokesperson and Rajinder Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha welcomed the farmers and said the party will take care of all necessary arrangements.“We welcome farmers to Delhi.

Farmers you fearlessly raise your voice, we stand with you,” Chadha said.Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh also extended his support to the farmers. “The farmers have been allowed to protest in Delhi after so much struggle. They were lathi-charged, teargas was used on them and when all means of the government failed then they were given permission. Why has the government pushed the meeting date till December 3, the farmers are struggling now why wait till then,” he said.AAP MLA from Rithala Mohinder Goyal said a kitchen has been started in his constituency to provide food to farmers. “From tomorrow morning, the Rithala Vidhan Sabha will make arrangements for food for 1 lakh farmer friends,” Goyal tweeted, posting pictures of the community kitchen.

27-11-2020||Mumbai||Stan Swamy case: ‘Never recovered straw, sipper or sought 20 days’ says NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday disparaged reports claiming that it sought 20 days’ time from the court to respond to Father Stan Swamy’s plea to allow him a straw and sipper in Taloja Central Jail as he cannot hold a glass because he has Parkinson’s disease. The agency also said that it never recovered any straw and sipper from him, so there was no question of the agency holding onto it. It termed all such claims as “false, incorrect and mischievous”. In an official response, the NIA spokesperson said, “Accused Stan Swamy filed an application on November 6 in the NIA court at Mumbai to get back his straw and sipper which he alleged had been kept by NIA. The court asked the agency to file its reply on the next date, which was scheduled on November 26 (Thursday). NIA never sought any time as such, and to say that NIA sought 20 days time is false, incorrect and mischievous.” Also Read: Bhima-Koregaon case: Father Stan Swamy files plea for woollens, sipper, strawThe agency added, “NIA duly filed its reply in the court on Thursday stating therein that NIA had searched Stan Swamy’s in the presence of independent witnesses and no such straw and sipper were found.” “The court rejected Swamy’s application and ordered the jail authorities to provide him a straw and sipper,” the spokesperson said. Swamy, 83, was arrested in the first week of October by the agency in the Bhima-Koregaon conspiracy case of 2018.The central anti-terror probe agency has claimed in its charge sheet, filed last month itself, that Swamy had received “Rs8 lakh from one comrade Mohan to spread the activities of the Communist Party of India (Maoist)”. Several documents recovered from his place, which have been added to the NIA charge sheet, include “an underground handbook, letters between cadres, a mini-manual of urban guerilla warfare, the constitution of CPI (Maoist), documents related to the status of People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army, documents on strategy and tactics”. One of the letters seized from him stated that Maoists were keeping an eye on the strategy of the Ministry of Home Affairs pertaining to operations against them, according to the NIA charge sheet. While Swamy’s lawyers have claimed in the court that Swamy is a member of the organisation Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC), which works with prisoners under trial, NIA has argued that PPSC is a “frontal organisation” for CPI (Maoist).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/stan-swamy-case-never-recovered-straw-sipper-or-sought-20-days-time-says-nia/story-9ewlzkauaZYjHfLBi6uCaN.html

27-11-2020||Delhi||Helping the homeless: Stories of selfless deeds that will warm your heart||This winter, help spread warmth to those who need it most. Homeless, daily wage workers and those who have lost their homes to calamities are the worst hit. And if the cold weather wasn’t enough, they have Covid19 to battle with everyday. As Rahul Verma, founder, Uday Foundation, rightly points, it is a four-pronged fight. “We are fighting Covid19, hunger, pollution and winter. The least we can do is not ignore what is happening around us. We can’t save people from Covid19, but we help prepare them to face it. For a person living on the street, a warm blanket is a reassurance that there is someone who cares about him,” he says. Relief work is community-based, and volunteers and other good Samaritans add to the task force. “You just have to reach out and people are willing to help. We have conducted distribution drives with armed forces personnel of Delhi Poilce, Jammu and Kashmir Police, BRO, Rashtriya Rifles to name a few,” he shares. Verma and his team help provide blankets, clothing, over-the-counter medicines, masks and sanitisers in addition to several other supplies.  Donate ! https://t.co/cFuzpsKmriThe importance of a shelter in winter cannot be emphasized enough, and then there are those who have been rendered homeless due to either calamities or demolition drives. Avani Gupta, a former data scientist quit her job at the beginning of the pandemic to help rebuild their homes. “I have distributed blankets in Bhopura and Bhowapur in Ghaziabad, and GB Road. I have also provided them with tarpaulin, utensils, clothes, wall paints and electricity supplies so that they can rebuild their homes,” she says. As for funds, she seeks help from crowdfunding sources. “Till now I was sustaining on personal funds, but now I have to ask for crowdfunding,” she adds. Vickey Sharma, an engineer who quit his job in Australia to help people in his homeland, surveys the streets every night, rescuing people in need. “We have a meeting every night and plan our route. We shift people in shelters, hospitalize those who need it, distribute masks and sanitisers, and provide food. We give them blankets and warm clothing,” he says, adding that the zeal to keep going comes from the duty towards his fellow citizens. “Yeh zaroori nahi ki lakh rupaya kamaana hai; hazaar rupaye kamaa lenge, lekin Hindustan mein jo vyakti hai uski help karenge,” he says. Digital marketing specialist Asad Zaidi, along with some friends, aims to distribute 1,0000 blankets every night. “Our campaign is called #BlanketOfLove. We have 10-15 cars which we load with blankets and set off looking for people who need them the most. We enlist help from some NGOs in identifying these places and people,” he says, adding that everything is self-funded and the group pitches in from their own savings.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/helping-the-homeless-stories-of-selfless-deeds-that-will-warm-your-heart/story-ZMYp0TqmBj64gNseKPh1HP.html

MPS Bisht, director USAC said, “The system built using GIS mapping is the first of its kind to be used in the management of any of the mahakumbhs held in the country.” Base map covering mela area of 161 sqkm created Bisht said, “Under the developed mechanism, we created a base map of the mela area covering an area of about 161 sqkm. It was made by 15 students of geology at the Garhwal Central University by collecting data on the ground, which includes locations of camping site, sewer lines, medical facilities, toilets and other basic amenities for the pilgrims.” Also Read: Uttarakhand HC directs state govt to file affidavit on Covid-19 preparedness for Mahakumbh 2021He said that after the data was collected, it was then integrated with the satellite imagery to provide realtime data to the authorities. “As per the system, a war room will be built in the mela authorities’ headquarters where the officials can avail realtime data of crowd movement to manage the mega event,” said Bisht. Mobile application for pilgrims to check crowd and water level at ghats on realtime basis The USAC director said that as part of the system, there would also be a mobile application for pilgrims to help them avail various facilities without much hassle. “Using the application, they can get realtime information about crowd concentration on the ghats by which they can decide on which ghat they should visit to take a holy dip. Similarly, they can also see the water level at the ghats and decide accordingly about taking the bath,” said Bisht. He also said that the “easy to use” application will also help pilgrims with the location of various important basic amenities like lodging and transportation. “As we have included the information about the hotels and lodges in the application, the pilgrims can find which hotels have how many rooms vacant. They can also find about the nearest taxi stand or bus stop for their destination just by using the application,” said Bisht. While the portal was to cover all 41 sectors of the mela area, the number is now reduced to half due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The portal will likely cover only about 21 sectors now as authorities are expecting less of a crowd due to the pandemic,” said Bisht.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/in-a-first-uttarakhand-space-agency-develops-gis-mapping-portal-for-crowd-management-during-mahakumbh-2021/story-xabGpMEHSp6sO6ILbFyJ4N.html

Pednekar added that the legal department of BMC will study the high court order before deciding to challenge it in the Supreme Court. Pednekar said, “We believe in the Constitution and we respect the order of Bombay high court. We have issued similar notices in the past and even courts have accepted them. Now, this time we will have to check where we went wrong.”On whether BMC will challenge the order in Supreme Court, Pednekar said, “Our legal department will study the entire issue once the order is served by the court. Only after that we will take a decision.”Also Read: ‘Because you played a villain, I could be a hero’: Kangana Ranaut reacts after Bombay HC rules her bungalow demolished in ‘malice’Pednekar added, “However, I would like to add that someone coming from Himachal Pradesh to Mumbai and calling Mumbai Pakistan occupied Kashmir is wrong, and those trying to make the court a political battlefield is also wrong.”Meanwhile, both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have welcomed the Bombay high court order. The BJP said it was a “political demolition” and BMC must not use public money to compensate Kangana Ranaut, instead, it should come out of the pockets of those who ordered the demolition. The Bombay high court has also directed a valuer to ascertain the damage caused in the demolition and compensate Ranaut accordingly.Prabhakar Shinde, BJP corporator and BJP’s group leader in BMC said, “The demolition of Kangana [Ranaut]’s structure was political vengeance. The Bombay high court order makes it clear that there was malice behind the demolition.”Also Read: Demolition of Kangana Ranaut’s bungalow actuated by malafide: Bombay high courtShinde added, “Also, the compensation given to Kangana Ranaut by BMC, as per Bombay high court’s order, should not be paid from public money. The mayor and municipal commissioner are responsible for the demolition, and the money should be recovered from the pockets of who ordered this political decision.”On the other hand, the Congress welcomed the Bombay high court’s order. Ravi Raja, the Congress corporator and Leader of Opposition in BMC, said, “We welcome and respect the Bombay high court’s order. The BMC should take care and follow proper process before taking any action. At the same time, I also respect that Bombay high court has also asked Ranaut to make responsible statements.”A division bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla on Friday set aside the demolition notice sent to Ranaut by BMC dated September 7 and 9 — marking a victory for Ranaut. The high court said the demolition at her office had malafide intent, passing an order for a valuer to be appointed to ascertain the damage caused in the demolition. However, the court has also asked the actor to exercise restraint while speaking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kangana-ranaut-bungalow-demolition-case-will-study-court-order-before-deciding-to-challenge-it-says-mumbai-mayor/story-pYYa6zW4wbVKAvbNXOkc3H.html
27-11-2020||City||Farmers’ protest: Haryana Police dig trenches to block the path of protesters||Thousands of protesting farmers marching towards Delhi have been facing several hurdles while crossing the police barricades on the Chandigarh-Delhi national highway. The Haryana Police used military tactics—digging trenches at Samalkha, Haldana border, Sonepat, Murthal and Kundli border—to block the path of the protesting farmers.The Haryana Police had installed a 7-foot-tall barricade on the Delhi-Rohtak highway at the Rohad toll plaza, but farmers managed to cross it by breaking it from one side. The state police have stationed sand-laden trucks and water cannons as well as tear gas shells to stop the protesters from proceeding further. Also Read: Farmers’ protest: Delhi govt rejects police request to convert stadiums into temporary prisonsHowever, Delhi Police have used barbed wire to fence the Singhu border between Delhi and Haryana to stop the farmers’ entry into the national capital. Farmers have been unable to cross the multiple layers of fencing and are sitting on dharna nearly 100 metres away from the Singhu border waiting for more groups of farmers to join them before confronting the cops.A senior Sonepat Police officer, seeking anonymity, said the police brought trucks laden with sand at Murthal, near Education City in Sonepat, Murthal and Kundli border.“ We used water cannons and installed barricades but were unable to stop the farmers from moving forward. The protesters are moving in large numbers and some of them throw stones at the policemen during confrontation,” the officer added.A Jhajjar Police officer, who also wished to remain anonymous, told HT that farmers came in large numbers on Friday morning and crossed the Rohad toll plaza despite the 7-foot-tall barrier by breaking some of it.“The protesters broke the windows of the water cannon vehicle and crossed the plaza. Due to their large numbers, we have no option but to let them through,” the officer added.The police have used water cannons and tear gas shells at Tikri and Sinhgu borders twice and famers have started a dharna in Haryana territory near the border.Rakesh Bains, media in-charge of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) said the stand-off between the police and farmers is continuing at Singhu and Tikri border.“ We will cross this hurdle also to reach Delhi. We will wait for an hour here and cross the Sanghu border after other farmers joins us. The police dug up holes to prevent us from reaching Delhi. Our brave farmers crossed every barricade, water cannon, tear gas shells to reach here. Many farmers diverted their route through villages to reach here. The Haryana government has shown that it is against the farmers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-protest-haryana-police-dig-trenches-to-block-the-path-of-protesters/story-5OnmKPQNwX92KPvENiOGzK.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi violence: Court refuses to grant interim bail to Ishrat Jahan, finds no Covid-19 scare in jail||A Delhi court has refused to grant interim bail to former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan in connection with an Unlawful Activities Prevention Act case related to the northeast Delhi violence. She had approached the court for bail citing a Covid-19 outbreak in Mandoli prison and other medical issues.Additional Sessions Judge Amiabh Rawat on Thursday noted that in terms of the medical ailments agitated by the applicant and the report of the Jail Superintendent, the court does not find any cogent reason for enlarging the applicant on interim bail.“Considering the gravity of the offences including Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 with which the applicant is charged, the discussion in the preceding paragraphs and the Jail Report, I do not deem it a fit case to grant interim bail to accused Ishrat Jahan,” ASJ Rawat said.Jahan had sought interim bail on the ground that being jailed had taken a toll on her mental health and some of the inmates at the prison where she was lodged had tested positive or Covid-19. Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, representing Jahan, had argued that she was a practicing advocate and didn’t have any criminal antecedents.Gupta also argued that the applicant had a history of cervical, spine injury (lower back pain) and migraine prior to her arrest and she had been under continuous medication in the past for the said illnesses.It was also submitted that around 15 days back, the applicant fell inside the bathroom while she was in jail due to slippery floor and has suffered spinal injuries. Moreover, the Covid-19 situation inside the jail is precarious and the applicant has anxiety issues, the lawyer argued.Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad had argued that the applicant has been chargesheet in the case under various sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, Arms Act, Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and the Indian Penal Code on charges pertaining to criminal conspiracy, rioting, murder among others.Prasad further argued that the latest medical prescription dated June 14, 2020, of Cribs Hospital relating to the applicant also got verified from the hospital and a report has been obtained and added that there is no urgent medical requirement of the applicant.He also argued that as per the report of the Jail Superintendent, Tihar Jail, Delhi, all the necessary protocols regarding the Covid-19 related precautions are being taken and the situation is totally under control.“There is no Covid-19 scare inside the jail. The applicant is also being given proper treatment for her minor health issues and her condition is stable. In fact, she was tested twice for Covid-19 and was found negative,” Prasad submitted.At least 53 people were killed and hundreds of others were injured in the violence that took place in northeast Delhi between February 24 and 26 sparked by clashes between groups supporting and opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-violence-court-refuses-to-grant-interim-bail-to-ishrat-jahan-finds-no-covid-19-scare-in-jail/story-x8QCHTMNThic5nnJUKuHpJ.html
27-11-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: In Mumbai, number of people not wearing masks almost doubled in last 2 weeks, says BMC||Despite mandatory for people to wear a mask in public places, the number of violators does not seem to be going down in Mumbai. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s data, between November 6 and November 25, the number of violators booked for not wearing mask has almost doubled. The data of BMC shows that the civic body’s squads caught 445,000 citizens for not wearing masks in public places and collected Rs9.28 crore as fine till November 25. The number of violators is almost double compared to 226,000 offenders who were caught till November 6 and paid Rs4.79 crore as fine.The BMC levies a fine of Rs200 from each individual who does not wear a mask in public. According to BMC, currently each of the total 24 wards is levying fine on around 500 citizens daily. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has given each ward a target of booking at least 1,000 citizens daily.Also read | Covid-19: Beginning 2021, India to produce 100 million doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccineOn October 12, the BMC launched a massive drive to penalise 20,000 citizens daily for not wearing a mask, however even that target has not been met yet.As per the BMC data, the highest fine collection has been done from S and L ward which covers areas like Bhandup, Vikhroli, Powai, Kurla and Saki Naka.A BMC official involved in the fine collection said, “The numbers increased drastically because for Diwali, many citizens were out, and the marshals were busy during that period. Owing to this, we managed to book so many in the last two weeks.”The BMC official added, “In the coming days, with more unlocking we expect to increase our surveillance. This may result in our fine collection going up further.”Apart from collecting fines, the BMC has also started making violators perform community services, such as sweeping roads for an hour or cleaning graffiti, if they argue or refuse to pay the ₹200 fine for not wearing masks.This punishment is being implemented as per BMC’s solid waste management by-laws, which give it powers to make citizens perform community services for spitting on roads.Stressing on the importance of wearing a mask, Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar had told HT a couple of days ago, “Unless we do have an actual vaccine to fight with Covid-19, mask and social distancing is the only vaccine available. Hence, if people do not follow safety norms, administration will be compelled for a lockdown.”Meanwhile, Dr Siddarth Paliwal said, “Those wearing mask have only 10% chances of getting infected with Covid-19, if social distancing is maintained. Hence, mask is the least we could do. Also, it is not just about us but citizens have to understand that it is for the entire community. Due to this, wearing mask becomes more of a responsibility rather than a rule.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-in-mumbai-number-of-people-not-wearing-masks-almost-doubled-in-last-2-weeks-says-bmc/story-nLcDgpdwASORc0WByGRcXP.html

27-11-2020||Mumbai||Demolition of Kangana Ranaut’s bungalow actuated by malafide: Bombay high court||In a strongly worded judgment, the Bombay high court on Friday struck down the September 9 order passed by a ward officer of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to demolish a part of actor Kangana Ranaut’s bungalow at Pali Hill in Bandra west. The division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Riyaz Chagla held that the action of the civic body of demolishing about 40% of the bungalow was “actuated by malafide” and was in complete disregard of her rights. The bench concluded that the civic action was a clear case of legal malice and was initiated after Ranaut’s infamous tweets, comparing Mumbai with Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Also Read: ‘Why Section 124A?’ Bombay HC’s scathing remark over sedition charges against Kangana RanautIn this regard, the bench said irresponsible statements made by an individual should be ignored, howsoever distasteful those may be, and no action can be taken against such individual by resorting to colourable exercise of power and causing injury to that individual or his property by the State or any of its instrumentalities. The high court has now appointed valuer Shetgiri and Associates to assess the damage caused by BMC while demolishing part of Ranaut’s bungalow and asked them to submit their report in three months. The high court also allowed Ranaut to take steps to make the bungalow habitable again. But, she will have to approach BMC and seek permission, if any permission is required for reconstruction of the demolished portion. Ranaut approached high court on September 9, hours after the BMC demolished a part of her bungalow in the upscale Pali Hill area. Apart from seeking that the demolition be declared illegal, the actor also sought Rs 2 crore from the civic body towards damages, claiming that several valuable articles were damaged by the civic body during the course of the demolition. She alleged that BMC carried out the demolition out of malice following her comments against the Mumbai Police which, according to her, irked the Shiv Sena leadership. She had also cited an alleged threat against her by Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson and member of Parliament Sanjay Raut in an interview. BMC had denied the allegations of malice and of any personal vendetta against the actor. The civic body maintained that Ranaut had brazenly and unlawfully carried out extensive additions and alterations to the bungalow, in breach of its approved building plan. It said that after being served a stop work notice under Section 354 (A) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, the actor submitted a false and evasive reply, because of which it had to take the next step of issuing a demolition notice and carrying out the demolition work. BMC countered Ranaut’s claim for damages saying she had not submitted any proof to show that any movable property or articles were damaged during the demolition. “The petitioner’s claim for Rs2 crore compensation for movables/ articles allegedly damaged or destroyed during the demolition cannot be adjudicated in the present proceedings,” the BMC had said in its affidavit filed through advocate Joel Carlos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/demolition-of-kangana-ranaut-s-bungalow-actuated-by-malafide-bombay-high-court/story-B4ygRhImdaYcplz8T9UPJN.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Meet Delhi Police constable who never says no to donate plasma||How do you define ‘new normal’? Wearing mask compulsorily in public places, social distancing, sanitisers placed at the entrance and other strategic spots in shops and homes, and the constant news feed on present number of coronavirus cases. Including all this are the messages for plasma donation, on WhatsApp and other social media platforms; which are becoming another new normal. But, how much attention do you really pay to such messages? Ask Krishan Kumar, head constable, Delhi Police, who says, “Not even once do I said no to anyone who send me a message asking for help with plasma donation.” “I was on ventilator when admitted to the hospital on being detected with Covid-19, and I know what families of corona patients have to go through when their dear one is between life and death,” says the 42-year-old who makes it a point to help everyone who reaches out to him. “Any person who approaches me for plasma donation, I go to any length to help. And so far I’ve donated plasma five times. It feels great to help someone out there,” he adds, and goes on to share what made him do so: “I once saw a family crying for they were unable to get help, and at that very moment I decided ‘Never to say no for plasma, if my health permits’. Aur humara toh kam hi hai logon ki seva karna. Covid-19 ne hume ek aur mauka dia hai iske liye, aur mujhe acha bhi lag raha hai ki log mere is kaam ki tareef kar rahe hain. There are others like me who keep donating plasma.” Kumar has even communicated to his colleagues, including seniors, to inform him if anyone is in need of plasma. “When I offer help in such a manner, usually everyone in my office asks me to take care of my health, and I feel so loved,” he adds.

27-11-2020||Kolkata||Ahead of Bengal polls, Mamata eyes upper hand with cashless health scheme||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced cashless health benefits for 100 million families from December 1 with less than six months left for the crucial 2021 assembly polls, which her government hopes to win on the back of her developmental and welfare record. “Every family in the state, which is not yet covered by any state-sponsored health scheme, will be covered under the Swasthya Sathi health scheme from December 1. Under this project, every family will get a smart card which would allow it to get cashless health benefits up to Rs 5 lakhs from around 1500 government and private hospitals across India,” said Banerjee. The State had initially planned to cover around 75 million families under the Swasthya Sathi scheme, the additional 25 million families including those of artisans, drivers, domestic helps and rickshaw pullers among others would be brought under this from December 1. “It would cost the state exchequer around Rs 2000 crore. Those who have not yet registered under the Swasthya Sathi health scheme can do so when the government launches its door-to-door campaign,” she added. While on one hand the TMC-supremo played the development card, on the other, she upped the ante against the BJP, trying to brand the party as an ‘outsider’ in Bengal and attacked it on various fronts, including alleged delay in developing Covid-19 vaccines and payment of GST dues to States. “After ruining the country’s economy, the Union home minister is now going to campaign for municipal elections. I have never seen such a country where a Union home minister is visiting a household and having food for a photo session when the economy is going down and unemployment is increasing,” she said, while adding that Bengal will not accept outsiders.

After a day of clashes with the police, the farmers from Haryana stopped their tractor-trailers for a night halt at Panipat toll plaza, where farmers from Punjab joined them. Several farmers from Punjab, who braved water cannons and tear gas before breaking through barricades put up by Haryana Police on the state’s border, reached Panipat late on Thursday night.

He sent his resignation letter to Banerjee and emailed a copy to governor Jagdeeep Dhankhar at 1.05pm, fanning speculations that the rebel leader may quit the party. Adhikari, the legislator from Nandigram in East Midnapore district, had resigned from the post of chairman of the Hooghly River Bridge Commission on Thursday night. There were reports that he also resigned from the Haldia Development Authority where he was the chairman. “I do hereby tender my resignation from my office as Minister. Steps may be taken for its immediate acceptance,” Adhikari wrote to Banerjee. Also Read: No place for outsiders who incite violence during polls: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee“I still believe that he will not quit the party.

Senior TMC leaders told HT earlier this month that Adhikari is specifically unhappy with organisational decisions taken by the chief minister’s nephew and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor who was roped in after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. On November 10, Adhikari threw a veiled challenge at the party while addressing a public rally at Nandigram. “Political observers are waiting for me to announce my political programme. They want to hear me talk about the roadblocks I am facing and the path I am going to take. I will not announce my political programme from this scared platform. This is not the place. I will speak from a political platform,” Adhikari said at the rally. “I am not afraid of anyone. We will meet in the battlefield,” he added without naming anyone or even the TMC. A senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said that Mihir Goswami, another rebel legislator from Cooch Behar, was on his way to Delhi. He was likely to join the BJP at the BJP headquarters in the presence of the party’s national president JP Nadda on Friday afternoon. “The days of the Mamata Banerjee government are numbered. Adhikari has dealt a blow to the ruling party,” said BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya.

Health officials have attributed the surge to increase in testing post the festival of Diwali. According to data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), on November 17, there were 8,946 active Covid-19 patients (individuals who are presently carrying pathogens of the virus), which increased to 11,101 in November 25.As expected, cases of Covid-19 after Diwali increased gradually in the city. In the first 15 days of the month, the city was reporting around 700 new Covid-19 cases everyday. However, since November 16, the number of daily new Covid-19 cases increased to over 1,000.Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine review: PM Modi to visit Pune, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad tomorrowMeanwhile, the civic body has ruled out the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic as the positivity rate is still between 6% and 7%. Since Diwali, BMC has increased testing and each ward has been given new daily targets of testing. “The rise in the number of cases is due to the rise in testing post-Diwali to identify super spreaders. We are testing over 17,000 people daily on an average. Local doctors have also been instructed to keep an eye on the suspected patients,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. On November 25, BMC created a record by testing 19,018 people in a day, the highest since the outbreak of the virus in March.To provide timely treatment to infected people, BMC has kept beds ready. The civic body will use beds in private hospitals for the treatment of patients till December 31. They have also filled all oxygen tanks at Covid-19 jumbo centres where mildly and moderately ill patients undergo treatment. The civic authority has stocked up on emergency medicines. Health experts have cautioned citizens, especially the elderly with co-morbidities, as reverse migration has started in the city which can be a source of infection.Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist and epidemiologist at PD Hinduja hospital, Mahim, said there is possibility of a second wave in Mumbai like in Europe, which can be associated with the festival season and violation of social distancing norms. “We hope for high seroprevalence which can gradually push us towards herd immunity. But at present, it is unlikely. So, we have to be very careful around the upcoming Christmas and New Year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mumbai-s-active-covid-19-cases-increase-by-24-in-7-days/story-1KWeKvmEeL2HUOnVG9XOCK.html

According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin on Thursday, the average AQI stood at 302 compared to 413 on Wednesday and 379 on Tuesday.The levels of particulate matter (PM) also came down significantly. On Thursday evening, the PM 10 (coarse dust particles) levels reduced to 218ug/m3 as compared to 410 ug/m3 at the same time the previous day. The PM 2.5 levels (the most harmful aerosols in Delhi’s air) also came down to133 ug/m3 from 243ug/m3 on Wednesday.Also Read: Weather comes to Delhi’s rescue, winds flush out pollutionScientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the improvement was mainly because of a change in the wind direction and speed. On Thursday, traces of rain were observed at the Lodhi Road and Ridge weather stations. Safdarjung Observatory -- the official marker for the city’s weather -- did not record any rainfall. The IMD had also predicted cold wave conditions in Delhi from November 27. “Due to the influence of a western disturbance over Afghanistan and neighbouring areas, fairly widespread rainfall and snowfall, as well as isolated hailstorms, are likely over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and Himachal Pradesh from November 25, which will result in low temperatures in Delhi as well,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.He said the minimum temperature is likely to remain around 6-7 degrees Celsius till November-end. “The skies will be clear again, and this will cool the surface down faster and reduce the temperature by the end of the week,” said Srivastava.On Thursday, the minimum temperature was 10.4 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal. The maximum settled at 25.8 degrees Celsius, normal for this time of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-breathes-easier-as-air-quality-improves/story-DBuW27osoisx30hPaDJ2tO.html

27-11-2020||Delhi||Farmers force way into Haryana, head to Delhi||Thousands of farmers from Punjab broke barricades and forced their way into Haryana on Thursday, braving tear gas shells and water cannons en route to Delhi, where law enforcement officials deployed stringent crowd control measures as residents grappled with long traffic snarls in border areas. By late evening, a large group of farmers — both from Haryana and Punjab — reached a toll plaza at Panipat, about 100km from the Capital, setting the stage for a confrontation with the Delhi Police, who have refused to give them permission for protests within the city limits. Leaders of farmers’ groups said that they will resume their march — christened “Delhi Chalo” —on Friday morning.While Delhi prepared for a possible law and order challenge as well as traffic disruptions, high drama unfolded in Haryana on Thursday, as farmers from Punjab entered the state a day after being thwarted by border barricades. The police in Ambala erected barricades on an overbridge on the Ghaggar river connecting the Haryana town with Punjab’s Patiala. Farmers threw several of these barricades into the river, facing tear gas shells by law enforcement personnel. Protesters could be seen waving black flags and shouting slogans. The police made announcements on loudspeakers, asking farmers on the Punjab side to disperse, but that did not help. As smoke from tear gas clouded the skies and farmers outnumbered security personnel, they were allowed to enter Haryana around noon. However, their forward march was not smooth, with frequent barricades and trucks filled with sand on the Grand Trunk (GT) Road blocking their way. This led to traffic snarls that hit commuters as well. But the farmers marched on. Apart from this confrontation in Ambala district, there were face-offs between protesters and the police in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled Haryana’s Sirsa, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad and Jind districts bordering the Congress-run Punjab. At Karnal, there was another face-off and police again used water cannon. A farmer was injured, though no arrests were reported. Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal were among those who criticised the Haryana Police’s action. Haryana Police chief Manoj Yadava, however, said that his force acted with “great restraint”. “In this entire episode, not only a number of police personnel were injured, but police and private vehicles were also damaged,” he said in a statement. As tension spiralled, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and his Haryana counterpart, Manohar Lal Khattar, exchanged words over Twitter. While Singh asked Khattar why his government was stopping farmers, and the BJP leader told him to stop “inciting” them. Food bowl Punjab is at the centre stage of the farmers’ agitation against the government’s moves to open up agricultural markets in the country and bring sweeping reforms to the farm sector, which supports nearly half the population. Farmers have demanded a repeal of three laws enacted by Parliament in September which, together, allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s minimum support price (MSP) system, which offers cultivators assured prices from the government, largely for wheat and rice. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal held day-long negotiations on November 13 with leaders of several farmers’ groups in an attempt to end over two months of a politically challenging agitation. The discussions were inconclusive, but both sides had agreed to continue negotiations in the future. “New farm laws were the need of the hour. In the coming time, it’s going to bring revolutionary changes. We’ll talk to the farmers on December 3,” Tomar told ANI on Thursday, reiterating that the Centre was ready to talk with farmers and resolve differences.In the Capital, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) announced stopping trains from neighbouring cities in the National Capital Region (NCR) — Gurugram and Faridabad in Haryana, and Noida and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh — to Delhi on Friday, a decision that could likely impact thousands of interstate commuters at a time when stringent restrictions are already in place in borders areas. However, it will be business as usual for trains to these cities from Delhi.From barbed wires at the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh borders to blocking highways with dumpers full of mud and sand, the Delhi Police on Thursday took a host of steps to stop the march of representatives of about 500 farmers’ groups that are protesting against three contentious laws enacted recently by Parliament with an aim to liberalise the farm sector. During the day, Metro services remained suspended on seven corridors for most parts and normal operations resumed from 5pm. On the road, heightened checking at Delhi’s borders with both Haryana and Uttar Pradesh resulted in huge jams and confusion among commuters. The border connecting Haryana’s Sonepat with Delhi’s Narela was closed for three hours in the evening. Notwithstanding the arrangements, two small groups reached Jantar Mantar, Delhi’s protest venue, and Manju Ka Tilla in north Delhi. Eish Singhal, DCP-New Delhi, said that 70 farmers and activists were detained at Jantar Mantar and then let off. “We have registered a case under IPC (Indian Penal Code) section 188 (disobedience to an order by a public servant),” Singhal said. He refused to describe them as farmers. “They arrived in cars. Most of them were already in Delhi,” Singhal added. A group of 35 people from different states landed near Majnu ka Tilla and began a protest. “They had arrived by public transport such as trains and buses. We have detained them and are booking them for not following the Covid-19 safety protocols,” NS Bundela, joint commissioner of police (central range), said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-force-way-into-haryana-head-to-delhi/story-zhUrlettfZeWhdZY58PqhM.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi ‘actively considering’ night curfew to combat Covid, HC told||The Delhi government on Thursday informed the Delhi high court that it is “actively considering” a night curfew or a weekend lockdown as part of its effort to slow the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the Capital. The government was responding to the court, which sought to know whether the Capital is implementing any lockdown in order to check the surge in Covid-19 cases. Delhi has seen an average of 6,103 cases over the last seven days, and its positivity rate rose to as high as 15.3% on November 15; on Thursday, the Union territory recorded 5,475 cases and a positivity rate of 8.65%, reflecting what chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said last Friday at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit— that the third wave may have peaked.Also Read | Situation in Delhi ‘alarming’, says HC, defers beds reservation matterSenior advocate Sandeep Sethi, appearing for the Delhi government along with advocate Satyakam, the Union territory’s additional standing counsel, told a bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad that while a decision on the imposition of the curfew is yet to be taken, it is actively being considered. New guidelines issued by the home ministry on Wednesday, allowed states and Union territories to impose restrictions such as night curfews to fight the pandemic’s spread. The guidelines also said that state authorities shall not impose any lockdown outside containment zones without consulting the Union government.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer Rakesh Malhotra seeking an increase in testing in the city. Over the past fortnight (November 13-26) Delhi has conducted an average of 51,244 tests a day, with a dip on weekends and public holidays. The corresponding period in October saw a similar average of 52,818 tests a day. However, during this period in October, of the total tests, 14,307 was conducted using the RT-PCR method, while in the corresponding November period, this went up to 19,680.On Thursday, for instance, it conducted 63,266 tests, and recorded 5,475 cases — a positivity rate of 8.65%. The Capital has also been increasing the number of RT-PCR tests it conducts. On Thursday, for instance, it conducted 28,897 of these molecular tests which are considered the gold standard in diagnosing Covid-19.“Lockdowns and night curfews are all secondary measures; what is of key importance in cutting the transmission cycle is making Covid-19 appropriate behavioral changes. It is crucial to wear a mask, maintain physical distancing, observe hand hygiene, and following respiratory etiquettes to keep the infection at bay. There is no alternative to people not behaving properly,” said Jugal Kishore, head, department of community medicine, Safdarjung Hospital.The court also said that the Delhi government should consider setting up a portal where fines for not adhering to social distancing norms can be deposited. It added that weddings should be monitored to ensure the government order of limiting the number of attendees to 50 is being followed. “How are you enforcing cap on marriage gathering? Are you conducting random check or is there any protocol that you are maintaining? This is the season where several marriages are either going on or are scheduled,” the bench said. “We cannot allow these wedding parties to become super spreader (events) because this is the season of weddings and similar functions. There should instructions for the banquet halls that if there is one wedding, then they can take only one booking at a time. If there is a partition in the banquet hall where another wedding is conducted, then it would be the violation of your own guidelines.” .In the course of the hearing, the court sought to know from the Delhi government whether it has adopted any of the steps used by other states faced with a sudden spike in cases. To this, senior advocate Sethi said, “We are considering imposing a night curfew or a weekend lockdown. It is under active consideration”.The court also criticised the government for acting only after being pushed to. “It is after so much of pushing and prodding that so much has been done. Do you realize how many lives have been lost? What solace is this to those who have lost their near and dear ones?”The number of deaths in Delhi has soared during the third wave. Over the past fortnight, the average deaths have been 105 a day.The court asked the Centre why it is yet to respond to the Delhi government’s proposal of shutting down some markets. During the hearing, the petitioner Malhotra told the court that over 2,200 deaths have taken place in the city from November 1 to November 24. He said that over the past eight months, over 6,562 deaths have taken place in the city due to Covid-19 infections, which is an average of 800 deaths in a month. To date, Delhi has recorded over 551,000 cases.The court termed the situation “alarming”. It asked the Delhi government to file a further status report detailing the meeting to be conducted with the market associations and the Resident Welfare Associations making them aware of the conditions.It will next hear the case on December 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-actively-considering-night-curfew-to-combat-covid-hc-told/story-rlOE2d2YmVvLOMze0sER4L.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Situation in Delhi ‘alarming’, says HC, defers beds reservation matter||Calling the surge in Covid-19 cases in the capital “alarming”, the Delhi high court on Thursday said it would hear, on December 9, a plea by the Association of Healthcare Providers challenging the state government’s decision to reserve 80% ICU beds in 33 private hospitals for Covid-19 patients.Until Thursday, Delhi had reported 551,262 cases and 8,811 deaths. Currently, there are 38,734 active cases. Justice Navin Chawla said, “The numbers are presently in alarming state. The matter should be heard after two weeks looking at the present situation.”Through an order on September 12, the Delhi government had asked 33 private hospitals in the city to reserve 80% ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. This order was stayed by the high court on September 22 on a petition by the Association of Healthcare Providers.Later, on October 9, a division bench of the court took up an appeal by the Delhi government, refusing to vacate the stay while adjourning the matter to November 27. The AAP government approached the Supreme Court against these two orders of September 22 and October 9. The apex court refused to interfere with the HC order, staying the AAP government’s instruction to private hospitals.On November 12, a division bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad vacated the stay considering the increase in the number of cases in the city. The court had also posted the matter for further hearing before a single bench for November 26.On Thursday, appearing for Delhi, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain said the situation was being reviewed periodically and review meetings were being conducted under the chairmanship of the Union home minister. In a status report filed through advocate Sanjoy Ghose, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, a meeting was conducted on November 17 under the chairmanship of the Special secretary, Health. “There has been a rise of more than 200% and consequently there is a shortage of both Covid ICU beds for clinically severely ill patients and normal Covid beds for clinically moderate to mild patients, respectively,” the minutes of the meeting said.The court will now hear the matter on December 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/situation-in-delhi-alarming-says-hc-defers-beds-reservation-matter/story-Bq91Kpea7GuOlTlmNwc5QO.html
27-11-2020||Chandigarh||Amarinder Singh, Manohar Lal Khattar spar over police action||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar engaged in a war of words on Thursday over Haryana’s attempt to stop thousands of farmers from entering the national Capital to stage a demonstration against three contentious laws enacted recently by Parliament to liberalise the farm sector.While Singh termed the Haryana government’s move to stop the farmers from moving towards Delhi “totally undemocratic and unconstitutional”, Khattar accused the Punjab chief minister of “inciting” innocent farmers.Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, had announced they will go to Delhi through several routes, and will hold a dharna wherever they are stopped from moving towards the national Capital.On Wednesday, Haryana completely sealed its borders with Punjab to prevent the farmers from entering the state for their protest march. Tension spiralled at the Shambhu border in Haryana, around 215 km from Delhi, on Thursday as police used water cannons and teargas to disperse hundreds of farmers coming from Punjab who broke barricades, throwing some into a river, determined to enter Haryana as part of their march. Condemning the move, Singh tweeted: “Why is @mlkhattar govt in Haryana stopping the farmers from moving to Delhi? The tyrannical use of brute force against peacefully protesting farmers is totally undemocratic and unconstitutional.”The Punjab chief minister said it was a “sad irony” that the constitutional rights of farmers were being “oppressed” on the Constitution Day. “Let them pass @mlkhattar ji, don’t push them to the brink. Let them take their voice to Delhi peacefully,” Singh, a senior Congress leader, said.Shortly after, Khattar of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) asked Singh to desist from “misleading” farmers, highlighting that he has already pledged to quit politics if the Minimum Support Price mechanism is ever dismantled.“@Capt Amarinder Ji, I’ve said it earlier and I’m saying it again, I’ll leave politics if there’ll be any trouble on the MSP -- therefore, please stop inciting innocent farmers,” Khattar tweeted. He also accused Singh of “only tweeting” and “running away from talks” with him on the issue. “I’ve been trying to reach out to you for the last 3 days but, sadly, you have decided to stay unreachable -- is this how serious you are for farmers’ issues? You’re only tweeting and running away from talks, why,” Khattar asked in another tweet.Congress leader Singh expressed shock at his response. “Shocked at your response @mlkhattar ji. It’s the farmers who’ve to be convinced on MSP, not me. You should’ve tried to talk to them before their #DilliChalo. And if you think I’m inciting farmers then why are Haryana farmers also marching to Delhi,” he asked.Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal, a former ally the BJP, too criticised attempts to thwart the protest. “Today is Punjab’s 26/11. We are witnessing the end of the right to democratic protest,” he tweeted.Former Union minister and SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who had resigned from the Union Cabinet in September in protest against the three laws, she said: “Using force against farmers on Constitution Day has turned the day a ‘black day’ for ‘annadattas’ of the country.” Condemning the police action, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “The nation’s farmers are standing firmly against the cruelty of the Modi government.”West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee tweeted, “What @narendramodi ji’s wonderfully pro-people government has ensured? 700% increase in farmer protests, Draconian anti-farmer bill, Atrocities on the farmers.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amarinder-singh-manohar-lal-khattar-spar-over-police-action/story-hQmge6bRqWAw3BtO993teJ.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Mesmerising shades of blue||There is something gracefully fragile about the blue colour—especially in Delhi, where blue skies are more of a myth. In our city, every bit of blue, whatever its shade, depth and scale, can be seen as a mute testament to what we don’t have. See this wall. It displays such an exquisite depiction of blue that it probably wouldn’t be out of place in a critically acclaimed museum. The colour here is rendered in many fine gradations of decreasing brightness, as if a painter had, after playing on her palette with several shades of blue, harmoniously arranged them on a canvas of bricks. For that matter, red bricks also show up, in a long straight line running horizontally at the centre of the wall, evoking a thunderbolt suddenly flashing across a blue sky, frozen still on the painting.The wall’s beauty is particularly poignant because it is unintentional. It hasn’t been put up to attract admirers. A quick investigation reveals that the wall was painted blue by a couple of professional wall painters some years ago—and one wonders who picked the colour, and why. The irregular coating, though essential to the beauty, might not be voluntary. The passage of shifting seasons also left its layers of patina over the wall. Parts of the paint surface peeled off here and there, revealing the bricks underneath. This is an exhibit in which humans, atmosphere and time each played a role. The wall lies at one end of a courtyard, snuggled inside the little-known Sufi shrine of Sheikh Kaleemullah Jehanabadi in Old Delhi, just across the road from Red Fort. The courtyard itself strives to be worthy of the wall’s melancholic allure. It is lined with a smattering of marble graves—one of which has a plaque announcing “physician to president of India.” Some of them have tulsi plants growing about. This afternoon, the littlest grave of all has a white skull cap tucked onto its headstone. This is all charming, but this charm is only secondary to the breathtaking blues of the aforementioned wall. For maximum impact, visit on a day when the sky is nastily grey. But that is any day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-mesmerising-shades-of-blue/story-BunjFAMPgY1nPTXce3DDBN.html
27-11-2020||City||After arrest of Pratap Sarnaik’s aide, ED claims link between Thane MLA, firm||A special The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Thursday remanded Amit Chandole, a close business associate of Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik, in the Enforcement Directorate’s custody till Sunday in a money laundering case related to Topsgrup, a security service giant owned by businessman Rahul Nanda. ED had sought his custody to probe various money laundering aspects of irregularities linked to Nanda. ED in their remand application has stated that from the probe conducted so far, it appears that Topsgrup obtained contract from Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) in “collusion with Sarnaik through illegal means by a well-thought out strategy”. “The aim of these illegal manoeuvrers was to get additional inadmissible benefit by inflating the bills at the cost of MMRDA and illegal cash gratification to Sarnaik for facilitating this scam. Against this active role and criminal conspiracy, Sarnaik used to get 50% profit earned out of the said contract through Amit Chandole,” said the ED’s application. Nanda had earlier denied all the allegations. “Pratap is a very old friend and has not invested a single penny into my business or company ever. He or Sena have nothing to do with Tops. This is absolutely absurd.” Sarnaik has claimed vendetta politics behind the allegations. “The day I moved a privilege motion against (actor) Kangana Ranaut and [Republic TV editor-in-chief] Arnab Goswami, and spoke about reopening the Anvay Naik (suicide) case, I knew what would happen. I am a Shiv Sainik and a fighter who has reached this far. (Chief minister) Uddhavsaheb has made me the spokesperson to put forward the party’s views. Today they told him [Vihang] your father speaks a lot on Ranaut and Goswami. I will continue to speak wherever Mumbai, Maharashtra or its police are maligned. I have done nothing wrong in my business,” he had told a news channel on Tuesday, the day his offices were raided. On Wednesday, the legislator quarantined himself after his return to the state from Goa and asked a week’s time to appear before ED. According to ED, Chandole accepted the receipt of cash from Topsgrup. The billing was done by the security firm by allegedly inflating the number of contracted security guards deployed for MMRDA projects. Therefore, part of the amount received by Topsgrup from MMRDA appears to be proceeds of crime. The 50% profit of the said contract was being shared by Topsgrup with Sarnaik through Chandole and sometimes, through bank transfer to the account of a third person. Chandole appears to be a recipient of the proceeds of crime fraudulently obtained by Topsgrup from MMRDA, ED’s remand application stated. ED’s money laundering probe is based on the case registered by Mumbai’s Yellow Gate police on October 28 on the direction of 16th metropolitan magistrate court, against Nanda and his family members. Topsgrup former vice-chairman Ramesh Ramkrishna Iyer is a complainant in the case, who approached the court alleging Nanda’s involvement in unlawful activities, massive irregularities in the company and misappropriation of funds involving Rs175 crore and cheating company’s employees, its shareholders, other government and private organisations with forged documents. lyer alleged that Nanda and the others diverted huge funds from the accounts of Topsgrup companies to various accounts in India and to accounts of overseas companies. He also alleged that these funds were further utilised by Nanda and other individuals for their personal purposes such as purchasing real estate etc and thus defrauded the company Rs175 crore. The case was recently transferred to the Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) for further investigation. Iyer and Topsgrup’s former director of finance Amar Panghal alleged that in 2014, a contract was signed by Topsgrup Services & Solutions Ltd with MMRDA as per which, the security firm was to deploy 350 to 500 guards at project sites on a monthly basis. While only 70% of the guards were actually deployed, the billing was done for all the guards as per the contract. The details of the wages paid to the labourers were submitted to MMRDA for 100% of the contract value and accordingly the documents of their provident fund (PF)/ Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) were also submitted, ED stated before the court. The agency further alleged that huge cash amounts were withdrawn from the bank accounts of Topsgrup Services & Solutions Ltd and given to a former top executive of the firm, which in financial year 2017-18, amounted to Rs92 lakh. There was an arrangement with two people, one of whom was Chandole, as per which 50% of the profits (revenue billed to MMRDA by showing wages to workers and their PF) were being shared on a monthly basis. In addition, a fixed commission of Rs50,000 per month and Rs500 per guard (as per contracted agreement) deployed was being paid to both the people by the former top executive. As per the details provided by lyer, from May 2017 till June this year, the amount aggregating to Rs2.36 crore has been shared as commission. Of the said amount, Rs90 lakh has been paid through bank transfers to Chandole and the other person. As per lyer, all these amounts are still being paid from Topsgrup bank accounts and commissions worth Rs7 crore has been paid to Chandole and the other person since 2014 (the year the contract with MMRDA was initiated). During the course of investigation, the statement of the former top executive was recorded on Tuesday and Wednesday, in which he has allegedly stated that Nanda acquired a United Kingdom- based (UK) firm, Shield Guarding Company Limited, in 2014 for around Rs200-250 crore. On the pretext of meeting the expenses of the overseas company, Nanda used to siphon off money from his Indian firm. These funds were allegedly used for the personal expenses of Nanda and his family and for acquiring several immovable properties in Dubai and the UK. The former top executive also submitted that the said contract, worth around Rs32-33 lakh per month, was regarding the security and traffic management of footover bridges of Mumbai. For sharing a 50-50 profit, a sheet used to be prepared by the company’s finance department and approved by Panghal. Chandole used to coordinate with the finance department and collect the said profit share on behalf of Sarnaik, ED said. Funds mostly used to be delivered in cash. A company employee used to maintain the records and she used to mostly coordinate with Chandole, ED stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-arrest-of-pratap-sarnaik-s-aide-ed-claims-link-between-thane-mla-firm/story-9h6rAUBwJpEEZdwzLkdeZJ.html
27-11-2020||City||‘Dilli Chalo’ protest: Amarinder, Khattar spar over police action on farmers||Chandigarh: On the day the farmers started their ‘Dilli Chalo’ march, a war of words erupted between Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar who blamed each other for the chaotic scenes witnessed on the roads leading to the national capital. The slanging match was started by Amarinder who lashed out at Khattar on Twitter for stopping farmers from heading towards Delhi to protest against the Centre’s agriculture marketing laws. “Why is @mlkhattar govt in Haryana stopping the farmers from moving to Delhi? The tyrannical use of brute force against peacefully protesting farmers is totally undemocratic & unconstitutional,” he wrote in a series of tweets. Amarinder, who leads the Congress government in Punjab, asked Khattar why he was provoking them (farmers) by resorting to force. “Let them pass @mlkhattar ji, don’t push them to the brink. Let them take their voice to Delhi peacefully,” he tweeted, making an appeal to the BJP to direct the Haryana government not to indulge in strong-arm tactics. Khattar responded in equal measure, accusing the Punjab chief minister of inciting innocent farmers for cheap politics during the time of pandemic. The Haryana CM said he kept trying to reach Amarinder for the last three days but he was unreachable. “Is this how serious you are on farmers’ issues? You are only tweeting and running away from talks. Why?” he tweeted. Khattar further said that time for his (Amarinder’s) lies, deception and propaganda was over. “Please stop putting the lives of people in danger during the Corona pandemic. I urge you to not play with the lives of the people – at least avoid cheap politics during the time of pandemic,” he posted only to see Capt express shock over the response. Amarinder replied that it is the farmers who have to be convinced on MSP. “You should have tried to talk to them before their #DilliCaho. And if you think I’m inciting farmers then why are Haryana farmers also marching to Delhi?” he asked. He also questioned the Centre’s decision to push through the farm laws amid the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dilli-chalo-protest-amarinder-khattar-spar-over-police-action-on-farmers/story-LbZEUX58OTA8ycCVCrIF0I.html

27-11-2020||Mumbai||ED arrests Cox and Kings promotor Ajay Peter Kerkar in Mumbai in ‘multi-crore money laundering case’||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday arrested global tours and travel company Cox and Kings Group (CKG) promoter Ajay Peter Kerkar in an alleged money laundering case involving thousands of crores of rupees. Kerkar, who is arrested under the relevant sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), will be produced in court on Friday. He has been refuting all the allegations levelled against him.He is also booked for cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy in four first information reports (FIRs) registered by the banking (fraud) unit of Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) based on the complaints made by Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank and a private investment firm. According to these four financial institutions, the amount in the irregularities is worth Rs1,900 crore. The names of CKG and Kerkar emerged when the central agency was probing the financial irregularities and money laundering linked to the Yes Bank case. ED had arrested Yes Bank’s founder Rana Kapoor in March. The agency has since then been scanning the transactions made by the bank to its borrowers. Last month, ED had arrested CKG’s chief financial officer Anil Khandelwal and internal auditor Naresh Jain in connection with the Yes Bank case. In June, ED had raided five premises belonging to the senior management of CKG. Investigations have revealed that CKG has defaulted loans from Yes Bank worth Rs3,642 crore. ED stated that CKG forged its consolidated financials by manipulating the balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries. In addition to this, some board resolutions submitted to banks for sanctioning the loans were also found to be forged. The loan sanction from Yes bank was driven by Kapoor after bypassing the norms. “ED gathered the evidence regarding clear instructions of Kapoor to the bank officials concerned to get the said loan continued and not to take efforts to recover it,” the agency had previously said. The probe has also revealed that between the financial year 2015 to 2019, lending worth Rs3,908 crore was made to 15 fictitious customers. Majority of collections shown in ledgers from Ezeego (another group entity of CKG ) were not found in the bank statements. There are 15 fictitious, high-value debtors reflected in the books of accounts and another 147 sets of customers also appeared to be suspicious and non-existent, the agency said. The Cox and Kings Limited (CKL) has diverted Rs1,100 crore to another stressed company which has no business relationship with the company without any approval of its board, ED has further alleged. The probe conducted so far has revealed that the bank transactions of CKG are not matching with its books of accounts. The travel company was declared bankrupt last year in October, after it defaulted on payments to the bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ed-arrests-cox-and-kings-promotor-ajay-peter-kerkar-in-mumbai-in-multi-crore-money-laundering-case/story-V75FFpPDFevxjHICDkpLdM.html
27-11-2020||City||Ludhiana MC earns ₹2.9 crore by auctioning 4 parking lots||The Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) remained successful in conducting e-auction of its parking lots in third attempt and managed to earn ₹2.9 crore by auctioning four out of five lots in the city on Thursday. Till now, the parking lots were being managed by MC as the previous contracts had expired in October.While the MC had floated tenders for e-auction of five parking lots, no bidder turned up for the facility at Model Town extension (tuition market). The multi-storey parking near MC’s Zone-A office has been auctioned for ₹1.24 crore, including 20% night charges (reserve price ₹80.5 lakh); Feroze Gandhi market parking lot went for ₹1.16 crore (reserve price 80.1 lakh); BRS Nagar parking lot for ₹20.2 lakh (reserve price ₹18.5 lakh) and Bhadaur House parking lot for ₹30.3 lakh (reserve price ₹27.5 lakh). Contractor Deepak Madaan remained the successful bidder for multi-storey parking lot, while Jugnu enterprises gave highest bid for other three spaces. The parking lot of Sarabha Nagar’s I-block market was auctioned for ₹4.3 lakh last week.The contractors can charge ₹10 as parking fee for two-wheelers and ₹20 for cars.MC secretary Neeraj Jain said, “The successful bidders will have to deposit 1/6th of the amount to the civic body within 24 hours. The parking lots will be handed over to the bidders after getting final approval from MC’s finance and contracts committee.”Earlier, members of local market association had opposed the e-auction of Feroze Gandhi market parking lot.

27-11-2020||Mumbai||Sion, JJ hospitals in Mumbai get approval to start phase 3 of Covaxin clinical trials||The Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital (Sion hospital) and JJ Hospital have received approvals from their respective ethics committees to conduct third phase of clinical trials for Covaxin, the indigenous vaccine candidate for Covid-19 by Bharat Biotech. Both hospitals, which are conducting human trials for Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield vaccine, will require around 2,000 volunteers for their trials of Covaxin. Of these, 20% will be people with co-morbidities and 5% will be medical health workers.Civic-run Sion hospital, which received the nod on Thursday, is expected to start the trial within two-three days. “We have already got 300 volunteers, who want to participate in the trial, and we are currently running tests on them. Each will have to undergo Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and antibody tests to check if they are or have been infected with Covid-19,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Sion hospital.The government-run JJ hospital will start their trial after a week, as they are yet to select volunteers. “We will start the selection process by next week. We will also start a dedicated helpline number where people can call to participate in the trial,” said Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar, dean of JJ Hospital. People between the age group of 18 and 60 years will participate in the trials, with a second dose of the vaccine given to them 28 days after the first dose. The hospitals will follow up with the volunteers for a year.As per Bharat Biotech’s official website, Covaxin is developed in BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment facility. The vaccine received Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approval for Phase I and II human clinical trials, which commenced across India from July.DEDICATED ZONE FOR TESTING AT MUMBAI AIRPORT After the state made it mandatory for passengers from NCR, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Goa to have a negative RT-PCR test result before entering Maharashtra, Mumbai airport has created a dedicated zone for fliers to undergo the test upon arrival. Passengers, who have not undergone the test before boarding the flight, can take the test at Mumbai airport and they will be given the result in 8 hours, while they wait in the dedicated zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sion-jj-hospitals-in-mumbai-get-approval-to-start-phase-3-of-covaxin-clinical-trials/story-vXQvAsHvOq74nqmg51jsSJ.html
27-11-2020||Mumbai||MVA government completes a year: Handling Covid-19 in Maharashtra the highlight||The first year of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, formed by three parties following different ideologies with a common aim of keeping the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power, has been a hurdle race, with the Covid-19 pandemic, economic slowdown and a friction with the Central government. The Uddhav Thackeray-led government has little to show, besides the handling of the Covid-19 situation, which, too, can’t be termed as complete success as Maharashtra remains the most-affected state in India and the disastrous financial impact of the pandemic. Till Thursday, the state reported 1,802,365 cases and 46,813 deaths. Successive governments did not invest much in building health infrastructure, as no party expected a pandemic like Covid-19, leading to chaos as the pandemic struck in March. It took some time for the government to work out facilities to handle the huge inflow of affected people. The situation eased in October-November with the fall in cases, but the post-Diwali spike has again worried the state. To make it worse for the Thackeray government, the Covid-19 lockdown affected the state economy badly over the past nine months, with expected shortfall of ₹1.10 lakh crore in the revenue receipts, which were pegged at ₹2.6 lakh crore during 2020-21. This has badly affected the development works and led to less spending on social-educational schemes. A pendency of ₹35,000 crore from the Centre towards the GST compensation and tax devolution has posed a serious economic challenge before the state. “Our outlay towards development works is ₹1.15 lakh crore and the expected drop in revenue collection is equal to it. This means only the inevitable expenditures are being undertaken from the money borrowed from the market,” said a senior official from the finance department. The shrunk revenue resources have put the state government in a fix when it comes to the compensation to the farmers for crop, house, livestock damages due to natural calamities or while fulfilling the promise of waiver to consumers who received inflated bills during the lockdown. Also read: Maharashtra’s MVA government will complete 5-year term: Shiv Sena MP Raut after meeting BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis“In political perspective, the stay on Maratha reservation and delay in lifting it and failure to give waiver from inflated electricity bills will cost the three ruling parties dear. The sentiments among Marathas over the reservation are extreme and perception is that the MVA government could not retain the quota given by the Fadnavis government. This may damage the prospects of the ruling parties in Marathwada and western Maharashtra. We could not fulfil the demand of waiver from the inflated bills due to the financial burden of more than ₹1,000 crore. It is being perceived as our backtracking on the promises. Both these damages could have been avoided with better coordination within the ruling parties,” says an NCP minister, requesting anonymity. “It is true we could have given more relief to farmers hit by cyclone or unseasonal rain, if we were not hit by the pandemic. We would have given incentives to farmers who have been paying the loans regularly,” said Balasaheb Thorat, revenue minister and state Congress chief. “As far as the Maratha reservation is concerned, the Supreme Court stay was unexpected. But it does not mean that the entire community will go against the government.” Thorat said the electricity bills waiver could have cost the state between ₹1,000 crore and ₹2,400 crore, depending on the waiver extended to the types of consumer and the state was not in a position to handle it. He added that errors in bills and unjust amount levied on consumers was false propaganda. Other leaders from ruling parties, however, said that while Marathas are unhappy to an extent, a few decisions by the Thackeray government has helped them creating a soft corner among farmers. “We gave loan waiver of more than ₹22,000 crore to over 30 lakh farmers and more than 50% of the amount was credited to farmers within just four months of announcement. Similarly, we have procured record 219 lakh quintal cotton this year and it was highest procurement in the past 10 years. Our ₹10,000-crore relief package for flood, cyclone-hit farmers too has sent a positive message among farmers,” said a Sena minister. While the MVA government is banking on farmers in rural parts of the state, it has not been able to do much for urban areas. In case of Mumbai, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray pleased citizen groups and environment activists by scrapping controversial Metro-3 car shed at Aarey Colony and reserved 800 acres in the area as reserved forest. Former chief minister and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said both these announcements are just hogwash. “Shifting of car shed will not save environment as the salt pan land in Kanjurmarg will face destruction for car shed. Secondly, what is touted to have reserved as a forest, was already declared as eco-sensitive zone during our tenure,” he said. Political analyst Hemant Desai points at the MVA government’s failure to roll out any project or scheme which could be recognised by its name. “The Samruddhi corridor between Mumbai and Nagpur was Fadnavis’s pet project and will be known as an achievement of his government. Sharad Pawar’s horticulture development scheme during his tenure as the CM, or AR Antulay’s Sanjay Gandhi pension scheme are acknowledged by their names in the state. The Thackeray government has neither implemented any such scheme nor does it have the vision to make any policy statement,” he said. Also read: MVA government completes a year: More challenges ahead for Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP in MaharashtraThorat however said, “All infrastructure projects, be it Metro lines, coastal road or Samruddhi corridor, are being completed on war footing. It is a balance between rural and urban development. We have helped farmers financially, but ultimately the money in pumped into state economy, leading to the growth of the GDP.” The incumbent government is full of experienced ministers as 26 of the 43 ministers and their deputies have been in cabinet earlier. Even after considering the exceptional situation amid the Covid-19 pandemic, very few ministers have been able to perform in accordance with their experience, a bureaucrat said. “They have been lucky in a way that they have got extended ‘honeymoon period’ owing to the pandemic and lockdown. Generally, people start raising questions over the performance of the government within six months,” he said. The MVA government has been haunted by the uncertainty over its existence since day one. The prime opposition party BJP and its leaders have been announcing dates for dislodging the government every few weeks. The bitter experience of a group of NCP MLAs led by Ajit Pawar joining hands with Devendra Fadnavis to form a three-day government on November 23, keeps haunting the MVA government and raises doubt over its ability to complete the five-year term. According to the leaders from ruling parties, the 2022 elections for 27 district councils and 10 municipal corporations – which are termed as mini Assembly polls – could see the three parties at loggerheads. The tussle will be to gain power at local level due to different equations in local bodies. They also expect a clash over seat-sharing in Mumbai civic body elections. Prakash Bal, another political analyst, said immediate collapse of the MVA government was unlikely. “The BJP has been talking about the fall of the three-party government time and again, but it is because it has a fear of leaders and workers quitting the party. I do not see any uncertainty over the existence of the government as long as Sharad Pawar is at the Centre at the affairs of the alliance. The party’s MLA tallies are at such a matrix that the government cannot be dislodged unless an entire party joins hand with the BJP to form a new government. The Sena or NCP are not in a position of even thinking of any such move,” he added. Although no major differences within the alliance have come up in the first year, the murmur of discontent is being heard. The Congress has expressed its displeasure over the allocation to the portfolios it held. It has a feeling of secondary treatment in decision-making. A few ministers also point at the dominance of the bureaucracy. It had led to clashes between bureaucrats and ministers from the Congress and NCP on a couple of occasions. On the investment front, Thackeray has tried to get foreign investment in industries, signing MoUs with various investors. Amid Covid-19 pandemic, the Maharashtra government has signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) worth nearly ₹51,000 crore. The state has signed three MoUs with Chinese companies, which was expected to get ₹5,000 crore investment. After the relations between the two nations turned sour, they have been put on hold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mva-government-completes-a-year-handling-covid-19-in-maharashtra-the-highlight/story-duO0bIh1oj1Vfdpqjky3cJ.html

The court has directed the commissioner of police concerned to take necessary action and asked the prison authority to submit its report at the next hearing, scheduled in December. “In number of matters, this court has observed that whenever a report is called either from superintendent of Taloja central prison or Mumbai central prison they do not bother to submit timely reports, resultantly it compels the court to keep such application pending for want of reports from the prison authorities. Hence the superintendent of Taloja central prison and Mumbai central prison are directed to submit the reports on fixed dates, else this court will be constrained to initiate action for not following the orders of the court,” said the court on Thursday. On August 28, Teltumbde had moved an application for home food and raised concerns about his health. The court had directed the superintendent of Taloja Jail to submit a report and take Teltumbde for a medical check-up. The prison authorities were to submit a reply by September 4, but are yet to submit their report. Teltumbde is among those arrested as part of the NIA’s probe into the violence at Bhima-Koregaon in January 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-nia-court-raps-jail-administration-for-no-report-on-activist-dr-anand-teltumbde/story-3fmzN2UVGkOLoOPCmmZcSI.html
27-11-2020||Mumbai||Rise in crimes against women, children in Mumbai in 2019-2020: Praja Foundation report||The number of rape cases in Mumbai went up from 728 in 2015-2016 to 904 in 2019-2020 (a 24% increase), according to the city-based Praja Foundation report released on Thursday, which stated that there has been an increase in crimes against women and children.A total of 2,145 molestation cases were registered in 2015-2016, as against 2,677 in 2019-2020, an increase of 25%. The report stated that children were victims in 61% of the rape cases in Mumbai in 2019.According to the report, probes in 67% of the 15,654 crimes against women, and 73% of the 11,268 crimes against children were pending. It also stated that 61% investigations (3,039 cases) under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act were pending. The report also stated similar pendency across courts in Mumbai — 94% of the 23,791 cases related to crimes against women were pending in courts, while 92% of the 8,126 cases of crime against children were pending in courts. 89% of the 4,250 cases under POCSO Act, too, was pending in courts, stated the report. Also, the report stated that of the 222 cases tried in 2019, only 20% were finished within a year. Section 35 of the POCSO Act states that the court should complete the trial within one year of cognisance of the offence. “There are multiple reasons for trials to be delayed. Increase in cases and shortage of police personnel are among them,” said Jennifer Spencer, project coordinator at Praja Foundation. Former chief public prosecutor of Mumbai sessions court, Kalpana Chavan, said that cases gets delayed majorly because courts are overburdened. “There are lots of factors responsible for delay. Sometimes, witnesses are not available or cannot come on a particular date. Or, at times, either the public prosecutor or defence lawyers are not available, or the courts could be busy in some other cases. There is no single factor for delay in conducting trials,” Chavan said. Similarly, Chavan pointed out multiple factors responsible for low conviction rate. “In a criminal case, the most important thing is preparation of a case and case papers of investigation. The police officer has to make sure that he has prepared all documents as per mandatory provisions. At times, for technical reasons, the accused gets the benefit of doubt,” Chavan said. The key point is punchnama in criminal trials. According to the Indian law, the investigating officer has to seize a piece of evidence in front of an independent witness that are referred as punchas and a document is prepared under their signature on how a piece of evidence is collected from the scene of offence. If this is faulty, the process of collection of evidence is invalidated, Chavan pointed out. While talking on crimes against woman, Chavan said, Many of the cases filed are cases of relationship went wrong. “There is a rise in cases wherein a relationship went wrong and women file a complaint of rape out of revenge. These kind of cases result in acquittal as the parties at the end make a settlement out of court,” Chavan said. Flavia Agnes, a women’s rights lawyer and pioneer of the women’s movement in India focused on issues of gender and law reforms, said, “Trial is the last part of the journey which starts after a year or two. And by that time, everything is settled. In most cases, investigation is not done properly, which results in lower conviction rates.” The victim faces so many problems at the time when a case is registered, and also during the trial. But there is no one to support them, said Agnes. “There is not support system for the victim after the incident. We need to provide support to the victims, which we do not have. The support system should be improved,” said Flavia. RC Chavan, former judge, Bombay high court (HC), who joined the judiciary in March 1976 as a civil judge (junior division) and judicial magistrate first class and went on to become a high court judge in 2005, said that faulty investigation is one of the key reason for low conviction rate. “The police is always under pressure during the investigation. In such circumstances, judiciary has to play an active role. The magistrate has a power to reject the charge sheet filed by the investigating officer. The power is not used much, because of which, the faulty charge sheet is accepted and taken further,” Chavan said. Chavan said that a judge has to see at the preliminary stage itself if there is evidence enough to prosecute the accused or if something is missing. “Rejection of charge sheet would give an opportunity to the police to strengthen the case. This will help in improving conviction rate,” Chavan added. On the delay in judicial system, Chavan said, “The major reason is service of summons to the witnesses. The police are overburdened and at times they cannot serve the summons to the witnesses on time, which delays the trial. Most of the court’s time wasted in this and they are just made to wait for either prosecution of defence to come up for hearing. The judiciary is, however, in process of developing a system that can solve the problem in future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rise-in-crimes-against-women-children-in-mumbai-in-2019-2020-praja-foundation-report/story-JxDRqQslDW2P5uImuUSbvK.html
27-11-2020||Mumbai||In a first-of-its-kind experiment, Maharashtra to release tigress captured for killing human, livestock back in the wild||The Maharashtra forest department will carry out a first-of-its-kind exercise to release a sub-adult tigress that was previously involved in conflict, back into the wild. The tigress T2C1 is almost two-and-a-half years old and was captured in September. The rewilding exercise will be carried out in Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR), Nagpur.Rewilding captured or captive tigers is mostly carried out with cubs or young adults. It involves placing them within a natural enclosure with access to wild prey, to teach them hunting skills, before they are reintroduced to the wild. The principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF-Wildlife) approved the decision to rewild T2C1 on Saturday, and said this was the first time in Maharashtra where a sub-adult tiger would be part of such an exercise. Previously, cubs less than a year old have been released back into the wild through minimal human imprint. The PCCF’s decision was based on recommendations by a state-appointed committee on the possible rehabilitation of tigers captured due to conflict.On September 19, T2C1 killed a 60-year-old woman at a farm near Andharwadi village. Earlier in the month, the tigress had attacked a farmer in the same area and killed livestock. On September 23, T2C1 was tranquilised and captured near the Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS) in Yavatmal district, and sent to the transit treatment centre at Nagpur.“We want to give this tigress one more chance because of her age and to ensure she doesn’t spend the rest of her life in captivity. She has killed only one person, and that may or may not have been killing by stalking. The basic aim is to give her a chance to survive on her own,” said Nitin Kakodkar, PCCF-Wildlife. “Our intent is to wean the tigress away from cattle kills and human presence so that it takes to wild prey.”For the next three to six months, T2C1’s behaviour will be monitored in PTR. “Human imprint will be zero once T2C1 goes into the enclosure. Over the next three to six months, we will release wild prey steadily and monitor her with CCTV cameras placed across the enclosure. A final decision on T2C1’s release will be taken based on the progress we make,” said Kakodkar, adding that T2C1 did not seem to present a threat to human life.According to veterinarians, animals in captivity undergo emotional distress resulting in them becoming overweight, developing health problems and sometimes leading to self-mutilation. SP Yadav, additional director general of forest (Project Tiger) and head of National Tiger Conservation Authority, said, “This is a step in the right direction. Rehabilitation in the wild is a better option for young tigers, but it has to be ensured they are properly rewilded and don’t enter into conflict again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-a-first-of-its-kind-experiment-maharashtra-to-release-tigress-captured-for-killing-human-livestock-back-in-the-wild/story-Db9tnU1MNYG1zTgQoL8RKM.html

27-11-2020||Mumbai||Bhima-Koregaon case: Father Stan Swamy files plea for woollens, sipper, straw||Tribal rights activist and priest Father Stan Swamy filed a fresh application on Thursday, requesting winter wear, a sipper cup and straw after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) informed the special court it had not confiscated Swamy’s straw and sipper cup. The matter, along with Swamy’s bail plea, will be heard next in December. Swamy, 83, is among the accused in the case of violence at Bhima-Koregaon in January 2018 and has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). In early November, Swamy’s lawyer Sharif Shaikh had filed an application seeking the return of Swamy’s straw and sipper cup, citing Swamy’s medical condition as a patient of Parkinson’s disease. On Thursday, NIA’s special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty told the court these items had not been confiscated during Swamy’s arrest on October 8. The defence counsel then sought direction to prison authorities, to provide Swamy with the same at a cost, along with slippers for daily use. The court has asked the prison authority to file a report and adjourned the matter till December 4. While seeking bail for Swamy on Thursday, Shaikh pleaded that Swamy has been falsely implicated in the Bhima-Koregaon case. While accepting that Swamy is a member of the organisation Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC), which works with undertrials, the bail plea points out that working with those accused of being members of the banned outfit Communist Party of India (Maoist) does not necessarily make Swamy an affiliate. NIA has alleged PPSC is a “frontal organisation” for CPI (Maoist) and that Swamy had received Rs 8 lakh to carry out activities for the outfit. In the charge sheet filed on October 9, NIA said it had seized “documents related to aiding the activities of CPI (Maoist) and propaganda material” from Swamy during his arrest and that the agency had found letters that proved Swamy’s connection with CPI (Maoist). In his bail plea, Swamy refuted NIA’s allegations and questioned the authenticity of letters that NIA has submitted as evidence. “The Prosecution has attached word and pdf copies of the letter. They are not even part of emails. That these alleged letters were ever sent/received is questionable,” said Swamy’s bail plea.Last month, Swamy had applied for bail on medical grounds, but was denied. Parkinson’s disease is a debilitating nervous disorder that can cause involuntary spasms and tremors that make it difficult for patients to carry out everyday actions, such as drinking water, without aid. Meanwhile, the court on Thursday permitted activist Shoma Sen to withdraw Rs1 lakh from her account for expenses, but rejected her plea to add her husband as a second account holder to operate the account. The prosecution said that during investigation, Sen’s accounts had reflected some suspicious transactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-father-stan-swamy-files-plea-for-woollens-sipper-straw/story-hYCuIiumPEDaQWJCK4GC1O.html
27-11-2020||Kolkata||Trade union strike partially affects normal life in Bengal, 449 arrested||Normal life was partially affected in West Bengal on Thursday due to a nationwide trade union strike -- the first since the lockdown -- during which sporadic clashes were reported in several parts of the state.Around 449 people were arrested in the state, 140 of them in Kolkata, while trying to enforce the strike, which began at 6 am, police said.The CPI(M) claimed that the 24-hour bandh called by a joint committee of the central trade unions in protest against the Centre’s economic policies turned out to be a “complete success in West Bengal”.The strike, which was also supported by the Congress, was more of a litmus test for both the parties, which seem to be testing waters ahead of the assembly polls in the state.Bandh supporters, mostly activists of CPI(M)- affiliated outfits such as CITU and DYFI, brought out rallies in Jadavpur, Garia, Kamalgazi and Dumdum areas, besides other parts of the state, disrupting vehicular movement and asking shopkeepers to pull down shutters, an official said.They picketed outside Howrah railway station, threatening vehicle operators to stop services, but a large police contingent, deployed in the area, ensured vehicles plied normally, he said.Left activists blocked roads in Central Avenue, Hastings, Shyambazar and Moulali areas of Kolkata, while Congress workers tried to shut down shops in Burrabazar area, triggering tension, he said.Left Front Chairman Biman Bose led the protesters, as they restricted traffic movement at Mallickbazar Crossing.He alleged that the TMC government was trying to muzzle a “spontaneous people’s movement” with brute force.SFI activists blocked a portion of the road near Jadavpur 8B bus terminus and played football and table tennis.Protesters clashed with the police at Barasat and Belgharia in North 24 Parganas, Paschim Barddhaman’s Durgapur, Coochbehar’s Mathabhanga, Dhupguri in Jalpaiguri and Midnapore town in Paschim Medinipur district, the official said.Suburban trains in the Sealdah division and Howrah- Kharagpur section came to a halt as agitators sat on railway tracks at several stations, a railway spokesperson said.Kolkata Metro services, however, were not affected.Flight, too, took off from the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport as per schedule, an official said.Banking services were partially affected in parts of the state as many branches and ATMs remained closed.Operations at the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port’s Kolkata Dock System faced a temporary setback, as 70 per cent of permanent employees and 50 per cent of contractual workers did not join work in the city, officials said, adding that the Haldia dock functioned normally.The strike had an adverse impact on the state’s jute industry, with many mills remaining closed and a handful operating at 30-50 per cent capacity, sources at the Indian Jute Mills Association said.Several tea gardens in the Dooars region in North Bengal did not function during the day, but the strike had little effect on the estates in Darjeeling Hills, a senior trade union leader said.The bandh also affected coal production in the mines of the Eastern Coalfields Ltd in the western part of the state, sources said.The TMC did not support the strike but said it backed the issues flagged by the Left and the Congress.“We are opposed to any bandh as we don’t believe in inconveniencing people. But we support the reason for which it has been called,” Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said.CPI (M) politburo member Mohammed Salim said that the strike was a “success” in Bengal.Attempts by the state administration to scuttle the agitation prove the theory of “tacit understanding” between the TMC and the BJP, he alleged.“The BJP, through its protest at Majerhat, and the CM, through her press conference, tried to divert attention from the success of the strike,” he stated.Senior Congress leader and MP Pradip Bhattacharya also echoed Salim and said “had the TMC been serious about supporting the reason for the bandh, its members would have joined the agitation.Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh claimed that the way the TMC administration gave a free run to the agitators, it proves a “grand alliance of the TMC, CPI(M) and Congress” is in the offing.“We have seen how the CPI(M) and Congress were allowed to have a free run. This proves a grand alliance is in the offing. We have defeated grand alliance in Bihar, and we will defeat it in Bengal also,” Ghosh said.

27-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi to continue door-to-door survey to test symptomatic Covid-19 patients||A door to door survey for identifying and testing symptomatic Covid-19 patients will continue in Delhi with focus on those aged above 50 years and having comorbidities, officials said on Thursday.The survey was earlier conducted between October 20-24, covering over 57 lakh people in containment zones and hotspots to identify symptomatic persons and their contacts and test them.The direction to continue the exercise was given in a meeting of the Covid-19 nodal officer with district magistrates on Wednesday, a senior Delhi government officer said.The district magistrate of the west district in an order issued on November 25 directed officials to continue the door to door exercise.“During the meeting on November 25, it was directed by the competent authority to continue the process of the house to house search for symptomatic persons and those above 50 with co-morbidities,” the order stated.All the SDMs in the district have been directed to ensure the house to house search for symptomatic persons and other categories through teams allocated to them till further orders, it said.“We have been directed to continue the survey to cover buffer areas adjoining containment zones and vulnerable pockets,” a senior officer in the north east district said.“No time period has been given to wrap up this next phase and elderly people especially those over 50 years of age having comorbidities and those above 60 years, and also the contacts of symptomatic persons will be focused,” he said.The extended door to door survey will not have any time period and will be conducted as an ongoing process. It will be random rather than being targeted in terms of numbers and the focus will be vulnerable age groups who have higher chances of getting infected, another officer said.The door to door survey for five days in October to identify and isolate Covid-19 infected persons in containment zones and hotspot pockets of the city reported 1,178 cases with a positivity rate of 6.4 per cent, officials said.The RTPCR test reports of total 18,336 symptomatic persons and their contacts reported 1,178 cases, they said.About 9,000 three-member teams equipped with oximeters and thermal scanners surveyed people in 4,456 containment zones and surrounding areas across 11 districts.The survey was part of various steps decided to be taken in Delhi in view of surging Covid-19 cases, in a high-level meeting including Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Chief Minister Amit Shah on November 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-continue-door-to-door-survey-to-test-symptomatic-covid-19-patients/story-XJf3ZTHxnVjYmbm98kROXP.html

27-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records its worst air quality of the past eight months||The city recorded its worst air quality over the past eight months on Thursday after a sharp spike in pollution levels was witnessed over the past two days. According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality index (AQI) went from 157 (moderate) on Tuesday to 180 on Wednesday morning, then 201 (poor) on Wednesday evening, and 252 (poor) on Thursday morning, which fell to 242 (poor) by the evening, making it the worst AQI so far this season and worst since March 17 when 272 (poor) was recorded. Prior to Thursday, the worst AQI was recorded on November 10 at 221 (poor).On Thursday, five of 10 locations —Malad (311), Bandra Kurla Complex (308), Mazgaon (314), Colaba (303), and Chembur (303) — all recorded very poor AQI.AQI levels are categorised from 0-50 as good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate, 201-300 is poor, 301-400 is very poor, and above 401 is severe.SAFAR had predicted AQI to worsen after a change in wind direction. “The northerly to north-easterly wind component has increased pollutant accumulation over the city, making the air heavy. This is being reflected through a thin layer of haze. Calm winds are further reducing fast dispersion of pollutants suspended close to the surface,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR, adding that poor air quality could continue for the next three days. SAFAR predicted an AQI of 235 (poor) for Friday.The concentration of PM2.5 increased from 91 microgrammes per cubic metre (µg/m3) on Wednesday to 103 µg/m3, against the safe limit of 60 µg/m3, while PM10 levels were 195 µg/m3, against the safe limit of 100 µg/m3, almost twice the safe limit.According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily air quality bulletin, Mumbai recorded an AQI of 221 (poor) — from the average calculated from 15 air monitoring stations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) — on Thursday, with prominent pollutant being PM2.5 (small pollutant particles that can easily enter the lungs and cause health ailments). Meanwhile, the maximum and minimum temperature at the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, was 34.8 and 20.8 degrees Celsius, both a degree Celsius above normal. Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded the maximum temperature at 32.6 degrees Celsius, a degree Celsius below normal, while the minimum temperature was at the normal mark at 22 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-its-worst-air-quality-of-the-past-eight-months/story-bWl30cWscSoebm2Y1YiZjI.html
27-11-2020||Mumbai||MSC Bank scam: Mumbai court rejects ED’s plea for intervention||The special anti-corruption bureau (ACB) court on Thursday rejected the plea of Enforcement Director (ED) for intervention in the process of hearing the closure report recently submitted by Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) in connection with Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank scam involving politicians from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.EOW had, in September, filed a closure report in the alleged ₹25,000-crore MSC Bank fraud. The police filed a C-summary in the special ACB court after EOW’s special investigation team (SIT) found no criminal aspect to be investigated in the case.The agency had filed a first information report (FIR) in the case under sections 406, 409, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471, 120B and 34 of the Indian Penal Code, section 13 (a)(b)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and section 29 of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act. The case was filed in August last year on the direction of the Bombay high court (HC) while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Andheri-based social activist Surinder Arora who had alleged police inaction into the fraud.On the basis of the case registered by the Mumbai Police, ED too initiated probe for money laundering. While the Mumbai Police filed a closure report after the probe, ED questioned the probe by the Mumbai Police and sought to intervene. ED also urged the court to reject the closure report filed by the Mumbai Police.The complaint pertained to thousands of crores of rupees obtained in loans by sugar cooperatives, spinning mills and other processing units from district and cooperative banks. MSC Bank, the apex bank that controlled credit to the co-operative sector in the state and was handled by then ruling politicians, landed in trouble in 2011 after an inquiry report by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) found the bank was in red with a negative of ₹144 crore. The report indicated financial mismanagement on part of the board of directors which led to ballooning of non-performing assets. This was largely due to handing out loans to sugar co-operatives and spinning mills in violation of all norms.The Mumbai Police in its closure report justified the actions and claimed there was no case. ED, however, questioned the probe.In Its plea, ED claimed that during their investigation they referred to reports of Nabard available since 2000-01. “On perusal of the said reports, it is found that Nabard has pointed out various irregularities in its every inspection report from the period 2000-01 onwards. The said irregularities pertain to working of the board of directors of the bank, size of the various committees of the bank, documentation and proposing of loan proposal, sanctioning of the loan proposals, non-compliance of various RBI circulars and directions from Nabard, etc,” ED claimed.The central agency further claimed, “During the course of investigation, it was found that loans were given to sugar mills/companies controlled by relatives of the directors of the bank without assessing loan repayment capacity of the sugar mills/companies.” It also alleged that the bank did not follow the process stated under the SARFAESI Act while auctioning defaulting Sugar Sahkari Kharkhana (SSK). “It is found that though the reserve price was decided based on the valuation of the valuers, the same was not disclosed in the advertisement as well as in the tender form of the above mentioned 5 SSKs. Therefore, the offer amounts were received well below the reserve price and the SSKs were sold below the reserve price,” the agency claimed.The ED has further alleged that, “Some SSKs were indirectly sold to the then director/office-bearers of the bank, and the financial investigation in this regard raises suspicion about transparency in the auction proceedings conducted for sale of the said SSKs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/msc-bank-scam-mumbai-court-rejects-ed-s-plea-for-intervention/story-33mZtTqUV8IFRq0zDw20YN.html
27-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra crosses 1.8 million Covid-19 cases; state hints against lockdown||Maharashtra on Thursday went past 1.8 million Covid-19 infections with 6,406 new cases, pushing the tally to 1,802,365, even as the state hinted against imposing any lockdown. Mumbai reported 1,147 new cases and added 15 deaths, taking the tally to 279,744 and toll to 10,740. The state’s death toll was pushed up to 46,813 with the addition of 65 new fatalities on Thursday.Cases are on the rise in the state in the past ten days as the daily caseload first mounted to over 5,000 cases from November 18 and over 6,000 cases in the past two days. Nine days before it, the daily caseload average was 3,690. Despite the steady rise in cases, owing to crowding during Diwali and fall in temperature, the state government in not in favour of reimposing a lockdown. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has opposed any new lockdown as he feels it badly affects the economy and vulnerable population. “We cannot afford any more lockdown. The poorer class, which makes its living on daily wages, has been affected badly during the lockdown. Despite it, they cooperated with the state and central government with lockdown imposed earlier. I think instead of curbs, all of us should adhere to the health protocol by maintaining social distancing and wearing masks as it will help us contain the virus spread,” he said in Pandharpur.According to officials from the health department, a section of ministers and bureaucracy is against imposing a fresh lockdown. “Central government, through its notification on Wednesday, prohibited states to impose a lockdown without its permission. Even the state authorities are against it as the collateral economic and social damages are more than the health benefits. Instead of it, we are focusing on strict implementation of health protocol and tapping superspreaders. We believe that it will help us contain the spread to a large extent,” said an official.The doubling rate, which is a crucial parameter to show the growth of the outbreak, improved to 81 days in the state as the caseload breached the grim milestone of 1.8 million, 81 days after it crossed 900,000 cases on September 6. The last 100,000 cases were reported in 26 days, after going past 1.7 million cases on November 5. After crossing the 1.5 million mark on October 9, another 100,00 cases were added in 10 days, taking the tally to 1,601,365 on October 19 and another 17 days to take the tally to 1,703,444 on November 5.In Mumbai, for a second day in a row, recorded over 1,000 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday, at 1,147, taking the total to 279,744. Mumbai also recorded 15 new deaths on Thursday, taking the toll to 10,740. Active cases in Mumbai have now gone up to 14,185, up from 12,707 in the beginning of this week, and 11,822 last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-crosses-1-8-million-covid-19-cases-state-hints-against-lockdown/story-jajYFSvRxbZs3erPTxVrnK.html

27-11-2020||Mumbai||MVA government completes a year: More challenges ahead for Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP in Maharashtra||“I have the remote control of the government in my hand…The moment I think the chief minister is not working for the people, I will eject it..” This was a favourite line of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray during the tenure of the first Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra in 1995-99. He never took up a position of power, even though his party ruled the Mumbai civic body for years, ruled Maharashtra between 1995 and 1999 and was part of the successive NDA governments at the Centre headed by the late AB Vajpayee. The senior Thackeray preferred having power in hand without him being held accountable for the performance of the government. His followers and supporters would see him as a leader above power politics, often saying: “Balasaheb wouldn’t need to do any compromise for power.” His son, Uddhav, however, chose a different path. He decided to head a government propped by two parties that were not just traditional rivals of the Sena, but had exactly opposite ideology. He wanted to come out of the shadow of his father. More importantly, he had to prove a point. Forming the government with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress under the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was his revenge on the BJP, which was aiming to finish the Sena in Maharashtra. A year ago, on November 28, he was sworn-in amid an atmosphere of uncertainty – whether his government would last or collapse due to its internal contradictions. One year later, Uddhav Thackeray has shown that he has the acumen to handle a complex coalition of three parties, even though the uncertainty still exists. He has been appreciated for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, although he has not yet shown his administrative skills. One year could be a short period to draw a conclusion on his performance, but he has not disappointed his supporters and allies. “Thackeray has not yet got an opportunity to show the performance of his government, as most of his time and energy has gone into fighting the Covid pandemic. Coupled with revenue loss, the functioning of the government is badly affected. The Centre too has not extended a helping hand, as expected by the government,” opined Pratap Asbe, political analyst. Also read: MVA government completes a year: Handling Covid in Maharashtra the highlight Survival, an achievementThackeray’s major achievement in one year is that his government survived. While non-BJP governments in neighbouring Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh have collapsed, the one in Rajasthan was on the verge of collapsing, the MVA government in Maharashtra remained intact. It is partly because all three parties were forced to stick together due to the fear of common enemy (the BJP), partly because the MVA’s architect NCP chief Sharad Pawar is firmly behind Thackeray and partly because Thackeray has managed to do the balancing act. Pawar, who suffered setback as Devendra Fadnavis tried to cut him to size during the latter’s tenure as chief minister, needs his party to be in power in Maharashtra as much as Thackeray. The mutual need has led to a good understanding between the two leaders. Pawar has been guiding Thackeray in the matters of governance. Both the leaders are on the same page when it comes to their political strategies. Thackeray has acknowledged Pawar’s big brother role though he doesn’t follow the latter’s advice every time. He has also kept the people who matter in Congress happy. He kept his cool even as friend-turned-foe BJP threw up one challenge after another to corner him. He also tried maintaining relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah even as he battled it out with Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP in the state. “Thackeray has played a gamble and it is in his interest that this government survives. He has been taking care not to upset the allies though he also tries to keep his original agenda intact,” said a senior Congress minister, who did not want to be named. Even as he runs a government with parties that believe in secularism, Thackeray has not given up on the Hindutva plank. However, he keeps insisting that his Hindutva is different than the BJP’s Hindu hardline politics, but also adds that the MVA government would be run on a common minimum programme agreed upon by the three allies. Hurdles galore As the Covid-19 epidemic became his priority, his one-year rule was made difficult by an offensive BJP and not so-friendly Central government. Whether it was the handling of the pandemic or Palghar mob lynching case or Sushant Singh Rajput suicide case, the BJP has not left any stone unturned to politically corner Thackeray and his government. Just when the state was planning a thorough investigation in the Bhima-Koregaon violence, the Centre took over the case through the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Governor BS Koshyari’s refusal to accept the government’s requests—whether to nominate Thackeray to the Council or endorse the decision to cancel final-year examination of universities due to the pandemic or nominate 12 candidates to the legislative Council— has not made things easy for Thackeray. MVA leaders keep pointing out how the Centre has not been responding to state’s request for adequately compensating the state for revenue loss due to Covid-19 or giving funds to provide compensation to farmers hit by natural calamities. After initial reluctance, Thackeray has started taking on the BJP and its supporters. The state’s decision to reopen the suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik who had blamed TV anchor Arnab Goswami or Sena-ruled Mumbai civic body’s action against illegal structures by actor Kangana Ranaut clearly indicated that. The MVA has also begun investigation into fake social media handles (80,000, according to Mumbai police) that were apparently being used to target the government and Thackerays. “Thackeray doesn’t lose his cool, but can take a stern stand if he needs. In case of lockdown, too, he lifted the restrictions when he thought the timing was right,” said Hemant Desai, political analyst. Lacking administrative skills? Before becoming the chief minister, Thackeray had never occupied any public office in his life. Covid-19 outbreak was his first big test. “He has handled the government’s effort to tackle Covid-19 epidemic in a transparent way, chosen to communicate directly with the people, often being frank and seeking their cooperation. His approach was appreciated even though there were different opinions on how much the state government succeeded in containing the pandemic,” said Desai. Also read: Maharashtra’s MVA government will complete 5-year term: Shiv Sena MP Raut after meeting BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis“The MVA government’s handling of the situation was better than several states. Thackeray takes advice from a taskforce of experts and remains firm on his plan. Besides him, health minister Rajesh Tope has taken a lot of efforts to handle the situation,” said Asbe. However, Thackeray’s colleagues in the government are not completely impressed with his style of functioning. In his first year in office, he has been extremely cautious to avoid any mistakes or getting entangled in any allegations of corruption. The common complaint about him among the MVA ministers and legislators is that he is over-cautious in his bid to avoid any controversy or allegations and hence relies too much on bureaucracy. Thackeray’s approach in handling the governance is stark in contrast with several experienced ministers from the NCP and Congress who are in his cabinet (they include one former chief minister and two former deputy chief ministers). “It is a group of top bureaucrats who enjoy his trust and have a say on various issues. This is not how we used to run the government. If people have elected us, we will decide the direction the government should take and the bureaucracy should handle the execution,” remarked a senior NCP minister. It was no surprise when the NCP and Congress ministers strongly opposed his move to give a second extension to IAS officer Ajoy Mehta as chief secretary of the state. Thackeray then appointed him as the former’s advisor in the chief minister’s office (CMO). Mantralaya insiders say deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar (NCP) openly expresses his unhappiness about Thackeray not giving enough time to discuss the financial situation and what can be done to generate revenue in current circumstances. Ajit Pawar heads the finance department. “In the aftermath of Cyclone Nisarga or when he was reluctant to lift the lockdown initially, he had to be nudged by Sharad Pawar. It remains to be seen, if he learns from his experience in first year and improves handling of the government,” Desai pointed out. Rocky road ahead The coming days are challenging for Thackeray. The economy is in bad shape which means there will be paucity of funds. It will badly affect state’s work on welfare schemes and building infrastructure. It may create a negative sentiment against the government in rural areas where subsidies and welfare schemes matter more than cities. There is visible unhappiness among the NCP-Congress MLAs over the same, but as of now they have no option but to keep quiet. To make it worse, a wounded BJP would be an undesirable Opposition for any government. Fadnavis has already gone on the offensive. With not much hopes of help from the Centre, Thackeray’s skills as politician and administrator will be put to test. And not to be forgotten, he will have to do a balancing act of keeping the allies happy. Congress leaders point out that Thackeray had avoided direct confrontation with the BJP-led Centre till his son Aaditya and he were targeted by the BJP as well as the right-wing trolls over Palghar mob lynching and actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. His stand on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) was ambiguous. He did not show a desire to retain the Bhima-Koregaon case investigation with Maharashtra Police even as the Centre took over. He has not yet accepted the Congress’s demand for passing a resolution in the Assembly against new farm sector laws. This has not gone down well with his both the allies, but they do not have any option due to political compulsion. “I don’t think there is any problem regarding stability of the government.

27-11-2020||Mumbai||Over 2.42 lakh FYJC seats up for grabs in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, second merit list on December 5||More than 2.42 lakh first-year junior college (FYJC) seats remain vacant after the first round of online admissions. As per the revised admission schedule, these seats will be up for grabs in the second round of admissions, and the second merit list will be released on December 5.As per information shared by the Maharashtra school education department, a total of 3.2 lakh seats were available for admissions, including 2 lakh seats for online admissions.“Registrations for the second round of admissions were already complete, but with the change in socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) quota, we’ve reopened the registration process to allow students to change their quota preference. New registrations will be also be allowed,” said an official from the school education department.On September 9, in line with the Supreme Court’s interim stay on the SEBC quota in jobs and education, the state education department stayed the admission process for FYJC until further orders. With this, the second merit list for admissions, which was originally scheduled to be released on September 10, was stalled, leaving over 2.42 lakh students in the lurch in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) alone. While the state government has revealed that admissions to all courses will now take place without the 12% of SEBC quota, it has also clarified through its recent government resolution (GR) that admissions under the SEBC quota that have already been confirmed before September 9 will remain intact.With lakhs of seats still vacant, top college principals confirmed that seats in their colleges have already filled up after the first round. “Most seats in the open category were already filled up after the first seat merit list itself, so very few seats remain vacant for the remaining rounds. Unless students withdraw admissions in the forthcoming rounds, any dip in cut-offs will also be less likely due to the high number of Class 10 top scorers this year,” said the vice-principal of a south Mumbai college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-2-42-lakh-fyjc-seats-up-for-grabs-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-second-merit-list-on-december-5/story-BG33K2uhV09gpilYHOqr0I.html
27-11-2020||Mumbai||Vile Parle, Kurla, Bandra, Chembur see maximum crime in Mumbai: Praja Foundation report||North-central Mumbai, consisting of areas like Vile Parle, Kurla, Bandra and Chembur, followed by Jogeshwari, Goregaon, Andheri and Malad, recorded the maximum number of cases in Mumbai in 2019-20, according to a report released by NGO Praja Foundation on Thursday. According to the report, 12,865 cases were registered in Vile Parle, Kurla, Bandra and Chembur which included 1,833 cases of theft, 580 cases of house break-in, 281 cases of rape and 40 of murder. North-west Mumbai, which constitutes of Jogeshwari, Goregaon, Andheri and Malad, recorded 11,088 cases which included 1,435 cases of theft, 540 cases of house break-in, 251 cases of rape and 40 of murder.According to the report, murder cases from April 2019 to March 2020 were highest in the north-east region of Mumbai, including Bhandup, Vikhroli, Ghatkopar and Govandi. However, this region is reportedly the least number of criminal cases with 6,594. Mumbai Police said that the areas of Bandra and Kurla are the most vulnerable, though the topography and the people living in them are different. “Ironically, cases of rape and theft are highest in Bandra which otherwise is a plush locality,” said a police officer. The second-highest region recording more crimes was north-west Mumbai with 11,088 cases.“Crimes like murder have dropped considerably due to the constant efforts of the police in several parts of the city,” said Vishwas Nangre Patil, joint commissioner, law and order.It was also observed in the annual report, that although criminal cases were less in south Mumbai with 7,223, theft cases were third-highest, with 1,110 cases after north-central Mumbai, with 1,833 cases and north-west Mumbai with 1,435 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/vile-parle-kurla-bandra-chembur-see-maximum-crime-in-mumbai-praja-foundation-report/story-HBZ0t9pADJuSSVc1HG7NmK.html

27-11-2020||City||Khanna man flees with ₹39 lakh belonging to his employer||An employee of a shopkeeper fled with ₹39.13 lakh belonging to his employer in Khanna, police said on Thursday. The accused, along with his co-worker, had left the shop for depositing the cash in the bank. However, when the co-worker went to refuel bike, the accused fled with the cash.Khanna City 2 police have registered an FIR against Nihal Vijan of Khanna following the statement of Gagan Batra, owner of Batra Enterprises. The complainant said that he had sent his employees, Nihal and Narinder, to deposit ₹39.13 lakh to his account in Union Bank of India.“When Narinder and Nihal were going to bank, their motorcycle ran out of fuel. They pushed the motorcycle to the petrol pump. While Narinder went inside the filling station, Nihal waited outside. When Narinder came out, he couldn’t find Nihal and contacted me immediately. When Nihal couldn’t be traced, we approached the police,” Batra said. Inspector Labh Singh said while scanning CCTV footage, the police found Nihal standing outside the filling station. “In the mean time, a white Honda City car turned up there. Nihal could be seen signalling the car occupants. The car arrived near him, he sat in the car and they fled the scene,” he added. The inspector said that police are trying to trace the owner of the car. The police also suspect that the accused was hatching conspiracy of committing the crime for long.The police have also conducted raids at his house in Khanna, but he was not present there. A hunt is on for his arrest, the cop said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/khanna-man-robs-his-employer-of-39-lakh/story-B5HyzswLIaUWcsVZAMjYwO.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Daily Covid deaths dip below 100 for the first time in 10 days; 5,475 new cases||For the second straight day on Thursday, Delhi’s Covid-19 test positivity rate remained below 10%even as the national capital added 5,475 new cases, a marginal increase from the previous day, but significantly lower from the highs seen two weeks ago. Delhi added an average of 5,805 new cases a day in the seven days ending November 26, down from 6,228 in the week before that, and 7,196 in the week ending November 12.Meanwhile, of the 63,266 tests conducted on Thursday, 28,897 were conducted using the gold standard reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, the most in a single-day so far.The positivity rate in Delhi — 8.65% on Thursday — has dropped consistently from the levels it breached in the first half of this month. In fact, as per the November 15 state health bulletin, the city’s test positivity rate had hit a 140-day high of 15.33%.Experts regard the positivity rate — the proportion of samples that return positive among total tested — as a crucial metric to judge the spread of an infection. According to recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control in the region.The single-day death toll also dipped slightly with Delhi reporting 91 new deaths on Thursday, as compared to 99 on Wednesday, and 109 the day before that. The Capital added over 100 daily deaths for five days, between November 20 and November 24.With 5,475 new cases being reported on Thursday, Delhi’s tally has crossed 550,000 cases, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. So far, 8,811 people have died of the infection in Delhi since the first case was detected on March 2. Of the total deaths, 2,300 happened in November, as per the data. The seven-day case fatality ratio (CFR) – the proportion of deaths among those who test positive – remained at 1.8%, which has increased from 0.85% at the beginning of the month.  “The positivity rate was less than 8.5% yesterday (Wednesday). On November 7, the positivity rate was 15.2%. Over the past three weeks, the positivity rate has been going down steadily,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said in a press briefing. Dr Vivek Nangia, head of the department of pulmonology at Max hospital, Saket, said, “People have started taking Covid-19 lightly and because of that there has been a spurt in cases. This is usually the time when people get the common cold and seasonal flu. So most people are ignoring symptoms. Everyone must get tested two to three days after they get symptoms of cough and fever. They should rush to a hospital if their oxygen saturation drops -- there is generally a feeling of breathlessness, fingers turn blue, and a person feels disoriented.” The government has been working on increasing the number of tests, especially the more accurate RT-PCR tests, after a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah 10 days ago. However, the numbers have remained stagnant at about 61,000. The proportion of RT PCR tests has increased to an average of 43.5% of the total tests over the past seven days, as compared to 36.8% the week before, and 30.5% the week before that. “We are trying to increase the number of RT-PCR tests, over 35,000 samples are being collected. But, it was said that labs have a capacity to test 35,000 samples and they are unable to give reports within a day. Now, you will hear people say that their samples were collected two or three days before results came. Testing has reached a saturation level,” Jain said during the briefing. The government has also asked experts for measures that can be implemented to reduce the number of deaths from the infection. There have been around 100 deaths each day for the past 10 days in the city. “Yesterday, there was a meeting with experts and chief minister Kejriwal has asked whether there was a need to change protocols to reduce the number of deaths,” Jain said. Stepping up its preparedness, the government has increased the number of intensive care unit beds by 843 in the past five days, as per data on the Delhi corona app. But there is a long way to go before Delhi’s positivity rate reaches the desired 5% or less.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/daily-covid-deaths-dip-below-100-for-the-first-time-in-10-days-5-475-new-cases/story-rvb64L84YlWRvDdYWjscjM.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Phase 3 of Covaxin trials kick off at AIIMS, neurology chief gets first dose||Phase 3 trials of the indigenously developed Covaxin kicked off on Thursday at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), with the vaccine being given to the head of the department of neurology Dr MV Padma Shrivastava.Unlike the phase 1 and 2 trials, people from the general population – including the young, the old and the comorbid – will be given the vaccine in Phase 2 and not just healthy volunteers.The large scale phase 3 trials will recruit over 26,000 volunteers from 25 trial sites across the country. In Delhi, doctors from AIIMS will administer the two dose vaccine, developed by an Indian vaccine maker in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research, to 3,000 persons in Delhi’s Dakshinpuri. “The first person to be enrolled for the phase 3 trial has received the first shot today. Another shot will be given a month later. We hope to complete the enrolment of 3,000 persons within a month. Volunteers would be selected from among AIIMS employees and from a site we have in Dakshinpuri. That will ensure that we are able to do proper follow-ups,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor, department of community medicine, AIIMS. He is one of the investigators of the vaccine trial. “It is my institute’s trial and my country’s product. It is an honour to participate in the trial. All medicines that come into the market have to go through the trial. I understand the science; it is a placebo controlled trial and no one will know who gets the vaccine and who does not, and I am happy to play my part,” said Dr MV Padma Srivastava. The doctor vouched that she is over the age of 60 years and has no comorbidities.Vaccine candidates have to be tested on animal models first to check their safety and immune response. In humans, a small phase 1 trial is done to check the safety of the compound, while in phase 2, trials are done to see the immune response and the dose at which the vaccine should be administered.Large scale phase 3 trials are done to see how many infections or severe disease the vaccine prevents in a given population. “The recruitment should be complete within a month and we will start seeing some preliminary data by that time,” said Dr Mishra. The people who are administered the vaccine will be followed up for a period of 207 days by researchers. The vaccine uses an inactivated Sars-Cov-2 virus to generate an immune response that can prevent Covid-19 disease. The preliminary data, which can be presented to the drug regulator for seeking emergency use authorisation, should be available within two months, the researcher said. The doctor said so far, none of the participants in the phase 1 and 2 trials has had any adverse events, although there have been news reports of a volunteer from Nagpur developing viral pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs. “Some participants have just experienced redness and pain at the injection site, but that is common to many injectables,” said Dr Mishra. Four vaccine candidates from around the world have announced preliminary reports this week – trial data from US Pfizer and Moderna and Russian Sputnik V show their vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing Covid-19, while AstraZeneca/ Oxford say its vaccine could be up to 90% effective with a particular half dose first and a full dose later. Apart from Covaxin, ZyCovD developed by Indian pharmaceutical company Zydus is also in advanced stages of human trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/phase-3-of-covaxin-trials-kick-off-at-aiims-neurology-chief-gets-first-dose/story-BOblmC07c44m5SBPgHoOVP.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||West Delhi will survey all houses in its area for Covid-19 symptomatic persons||The west Delhi revenue district on Thursday expanded the ambit of the door-to-door Covid-19 survey meant for containment zones, vulnerable localities and hot spots and said the exercise will now cover the whole district until further orders.Other districts in Delhi are likely to follow suit in the coming days, said a senior government official privy to the matter.“It has been directed by the competent authority (the Delhi Disaster Management Authority) to continue the process of house-to-house search for symptomatic persons, contacts, those above 60 years of age and people above the age of 50 years with co-morbidities in the remaining areas until further orders. It was also directed that testing of all such persons be carried out,” said the order issued for the west district, which HT has seen.The initiative to expand the survey started with west Delhi as its district officials had proactively sought permission to do so in a meeting with chief secretary Vijay Dev on Wednesday evening. Soon, other district magistrates, who were also present in the meeting, expressed a willingness to expand the survey in their respective districts, said a senior official privy to the meeting.“We will expand the survey across the district aiming to identify, test and isolate more Covid-19 cases, especially the elderly and the vulnerable,” said Neha Bansal, district magistrate (west Delhi).Delhi government spokesperson did not comment on the expansion of the surveyHT has reported on Thursday that a total of 13,516 persons (0.24%) of the 5.73 million screened as part of the Delhi government’s ongoing door-to-door survey, were found to have symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) till Tuesday, while 1,178 persons have tested positive for the disease. The survey was launched on November 20 and was to conclude on Thursday, but it is likely that the exercise may now be extended.Around 6.42% -- both symptomatic persons and contacts of Covid-19 patients in high-risk areas who have undergone tests till Tuesday -- have tested positive for the virus, according to the government data accessed by HT.The survey, which was launched on the directions of Union home minister Amit Shah in light of the sharp increase in Covid-19 cases and deaths in the national capital, was supposed to cover around 5.8 million people – more than one-fourth of Delhi’s total population of around 20 million – mainly residing in the over 4,500 containment zones and other areas assessed as hot spots in the 11 revenue districts.Around 30,000 government officials and civic agency employees ranging from teachers to mosquito breeding checkers and social health workers were roped in for the survey, which had covered 5.73 million people as on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/west-delhi-will-survey-all-houses-in-its-area-for-covid-19-symptomatic-persons/story-pOVPwznzI4KZWenqQLXFoO.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi has enough storage capacity, staff to deliver Covid vaccine: Govt||Delhi has the storage capacity as well adequate trained professionals to inject the entire population of Delhi within a month once the Covid vaccine is made available, head of the state immunisation programme said on Thursday. “We had already planned out the logistics for vaccinating 5 million children under the national MR [measles and rubella] vaccine campaign. The storage capacity is already there, we have a network for the childhood immunisation programme that can be used. And, if the nurses from hospitals are also pooled in for vaccination then the entire population of Delhi can be immunised in a month,” said Dr Suresh Seth, head of the state immunisation programme. However, the vaccination is unlikely to be carried out all at once as it will depend on the number vaccines that get approval and the number of doses that are made available. Currently, all the vaccines that are in advanced phase III clinical trials require two doses to be administered. On Thursday, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said schools in the city are unlikely to open before a vaccine becomes available. “There are no plans to open the schools as of now. A vaccine is likely to become available soon. Until we are completely assured about the situation is in control, schools are unlikely to open in Delhi,” he said during a press briefing. HT had reported last month that the government had started collecting data of 13- categories of healthcare workers, including MBBS doctors, AYUSH practitioners, nurses, lab technicians, pharmacists and ANMs (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife). The central government has said that 30 million healthcare workers and frontline workers will be the first to receive any vaccine that becomes available. HT had also reported that the government has identified a new storage facility at the state-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur. The government currently has a vaccine storage facility in Civil Lines, which was used to store over 5 million doses of the MR vaccine for the national campaign that was to happen in 2019. “We have deep freezers and other machines needed to safely store the vaccine. We might just need one more site where large quantities of the vaccines can be stored,” said a senior government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-has-enough-storage-capacity-staff-to-deliver-covid-vaccine-govt/story-7BWxyRkyPiytDZG6yjufdK.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Stricter checks at Delhi’s interstate borders lead to traffic chaos||Heightened checking at Delhi’s borders, to prevent agitating farmers from entering the national capital, resulted in huge jams and confusion among motorists crossing state lines throughout Thursday even as stray group of farmers managed to reach Delhi and were detained. The situation was the worst at Singhu border (connects Haryana’s Sonepat with Delhi’s Narela) after the local police shut the border for nearly three hours in the evening. The farmers from Punjab and Haryana were scheduled to reach Delhi on Thursday via several highways for a two-day protest named “Delhi Chalo”. The protesters are demanding that the Central government revert the implementation of the three new farm laws that, they allege, will harm the interests of farmers across the country. The Delhi Police on Wednesday had refused permission to farmers’ organisations to protest in Delhi on Thursday and Friday.On Thursday, motorists complained of being stuck in slow-moving traffic near the borders for hours, and many took to Twitter to bombard the Delhi traffic police with queries about road closures and restrictions. But Taj Hassan, special commissioner of police (Delhi traffic police), said the only road that was completely shut on Thursday was the Singhu border near Narela. “We diverted traffic towards the Ring Road and the Signature Bridge. All closures are being made at the discretion of the local police,” he said. Gaurav Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north), under whose jurisdiction the Singhu border comes, said there were inputs from the Haryana Police that protesters were marching towards Delhi. “So we closed both carriageways of the border road from 4.30pm to 7pm,” Sharma said.Other highways leading to Delhi also saw traffic move at a snail’s pace even as police maintained that they were only carrying out “strict checking” and not closing any road. “The traffic was slow on the DND Flyway (Delhi-Noida) in the morning due to heightened checking. The Ghazipur border (Delhi-Ghaziabad) and Chilla border (Delhi-Noida) were not so affected,” Jasmeet Singh, DCP (east), said. Ingit Pratap Singh, DCP (south-west), admitted that while checking at the Rajokri and Mahipalpur borders (both connect Delhi with Gurugram) did slow down traffic, the roads were not closed even once the whole day.Unless the protest march by the farmers is called off overnight, the situation could be quite similar or even worse on Friday, the traffic police has warned. It has advised motorists to avoid roads such as Outer Ring Road, Mukarba Chowk, GTK Road, NH-44 and Singhu border. Commuters to and from Noida were also caught in slow-moving traffic on Thursday. “ It took me half an hour to cross the Chilla (Noida-Mayur Vihar) border. There were barricades set up on both Delhi and Noida sides and there was a lot of checking,” said Sadhna Gupta, a Noida resident travelling to Mayur Vihar Phase 3 for work.In Ghaziabad, there was heavy deployment of personnel and administration officials at the UP Gate border with Delhi where commuters faced traffic snarls from about 11am till about 2.30pm. Commuters said the police had allowed vehicles to move via the Hindon canal over-bridge on NH-9 but no vehicle was allowed on the road below the UP Gate flyover. “Many commuters used the over-bridge to move to Delhi. Below the UP Gate flyover, the Ghaziabad traffic police had put up barricading for checks and that resulted in traffic bunching up,” said Kuldeep Saxena, resident of Shakti Khand, Indirapuram. Sporadic protests in Delhi There were sporadic protests by farmers in Delhi on Thursday and the police responded by registering cases in some of these incidents. Eish Singhal, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi), said that 70 farmers and political activists were detained from Jantar Mantar and later let off. “We have registered a case under the IPC Section 188 (disobedience to an order),” Singhal said. A group of 35 farmers were detained near Majnu Ka Tilla. NS Bundela, joint commissioner of police (central range), said, “They had arrived by public transport. We booked them for violating Covid-19 protocols.” Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava also made a tour of boder areas to review the situation. He said, “We have requested the farmer groups not to enter Delhi and if despite that they enter Delhi, we have our force deployed and prepared. We are in regular touch with our counterparts in Haryana and Punjab for updates. Since they have blocked the national highways there will be some problems which we will try to sort it out as soon as possible.” Protest low-key in NCR cities The protest against farm laws remained low-key in Gurugram when compared to areas bordering Punjab, as a majority of protesters mobilised by farmer unions in south Haryana were prevented by the police from reaching Panchgaon and Gurugram. Activists, including Swaraj India convener Yogendra Yadav, and farmer leaders were taken into preventive custody on Thursday morning when they tried to move towards Delhi to participate in the ”Delhi Chalo” protest. Addressing the media at Rathiwas, Yadav said, “Farmers across the country are united and they stand with protesters from Punjab who are spearheading the movement to save agriculture. Repressive measures are being taken in Punjab, Uttarakhand and particularly Haryana to deprive farmers of their constitutional rights,” he said. In Greater Noida’s Pari Chowk, a group of 30 farmers from the Bhartiya Kisan Union was stopped while trying to get to Delhi. “We assembled at the zero point and before we could start moving to Delhi, we were detained and taken to the DCP office,” said Rajkumar Roopwas, tehsil president, BKU. A group of about 25-30 farmers in the afternoon tried to move to UP Gate but were held back by police at Mohan Nagar. The traffic police officials said that checking points were also set up on the Hindon elevated road to scan vehicles for movement of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/stricter-checks-at-delhi-s-interstate-borders-lead-to-traffic-chaos/story-BmtYa86ZmFmVwDXqlEvyJK.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Farmers should be allowed to protest peacefully: Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday showed his support to farmers protesting against the three farm laws passed in Parliament in September and said they should be allowed to stage a peaceful protest.“The three farm bills of the central government are anti-farmer. Instead of rolling back these bills, farmers are being stopped from staging peaceful protests. Water cannons are being used against them. This is an injustice to the farmers. Peaceful protest is their constitutional right,” Kejriwal said in a tweet on Thursday.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had voted against the Bills in both the Lok Sabha (where it has one MP) and Rajya Sabha (where it has three MPs).Thousands of farmers are marching to Delhi from Punjab and Haryana, protesting against the laws that liberalise the agriculture sector. While some groups were stopped in Haryana on Wednesday and water cannons were used against them, several others continued to approach Delhi to stage a protest. The Delhi Police has issued a notice prohibiting any gathering in the Capital and the Delhi Metro temporarily closed operation on certain routes on Thursday.The three laws that have led to widespread protests are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-should-be-allowed-to-protest-peacefully-kejriwal/story-VaaosSdWeb1vJYFnurg0oO.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Metro to remain suspended from NCR cities to Delhi on Friday||Metro services to Delhi from stations in neighbouring NCR cities such as Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida and Ghaziabad will remain suspended on Friday in view of farmers’ protests, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said on Thursday. Trains from Delhi to these cities, however, will ply as usual. The corporation also clarified that metro services in Delhi, and within the respective NCR cities -- as well as the rapid metro -- will run normally.After remaining suspended on seven corridors for most of the day due to the protests, normal services to and from NCR cities resumed from 5pm on Thursday. But in a statement issued on Thursday evening, DMRC announced that train services from NCR towards Delhi will not be available on Friday as a precautionary measure. “As advised by Delhi Police, Metro services will be available only from Delhi towards the NCR sections. However, services from NCR stations towards Delhi will not be available due to security reasons till further notice.”Between 2pm and 5pm on Thursday, DMRC resumed services from Delhi towards other NCR cities, but trains from the opposite direction weren’t allowed. It was only after 5pm that Delhi Police allowed DMRC to resume full operations, including travel from NCR to the Capital.Most of Thursday, commuters travelling from or to Delhi faced problems as Metro restricted its routes in the wake of the farmers calling for a “Dilli Chalo” march in protest against the Centre’s recently passed farm bills. This was done on the request of Delhi Police to avoid overcrowding amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The move left a number of passengers stranded, who had to either book a cab, take e-rickshaw or a three-wheeler for their journey.Greater Noida resident Vivek Rana, who stays in GTB Nagar and is preparing for civil services, said he was stranded at Mayur Vihar Extension as there was no service beyond New Ashok Vihar for those wanting to go to Noida.“I had to book a bike ride because cabs were costly. Even cab drivers are apprehensive in crossing the border because of the heavy police presence,” he said.Sanjeev Kumar Jha, 49, who travels everyday for work from Dwarka, Sector 9, to Noida, Sector 15, by Delhi Metro, said, “Today, I had to get down at New Ashok Nagar and then take an e-rickshaw to reach my office in Sector 5.”Another passenger who had to reach Noida, Sector 168, said when he got off at Mayur Vihar Extension Metro station, he booked two cabs but both cancelled the rides as no one wanted to cross border. E-rickshaw drivers and auto drivers plying near Metro stations, however, got lucky as they had plenty of passengers willing to go to Noida, many of these getting off at New Ashok Nagar and Mayur Vihar Metro stations. Ratan Singh, a 40-year-old auto driver, said the first drop he got in the morning was at Noida, Sector 18. “We don’t get such passengers because Metro has direct connectivity. Some even got far off drops,” Singh added.These sections will be shut on Friday till further orders, DMRC officials said. On the Red line, no service will be available between Dilshad Garden and Major Mohit Sharma Rajender Nagar section.Similarly, on the Yellow line (Samaypur Badli-HUDA city Centre) services will not be available between Sultanpur and Guru Dronacharya stations.Trains will not run between Noida City Centre and New Ashok Nagar and Vaishali to Anand Vihar.On the Inderlok-Mundka corridor (Green line), services will not be available between Tikri Kalan and Brig.Similarly, on the Violet line, there will be no trains between Badarpur Border and Mewala Maharajpur section. DMRC officials said regular services will be available on the Airport line and other corridors.On the Magenta line, no services will be available from Jasola Vihar-Shaheen Bagh and Botanical Garden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/metro-to-remain-suspended-from-ncr-cities-to-delhi-on-friday/story-PhP2tnjkOABB3IIZO21JGM.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Weather comes to Delhi’s rescue, winds flush out pollution||Good winds helped Delhi breathe relatively cleaner air on Thursday as the air quality index (AQI) improved to the lower end of the ‘very poor’ zone after remaining in the ‘severe’ zone for a day. The air quality may improve to the ‘poor’ category by Friday and continue to remain so at least over the next three days, government agencies have forecast.According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4 pm bulletin, the average AQI stood at 302 compared to 413 on Wednesday and 379 on Tuesday. The levels of particulate matter (PM) also came down significantly. On Thursday evening, the PM 10 (coarse dust particles) levels reduced to 218ug/m3 as compared to 410 ug/m3 at the same time the previous day. The PM 2.5 levels (the most harmful aerosols in Delhi’s air) also came down to133 ug/m3 from 243ug/m3 on Wednesday.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the improvement was mainly because of a change in the wind direction and speed. Traces of rain were observed at the Lodhi Road and Ridge weather stations. Safdarjung Observatory -- the official marker for the city’s weather -- did not record any rainfall.V K Soni of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre said that with the impact of stubble burning being almost negligible, the good winds helped in the dispersion of local pollutants. “The wind speed was around 10-12 kmph. The wind direction changed to northwesterly in the afternoon from easterly. We expect the wind speed to remain high over the next three days. The air quality is likely to improve to the ‘poor’ zone and will remain so at least till November 30,” Soni said.According to the System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing, the share of stubble burning to city’s PM 2.5 levels on Thursday was just around 1% with the number of fire counts being as low as 37.COLD WAVEThe IMD had also predicted cold wave conditions in Delhi from November 27. “Due to the influence of a western disturbance over Afghanistan and neighbouring areas, fairly widespread rainfall and snowfall, as well as isolated hailstorms, are likely over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and Himachal Pradesh from November 25, which will result in low temperatures in Delhi as well,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.He said the minimum temperature is likely to remain around 6-7 degrees C till November-end. “The skies will be clear again, and this will cool the surface down faster and reduce the temperature by the end of the week,” said Srivastava.On Thursday, the minimum temperature was 10.4 degrees C, a notch below normal. The maximum settled at 25.8 degrees C, normal for this time of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/weather-comes-to-delhi-s-rescue-winds-flush-out-pollution/story-rb3BUYWULyQXUB4oshvgyH.html
27-11-2020||Education||DU to release lists for sports, ECA quota on December 2||Delhi University (DU) will on Wednesday release the list of marks awarded based on certificates submitted for undergraduate admissions under the sports quota. The marks will be notified on the students’ admission portal, following which they will be given three days to report any grievances.The university this year skipped trials for admissions under the sports and extracurricular activities (ECA) quotas in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, and students will be enrolled only on the basis of merit and participation certificates. In DU colleges, 5% supernumerary seats are reserved under these two categories collectively in each course. In a notification issued on Thursday, the university’s sports council said, “A grievance period of three days, from December 3 to December 5, will be given to the applicants to register their grievances (if any).”Grievances can be sent to the university on email, and applicants are advised not to visit the campus. “The centralized sports merit list for each sport/ game along with the ranking of applicants for sports quota admissions to UG Courses 2020 will be displayed on the DU UG portal after the redressal of the grievances of the applicants,” the notification added.Explaining the reason behind the delay in announcement of the results of sports quota admission even as the academic session for first-year undergraduate students began on November 18, sports council chairperson Pankaj Sinha said, “We have received over 50,000 sports certificates, on the basis of which marks have been allotted. Because of the prevailing pandemic situation, we could not call all our teachers together. They worked in batches.”Sinha said students will be able to take admission immediately after the grievance redressal. “There won’t be multiple lists of selected candidates this year. We will release the marks of all students and according to their ranks and marks, they will be allotted eligible courses and colleges on their admission portal,” he said.Meanwhile, on Thursday, the university released the list of marks allotted to candidates on the basis of their ECA certificates. It has invited students to register their grievances if any before it starts enrolments. “The centralized ECA merit list for each category along with a ranking of candidates for admission to UG courses will be displayed on the DU UG admission portal after the redressal of grievances of the applicants,” read another notification issued by the University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-to-release-lists-for-sports-eca-quota-on-december-2/story-nnyT27IXR26S7piB5gh2pK.html
27-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt asks CPWD to explain violation of tree transplantation norms||The Delhi environment and forest department on Thursday issued a show-cause notice to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), asking the agency to “explain” if it had violated conditions of the permission granted to transplant trees for the new Parliament building project and if so, “in what circumstances”.A Delhi government spokesperson said the department held a meeting on the matter on Thursday. “A show-cause notice has been issued to the CPWD following reports of violation. Necessary action will be taken under the DPTA, in case violations are found,” the spokesperson said. Officials in the department said they have given 15 days to the agency to respond to the notice issued under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act (DPTA). They said It came to their notice that CPWD had started the process of transplanting trees to a site more than 20 km away in NTPC Eco Park in Kalindi Kunj. As per the permission granted by the Delhi government, the agency was supposed to transplant the trees in the Central Vista itself.“Following news reports of violation of the permission given for transplantation, we have issued a show-cause notice to CPWD, asking them to explain, if the terms of the permission issued have been violated, and why the due procedure was not followed for the same. We have sought details of the number of trees, size, age and the kind of species transplanted to the site so far,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be named.The official said a change in a site cannot be done without following due procedure and amounts to a violation of the DPTA, under which the permission was granted. “Once a response is received, officials from the CPWD will be summoned for a hearing in the matter,” the official said.A senior CPWD official countered, “We are sending our reply to the Delhi government’s forest department. There is no violation of law or procedure. We have followed the due process. The site where trees are being transplanted is a government site.”The notification issued by the Delhi government granting the transplantation permission on September 16 stated: “Transplantation of 404 trees, which are standing on the site (plot no. 118, next to existing Parliament building) shall be done by the user agency (CPWD) at eight pockets in the Central Vista, New Delhi ….It shall be ensured by the user agency that all conditions mentioned in the environment clearance shall be followed scrupulously.”According to officials, the 404 trees to be transplanted are 100% native species and range from as young as five to 100 years old. The species include jamun, neem, peepal, amaltas, bargad and gular, among others.Ishwar Singh, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), said if the agency undertaking the work needs to change the sanctioned location for any project, they are required to send an application to the tree officer concerned, who will inspect the site and assess if it is conducive to the survival and growth of the trees being transplanted. “If the due procedure is not followed, it’s a violation of the permission and can cause damage to trees,” Singh said.According to the Delhi government’s transplantation policy, 80% of the transplanted trees must survive after a year. Besides, the compensatory plantation has to be carried out by the agency undertaking the work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-asks-cpwd-to-explain-violation-of-tree-transplantation-norms/story-NaC9dGpXzK5ytbvkUyzVDK.html
27-11-2020||City||From notoriety to glory, a village on border that changed its fate||Once a hotspot of terrorism and infamous for drug peddling activities, Jalaldiwal village in Raikot block is set to restore its glory and change its fate.Villagers are setting an example for the country by showing how communities and NGOs can work together to conserve the environment, help the needy and check the drug menace.Villagers, who formed the social organisation Giani Nihal Singh Sewa Society, have distributed medicines worth Rs 2 lakh to the needy from the village dispensary in the past one year. The dispensary remained open even during the lockdown to cater to the villagers.Besides, the constant persuasion of villagers led to the setting up of a Rs 5-crore power grid in the panchayat land that is expected to resolve the problem of power outage in six nearby villages.In order to protect the environment, 90% of villagers have decided not to set the paddy stubble on fire. Further, they are milking profits as the cooperative milk society of the village has made a whooping annual profit of Rs 8 lakh from the sale of dairy products.Not only this, the village, having a population of over 5,000, is also promoting sports among girls. Currently, over 20 girls, most of them from underprivileged backgrounds, are being trained for free in government-run sports institutions.“The hockey wing for under-14 and under-17 age group was set up in this village in 2013. Since then, the girls’ teams from the village are continuously bagging the first or second position at district-level competitions. Besides, six students have participated in the state-level competition,” said government-appointed hockey coach Baljeet Kaur.Sarpanch of the village Jagjit Singh Jagga said that Jalaldiwal has a glorious history with many freedom fighters hailing from the village. “But during the dark days of militancy, our village was targetted by terrorists. In 1991, a bomb was lobbed in the bank, where the dispensary is now located. One person was killed in the explosion. Besides, cannabis was grown in the vacant land which also attracted drug addicts. This brought a bad name to our village,” said Jagga.He credited homeopath turned progressive farmer Harminder Singh for being a catalyst for change.“Had he not persuaded all of us, this development would not have been possible. Harminder channelised the energies of the youth towards creative works. He formed a society that played a pivotal role in setting up development projects in the village,” said Jagga.Harminder Singh said that bringing social change was an easy task. “Initially, we faced a lot of criticism for our initiatives including management of stubble. There were times when I was told that I am a maniac and youngsters were asked to stay away from me. But, staying positive is the only way forward. Now, things are going in the right direction,” he said.Surinder Singh (75), the founder of Giani Nihal Singh Sewa Society, who is also running a library consisting of over 1,000 books said, “We kept the society apolitical. We have encouraged the participation of youngsters in development activities which proved to be a boon.”Rural medical officer Dr Deepak Bakshi said that the initiative by the villagers also intrigued NRIs to participate. Now, patients from nearby villages are also visiting the dispensary for treatment, he said.Appreciating the efforts of villagers SDM Raikot Himanshu Gupta said that these developmental works would not have been possible without the active participation of villagers, particularly youngsters.“The power grid being set-up in the village will resolve the problem of low voltage and breakdown,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-notoriety-to-glory-a-village-on-border-that-changed-its-fate/story-fBTEppOAC6gvr5mvqphJ1K.html
27-11-2020||Mumbai||Sedition charge: Kangana Ranaut, sister to appear before police in January||After receiving a rap from the Bombay high court, actor Kangana Ranaut and her sister Rangoli Chandel agreed to appear at the Bandra police station where an offence has been registered, charging them with sedition.The counsel for the sisters, advocate Rizwan Siddiquee, assured the bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik that Ranaut and her sister will appear before the investigating officer of the case between 12pm and 2pm on January 8, 2021.They will, however, not be arrested, as the high court has temporarily restrained the police from taking any coercive action against the Bollywood actor and her sister.The statement about their appearance before police came after the judges questioned as to why they did not appear before the police despite summons.Also Read: Kangana Ranaut, sister Rangoli move Bombay HC for quashing of FIR in sedition case“We gather from news reports that now a third summons has been issued to the applicants,” said the bench.Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare responded to a court query on the issue, saying the third summons asked them to appear on November 23, but they haven’t honoured the summons.Siddiquee then pointed out that all the three summons had been answered. He said the actor and her sister could not come to the police station because of a wedding in the family. According to the Covid-19 guidelines, they have to remain isolated for a certain number of days after the wedding, he added.“What is the procedure? What do you mean by you have answered the summons?” the bench asked Siddiquee. “How do you answer summons... by sending letter to police by post. Are police bound to wait for your convenience?” the judges sought to know. “You have to honour the summons,” they insisted.Siddiquee then took specific instructions from Ranaut and Chandel and informed the court that they will return to Mumbai on the first weekend of January 2021 and appear before the investigating officer on January 8.The actor and her sister moved the Bombay high court on Monday, challenging the October 16, 2020 order of a magistrate court in Bandra on the basis of which an FIR was registered against them at Bandra police station for allegedly “creating hatred between Hindus and Muslims, especially those engaged in Bollywood.”The Bandra police on October 17, 2020, booked the sisters under sections 124(A) (sedition - to bring or attempt to bring into hatred or contempt, or excite or attempt to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise), 153(A) (promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion, race, place of birth, language etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 295(A) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class, by insulting it’s religion or religious beliefs) along with section 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.The magisterial order had come on a complaint lodged by casting director Munawarali aka Sahil Sayyed. The magistrate directed the Bandra police to take action under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as he felt that a thorough investigation and search and seizure was necessary in the matter.Sayyed, in his complaint to the magisterial court, had alleged that Ranaut has, through her tweets and television interviews, continuously defamed the Hindi film industry by portraying Bollywood as a hub of nepotism, favouritism, drug addicts, communally biased people, murderers etc.The casting director further alleged that her sister Chandel, who also works as her manager, has also tweeted highly objectionable messages, intended to create communal rift.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sedition-charge-kangana-ranaut-sister-to-appear-b/story-9KS9SY9jFTKjSGTjgKi3aL.html
27-11-2020||World||First Covid-19 case reported in Wuhan, doesn’t mean virus originated here: China||Battling global adversity over the coronavirus and bracing for a WHO inquiry over its origin, China on Friday claimed that just because Covid-19 cases were first reported in Wuhan does not mean the contagion originated from the central Chinese city.Various outlets of the state-run Chinese media have been carrying reports in recent days stating that a number of imported food products from different countries, including a consignment of fish from India, were found to have traces of the Covid-19 alleging that the virus may have entered China through foreign routes.Asked whether that is China’s official view too, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here that “even though China was the first to report coronavirus but doesn’t necessarily mean China is where the virus originated”.“So we believe the origin process is a complex scientific issue which requires joint efforts on COVID-19 cooperation from the scientific community worldwide. Only by doing so we can guard against future risks because origin tracing is an evolving and sustained process that involves many countries and regions,” he said.His response came as the World Health Organisation (WHO) team to investigate the origin of the virus is due to arrive in China, even though Beijing is yet to give a timeline.There is also a sense of relief here that US President Donald Trump who launched a tirade against China over Covid-19 terming it as “China virus” is on his way out. Trump also denounced the WHO alleging that it is virtually controlled by China.Besides halting funding for the WHO, the Trump administration has formally notified the UN of its decision to withdraw the US from the global health body but US President-elect Joe Biden has promised to rejoin it.Since the coronavirus cases emerged in Wuhan in December last year before turning into a global pandemic with the worldwide death toll crossing over 1.4 million.China besides denying the US allegations that the virus emerged from a secretive bio-lab in Wuhan also refuted allegations that it emanated from a wet market in the city from bats or pangolins before infecting humans.The market has been sealed off ever since.In May, the World Health Assembly (WHA), the governing body of the 194-member states of the WHO, approved a resolution to set up an independent inquiry to conduct an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of the international response as well as that of WHO.It also asked the WHO to investigate the “source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population”.China, which has backed the inquiry with a rider that it should commence after the coronavirus was brought under control, said it is getting ready to receive the WHO experts’ team.WHO emergency expert Dr Mike Ryan told the media early this week that his organisation has had assurances from China that an international field trip to investigate the origins of the new coronavirus will be arranged as soon as possible.“We fully expect that we will have a team on the ground,” Ryan was quoted as saying by the state-run CGTN on November 25.Ryan said the Wuhan market, where the virus is reported to have originated, is “likely to have been a point of amplification” of virus transmission, but whether that was by human, animal or environmental spread is not yet known, the report quoted him saying.He said that there had been human cases that preceded that event, according to the CGTN report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-19-case-reported-in-wuhan-doesn-t-mean-virus-originated-here-china/story-lI3D8ZsKtabpe0BD9iWDLO.html
27-11-2020||World||Coronavirus in custody: Alabama ranks ninth for inmate deaths||At the Bibb Correctional Facility in Alabama, the old prison chapel has been turned into a quarantine zone. The sound of coughing is constant. And some people appear afraid to enter the room.An inmate described life in the quarantine to The Associated Press, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. The prison system has enforced the wearing of masks among inmates, but he said crowded dormitories like his offer nowhere to hide from the virus.He said he became so weak he could not stand.“He said they are just laying around like flies,” said Bonita Jackson, whose brother is a Bibb inmate who was hospitalized. “You can’t hardly hear him. He is gasping for breath.”As coronavirus cases skyrocket nationwide, they are also rising again in prisons, which are plagued by close contact and lack of good hygiene. In Alabama prisons alone, 34 people — 32 inmates and two staff members — have died from Covid-19 since the pandemic began. That ranks ninth in the country for the number of Covid-19 deaths per 10,000 inmates, according to figures compiled by The Associated Press and the Marshall Project.Criminal justice reform advocates have called for the release of vulnerable and elderly inmates and an increase in paroles to alleviate extreme overcrowding, as well as the mass testing of inmates.“These numbers are so disturbing, but not at all surprising given the culture and conditions in Alabama prisons. The Department of Corrections has failed to provide for the basic safety of people in its custody for years and Covid has escalated those failures,” said Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice.“What people should understand is that it did not have to be this bad,” she said.The Alabama Department of Corrections said in a statement that is has taken multiple steps to combat the virus behind bars.“As we continue to monitor the impact of Covid-19 in our facilities, the primary goal and concern of the ADOC is protecting the safety, security, and well-being of our inmates and staff,” the prison system said in a statement emailed from spokeswoman Samantha Rose.The agency said each inmate was given four masks, more than 200 floor-mounted hand sanitizer dispensers have been installed, and room foggers, backpack sprayers and other equipment are used to sanitize areas.Asked about the conditions described by inmates and their families, the prison system said the old chapel at Bibb is serving as a quarantine for symptomatic inmates awaiting Covid-19 test results, but the inmates are being closely monitored.“Using these non-traditional housing areas allows the ADOC to use all available space to quarantine positive cases, while protecting other inmates from exposure,” the system said.Since the pandemic began, nearly 800 inmates have tested positive for Covid-19, according to prison system numbers. The pandemic has also taken a toll on those that work in prisons. More than 600 Alabama prison employees have reported testing positive for Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Most inmates and staff have recovered.Most deaths, like those outside prison walls, have occurred in inmates with pre-existing health conditions, the prison system said.State Sen. Cam Ward, who was recently appointed by the governor as the new director of the Parole Bureau, said prison conditions where inmates are often “warehoused” in large rooms is a factor.“When you have 400-something people in one big room, it is going to spread disease,” Ward said.More than 1,000 people age 65 and older are behind bars in state prisons. Ward said older populations in prison include those sentenced for single violent crimes and those sentenced under the state’s habitual offender act before it was changed.“Because of that stringent three strikes, you’re out, you have a lot of people in there life without parole, and that population in there is getting older,” Ward said.Kenneth Glasgow, founder of the Ordinary People Society dedicated to ending mass incarceration, said he is fielding calls from inmate families daily. He agreed with Crowder that the state should have pursued the release of some offenders and increased testing early in the pandemic.“We’ve got family members calling out the yin-yang. They are scared. They say their family member got a two- or three-year sentence for drugs, not a sickness sentence or a death sentence from Covid,” Glasgow said.January Corbitt said she has underlying health conditions and feared catching the coronavirus before her release from Tutwiler Prison for Women this fall. One inmate and two employees at the Wetumpka prison have died from Covid-19.“It’s scary. Right now, it’s scary,” Corbitt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-in-custody-alabama-ranks-ninth-for-inmate-deaths/story-pq50WcCB8dGxepSwwtrt3O.html
27-11-2020||World||Senate control brings new urgency to Georgia turnout drive||In a black face mask and cap, activist Garrett Bess walked up driveway after driveway of million-dollar homes in suburban Atlanta on a recent afternoon, placing a flyer in each door, ringing the bell and stepping away to make a socially distanced pitch to vote for the conservative candidates in Georgia’s pivotal US Senate runoff elections.Bess’ group, Heritage Action for America, plans to knock on half a million doors before the state’s two Jan. 5 contests that will determine whether Democrats or Republicans control the Senate.“Everyone in Georgia knows the candidates,” said Janae Stracke, a colleague of Bess’ who also canvassed the subdivision. “There’s not a lot of convincing to do. They’ve made up their mind. It’s mostly knowing when to vote, how to vote, encouraging them to vote.”This election season, the coronavirus pandemic has upended traditional get-out-the-vote efforts where campaign workers go door to door to encourage people to cast ballots. With people staying at home and limiting contact with outsiders, an extended conversation with a campaign worker who shows up uninvited may actually encourage people to vote for someone else.But it’s a sign of how important the two Senate elections are that both parties and independent advocacy groups are going all in on their in-person get-out-the-vote efforts.After the GOP lost the presidential election in Georgia for the first time in 28 years, conservatives are urging Republicans to get more aggressive with their turnout efforts in the state to match the outreach of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.After Abrams lost the 2018 governor’s race, she devoted herself to voter outreach, convinced that the state was a genuine battleground if Democrats galvanized young voters, minorities and people moving in from other states. She raised millions of dollars to organize and register hundreds of thousands of voters in the state — efforts credited with helping Democrat Joe Biden win Georgia.Republicans have to catch up, Republican operative Karl Rove told Fox News.“Let’s not kid ourselves: This is a real race,” said Rove, who is leading fundraising efforts for the runoffs,The National Republican Senatorial Committee expects to have 1,000 staffers on the ground in Georgia. For comparison, the Republican National Committee had a total of 3,000 paid field staff across the whole country during the presidential race.Democrats carry their own baggage into the runoff. In many parts of the country, they limited face-to-face campaigning ahead of the Nov. 3 election because of the pandemic, arguing that was the responsible thing to do. But that decision was second-guessed in places such as Florida.The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee plans to spend millions on voter registration and turnout efforts.Outside groups are also hitting the ground, and the in-person appeals will be supplemented with a fusillade of phone calls, text messages, mailers and ads aimed at boosting turnout for the races pitting Republican Sen. David Perdue against Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler against Democrat Raphael Warnock.Turnout tends to drop precipitously in runoff contests in Georgia. And activists fear there might be even more of a falloff this time, when the excitement of the Trump-Biden race is over. So getting voters to come back to the polls becomes more of a focus than “trying to find new voters or win over voters who voted for your opponent,” said Charles Bullock, an expert on Southern politics at the University of Georgia.Historically, that drop-off has disproportionately affected Democrats, so the party faces strong headwinds heading into January. The Republican candidate has beaten the Democrat in seven out of eight runoff elections since 1992, including two US Senate races.Democrats have reason for optimism after Biden’s win, but his margin of victory was tiny — less than 13,000 votes of nearly 5 million cast — and it’s been 20 years since the state elected a Democrat to the US Senate.But groups whose efforts tend to favor Democrats are charged. The African Methodist Episcopal Church in Georgia, which has more than 150,000 parishioners in the state, is asking members to call eligible voters in their congregations, encourage them to vote early and assist with rides if they need help getting to the polls on Jan. 5.Bishop Reginald T. Jackson said Black voters are excited and “realize the eyes of the nation are on Georgia.”“They know people are going to be looking to see whether or not Blacks turn out,” he said.The New Georgia Project, a group founded by Abrams, will try to register some of the estimated 35,000 people who have finished their felony sentences and can requalify to vote as well as some of the estimated 23,000 people who are turning 18 before the runoff, Executive Director Nse Ufot said.Ufot said the group also aims to knock on 1 million doors before the runoff, up from 500,000 before the general election, and is training volunteers to take coronavirus precautions.In Milton, Bess and Stracke were in friendly territory. The affluent, mostly white city about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Atlanta showed strong support for President Donald Trump in the November election. The neighborhood they canvassed last week featured manicured lawns and spacious homes set back from the street.“Oh, you have no problem here,” Holly McCormick, 73, told Bess after he rang her doorbell. The flyers he carried warned that Georgia was the country’s “last line of defense from a socialist takeover.”McCormick called the outcome of the presidential race “rigged” though there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, and she said Trump’s claims of illegal votes made her more energized to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in January.“We have to hold the Senate,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-control-brings-new-urgency-to-georgia-turnout-drive/story-NmGGNgcFOGrOag274GpVKK.html

Both leaders welcomed the extensive work that has taken place on this to date and shared an ambition for deepening the economic relationship,” the spokesperson said.According to a readout of the interaction, Johnson “re-emphasised the UK’s commitment” to the wider Indo-Pacific region and looked forward to the first deployment of the HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier group to the region next year.An integrated review of the UK’s foreign policy with a focus on the Indo-Pacific is expected to be released in early 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/let-s-deepen-ties-in-2021-boris-johnson-tells-narendra-modi/story-dKqbENEJS19TigmrabW8NL.html

Iran denies his involvement.Who is the scientist and what is known about him?Western officials and experts believe Fakhrizadeh played a pivotal role in suspected Iranian work in the past to develop the means to assemble a nuclear warhead behind the facade of a declared civilian uranium enrichment programme. Iran denies ever having sought to develop a nuclear weapon.A landmark report by the UN nuclear watchdog in 2011 identified Fakhrizadeh as a central figure in suspected Iranian work to develop technology and skills needed for atomic bombs, and suggested he may still have a role in such activity. Believed to be a senior officer in the elite Revolutionary Guards, Fakhrizadeh was the only Iranian the report identified.What is known about his background?An exiled Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), in May 2011 issued a report with what it said was a photograph of Fakhrizadeh, with dark hair and beard stubble. It was not possible to independently verify the picture.The NCRI said in the report that Fakhrizadeh was born in 1958 in the holy Shi’ite Muslim city of Qom, was a deputy defence minister and a Revolutionary Guards brigadier-general, and holds a nuclear engineering doctorate and taught at Iran’s University of Imam Hussein.What does Iran say?The UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has long wanted to meet Fakhrizadeh as part of a protracted investigation into whether Iran carried out illicit nuclear weapons research. Showing no sign it would heed the request, Iran acknowledged Fakhrizadeh’s existence several years ago but said he was an army officer not involved in the nuclear programme, according to a diplomatic source with knowledge of the matter.He was also named in a 2007 UN resolution on Iran as a person involved in nuclear or ballistic missile activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-the-iranian-scientist-killed-in-tehran/story-leIWchcKko9ShSTGssltdI.html
27-11-2020||World||Iran scientist linked to military nuclear program killed||An Iranian scientist that Israel alleged led the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear program until its disbanding in the early 2000s was killed in a targeted attack that saw gunmen use explosives and machine gun fire Friday, state television said.Israel declined to immediately comment on the killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once called out in a news conference saying: “Remember that name.” Israel has long been suspected of carrying out a series of targeted killings of Iranian nuclear scientists nearly a decade ago.State TV said Fakhrizadeh was attacked by “armed terrorist elements.” He died at a local hospital after doctors and parademics couldn’t revive him.The semiofficial Fars news agency, believed to be close to the country’s Revolutionary Guard, said the attack happened in Absard, a small city just east of the capital, Tehran. It said witnesses heard the sound of an explosion and then machine gun fire. The attack targeted a car that Fakhrizadeh was in, the agency said.Others wounded, including Fakhrizadeh’s bodyguards, also were taken to a local hospital, the agency said.State television on its website later published a photograph of security forces blocking off the road. Photos and video shared online showed a Nissan sedan with bullet holes through windshield and blood pooled on the road.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. However, Iranian media all noted the interest that Netanyahu had previously shown in Fakhrizadeh.Hossein Salami, chief commander of the paramilitary Guard, appeared to acknowledge the attack on Fakhrizadeh.“Assassinating nuclear scientists is the most violent confrontation to prevent us from reaching modern science,” Salami tweeted.Hossein Dehghan, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader and a presidential candidate in Iran’s 2021 election, issued a warning on Twitter.“In the last days of their gambling ally’s political life, the Zionists seek to intensify and increase pressure on Iran to wage a full-blown war,” Dehghan wrote, appearing to refer to U.S. President Donald Trump. “We will descend like lightning on the killers of this oppressed martyr and we will make them regret their actions!”The killing comes just days before the 10-year anniversary of the killing of Iranian nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari, which Tehran also blamed on Israel. Those targeted killings came alongside the so-called Stuxnet virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, that destroyed Iranian centrifuges.The area around Absard is filled with vacation villas for the Iranian elite with a view of Mount Damavand, the highest peak in the country. Roads on Friday, part of the Iranian weekend, were emptier than normal due to a lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic, offering his attackers a chance to strike with fewer people around.Fakhrizadeh led Iran’s so-called “Amad,” or “Hope” program. Israel and the West have alleged it was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon in Iran. Tehran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful.The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran “carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device” in a “structured program” through the end of 2003. That was the Amad program, which included work on the carefully timed high explosives needed to detonate a nuclear bomb.Iran also “conducted computer modeling of a nuclear explosive device” before 2005 and between 2005 and 2009, the IAEA has said. The agency said, however, that those calculations were “incomplete and fragmented.”IAEA inspectors now monitor Iranian nuclear sites as part of Iran’s now-unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.Netanyahu in 2018 gave a presentation in which he unveiled what he described as material stolen by Israel from an Iranian nuclear archive.“A key part of the plan was to form new organizations to continue the work,” Netanyahu alleged in 2018. “This is how Dr. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, head of Project Amad, put it. Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-scientist-linked-to-military-nuclear-program-killed/story-7pud8qCjUWXAig9RzSadkN.html
27-11-2020||World||Thai pro-democracy protesters warn of possible military coup||Pro-democracy demonstrators in Thailand, undeterred by arrest warrants and the possibility of violent attacks, staged another rally on Friday, poking fun at their critics and warning of the possibility of a military coup.The potential for violence was illustrated after their last rally on Wednesday, when in the hours after it ended, two men were reportedly shot and critically wounded. Although the incident remains murky and its connection to the rally unclear, it was a reminder that the student protesters are vulnerable, especially because of the passions they inspire among some of their opponents.The protest movement’s core demands are for Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and his government to step down, the constitution to be amended to be more democratic, and the monarchy to be reformed to make it more accountable.Their demand concerning the monarchy is the most controversial and earns them the most enemies. The royal institution by law and tradition is virtually untouchable, and regarded by many as the bedrock of national identity. The military has declared defense of the monarchy to be among its foremost duties.The protest leaders believe that King Maha Vajiralongkorn holds more power than is appropriate under a constitutional monarchy, and have made that the centerpiece of their campaigning in recent weeks. Although any criticism of the monarchy used to be taboo, speeches at the rallies — as well as signs and chants __ include caustic words about the king and the palace.In response, Thai authorities this past week escalated their legal battle against protest leaders, charging 12 of them with violating a harsh law against defaming the monarchy. The lese majeste law carries a penalty of three to 15 years’ imprisonment, but has not been used for the past three years.Historically, defending the monarchy has been abused for political reasons. It has also triggered violence, most notably in 1976, when it led to the killings of dozens of students at a university protest against the return from exile of an ousted military dictator. That event was the trigger for a coup, and since then Thailand has had successful coups in 1977, 1991, 2006 and 2014.There is concern that if the government feels it cannot control the protests, which show little sign of abating, it may impose martial law or be ousted by the army in a coup.Some speakers on Friday evening urged the crowd to take measures to resist any coup that might be launched.Resisting any coup attempt was the nominal theme of the rally, which began in a festival-like atmosphere that has marked many of the protest events. Oversized inflatable yellow rubber ducks that became icons of the movement after they were used as shields against police water cannons were joined by balloons in the image of silvery space aliens. The balloons are displayed to mock accusations that foreigners — “aliens” — fund and direct the protest movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-pro-democracy-protesters-warn-of-possible-military-coup/story-ZoutuYEH7j0nV7Z1bPZqlN.html
27-11-2020||World||New cardinals quarantine in pope’s hotel ahead of consistory||The Vatican’s Santa Marta hotel was built to sequester cardinals during papal elections. It’s now sequestering soon-to-be cardinals in town for this weekend’s ceremony to get their red hats: A handful are in protective coronavirus quarantine, confined to their rooms on Vatican orders and getting meals delivered to their doors.The 10-day quarantines, with Covid-19 tests administered at the start and finish, are just one example of how Saturday’s ceremony to elevate new cardinals is like nothing the Holy See has ever seen.“They told me it would be like this but I didn’t think it would be so strict!” marveled Cardinal-designate Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel, the retired archbishop of Chiapas, Mexico.During a Zoom call with The Associated Press from his hotel room, Esquivel said he had thought there might be some exceptions to the lockdown for new cardinals. “No! Here, it doesn’t matter if you’re a cardinal or a pope. The virus doesn’t respect anyone,” he said.Pope Francis on Saturday will elevate 13 clerics to the College of Cardinals, the elite group of red-robed churchmen whose primary task is to elect a new pope. It’s the seventh time Francis has named a new batch of cardinals since his election in 2013, and his imprint is increasingly shifting the balance of power away from Europe and toward the developing world.The Vatican has said two new cardinals won’t make it to Rome for the ceremony, known as a consistory, because of Covid-19 and travel concerns: The Vatican’s ambassador to Brunei, Cardinal-designate Cornelius Sim, and the archbishop of Capiz, Philippines, Cardinal-designate Jose Advincula.The Vatican is arranging for them, and any of the cardinals who might not make it, to participate in the ceremony remotely from their homes. They’ll get their three-pointed “biretta” hats from a Vatican ambassador or another envoy.For those who are participating in person, the public health crisis has posed an unusual set of challenges. Italy, where the pandemic erupted in late February, is currently in the throes of a second wave. The Vatican itself has returned to a modified lockdown in recent weeks, with the Vatican Museums shuttered and a dozen Swiss Guards testing positive.Francis, 83, has been criticized for his rather lax mask usage, but he has abided by social distancing measures to a degree. He too lives at Santa Marta, where there has been at least one positive case reported in recent months.Usually, consistories are full of parties and crowds: Cardinals come to town with family, friends and sometimes benefactors and parishioners who get to see the new “princes of the church” up close and then attend receptions and dinners in their honour. Under normal circumstances, the consistory would be followed by “courtesy visits,” where the new cardinals greet well-wishers and the general public from the grandeur of their own reception rooms in the Apostolic Palace or Vatican auditorium.This year, there will be no courtesy visits, and each cardinal has a 10-person limit for guests. For Esquivel, no one other than his secretary travelled with him from Mexico, so he’s inviting some priests from the residence where Mexican clergy working or studying in Rome live.“We don’t have contact with practically anyone. It’s total isolation, but it’s necessary,” he said.Esquivel is one of four cardinals over age 80 who are joining the college as honorary members, named by Francis to recognize their lifetime of service to the church. The other nine are under age 80 and eligible to vote in a conclave to eventually choose Francis’ successor.History’s first Latin American pope has long sought to name cardinals from the “peripheries,” to show the universal nature of the church and boost small communities, where Catholics are a minority, with high-profile leaders.As of Saturday, there will be 128 voting-age cardinals, 42% from Europe. The Pew Research Center notes that in 2013 Europeans made up 52% of the voting-age block, evidence of Francis’ effort to decrease the strength of Europeans as a voting bloc and give greater visibility to church leaders from Asia, Africa and the Americas.Among the new voting age cardinals is the first African-American, Cardinal-designate Wilton Gregory, archbishop of Washington, D.C.He too is concluding his quarantine in the Santa Marta hotel, where he said his meals are left on a tray outside his door. Gregory said that while he was unable to go out, at least his new red cassock was delivered from Rome’s famous clerical haberdasher, Gammarelli.In a Zoom call, Gregory explained that a US-based ecclesiastical tailor took his measurements while he was still in Washington and sent them to Gammarelli, which then made the robes to order and sent them to Santa Marta.“I have them now. They fit!” he said.Fashion aside, Gregory said he was humbled by Francis’ decision to make him a cardinal and said he would return to a United States still in the throes of the pandemic with hope that vaccines against the virus will soon work.“I hope we can use them effectively to protect people and ... once this pandemic is brought under control, to face the future with hope,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-cardinals-quarantine-in-pope-s-hotel-ahead-of-consistory/story-BcISwdfquOqH6e6Had4a9O.html
27-11-2020||World||Iraq: Unmasked demonstrators take to the streets in support of radical cleric||Thousands of Iraqis — most of them not wearing protective masks — took to the streets in Baghdad on Friday in a show of support for a radical cleric ahead of elections next year, stirring fears of a spike in coronavirus cases.Supporters congregated in the capital’s Tahrir Square, once the epicentre of mass anti-government protests, to show their support for Moqtada al-Sadr, who leads a powerful political bloc, ahead of federal elections slated for next June.Most of al-Sadr’s followers stood unmasked in the square, chanting: “Yes, yes for our leader,” in support of the firebrand cleric as Iraq remains a high-risk country for coronavirus infection. The crowd then stood side-by-side for Friday prayers at noon.More than 12,000 people have died of the virus in Iraq amid 544,000 confirmed cases, according to Health Ministry figures. Daily infection rates average 2,400 cases per day, but health workers say the number may be higher as many Iraqis with symptoms choose to stay home and avoid hospitals to get tested.Iraq has the second highest outbreak and number of deaths in the region after Iran.Al-Sadr leads the Sairoon political bloc, which holds the majority in parliament. He has taken steps in preparation for elections scheduled for June next year. His followers called for a demonstration in support of the leader’s call for mass participation in the vote.“The Iraqi people and al-Sadr’s followers will have one saying, and that is: Yes yes for Iraq,” said Ibrahim al-Jabiri, director of al-Sadr’s office north of Baghdad.Observers consider the protest as a show of mettle by al-Sadr meant to send a message to other political blocs that on Iraq’s streets, the cleric still has clout.Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi called for elections to take place next June, a year earlier than expected. That was a key demand of anti-government protesters who paralysed Iraq’s streets when tens of thousands demonstrated last October.The elections will take place under a new law approved by lawmakers this year that theoretically will enable more independent candidates to run. Iraq’s electoral commission has said it is prepared to hold early elections on time if the government allocates a budget for the vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-unmasked-demonstrators-take-to-the-streets-in-support-of-radical-cleric/story-f3YV9sefmQb7KtZrknRFWJ.html
27-11-2020||World||US colleges mull new virus protocols for students’ return||St. Michael’s College managed to keep coronavirus cases at bay for almost two months this fall with students tested upon arrival and once every three weeks.But in mid-October, cases at the small Vermont school started to climb. The outbreak was linked to an ice rink more than 40 miles (64 kilometers) away. The liberal arts college shifted to all-remote learning and closed the campus to visitors. By November, a total of 76 of the roughly 1,600 students had tested positive, the school said.“It was very concerning to experience the spike in cases that we did after so many weeks of surveillance tests with no positives,” President Lorraine Sterritt said by email.When students come back for the spring semester, St. Michael’s will begin testing them weekly. The college may also require students to move to a separate residence hall when they are told to quarantine.The coronavirus presented huge challenges for the fall semester for US colleges that opened the academic year with in-person learning, including some that took a battering from outbreaks. Those not joining the growing number that will offer only virtual learning are assessing how they would bring students back after the winter holidays while the country faces crushing rates of virus infections.Schools that are bringing students back are adjusting testing protocols, introducing new screenings, and eliminating spring breaks to discourage students from traveling to help keep campuses open.Other schools big and small think it’s still possible to keep a pandemic-era residential college experience.California Polytechnical University in San Luis Obispo plans to add saliva testing in the winter quarter that will be processed on campus and will allow it “to test many more people much more quickly — our current estimate is 4,000 tests per day by mid-January,” President Jeffrey Armstrong said in a campus-wide message this month.In the spring semester, Colby College in Maine wants to add some rapid antigen tests to twice-weekly tests for students, faculty and staff. It also did away with the one-week spring break replacing it with two mini-breaks in March and April.“We’ll program stuff for the campus so people get a break,” Chief Financial Officer Douglas Terp said.More schools are expected to require students get tested before they come to campus rather than when they arrive, as some institutions did before the fall semester, said Barbara Mistick, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.Institutions like Syracuse University in New York abandoned in-person learning earlier than planned this fall but are planning on a resumption of campus life next semester.But a growing number of schools will stick with virtual instruction through the spring.“We are seeing a rapid rise in colleges and universities announcing they will move to remote learning for the remainder of this semester and for the spring,” said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities.George Washington University in Washington, D.C., for one, announced early last month it will continue most of its classes virtually.Student cooperation with protocols helped to keep the number of coronavirus cases low at the University of Vermont’s campus in the small city of Burlington, President Suresh Garimella said.On a recent day, students wearing masks streamed through a tent outside the student center where they are required to be tested weekly. They stayed apart, stopped at a station to sanitize their hands and blow their nose and then proceeded into the indoor testing center.“It’s part of my routine,” said sophomore Brian Boyle of the testing.The school received federal coronavirus relief funding for virus-related expenses like testing, but Garimella estimates it will spend an additional $10 million to $15 million.There are also a lot of precautions in place, rules for social distancing and the maximum number of people in a group, Boyle said. It’s harder to get together with people socially, but he said students can find ways to go about it and still follow the rules and be safe.“You know being outside in small groups and stuff,” he said.As cases rose in Vermont and at UVM in November, though, he said he was becoming a bit concerned about whether the spring semester will be in-person.“My biggest concern is probably that people will become more relaxed with their individual social distancing/quarantining measures over winter break,” he said by email. “I can only hope that people will remember how important these safety measures are, and will continue to practice them for the sake of their health and for the sake of our education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-colleges-mull-new-virus-protocols-for-students-return/story-5y3n6hqH0SCI9L5QPhslmN.html
27-11-2020||World||Covid-19: Hospitals race to set vaccine priorities for healthcare workers||Large hospital systems are grappling with how best to decide which health-care workers will be vaccinated first for Covid-19, a daunting task when it’s unclear which shots they’ll get, how many and when they’ll arrive.The first Covid-19 vaccine could be cleared for US use as soon as next month, with Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s candidate already under review and Moderna Inc.’s shot not far behind. Federal officials, meanwhile, have signaled that health-care workers and older Americans at high risk should be vaccinated as step one in what could set off months of fraught decisions involving other key priority groups.But following those initial guidelines could prove difficult. With 21 million health-care workers in the US, there almost certainly won’t be enough doses to reach them all at once. That’s forcing hospitals to categorize their workers based on best-guess distribution estimates, a task made even more complex for some systems by a patchwork state-by-state approach.Minnesota’s Allina Health system, which employs 15,600 workers who have direct contact with patients in Minnesota and Wisconsin, is estimating it could get 3,000 to 4,000 doses initially. The plan: Prioritize those that interact directly with coronavirus patients by listing each worker by their job type and the units they work in.“We’re looking at all employees, where they work, what their roles are and what their exposure risk is,” said Ryan Else, a doctor who is overseeing the coronavirus response in Allina Health’s hospitals.Health systems that operate across state lines face an even bigger challenge. While states are taking cues from federal guidelines, they are developing their own priority lists, creating a situation where some employees in one state might get vaccinated before their peers in another.“How fair does that feel to people in the same system?” said Amy Compton-Phillips, a doctor and chief clinical officer at Providence, which operates 51 hospitals, as well clinics and medical offices across seven states.Like Allina, Providence also plans to vaccinate workers based on their roles in an attempt at fairness. The health system will notify workers when it’s their turn to get vaccinated. It is also creating an appeal process if people think groups were misclassified.“When things are in short supply, you make really hard decisions. They don’t feel good,” Compton-Phillips said.Federal officials plan to initially send 6.4 million doses across the country, according to Gus Perna, Operation Warp Speed’s chief operating officer. More doses will then be sent out on a weekly basis with the goal of distributing 40 million doses by the end of the year, Perna said on a call with reporters Tuesday.Shipments will be divvied up across states based on the size of their adult populations, and not in response to any virus surges, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on the call.“We wanted to keep this simple, first because we’re seeing nationwide spread and susceptibility to the disease,” Azar said. “But also, once we pass through these initial tranches where we’re in much more of a scarcity situation, we’re eventually going to get to the point where it would need to be per capita. So instead of having multiple methodologies, we thought it best to keep it simple.”Some health systems are taking a more granular approach in preparing for use of the shots.Advocate Aurora Health Inc., with 26 hospitals and even more clinics and doctors across Illinois and Wisconsin, is identifying workers at greatest risk of severe illness, anticipating it will not receive enough doses to cover employees evenly. That means factoring in details like how prevalent the coronavirus is in a particular community, as well as employees’ risk factors, said Robert Citronberg, a doctor and executive medical director of infectious disease and prevention.“We want to target as best as possible the people who are most likely to get severely ill from Covid, and we know those are older people, people with underlying medical conditions,” Citronberg said.New York’s Northwell Health, with 23 hospitals, has already compiled a spreadsheet of its 74,000 workers that categorizes them by their risk of catching the novel coronavirus on the job, according to Mark Jarrett, who is a doctor and the system’s chief quality officer.Virus PrevalenceNorthwell’s calculation weighs how much employees interact with infected patients and, like Advocate Aurora, how prevalent the virus is in the community. That second data point could change at times, resulting in people working in areas with more spread being vaccinated first.And Jarrett brings another issue to the table. He’s worried less about people clamoring for a vaccine and more about workers not wanting one, a fear other hospital executives across the country echoed.Health systems already had to contend with anti-vaccination movements when concerns about the quick speed of Covid-19 vaccine development further spooked workers, Providence’s Compton-Phillips said.Allison Suttle, a doctor and chief medical officer of Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based Sanford Health, hopes clinical trial data will reassure the system’s workers. Internal surveys found more people said they would take a Covid-19 vaccine after Pfizer and Moderna released early results showing their candidates were each around 95% effective.Cautiously Optimistic“I’m optimistic, cautiously optimistic, and proud of our health-care workers that they’re willing to jump up, stick out their shoulder and get the vaccine,” Suttle said.If and when the Food and Drug Administration authorizes vaccine candidates, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make its final recommendations for whom to vaccinate. Members of the CDC’s immunization committee will review the data for clues on whether the formulas work better in some groups than others.In the meantime, health systems will continue preparing as best they can. When asked whether Northwell knows how many doses it will receive, Jarrett laughed.“Nope,” he answered. Any estimates are likely to change, Jarrett said, and even the smallest of fluctuations could make a big difference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-hospitals-race-to-set-vaccine-priorities-for-healthcare-workers/story-xOZMUjsivq4Okg5cCWcnAO.html

Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, reportedly said that the US’ attempts to give legitimacy to the “illegal Israeli settlements” contradicts the UN Charter and the Security Council’s resolutions.“We see this as another manifestation of the United States’ blatantly disdainful attitude to the globally recognized international legal principles of the Mideastern settlement,” Zakharova was quoted as saying by ANI .Here’s what you need to know about all US decisions favouring Israel:The Trump administration has been aggressive about its policy towards Israel by taking several decisions that have been considered as against Palestinian interests. Last year, the United States recognised Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a disputed region occupied by Israel since 1967.The United States also announced a reversal of its decades-long policy on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, calling the occupation not necessarily a violation of international law. Pompeo said that the US no longer agrees with the 1978 State Department legal opinion that held the occupied territories “inconsistent with international law”.Also Read | Pompeo touts Iran policy in Gulf ahead of Biden presidencyThe Trump administration went on to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved its embassy from Tel Aviv from the holy city. “Basing policy on reality, we recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and we recognised Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights,” Pompeo told a Senate committee in 2019.The US also brokered a deal for the normalisation of ties between Israel and the UAE. It was touted as a historic agreement since demands for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine issue was considered as a major obstacle to the normalisation of ties.Recently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US ambassador David Friedman also signed amended scientific cooperation agreements that effectively lifted the US’ ban on funding scientific research projects in the West Bank and Golan Heights.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-slams-pompeo-s-visit-to-golan-heights-know-about-all-us-decisions-favouring-israel/story-fXOsnWn3smRAjoNJHlnycL.html
27-11-2020||World||Biden’s win hides a dire warning for Democrats in rural US||Democrats once dominated Koochiching County in the blue-collar Iron Range of northern Minnesota. But in this month’s presidential election, President Donald Trump won it with 60% of the vote.That’s not because voters there are suddenly shifting to the right, said Tom Bakk, who represents the area in the state Senate. It’s because, he said, Democrats have steadily moved too far to the left for many rural voters.“We’ve got to see if we can get the Democratic Party to moderate and accept the fact that rural Minnesota is not getting more conservative,” said Bakk, who announced last week that he would become an independent after serving 25 years as a Democrat. “It’s that you guys are leaving them behind.”While Democrats powered through cities and suburbs to reclaim the White House, the party slid further behind in huge rural swaths of northern battlegrounds. The party lost House seats in the Midwest, and Democratic challengers in Iowa, Kansas, Montana and North Carolina Senate races, all once viewed as serious threats to Republican incumbents, fell, some of them hard.Though Democrats’ rural woes aren’t new, they now heap pressure on Biden to begin reversing the trend. Failure to do so endangers goals such as curbing climate change and winning a Senate majority, especially with GOP Senate seats in Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin up in 2022.“The pressure for Democrats has to be on conveying an economic message for rural America,” said Iowa Democrat John Norris, a former candidate for governor. “We have a great one to convey, but we haven’t put enough emphasis on it.”It has become a defining dynamic in almost every state where Democrats dominate urban areas and, for at least two elections, have clear momentum in the suburbs.While Trump sought to squeeze more out of his mostly white, working-class base, he made little ground in places he barely won or lost in 2016, and slid in suburbs across the industrial and agricultural north. Instead, he supercharged his focus on places he won big last times.Trump lost Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, after winning all three in 2016. But he won at least 60% of the vote in 126 counties in the three — 14 more than in 2016, according to Associated Press and state elections data. All of those counties are lightly populated.Perhaps more telling, Trump increased his winning percentages in 90% of the counties where he reached the 60% mark in those three states four years ago. That includes all 24 counties where he won at least 70% of the vote last time, even while Biden was vastly outspending Trump on advertising.The rural runaway was even greater in Iowa and Ohio, where polls late in October gave Biden’s campaign hopes of a close race or narrow win, only to see him lose them by the same margins Clinton did.Trump’s greater dominance in rural Ohio surprised even Republican strategists. In Ohio’s 6th Congressional District, 18 counties that hug the Pennsylvania border and Ohio River, Trump improved from 64% of the vote to more than 66%.“I’ll be the first to say I was doubtful President Trump could exceed what he did in 2016,” said Ryan Steubenrauch, a senior adviser to 6th District Republican Rep. Bill Johnson.Though Biden fulfilled Democrats’ long-sought goal of carrying Georgia and Arizona, albeit narrowly, it wasn’t because he concentrated on reaching beyond their metro hubs, said Steve Jarding, a veteran Democratic strategist who has long argued for greater party engagement in rural America.“Democrats have found a way to win in the country, at least they believe this to be the case, by not concentrating much in big parts of the middle of the country,” he said. “That’s a scary proposition.”Jarding worries that by winning Arizona, Georgia and the northern swing states without addressing the rural economy, Democrats might believe the states are now trending their way as the result of favorable population and demographic shifts.“We didn’t win Georgia because we had a great message to rural Georgians,” said Jarding, who helped Mark Warner win the Virginia governorship in 2001 by advising him to campaign aggressively far from the booming Washington, D.C., suburbs. “If Democrats say, look, we got into Georgia and we won it without having to talk about rural issues, they are dead wrong. It will flip back.”In clinging to their majority, House Democrats lost rural seats, notably the one held for 30 years by Rep. Collin Peterson in western Minnesota. The setbacks prompted accusations from moderates that the party’s prominent liberals, such as New York Rep. Alexandra Ocasio Cortez, had become representative of a party foreign to America’s farming and small manufacturing towns.“I would argue everyone talks about the big tent. It’s not as big as it used to be,” Minnesota’s Bakk said.Biden campaigned little in person, even less in rural areas. Trump, on the other hand, whipped up enthusiasm at rallies in places like Wausau, Wisconsin, in the state’s rural north where he dominated, as well as Saginaw in Mid Michigan, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania, surrounded by counties he carried by more than 70%, even 80%.Democrats also spent little time and money combatting Trump’s attacks.Unanswered, Trump’s claims that Biden and other Democrats are proponents of socialism and eliminating police departments, as unfounded as they were, resonated in small towns, according to VoteCast, an Associated Press survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago.“We have to address this in a really more aggressive way,” said veteran Democratic strategist James Carville, especially Trump’s claims that Democrats are anti-police. “There were some serious kind of headwinds there.”Democrats need to not just defend against attacks but recruit more candidates among rural Americans and argue that progressive policy is to their advantage.“We obviously have a brand problem in rural America,” said former North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat defeated in 2018. “But if you want to be an alternative, you can’t go there empty-handed.”Heitkamp credits Biden for including specifically rural provisions in his policy plans, such as a transportation component in his health care proposal, considering many people in sparsely populated areas must travel some distance to see a doctor.For now, Democrats’ future in rural America rests largely on how Biden is viewed there, Heitkamp said.“A good way to start out would be to make sure in his inaugural speech and state of the union, he talks about rural America,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-s-win-hides-a-dire-warning-for-democrats-in-rural-us/story-twPwz6c65T2yjlqUp3rXRO.html
27-11-2020||World||Covid-19: Death toll of UK Indians crosses 1,000||The death toll from Covid-19 of patients categorised as ‘Indian’ in official figures crossed the grim milestone of 1,000 on Friday, making the community the worst-hit among non-whites and complementing studies that showed non-whites have been disproportionately hit by the virus.As of Thursday evening, 1,029 Indians had passed away in England’s hospitals and care homes, according to the National Health Service (NHS). The Indian ethnic group is followed by Pakistanis, with 889 deaths, and Caribbean ethnicity with 739 deaths.Funeral companies catering to the Indian and Asian communities have been busier than ever this year, particularly in towns and areas such as Leicester, Birmingham, Manchester, Southall, Brent and Harrow.Those from the Indian community who succumbed to the virus include several doctors, nurses and pharmacists on the frontline of treatment. The largest number of health professionals in the NHS, after those who trained in the UK and EU, are from India, besides such UK-trained personnel of Indian origin.Health professionals of Indian heritage who passed away include Jitendra Kumar Rathod, Manjeet Singh Riyat, Krishan Arora, Rajesh Kalraiya, Pooja Sharma, Jayesh Patel, Vivek Sharma, Kamlesh Kumar Masson, Amarante Dias, Sophie Fagan, Hamza Pacheeri and Amrik Bamotra.According to Kamlesh Khunti, a medical expert at the University of Leicester, the reasons Indian and other non-white people figure more in the Covid-19 figures, despite accounting for only 14% of the UK population, include lower socioeconomic backgrounds, work in public-facing occupations, holding different cultural beliefs and behaviours or being at high risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.Several research reports published this year concluded that non-white communities have been disproportionately affected by the virus. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, Other Asian, Black Caribbean and Other Black ethnicity have between 10 and 50% higher risk of death when compared to White British, according to a report of Public Health England.It said: “When compared to previous years, we also found a particularly high increase in all cause deaths among those born outside the UK and Ireland; those in a range of caring occupations including social care and nursing auxiliaries and assistants; those who drive passengers in road vehicles for a living including taxi and minicab drivers and chauffeurs; those working as security guards and related occupations; and those in care homes”.A report by think-tank Runnymede Trust found that, besides structural inequalities, non-white groups are at greater risk from Covid-19 for various reasons.They are more likely to be working outside their home, using public transport, working in key worker roles, and living in multigenerational, overcrowded housing and therefore less able to self-isolate and shield from the virus, it said.They are also less likely to be rotected with personal protective equipment, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-death-toll-of-uk-indians-crosses-1-000/story-fWYrv1PAOI5cgWKvwJOysL.html
27-11-2020||World||For Big Tech, Biden brings a new era but no ease in scrutiny||The Obama-Biden administration was a charmed era for America’s tech companies — a moment when they were lionized as innovators, hailed as job creators and largely left alone.Now Joe Biden is coming back, this time as president. But times have changed. The halcyon days of an adoring Washington are unlikely to return when Biden takes the oath of office in January, with mounting legislative and regulatory challenges to the industry — including stronger enforcement of antitrust laws — nearly certain to outlast the tenure of President Donald Trump.“The techlash is in full force,” said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and co-director of its High Tech Law Institute.In the years since Barack Obama and Biden left the White House, the tech industry’s political fortunes have flipped. Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have come under scrutiny from Congress, federal regulators, state attorneys general and European authorities. Twitter has found itself in frequent run-ins with lawmakers over its policies for moderating content on its platform. And companies have seen their political support in Congress erode.Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle champion stronger oversight of the industry, arguing its massive market power is out of control, crushing smaller competitors and endangering consumers’ privacy. They say the companies hide behind a legal shield to allow false information to flourish on their social media networks or to entrench bias.In steps Biden, who may aim to take a bite out of the dominance of Big Tech and may welcome an opportunity to work with the opposing side to curb the power of a common adversary.As a presidential contender, Biden said the breakup of big tech companies should be considered. Dismantling the tech giants is “something we should take a really hard look at,” he told The Associated Press in an interview. He said he wants to see quickly crimped the social media companies’ long-held legal protections for speech on their platforms. And he singled out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for scorn, calling him “a real problem.”The Biden administration is also expected to press forward with the Trump Justice Department’s new antitrust lawsuit against Google, though its shape likely could be changed.But if Biden decides to pursue major legislation to overhaul the laws governing tech competition, he’ll have to navigate a tricky congressional and political landscape.Democratic lawmakers in the House, after a sweeping investigation by a Judiciary Committee panel, called last month for Congress to rein in Big Tech, possibly forcing the giants to break up their businesses while making it harder for them to acquire others and imposing new rules to safeguard competition.Those kinds of mandated breakups through a legislative overhaul would be a radical step for Congress to take and could be a bridge too far for most Republicans.Though it hasn’t been settled, Biden faces the possibility of becoming the first Democrat in modern history to take office without his party controlling Congress. Republicans would retain control of the Senate by winning one of two runoff elections in Georgia in January. Democrats have already won the House.Republican control of the Senate would force Biden to curb his ambitions and pursue a different legislative agenda, one rooted in bipartisanship. Legislation on the tech industry could be one area of possible agreement.“Biden’s strength as a senator was exactly trying to broker those kinds of deals,” noted Santa Clara University’s Goldman.But what may emerge in the end is a heavy reliance on executive power through more vigorous enforcement of existing antitrust laws, said Jerry Ellig, a former government official and professor at George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center. Republican lawmakers are likely to hang together in opposing fundamental changes to the tech industry, which also could affect smaller companies, while Democrats could be pulled in different directions.The Justice Department’s landmark suit last month accused Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to boost profits — the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft over 20 years ago.Then there’s the issue of legal protection for speech on the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter and Google: another area of agreement between the two parties, though for different reasons.Momentum has built in Congress toward curbing some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Republicans accuse the companies of anti-conservative bias that erases those viewpoints on social media while allowing what they describe as extreme leftist and anti-American rhetoric to thrive.Democrats’ concern focuses on hate speech and conspiracy theories that have sometimes incited physical violence and on the amplification on tech platforms of falsehoods from Trump — most notably allegations of fraud in ballot counting in the recent election.The social media companies’ CEOs rebuffed accusations of anti-conservative bias at a Senate hearing last month and promised to aggressively defend their platforms from being used to sow chaos in the Nov. 3 election.Critics in both political parties say the immunity under Section 230 of a 1996 telecoms law enables the social media companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.Biden has said that Section 230 “immediately should be revoked.”Given the landscape in Congress and the factions of views on material seen by nearly everyone on the planet, quick action may be difficult.If consensus legislation does emerge, suggests George Washington’s Ellig, “They’ll make it vague enough so everyone can claim victory.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-big-tech-biden-brings-a-new-era-but-no-ease-in-scrutiny/story-RGrjobj9UuixJrKzpK1l1K.html
27-11-2020||World||Iran shuts govt offices, tightening virus restrictions||Iran on Friday announced that all government offices will effectively close and operate with only essential staff, further tightening coronavirus measures as the country struggles to contain its most widespread wave of infection yet.Starting this Saturday — the first day of Iran’s workweek — state TV said “only those employees who need to be present will be at work” in government offices. Managers will make the call on who must still come to work.The report did not specify how long the closures would last, but asked Iranians to postpone any planned visits to government offices.Infections have soared in recent months, and on Friday, Iran again set a record for new virus cases in a single day with 14,051 cases, bringing the total to 922,397.Iran has also recorded more than 400 daily virus deaths since last Saturday, the same day new tightened restrictions went into effect. Health Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said the death toll on Friday reached 47,095, after 406 people died since Thursday.Since Saturday, some government offices and organizations had closed or began working with less than 30% of their employees, while banks, post offices, communications and other utilities worked with half their staff.Those new lockdown measures also included shuttering most businesses, shops, malls, and restaurants, and are set to last two weeks.Iran’s government had recently resisted shutting down the country in an attempt to salvage an economy cratered by unprecedented American sanctions, which effectively bar Iran from selling its oil internationally. The Trump administration reimposed sanctions in 2018 after withdrawing from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers.Earlier this month, authorities ordered a month-long nightly curfew for businesses in Tehran and 30 other major cities and towns, asking nonessential shops to keep their workers home. Still, enforcement in the sprawling metropolis remains a challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-shuts-govt-offices-tightening-virus-restrictions/story-VMHA8HohyRWwNHKBP35rFM.html
27-11-2020||World||Amid test data doubts, UK seeks temporary supply of AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine||The Boris Johnson government has requested the UK’s medicines regulator assess the suitability of Oxford/AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine for temporary supply, as soon as the company submits the necessary safety, quality and efficacy data, amid doubts regarding its trial results.The UK will be one of the first countries in the world to receive the vaccine, if authorised, with AstraZeneca expecting to have up to 4 million doses ready by the end of the year and 40mn by the end of March 2021, the Department of Health and Social Care said in a release.The UK was the first country in the world to sign an agreement with Oxford University/AstraZeneca, securing access to 100 mn doses of the vaccine, it added.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confirmed the government request and said public safety “will always come first.”Health secretary Matt Hancock said: “We have formally asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, to understand the data and determine whether it meets rigorous safety standards. This letter is an important step towards deploying a vaccine as quickly as safely possible”.The letter asks MHRA to assess the vaccine for authorisation under Regulation 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations, which enables the temporary supply of medicines to be authorised in response to a public health need.The MHRA has already started a rolling review to determine whether the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine meets its strict standards of safety, efficacy and quality. Once the MHRA receives the full data from the company, its team of scientists and clinicians will progress its assessment.The UK government has already formally asked the MHRA to assess the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for its suitability for authorisation under Regulation 174.The UK has so far secured early access to 355mn doses of seven of the most promising vaccine candidates, including: Pfizer/BioNTech (for 40mn doses), Oxford/AstraZeneca (100mn), Moderna (5mn), GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur (60mn), Novavax (60mn), Janssen (30mn) and Valneva (60mn).Johnson on Thursday evening sounded a note of caution on relaxations announced for Christmas, asking Britons to follow guidelines strictly to prevent another spike in new cases and potentially another lockdown in early 2021. The current lockdown in England is to end on December 2, with the country moving to the earlier 3-tier alert system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-test-data-doubts-uk-seeks-temporary-supply-of-astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine/story-jo01Dj32BIhe3CYFxGOsvJ.html
27-11-2020||World||Facebook’s AI Mistakenly Bans Ads for Struggling Businesses||New York-based businesswoman Ruth Harrigan usually sells her honey and beeswax products in souvenir shops. But with Covid-19 pausing tourism, she’s been almost entirely dependent on Facebook ads to drive online sales. On Nov. 11, this new financial lifeline was abruptly cut when the social media company blocked her HoneyGramz ad account for violating its policies. She couldn’t imagine what about her tiny honey-filled gifts would have triggered the problem.Friends told Harrigan to just wait a couple of days and the problem might resolve itself. She waited, until she lost an estimated $5,000 in revenue.“I was getting a little anxious thinking, ‘Oh my God, Black Friday is around the corner, most of my sales for the year happen in November and December and that’s it,’” she explained. “I said, ‘If I’m shut down any longer than this, it’ll cripple me.’”Harrigan is one of millions of small business advertisers who have come to rely on Facebook Inc. because the coronavirus has shut down many traditional retail channels. The social media giant has provided new sales opportunities for these entrepreneurs, but also exposed them to the company’s misfiring content-moderation software, limited options for customer support and lack of transparency about how to fix problems.Facebook’s human moderators have focused on election and Covid-19 misinformation this year, so the company has leaned more on artificial intelligence algorithms to monitor other areas of the platform. That’s left many small businesses caught in Facebook’s automated filters, unable to advertise through the service and frustrated because they don’t know why.The same weekend Harrigan’s account went down, Ivonne Sanchez, who runs a permanent makeup clinic in Ottawa, found her ads were blocked too, for what Facebook said was a “policy violation.” Her business, which had to shut down between March and June for the pandemic, was relying on Facebook to recover financially. The account was restored the next day without explanation, but “in the middle of a crucial shopping season, it left us shaken,” she said. “This experience makes us very nervous about investing dollars into a system that is operated seemingly by a bot.”Even if an ad account gets restored, businesses lose crucial momentum. Facebook’s advertising algorithm takes a couple of weeks to figure out which users may be interested in an ad, to refine the targeting. Jessica Grossman, chief executive officer of digital marketing firm In Social, said when her clients get hit, the hardest part is telling them their campaigns have to start over and their money won’t go as far.“Facebook almost doesn’t realize the impact of their own algorithm and what that means,” Grossman said. There seemed to be no logic to the account bans imposed on In Social’s clients, she added. A pizza vending machine company, a reusable water bottle company, a coffee delivery service, a business coach and a hair weave company were all suspended.“We know it can be frustrating to experience any type of business disruption, especially at such a critical time of the year,” Facebook said in a statement. “While we offer free support for all businesses, we regularly work to improve our tools and systems, and to make the support we offer easier to use and access. We apologize for any inconvenience recent disruptions may have caused.”Facebook often touts its commitment to small businesses, as it defends its ever larger hold over their economic future. On a recent earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said this was a “major focus” that’s “more important now than ever” as Covid-19 shifts commerce online. During a July ad boycott by major brands, Facebook’s revenue still grew, bolstered by small businesses rushing online to try to survive. The company added more tools this year for small businesses to sell directly to customers through its site, hoping these virtual shops become advertisers, too.But while business owners agree that Facebook is a lifeline during the pandemic, they say it’s also an unreliable partner. Facebook’s ban on political ads around the U.S. election, for instance, affected companies that have no connection to politics, like a business selling bracelets to benefit refugees. A seed company was also blocked for sharing a picture of Walla Walla onions -- which were “overtly sexual,” according to Facebook’s AI.The company’s policies against cryptocurrency frequently trapped ads from a solar roof company, Human SOLR, because some of the acronyms used by the business are similar to cryptocurrency tokens. After that issue was resolved, Human SOLR’s ads were banned again for using phrases like “see if your roof qualifies.” Facebook’s software guessed the company was selling financial products, which are more regulated. After enough flags on the account, Brett Lee, who runs the business, gave up on Facebook ads. “My business is at a complete standstill,” said Lee, based in St. George, Utah. “My employees’ lives are at a standstill.”GFP Delivered, a Chicago-based produce company advertising a way for people to avoid the grocery store during Covid-19, had its Facebook ads shut down for two months without clear explanation, according to owner George Fourkas. He said he was able to fix the problem only after reaching out to old college friends who work at Facebook.Yaniv Gershom, co-founder of digital marketing firm 4AM Media, said he had to cut 12 jobs partly because of Facebook ad account bans, which have lasted almost six months. “They give you zero feedback,” he added. “The only people who are OK are massive spenders who get a Facebook rep that can escalate issues and find out what’s wrong.”In some cases, the business impact is hard to quantify. Matt Snow, co-founder of an apparel business called Boredwalk, said Facebook’s automated systems inadvertently flagged 40% of his company’s product catalog as unsafe late last month. That left Snow targeting the wrong products to potential customers. He eventually noticed and quickly resolved the issue with a Facebook sales manager, but Snow doesn’t know how long the products were banned, or even which other items were being advertised in their place. “Facebook is very black box about all their internal machinations,” he said.Facebook has been automating content moderation for years, a transition it highlights in a quarterly report detailing how much content the company removes. In more nuanced categories such as “hate speech,” Facebook removed almost 95% of violating posts automatically in the third quarter, up from just 53% two years ago.But that increase comes with more corrections. Facebook removed 22 million posts for hate speech in the third quarter, more than 3 times as many as a year earlier. The number of posts it later restored jumped by 40%.Advertisers have been particularly hurt by these automated decisions in recent months. “It just exploded. They turned up the AI recently -- somebody changed something -- and all of the sudden everybody was getting shut down,” said Justin Brooke, founder of Adskills.com, which teaches businesses how to market on Facebook. “What are these small businesses going to do? They’ve got families to feed.”One of Brooke’s own Facebook ads has a small written disclaimer saying it wasn’t open to those trying to sell adult content. That got flagged and taken down. Facebook’s automated explanation? The post didn’t follow the company’s community standards on “nudity/sexual activity.”The over-reaction by Facebook’s AI is a side effect of the company taking more responsibility for the content on its platform, according to Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of integrity. “As we take more action, we remove more content, there’s more opportunities also for those to be in error,” he said during a recent press call.That’s what HoneyGramz’s Harrigan was told happened to her account. She eventually got desperate enough to Google names of Facebook employees who might help. She found Rob Leathern, the company’s director of ad products, and sent him a message on Twitter. Miraculously, he responded. A few hours later, Facebook sent an email restoring her account.“They just said they turned it off in error,” Harrigan said. “They didn’t give me any feedback. They just reset the whole thing as if it never happened.”But Harrigan won’t forget. She printed off the email and pinned it to her office whiteboard. “It was really, really scary,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-s-ai-mistakenly-bans-ads-for-struggling-businesses/story-TtUKmz6Yv9uuGgkBd60kRM.html
27-11-2020||World||NHS England to pilot blood test that may detect 50 cancers, PM Johnson calls it ‘promising breakthrough’||The United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS) on Friday announced to pilot an innovative blood test that may spot more than 50 types of cancer, including early-stage ones and said it will be piloted with 165,000 patients in a world-leading programme. Research has found that the Galleri blood test can identify many types of cancer that are difficult to diagnose at an early stage, including head and neck, ovarian, pancreatic, oesophageal and some blood cancers. If the programme shows that the test also works for people without symptoms, it will be rolled out to become routinely available. Through the pilot programme, NHS plans to increase the proportion of cancers diagnosed at an early stage to help reduce the mortality rate related to the disease. According to the healthcare agency, patients have between five and 10 times the chance of surviving when diagnosed at ‘stage one’ as against ‘stage four’.NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said in a statement that early detection, particularly for hard-to-treat conditions, has the potential to save many lives. Stevens stressed that the “promising blood test” could turn out to be a game-changer in cancer care. “This trial again confirms that the NHS is at the forefront of cutting-edge treatments and technology,” he added.Also Read | UK: PM Johnson warns of New Year lockdown as he defends new tier systemThe pilot programme is due to start in mid-2021 and will involve 165,000 people, of which 140,000 participants aged 50 to 79, with no symptoms, will have annual blood tests for three years. Another 25,000 people with possible cancer symptoms will be offered the testing to speed up their diagnosis. The results of the programme are expected by 2023.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it a “hugely promising breakthrough” that could transform the way cancers are diagnosed and treated. Johnson took to Twitter to thank the scientists and the NHS for helping to make it happen. Hugely promising breakthrough that could transform how we diagnose & treat cancer which still takes too many before their time.Another example of UK scientific leadership.

27-11-2020||World||China slaps 200% tax on Australia wine amid tensions||China on Friday added wine to the growing list of Australian goods barred from its markets in a trade war against Australia over disputes including its support for a probe into the origin of the coronavirus.The Ministry of Commerce imposed import taxes of up to 212.1%, effective Saturday, which Australia’s trade minister said make Australian wine unsellable in China, his country’s biggest export market.China increasingly is using its populous market as leverage to extract political concessions and increase its strategic influence. Earlier, China stopped or reduced imports of beef, coal, barley, seafood, sugar and timber from Australia after it supported calls for a probe into the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, which began in China in December. China’s ruling Communist Party is trying to deflect criticism of its handling of the outbreak, which plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s, by arguing the virus came from abroad, despite little evidence to support that.Meanwhile, Australia is working on a mutual defense treaty with Japan, which Chinese leaders see as a strategic rival, and has joined Washington and Southeast Asian governments in expressing concern about China’s construction of military facilities on islands in the disputed South China Sea, a busy trade route.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman called on Australia to “do something conducive” to improve relations but gave no details.Read more | China says India’s latest app ban order violates WTO rules“Some people in Australia adhering to the Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice have repeatedly taken wrong words and deeds on issues concerning China’s core interests,” said the spokesman, Zhao Lijian.Australia should “take China’s concerns seriously, instead of harming China’s national interests under the banner of safeguarding their own national interests,” Zhao said. Australia’s main stock market index fell 0.5% on Friday following the news.“To a certain extent, this is Australia’s fault for allowing itself to become a one-trick pony export-wise to China,” market analyst Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a report. The Chinese market is especially important at a time when China is recovering from the coronavirus while the United States, Europe and other major economies are struggling with anti-disease controls that depress demand.The Ministry of Commerce said the wine tariffs are in response to complaints Chinese producers were damaged by improperly low-priced Australian imports. Australia’s government denied subsidizing wine exports. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said the accumulation of Chinese sanctions suggested they were due to “other factors” but gave no details.“The Australian government categorically rejects any allegation that our wine producers are dumping product into China,” Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said.Australia has imposed restrictions meant to block foreign influence in its politics following complaints Beijing might be trying to manipulate its government. Australia also has joined the United States in imposing curbs on use of technology from Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. on security grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slaps-200-tax-on-australia-wine-amid-tensions/story-Ri5n2D6CuB2VlL7Ue6oT1L.html
27-11-2020||World||China seeks to import jet fuel ahead of Lunar New Year holidays||Lunar New Year may be more than two months away but one Chinese fuel supplier is already gearing up for an expected surge in air travel.China Aviation Oil is seeking to import jet fuel for January delivery in its first buy tender since May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The move by CAO, one of the largest buyers of jet fuel in Asia, comes as Chinese domestic air travel continues to recover after the pandemic-driven destruction.Tourism has rebounded in China after early and aggressive measures by the country to tackle the coronavirus proved effective in curbing its spread. The nation’s success in warding off a major outbreak during the Golden Week holiday in early October could also help boost optimism for locals preparing to travel back home during the Lunar New Year break.Traders expect a rise in Chinese jet fuel imports ahead of the extended holiday in February, even as overall volumes are forecast to remain well below 2019 levels.CAO’s activity is a positive sign that China’s jet fuel consumption is improving, said Fenglei Shi, an analyst at IHS Markit. However, buying is partly driven by the incentive to stock up ahead of the Spring Festival when travel usually peaks, and there are still some uncertainties after the holiday ends, she said.While China’s typically a net exporter of jet fuel, the country also imports the fuel in an opportunistic manner.China’s domestic aviation has been a rare recovery story in the midst of a suffering global jet fuel market, with local flights last month at about 88% of the levels seen a year earlier. IHS Markit expects jet fuel demand to reach 95% of 2019’s level by this month..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seeks-to-import-jet-fuel-ahead-of-lunar-new-year-holidays/story-rOrqGumVivQQFBpQqopGfM.html
27-11-2020||World||UK: PM Johnson warns of New Year lockdown as he defends new tier system||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on Friday fighting back rebels from within his own Conservative Party who are opposed to most of England being put into the toughest two tiers of high Covid-19 alert after the country’s second stay-at-home lockdown ends next Wednesday. In a Downing Street briefing on Thursday after he ended his self-isolation on being in contact with a Covid-19 positive MP, Johnson defended the three-tier system as the best chance of avoiding a third complete national lockdown in the New Year. “If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again, casting aside our hard won gains, and forcing us back into a New Year national lockdown with all the damage that would mean,” said Johnson.Also Read: UK shares poised for weekly loss on Covid-19 vaccine doubts, Brexit concerns “Under our Winter Plan, England will return to a tiered system of local restrictions. Our decisions on which area enters which tier are based on public health advice according to five indicators: cases across all ages, especially the over 60s, the rate by which cases are rising or falling, the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid-19, and the pressure on the NHS,” he said. However, the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), made up of Tory backbenchers within his party, said it was “authoritarianism at work”. “There is no logic whatsoever in having a month of lockdown only for people to have to live under an even more severe set of restrictions afterwards,” said Harriett Baldwin, the Tory MP for West Worcestershire, which has been placed in Tier 2. Johnson has a comfortable 80-strong majority in the House of Commons, but if 40 of his own MPs vote down his Winter Plan when it comes for a vote next Tuesday, he will have to rely on support from the Opposition to get it through. And, the Labour Party is expected to decide only early next week whether to back the plans after consultation with government coronavirus experts. Under plans laid out in the Commons on Thursday, only three areas of England – Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly – have been placed into the lowest Tier 1 or the medium restrictions category, with most of England either in Tier 2 or 3.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic Under the highest Tier 3 alert level, there is a complete ban on mixing of households except in limited outdoor settings. For Tier 2, the rule of six applies with up to six members of different households allowed to meet outdoors and under Tier 1, the rule of six applies both indoors and outdoors. Unlike before, gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers but government guidance says that people in all tiers who can work from home should continue to do so. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the authority to set their own coronavirus regulations but all four UK nations have agreed a joint plan for Christmas, allowing up to three households to get together in a bubble between December 23 and 27. However, Scotland has set out further advice on what the so-called “Christmas bubble” can comprise of, with an eight-adult limit. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland entered another tough new lockdown on Friday as a two-week “circuit breaker”. Non-essential retailers have been told to close except for click-and-collect services and cafes and restaurants can only provide a take-away service. Wales has also been implementing similar measures and continues to impose tough social distancing measures. It comes as the UK recorded 498 Covid-related deaths in the last 24 hours and 17,555 new cases of coronavirus, with the death toll from the virus now over 57,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-warns-of-new-year-lockdown-as-he-defends-new-tier-system/story-RBpNcAV44vyGdR3rf4ILiI.html

The students were given a choice of five Hindi movies from which they could pick the dialogues: Mohabbatein, Bajrangi Bhaijan, 3 Idiots, Secret Superstar and Dangal.Many of the students who have submitted videos are enrolled in some of China’s leading educational institutions including Peking University, Communication University of China, Beijing Foreign Studies University, Guangdong University of Foreign studies, and Yunnan Nationalities University.“The rules were these: Each student had a time limit of three to five minutes in which they had to dub their favourite dialogue – in Hindi – from one of the five movies. That part of the movie will play in the background,” explained Zhang Yaneng, Hindi lecturer at BISU’s Hindi department, adding that the planning took about two months.“We set up standards for assessment,” she said.The students of Hindi will be tested on their pronunciation, intonation and the quality of the video and the techniques they used to record it, said Zhang, who is known as Soumya among her peers.Some of the top names associated with Hindi in China are part of this competition and will be judging the participants.It includes Jiang Jinkui, head of the Centre for South Asian Studies and the Hindi department at Beijing’s Peking University, who is a consultant for the competition.Hindi experts from several universities including Shanghai Foreign Language University and Xi’an International Studies University are associated with the competition.There are eight judges and an Indian consultant, Prof Rakesh Vats, who will declare the winners in December, Zhang added.Initially, BISU’s Hindi department professors and students had planned to hold the competition among themselves.Subsequently, it was decided to expand its scope and involve Hindi departments of universities across China.“Earlier, similar competitions had been held in Beijing or Tianjin (a city about 100 km from Beijing). This is the first time it is being held nationally,” Zhang told HT.The history of Hindi in China dates back at least to 1942, seven years before the People’s Republic of China under the Communist party was formed.In 1942, under Chiang Kai-shek, the then Chinese government established the National Institute of Eastern languages in Yunnan and officially initiated the teaching of modern Indian languages including Hindi in China.The seeds were sown during the visits of former PM, then Indian National Congress leader, Jawaharlal Nehru to China in 1939, followed by Chiang’s India visit in 1942.The language continued to be taught in China even during the tumultuous decade (1966-76) of the Cultural Revolution.This year’s competition has taken on added importance despite the chill in ties because of the border friction – 2020 marks the 70th year of the establishment of diplomatic relationship between the two neighbours.“Our inspiration was the 70 years of Sino-India relationship. The competition is our tribute to the ties between the two countries,” Zhang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-universities-teaching-hindi-hold-bollywood-movie-dubbing-contest/story-9liEdJtOhnvnWPp4yMY4nN.html
27-11-2020||World||Another week gone, Brexit trade talks remain stuck||The European Union said Friday that another week of talks with Britain on a new trade deal has gone with barely any progress. Its chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is heading to London for ever-more pressing weekend negotiations to avoid chaos when Britain’s trade agreements with the EU end at New Year.Barnier emerged from a Covid-19 quarantine on Friday and said that after a week of remote video talks the “same significant divergences persist.”The lack of progress is frustrating since the EU had sounded optimistic about a deal last Friday and had committed to be “creative” in its approach during the final stages of the talks. Barnier was on Friday briefing EU member states and the EU parliament, which all have to give their consent to any deal reached with the UK.The three most divisive issues remain EU fishing rights in UK waters, compliance guarantees on any deal reached and the standards the UK must meet to export into the EU.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said substantial and important differences remained with the European Union on a Brexit trade deal.“Clearly there are substantial and important differences still to be bridged but we’re getting on with it,” Johnson told reporters. “The likelihood of a deal is very much determined by our friends and partners in the EU - there’s a deal there to be done if they want to do it.” (with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-week-gone-brexit-trade-talks-remain-stuck/story-tQXm8SHUB6kg6D3AuytFpJ.html
27-11-2020||World||New UK regulator to rein in Google, Facebook, other tech giants||Tech giants such as Google and Facebook will be subject to a new UK regime to give consumers more choice and control over their data, help small businesses thrive, and ensure news outlets are not forced out by bigger rivals, business secretary Alok Sharma announced on Friday.A dedicated Digital Markets Unit to be set up within the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in April will work closely with regulators including Ofcom and the Information Commissioner’s Office to introduce and enforce a new code to govern the behaviour of the tech giants.Officials said online platforms bring huge benefits for businesses and society, but there is growing consensus in the UK and abroad that the concentration of power within a small number of tech companies is curtailing growth in the tech sector, reducing innovation, and potentially having negative impacts on the people and businesses that rely on them.The new code will set clear expectations for platforms that have considerable market power - known as strategic market status - over what represents acceptable behaviour when interacting with competitors and users.Under the new code, platforms including those funded by digital advertising could be required to be more transparent about the services they provide and how they are using consumers’ data, give consumers a choice over whether to receive personalised advertising, and prevented from placing restrictions on their customers that make it hard for them to use rival platforms.The new unit could be given powers to suspend, block and reverse decisions of tech giants, order them to take certain actions to achieve compliance with the code, and impose financial penalties for non-compliance.Sharma said: “Digital platforms like Google and Facebook make a significant contribution to our economy and play a massive role in our day-to-day lives - whether it’s helping us stay in touch with our loved ones, share creative content or access the latest news”.“But the dominance of just a few big tech companies is leading to less innovation, higher advertising prices and less choice and control for consumers. Our new, pro-competition regime for digital markets will ensure consumers have choice, and mean smaller firms aren’t pushed out”.The officials said the code could be used to ensure platforms are not applying unfair terms, conditions or policies to certain business customers, including news publishers. Currently, dominant online platforms can impose terms on news publishers that limit their ability to monetise their content - severely impacting their ability to thrive.The new code will govern commercial arrangements between publishers and platforms to help keep publishers in business, helping enhance the sustainability of high-quality online journalism and news publishing in the UK.According to a CMA study, Google has significant market power in the general search market and in search advertising, and Facebook has significant market power in the social media market and in display advertising.Nearly £14 billion was spent on digital advertising in the UK in 2019, around 80% of which was spent on Google and Facebook. The CMA noted that the number of advertisements that consumers are exposed to on digital platforms is increasing, with adverts seen per hour on Facebook rising from 40-50 in 2016 to 50-60 in 2019. Its average revenue per user is now more than 10 times higher than competitors, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-regulator-to-rein-in-google-facebook-other-tech-giants/story-FfLXh8G3WEtUmhbgCFIV2H.html

He cried foul, blaming Twitter for sending out “false trends”. Trump also accused the micro-blogging platform of making up only “negative stuff”. In a subsequent tweet, the US president said that Section 230 must be immediately terminated for purposed of “national security”.  For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!!What is Section 230?Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was enacted to protect owners of any “interactive computer service” from liability for content published by third-party. The piece of legislation is considered extremely vital for social media networks since the firm can not be held accountable for the millions of content posted by users. The law was passed in 1996 as a part of the Communications Decency Act, which encouraged the emergence of a new form of communication in the internet era. However, it doesn’t protect copyright violations, sex work-related material, and violations of federal criminal law. It also allows social media platforms to remove posts that are obscene or violate the company’s policies, so long as they are acting in “good faith.”Also Read | Social media CEOs get earful on bias, warning of new limitsRepublicans cry anti-conservative biasDuring a Congressional hearing, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google were accused of anti-conservative bias on the social media platforms.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has also defended the decision of the micro-blogging platform to not remove Trump’s tweets related to election results. In another hearing, the Twitter chief testified that the platform has removed some 300,000 election-related tweets between October 27 and November 11, representing 0.2 per cent of all election-related tweets.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-wants-section-230-terminated-all-about-the-law-which-protects-social-media-platforms/story-nx7BZOHwQJ8YkLbNiuZ9UL.html

Thank you to my family and friends...thinking of my dad today,” Kahlon said in a tweet.The task before him will be tough especially as Canada and BC are witnessing a second wave surge of coronavirus cases.The province’s Premier John Horgan made clear the challenge that lies before Kahlon.“Mr Kahlon is taking on an enormous responsibility. The recovery initiatives that we announced in September will now be overseen by Ravi,” media outlet Vancouver Sun quoted him as saying.“We have had a cross-government approach to recovery from the beginning, but Ravi will be the point person.”Also back in the New Democratic Party government’s cabinet is veteran Harry Bains, who was a minister in the outgoing government as well. He will have charge of labour.While Kahlon was originally appointed a parliamentary secretary when the Horgan-led NDP formed a coalition government in 2017, the party now has a majority mandate. Another Indo-Canadian who will feature in the government will be Niki Sharma, who has been named parliamentary secretary for community development and non-profits.While Kahlon and Bains are Sikhs, Sharma is of Hindu heritage.Another veteran Jinny Sims, who had been a cabinet minister when the first Horgan government was formed, has been dropped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-indo-canadian-politicians-get-key-positions-in-british-columbia-govt/story-ZPC95fOjnSNbLlV5kKnGKN.html

It is seeking 20-50 million doses from China’s Sinovac and US firm Pfizer among others. AstraZeneca is one of five vaccine makers that have applied to hold late-stage trials in the Philippines and the supply deal comes amid questions over the results of one such study elsewhere. Several scientists have raised doubts about the robustness of results showing it was 90% effective.“We want an end to this nightmare. We are willing to take this risk,” Concepcion said, stressing the urgent need to reopen the economy further. “The private sector is desperate.” Also Read | Covid-19 vaccine update: PM Modi to visit vaccine development centres, AstraZeneca eyes second global trialThe Philippines’ $370 billion economy, among Asia’s fastest growing before the pandemic, fell deeper into recession in the third quarter as broad curbs aimed at quelling some of the region’s highest infection rates limited economic activity.The private sector contingent, which includes industry groups and firms owned by tycoons collectively worth tens of billions of dollars, will donate half of the 2.6 million doses to the government, and administer the rest to their own employees, Concepcion said.

A meeting of the Cabinet committee on legislative cases chaired by federal Law Minister Farogh Naseem on Thursday approved the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Ordinance 2020 and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance 2020. The ordinances have already been approved in-principle by the federal Cabinet on Tuesday, the Dawn News reported.The concept of chemical castration for first or repeated offenders has been introduced mainly as a form of rehabilitation, and subject to consent of the convict, it said.According to law minister Naseem, it is mandatory under the international law to take consent of the convict before castrating him.In case, chemical castration is ordered without taking consent, the convict might challenge this before a court of law, he said.If a convict would not agree to castration, he would be dealt with in accordance with the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) under which the court might award him death sentence, life imprisonment or 25-year jail term, the minister said.However, he said, it is up to the court to decide the punishment. The judge may order chemical castration or the punishment under the PPC.Also Read | Rise in crimes against women, children in Mumbai in 2019-2020: Praja Foundation reportThe court might order castration for a limited period or lifetime, Naseem said.The ordinances also provide for setting up of special courts to conduct trial in rape cases. Special prosecutors for the special courts will also be appointed. As per the proposed legislations, anti-rape crisis cells headed by a commissioner or deputy commissioner will be set up to ensure prompt registration of an FIR, medical examination and forensic analysis.It also bar the cross-examination of a rape survivor by the accused. Only judge and the accused’s lawyers will be able to cross-examine the survivor.The proposed laws include in-camera trials, witness protection for the victim and witnesses, use of modern devices during investigation and trial, legal assistance to the victims and appointment of independent support advisers for the victims.It prohibits the controversial “two-finger” test performed on rape survivors. The World Health Organisation has already declared the test as “unscientific, medically unnecessary and unreliable”. Human Rights groups have also termed the test as invasive, disrespectful and a gross violation of a woman’s right to dignity and privacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-cabinet-approves-chemical-castration-of-rapists-special-courts-for-rape-trials/story-VwPfi7bYCYm7Fh7GgHx2MN.html
27-11-2020||World||Census gives Trump a final Supreme Court showdown on immigration||President Donald Trump’s administration has one last blockbuster showdown at the Supreme Court over his divisive immigration policies, and this one goes to the heart of how US political power is allocated.In an argument set for Monday, the administration will seek the right to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census count used to divvy up congressional seats and federal funds. The move would change more than two centuries of practice in a nation that has always counted non-citizen residents, even those in the US illegally.The administration is racing to finish the count, and submit a report to Congress, before Joe Biden is inaugurated to succeed Trump on January 20. Critics say Trump is trying to manipulate the numbers at the expense of Democratic-leaning areas with high immigrant populations. The push could mean fewer seats for Texas, California and possibly New York and New Jersey.“This case is about the basic constitutional requirements for how political representation is divided in this country,” said Dale Ho, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who will argue against the Trump plan on Monday. “For 230 years, it’s been on the basis of people living in each state, and what the administration wants to do is a radical departure from that.”The 80-minute session Monday is Trump’s biggest remaining Supreme Court argument in a presidency defined by polarizing legal battles over immigration.Since 2018, the court has upheld Trump’s restrictions on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, blocked his addition of a citizenship question to the census and stopped him from rescinding the DACA deferred-deportation program. The justices also let Trump force asylum applicants to wait in Mexico and cleared him to use redirected Pentagon funds to build fencing along the Mexican border.The court has put the latest census case on a fast track, making a ruling possible by the end of the year. But the challenge is just one of several hurdles Trump will have to overcome to accomplish his goal.With the pandemic slowing the count, Census Bureau officials have told the Commerce Department they can’t produce the state population totals until after Trump leaves office, the New York Times reported last week. And even if Trump can send Congress the numbers, lawmakers could still reject the tally, and Biden might be able to submit a revised report after he becomes president.Read more | Donald Trump calls into Pennsylvania event, urges overturning electionLooming DeadlinesStill, the focus next week will be the Supreme Court, as Trump tries to take advantage of the 6-3 conservative majority he helped create. The president is defending his July 21 memorandum making it administration policy to exclude undocumented immigrants from the count. The memo tells the Commerce secretary to send the president a tally that excludes that group, along with a separate set of numbers showing the total population.Current federal law requires the Commerce secretary to send the census figures to the president by Dec. 31, and the president to send Congress the numbers for allocating House seats by Jan. 10.Three lower courts around the country have said the Trump policy violates either the Constitution or federal statutes. In the case directly before the justices, a three-judge panel in New York said the plan runs afoul of the U.S. Census Act, which requires the Commerce secretary to show the “tabulation of total population by states” and says the president must give Congress “the whole numbers of persons in each state.”Critics of the Trump push say those words leave no room for interpretation. That’s an argument that could resonate with Trump’s three Supreme Court appointees -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- all of whom advocate interpreting laws strictly according to their text.“It’s difficult to know how Congress could have been any more plain than they already were unless they put in parentheses ‘and we really mean it,’” said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.Read more| Donald Trump says he will leave office if Joe Biden’s victory confirmedPresidential DiscretionThe Trump administration contends the laws leave room for the president to exclude people who are in the country illegally. The administration’s top Supreme Court lawyer, acting U.S. Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, argued in court papers that the phrase “persons in each state” means “inhabitants,” a term whose application requires the use of judgment.“The president need not treat all illegal aliens as ‘inhabitants’ of the states and thereby allow their defiance of federal law to distort the allocation of the people’s representatives,” Wall argued.Supporters of the president’s effort say his approach is long overdue.“What’s at stake is whether the American people are represented in Congress or whether others who are not part of the American people are also represented in Congress,” said Christopher Hajec, director of litigation at the Immigration Reform Law Institute.The administration must also defend against contentions that the plan is unconstitutional. In a separate case in California, a court said Trump was violating a constitutional provision that requires congressional seats to be apportioned according to the “whole number of persons in each state.”‘Biggest Hurdle’The Trump memo is being challenged by states led by New York and advocacy groups represented by the ACLU. Their biggest obstacle at the Supreme Court is likely to be a procedural one: Trump’s contention that they don’t currently have “standing” to challenge the plan because they lack a legal stake in the outcome.Trump’s contention that they don’t currently have legal “standing” to challenge the plan.In letting the suit go forward, the three-judge panel said the plan to exclude undocumented immigrants could chill participation in the census. But with the survey now complete, that argument for standing is questionable at best. And the Trump administration says any impact on congressional apportionment is too speculative at this stage to allow a lawsuit.“Whether the memorandum will result in the exclusion of a number of illegal aliens sufficient to impact apportionment is unknown,” Wall argued. “The executive branch thus should be allowed to implement the memorandum, at which point suit can be brought by any actually injured parties.”Ho, the ACLU lawyer, called standing “the biggest hurdle” for the challengers. But he pointed to a prediction in the Trump memo that California would lose two or three seats without undocumented immigrants.“The purpose of the memorandum was to change the way that Congress is apportioned,” Ho said. “It sort of strains credulity for the government to be saying, ‘We don’t know if this is going to change the apportionment.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/census-gives-trump-a-final-supreme-court-showdown-on-immigration/story-HhFg4JmPAplwODQ9lITMYO.html
27-11-2020||World||Germany passes 1 million Covid cases since start of pandemic||Germany’s total coronavirus cases exceeded 1 million for the first time late Thursday, passing the grim milestone around 10 months after the country reported the first infections.Cases in Europe’s biggest economy have more than tripled since the start of October, with the number of people with the disease in intensive care climbing to record levels.Germany recorded 21,951 new infections in the 24 hours through Friday morning, taking the total to 1,017,830, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The number of deaths rose by 430, the biggest gain since April 16’s record of 510.Like other European nations, Germany has imposed stricter measures in recent weeks to stop the disease from spreading. Chancellor Angela Merkel and the leaders of Germany’s 16 states agreed Wednesday to tighten limits on private gatherings but kept schools and most businesses operating to help limit the impact on the economy.Read more | Germany extends partial shutdown to curb virus spreadIn contrast to nations like France and the UK, Germany’s curbs have yielded little progress in slowing the disease’s spread. Infection levels are still nearly three times the government’s target rate and fatalities have exceeded 300 for four straight days, the first time that’s occurred since the start of the pandemic.“The case numbers have stagnated at far too high a level,” Merkel told lawmakers on Thursday. She wants the seven-day incidence per 100,000 citizens to come down to around 50 -- and stay there -- before restrictions can be loosened. It was at 138 on Thursday, according to the latest report from the RKI public health institute.“We undoubtedly have some difficult months ahead of us again,” Merkel said before urging citizens to do everything they can to avoid a “worst-case scenario.”The chancellor said restrictions will likely remain in place until early January, while her chief of staff raised the possibility of them being extended until March. On a more positive note, Merkel said it’s possible that a vaccine for the virus will be available before Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-passes-1-million-covid-cases-since-start-of-pandemic/story-daKXW8zaG2oDXiHLZMLlTI.html
27-11-2020||World||Turkey rejects European Parliament call for sanctions over Cyprus||Turkey on Friday rejected a call by the European Parliament for sanctions against Ankara over President Tayyip Erdogan’s recent visit to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in north Cyprus, calling the demand “disconnected from the realities”.On Thursday, the European Union’s parliament agreed a non-binding resolution in support of EU member Cyprus urging EU leaders to “take action and impose tough sanctions” against Turkey, a move likely to bolster support for France’s push for sanctions on Ankara at an EU summit next month.Turkey is at odds with EU members Greece and Cyprus over hydrocarbon exploration in disputed east Mediterranean waters.Erdogan incensed Cyprus, whose territory covers the southern half of the partitioned Mediterranean island, on Nov. 15 by visiting Varosha, a resort on the island that has been fenced-off and abandoned in no-man’s land since 1974.Ankara supported the partial reopening of Varosha last month in a move criticised by the United States, Greece and Greek Cypriots.Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy denounced the resolution and accused the European Parliament of being “prejudiced and disconnected from the realities” on Cyprus.“If this approach and mentality are maintained, it would not be possible for EU bodies to make a constructive contribution to the settlement of the Cyprus issue,” Aksoy said.Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion after a brief Greek-inspired coup. Only Ankara recognises northern Cyprus as an independent state, but not the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government to the south.France has not yet drawn up sanctions against Turkey, but diplomats say any measures would probably target areas of Turkey’s economy linked to natural gas exploration in seas off the coast of Cyprus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-rejects-european-parliament-call-for-sanctions-over-cyprus/story-bnvQJPkMC3clqm1pmCzEbK.html

27-11-2020||World||Australia’s toughest lockdown pays off with no Covid-19 cases for 28 days||The state at the center of Australia’s worst coronavirus outbreak has gone 28 days with no new cases of the virus, an enviable record as the US and many European countries grapple with surging infections or renewed lockdowns.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19One of the world’s strictest and longest stay-at-home orders enabled Victoria to crush community transmission after a daily peak of about 700 cases in early August. The success means Australia will be among a handful of western nations that can look forward to Christmas with limited restrictions on family gatherings and what authorities are calling a Covid-normal summer.The 28-day run is “an extraordinary achievement psychologically as well as practically, in terms of opening up the economy,” said Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious diseases physician and associate professor of medicine at the Australian National University in Canberra. But there’s no room for complacency, he warned, and Australia faces on an ongoing risk of the virus entering the community from returned overseas travellers -- despite a mandatory system of hotel quarantine.“The reality is, no matter how careful people are, there can always be that accidental breach or a breach where you can’t even identify the source,” Senanayake said.More than 30,000 Australians, many living in Europe and the US where the virus is rampant, are waiting to return home.Also Read |  Australia opens up more borders in domestic travel boost, eyes vaccineBungled security at quarantine hotels in Victoria, which reportedly included guards sleeping with guests, saw the virus escape into the community -- leading to the three-month lockdown in Melbourne. Meanwhile, in neighboring South Australia, authorities are investigating how two security guards, a cleaner and two returned travellers contracted the virus while in hotel quarantine -- seeding a cluster of infections in the state that’s grown to at least 31.While 28 days with no mystery cases of Covid-19 is the working definition for eliminating community transmission, the Victoria government remains wary.“Now is not the time to be complacent,” Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said in a statement. “Recent wastewater testing demonstrates there may still be virus in the community and a real risk remains with arriving interstate travelers or the emergence of new local cases. Our fight against Covid-19 is not over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-toughest-lockdown-pays-off-with-no-covid-19-cases-for-28-days/story-xKtJPOpMAYoD5V3y5MCznL.html
27-11-2020||World||China to impose temporary anti-dumping measures on Australian wine imports||Australia has responded defiantly to China imposing anti-dumping tariffs on Australian wine, saying the “seriously concerning development” looks to be about diplomatic grievances and not any action by winemakers.China will impose temporary anti-dumping tariffs of 107.1% to 212.1% on wine imported from Australia from Nov. 28, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said on Friday.Australia’s trade minister Simon Birmingham said the tariffs were unjustifiable and it was a distressing time for hundreds of wine producers because it “will render unviable for many businesses, their wine trade with China”. China takes 37 per cent of Australia’s total wine exports, an industry worth AU$2.9 billion, the government said.Last week China outlined a list of grievances about Australia’s foreign investment, national security and human rights policy, saying Canberra needed to correct its actions to restore the bilateral relationship with its largest trading partner.“China’s recent comments gives the perception that it’s more about their grievances around those matters, rather than in fact around anything any industry has done wrong,” Australia’s agriculture minister David Littleproud told media on Friday.He added, “It just doesn’t worry Australian exporters, it worries exporters from around the world.”China began an anti-dumping probe in August at the request of the Chinese Alcoholic Drinks Association, but in Canberra the preliminary decision to impose tariffs was viewed as part of a pattern of punitive trade measures since Australia called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.Birmingham pointed to “the cumulative impact of China’s trade sanctions against a number of Australian industries” and said if they were a response to other factors this would be “completely incompatible with the commitments China has given” to the World Trade Organisation.This year China has imposed tariffs on Australian barley, suspended meat imports, and Chinese importers were told to expect customs delays across seven categories of Australian products from coal to seafood from November.Importers bringing in Australian wine will need to pay deposits to China’s customs authority, which will be calculated based on different rates the authority has assigned to various companies, according to the statement. The rate required of Treasury Wine was 169.3%, the highest among all the named wine firms in the statement. Shares of Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates Ltd, the world’s largest listed winemaker, fell more than 13% before being put on a trading halt pending an announcement.An importer of Australian wine in Shanghai told Reuters:”I will stop importing Australian wines for at least 3 months to see how things go. Many importers will stop the business, according to what I know, because it is simple not workable with such a deposit.”Casella Wines will require a 160.2% deposit, Swan Vintage will require 107.1%. For Australian wines that are not named on the list, the rate is 212.1%.The Australian government will hold a meeting with winemakers on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-impose-temporary-anti-dumping-measures-on-australian-wine-imports/story-TPfDDOhL9UsHQtpVHg0ZaP.html
27-11-2020||World||Trump says will leave White House, but under one condition||US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would concede if the Electoral College elected President-elect Joe Biden, and would leave the White House. But he vowed to continue pursuing poll fraud allegations until then, undeterred by the dismal impact of his lawsuits and challenges.“Certainly, I will, and you know that,” Trump said when asked by reporters if he will leave the White House, which has become a concern as he has refused to acknowledge the outcome despite losing to Biden by a wide margin of 306-232 in Electoral College votes, and by over 5 million popular votes.Trump has not conceded yet. But he told reporters after the traditional Thanksgiving messages to US armed forces that he will if the Electoral College elected Biden.  Watch | Trump says he’ll leave WH if Electoral College seats Biden; snaps at reporter“It’s going to be a very hard thing to concede,” he said, adding, “If they do, they made a mistake.”Americans don’t vote to directly elect their president. They choose electors instead, who are granted to the presidential nominee that wins the popular vote in that state in a winner-takes-all system, except in two states.Most election cycles, this would have been a pro forma next step — on the second Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors endorse the nominee projected to win. Trump is trying to subvert the process and use this stage to further delay the inevitable.The electors will meet in their respective states on December 8 to elect the president. And on the basis of the current projected count — pending complete certification of results by all states — Biden will win 306 of the 528 total votes, to Trump’s 232. Trump had won the 2016 election with the same count and had bragged of it as a landslide.

You cannot save your way through a crisis,” said Greens lawmaker Sven-Christian Kindler.Planned new debt of 179.82 billion euros for next year compares to 96 billion euros initially envisaged by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz in September.Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has taken unprecedented steps to help companies and small businesses get through the crisis, freeing up billions of euros to prevent the economy shrinking further.

27-11-2020||World||Brazil’s Sau Paulo could roll out China’s Covid-19 vaccine without approval||Sao Paulo could roll out a COVID-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac without approval from the national health regulator, Governor Joao Doria said in an interview on Thursday, pressuring Brasilia to greenlight the vaccine.Health experts said Doria’s comments were an empty threat, as no drugs or vaccines can be used legally in Brazil without clearance from health regulator Anvisa, which pushed back against the comments. Still, his statements reveal growing tensions over the vaccine rollout in Latin America’s biggest country, with the world’s second-highest COVID-19 death toll.Critics of President Jair Bolsonaro argue he is threatening the independence of Anvisa with political appointees to gain leverage over governors and other rivals.In a video interview on the news website Metropoles, Doria said Sao Paulo could use the vaccine from Sinovac Biotech Ltd based on approval from regulators in other countries.“Today, there is suspicion that Anvisa could suffer political interference from the presidency and could fail to be an independent agency as it should be, as it must be,” he said.He added the state would consider the vaccine appropriate for use if approved by authorities “in the United States, in Europe and, above all, in Asia.”In a statement, Anvisa said that was impossible.“It is important to clarify that the tacit approval of vaccines by other agencies ... is not foreseen in the law,” the regulator said. “Even after it is approved in another country, Anvisa’s approval is necessary.”Doria, a staunch opponent of Bolsonaro, has already ordered the construction of facilities to produce the Sinovac vaccine, which is currently undergoing late-stage trials in Sao Paulo and elsewhere in Brazil.Bolsonaro, a strident China critic, has frequently dismissed the Sinovac vaccine, known as Coronavac, saying he is concerned about its “origin.”So far, the federal government’s principal bet has been on a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca, though federal health officials have also held discussions with other vaccine developers, such as Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Ltd .

27-11-2020||World||UK asks regulator to assess AZ-Oxford vaccine amid questions||The British government said Friday it has formally asked the country’s medicines regulator to assess whether a coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University should be authorized for use.The step comes amid questions about preliminary results from trials of the jab, after the company and the university acknowledged that the most encouraging part of their findings stemmed from a dosing error.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he had asked the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to determine whether the vaccine “meets rigorous safety standards.”It’s the second vaccine candidate to reach the formal assessment stage in Britain, following a shot developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. A third vaccine from U.S. firm Moderna is not far behind.The British government has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and plans to start distributing it in December if it gains approval.The regulator said it could not give a time frame for possible approval of the vaccinesMHRA Chief Executive June Raine said “no vaccine would be authorized for supply in the U.K. unless the expected standards of safety, quality and efficacy are met.”Oxford and AstraZeneca reported Monday that their vaccine appeared to be 62% effective in people who received two doses, and 90% effective when volunteers were given a half dose followed by a full dose. They did not mention at the time, but later acknowledged, that a manufacturing issue had resulted in “a half dose of the vaccine being administered as the first dose” to some participants.The drugmakers informed the U.K. regulator of the issue when it was discovered, and it was agreed to complete the late-stage trial with two groups.AstraZeneca has said it plans to conduct a new global clinical trial to assess the vaccine’s efficacy but does not expect that to delay regulatory approval in Britain or the European Union -- though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may take longer.Some scientists have expressed concerns about gaps in the data and the way the results were reported. Only 2,741 people received the half dose, making it hard to know if the effectiveness seen in the group is real or a statistical quirk. A total of 8,895 people received two full doses.Eleanor Riley, professor of Immunology and Infectious Disease at the University of Edinburgh, said Oxford and AstraZeneca needed to answer questions about their results “clearly and completely.”“Trust is at a premium when it comes to vaccines and we must not do anything that might in any way undermine that trust,” she said.Full results are due to be published in medical journal The Lancet, though no date has been given.Pfizer and BioNTech said earlier this month that their vaccine is 95% effective, and Moderna said its product appears to be 94.5% effective, according to preliminary data.Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab does not need to be stored at freezer temperatures, making it potentially easier to distribute, especially in developing countries. It is also cheaper, because AstraZeneca has agreed not to profit from it during the pandemic.The British government and its scientific advisers have expressed confidence that multiple vaccines will win approval, but say all decisions are up to the regulator.“They will make an assessment with lots of data that is not currently public domain on efficacy and on safety,” said England’s Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty.“I think it’s always a mistake to make too many judgements early before we have the full information and particularly before the regulator, the independent regulator, has had their chance to look at the data and make an assessment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-asks-regulator-to-assess-az-oxford-vaccine-amid-questions/story-7hAIv3zBqzHeQsIkKpjmsK.html
27-11-2020||World||Empty seats, delivered feasts as coronavirus ‘changes’ Thanksgiving||Vivian Zayas can’t keep herself from scrolling through photos of last Thanksgiving, when her mother stood at the stove to make a big pot of rice and beans and then took a seat at the edge of the table.That was before anyone had heard of Covid-19 and before it claimed the retired seamstress. Ana Martinez died at 78 on April 1 while recovering at a nursing home from a knee replacement.The family is having their traditional meal of turkey, yams, green beans and rice and beans — but Zayas is removing a seat from the table at her home in Deer Park, New York, and putting her mother’s walker in its place.“It’s a painful Thanksgiving. You don’t even know, should you celebrate?” asked Zayas. “It’s a lonely time.”The family is left with “an empty chair at the table forever,” another daughter, Alexa Rivera, said Thursday.Americans are marking the Thanksgiving holiday amid an unrelenting pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than a quarter of a million people in the United States.Turkey and pies will still come out ovens, football will still be on TV, families will still give thanks and have lively conversations about politics. But this holiday has been utterly altered after months filled with sorrows and hardships: Many feasts are weighed down by the loss of loved ones; others have been canceled or scaled back with the virus surging.Zoom and FaceTime calls have become a fixture at dinner tables to connect with family members who don’t want to travel. Far fewer volunteers are helping at soup kitchens or community centers. A Utah health department has been delivering boxes of food to residents who are infected with the virus and can’t go to the store. A New York nursing home is offering drive-up visits for families of residents struggling with celebrating the holiday alone.“The holidays make it a little harder,” said Harriet Krakowsky, an 85-year-old resident of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale in New York who misses the big Thanksgiving celebrations of years past and has lost neighbors and friends to the virus. “I cry, but I get over it. We have to go on.”On any normal Thanksgiving Day, Kara McKlemurry and her husband would drive from their Clearwater, Florida, home to one of two places: his family’s home in another part of the state or her family’s house in Alabama. This year, McKlemurry informed her family there would be no visits. When her in-laws offered to stop by, the couple said no.She and her husband didn’t want to risk infecting anyone or getting the virus themselves.Not everyone followed McKlemurry’s example. Millions of Americans bought tickets to fly somewhere for the holiday, crowding airports despite pleas from officials to avoid travel and gatherings.Still, McKlemurry, 27, wanted to do something unique to mark this unusual holiday — something to let everyone know that she and her husband still feel blessed this year.So, a week before Thanksgiving, armed with coloured pens and stickers of owls with scarves, she hand wrote notes of gratitude to every member of the family.“We’re so grateful to have you in our lives,” she wrote on a card with a cartoon fox, “even if we can’t actually be together this year for the holidays.”In the nation’s capital, the convention center is empty unlike in previous years, when volunteers have worked together to serve a meal to about 5,000 people. In the era of social distancing, the sponsored event had to be reimagined.Ahead of the holiday, organizers delivered to 20 nonprofits 5,000 gift bags, each with winter clothing accessories, hand sanitizer and a mask, and 5,000 boxes that included a turkey sandwich with condiments, a side potato salad, a cookie and utensils.From start to finish, Thanksgiving is different this year for Jessica Franz, a nurse who works the graveyard shift at Olathe Medical Center, in a Kansas City suburb.For one, Franz, 39, is celebrating without her mother-in-law, Elaine Franz, who died of the coronavirus on Nov. 10, just one day before her 78th birthday. In previous years, her mother-in-law, who was Mennonite, would lay out a spread for her children and grandchildren. At Franz’s work, in a typical year, co-workers would bring food for a potluck.None of that is happening this year.The family is shifting the festivities to Zoom and FaceTime. It’s been hard for her daughters — ages, 2, 8 and 11. Her middle daughter was exposed to the coronavirus at school and is quarantined until Dec. 3, and her oldest daughter is struggling with the concept of a scaled-back holiday.“We had a good conversation that was, ‘This year may be different, and that’s OK. It is one year. If things are different this year and that means we get to see all the rest of our family next year, it is OK,’” said Franz, who has personally cared for patients dying of coronavirus.The Thanksgiving gathering at David Forsyth’s home in Southern California, meanwhile, comes with a uniquely 2020 feel: rapid virus tests at the door to decide who gets inside.The kit costs about $1,000 for 20 tests, each of which involve pricking a finger and putting a drop of blood on a tray. Ten minutes later the results either show someone is negative, has antibodies or is positive.Normally, about 15 to 20 people attend the family’s Thanksgiving dinner in Channel Islands Harbor. But this year, it will only be eight of them: Forsyth, his wife, her four adult sons and the partners of two of them.His wife started cooking Tuesday. She’s planning a cold cucumber soup for a starter and bunch of appetizers for the early afternoon meal. The sons are bringing side dishes. Turkey and the fixings are the main course. Champagne may be cracked.Forsyth hasn’t seen his family much during the pandemic but wanted to save the holiday.“People are trying to live a normal life,” he said. “And, you know, with the second wave coming now, it’s not a bad idea to be prepared.”Kerry Osaki longs to see his now-grown children, without masks, and hug them. But instead he and his wife are celebrating just the two of them after their traditions were upended.Osaki’s 93-year-old mother, Rose, who lived with the couple in Orange County in California, died from the virus after all three got sick.With his mother gone, Osaki, 67, and his cousin decided to pass on the family’s annual Thanksgiving get-together. His wife, Lena Adame, typically spent the holiday cooking a spread of turkey and stuffing with her relatives — but some had seen virus cases at their workplaces, so the couple decided to skip that, too.“It’s just been a long, rough and sometimes sad year,” he said.In Ogden, Utah, Evelyn Maysonet stepped out of her home Tuesday morning to find boxes overflowing with canned goods, desserts and a turkey. She has been isolating with her husband and son since all three tested positive for Covid-19.None of them has been able to leave to buy groceries, so they were thrilled to receive the health department’s delivery — and the chance to cherish the things that matter most.“As long as you have a life and you’re still alive, just make the best of it with you and your family,” Maysonet said.___Associated Press journalists Tamara Lush, Jennifer Sinco Kelleher, Sophia Eppolito, Amy Taxin and John Minchillo contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/empty-seats-delivered-feasts-as-coronavirus-changes-thanksgiving/story-FmoUqjo4BTncjhd2dyzZVP.html

It was a rigged election.” Trump spoke to reporters at the White House on Thursday after speaking with US military leaders overseas.After his conversation, Trump took questions for the first time since Election Day and angrily denounced officials in Georgia and Pennsylvania, two key swing states that helped give Biden the win, as “enemies of the state” and claimed they were culprits in vote fraud.State officials and international observers have repeatedly said no evidence of mass fraud exists and Trump’s campaign has repeatedly failed in court.Trump said he would hold a rally with thousands of supporters in Georgia on Saturday to support a pair of Republican candidates — Sen. David Perdue and Sen.

27-11-2020||World||Kim Jong Un likely to let his missiles do the talking with Joe Biden||North Korea has greeted the last two US presidents with tests of missiles or nuclear bombs within weeks of taking office. And experts see the same happening with Joe Biden, whom the regime has called “a rabid dog.”Kim Jong Un is one of the few world leaders who has yet to congratulate -- or even acknowledge -- the president-elect, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping did so on Wednesday. While it’s not unusual for North Korea to stay silent on the results of US elections, Kim held unprecedented meetings with President Donald Trump that broke the mold of relations between the long-time adversaries.Ties now are poised to revert to the frostier days of the Obama administration, when the US deployed “strategic patience” to avoid rewarding North Korea for provocations -- a policy that stayed in place after Kim took power in 2011. For North Korea, it may not make too much of a difference: Under both Barack Obama and Trump, Kim steadily increased his ability to threaten the US homeland with nuclear weapons even in the face of ever-tighter sanctions.“Regardless of the US presidency, the North Korean regime is unlikely to change its behavior or shift its strategy toward the US,” said Soo Kim, a Rand Corp. policy analyst who previously worked at the Central Intelligence Agency. “The nukes are here to stay, Kim will continue to build and extort, and the strategy has proven to work for decades. So why change what works?”North Korea tested Obama with the launch of a long-range rocket and a nuclear device within months after he took power in 2009. Trump was welcomed to the White House with a series of ballistic missile tests that culminated with the launch in November 2017 of an intercontinental ballistic missile that experts said could deliver a nuclear warhead to all of the the USThe most likely missile test this time will be another ICBM. This could include a new rocket North Korea rolled out at a military parade in October, which is designed to carry multiple nuclear warheads to the US homeland. The Pentagon said earlier this month that it had successfully intercepted a mock ICBM simulating one developed by North Korea.“They need to test the new ICBM in order to demonstrate it is credible in the eyes of adversaries, and they will likely do so when they are ready,” said weapons expert Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network. “North Korea only needs their ICBMs to be accurate enough to deter the United States.”North Korea sees its nuclear weapons as insurance against a US attack, and has vowed to maintain its deterrent no matter what. Kim has repeatedly rejected the Trump administration’s call for a “complete, verifiable and irreversible” dismantlement before Pyongyang can receive any rewards.Biden’s camp has signaled more room for negotiations, saying in a policy paper that he wants to “jump start” a campaign with US allies and others for denuclearization. At the second presidential debate in October, Biden called Kim a “thug” but said he could meet the North Korean leader if he made moves to reduce his nuclear arsenal.Biden’s choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has called Trump’s personal diplomacy a failure and advocated for a multilateral approach that seeks disarmament in stages. In a 2017 opinion piece in the New York Times, Blinken backed a negotiated settlement with North Korea “that first freezes and then rolls back North Korea’s nuclear program, with inspectors to carefully scrutinize compliance” before a more comprehensive deal is reached.Kim is likely to give clues on how he’ll approach the new Biden administration during an annual New Year’s address -- one of the biggest political speeches on the country’s political calendar. North Korea is also expected to hold a rare ruling party congress at around the time of Biden’s inauguration to lay out a new five year plan for its economy, which is headed for its biggest contraction in more than two decades due to sanctions, the coronavirus and a series of natural disasters.Kim’s decision to close borders due to the coronavirus has had a devastating impact on trade, which is on course to drop with its most important partner China by 80% for the whole year, the Korea International Trade Association said in a report Friday.Pyongyang has made clear that it prefers dealing with Trump, who gave Kim a seat at the table as an equal. His regime has extolled the “mysteriously wonderful” chemistry between the two leaders, while denouncing Biden as an “imbecile bereft of the elementary quality as a human being.”And as Biden seeks to work with allies following Trump’s “America First” approach, Kim may also find that he has more friends now than he did a few years ago. He enjoys much better relations with China and Russia, who joined with the the US in 2017 to support unprecedented United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea in response to its nuclear and missile tests.“This time around, new tests may not have the same effect at the UN,” said Ankit Panda, a Stanton senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, adding that tensions could escalate quickly if Biden responds with a show of military might. “The greatest risk would be that we reenter a crisis cycle with North Korea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-likely-to-let-his-missiles-do-the-talking-with-joe-biden/story-xcK3QxCbuKetNojufQfyTO.html
27-11-2020||World||Amazon will spend $500 million on holiday employee bonuses||Amazon.com Inc. will pay the employees who pack and deliver its goods a one-time bonus of up to $300, extra compensation that comes as the company faces a union drive and criticism from others for rolling back pandemic hazard pay.The company said on Thursday that it would pay full-time operations workers $300, and part-timers $150, if they are employed by the e-commerce giant for the entire month of December. The cost to Amazon will amount to about $500 million, logistics chief Dave Clark said in a corporate blog post.Like many of its peers in retail who had offered hazard pay as an incentive for workers to keep coming in during the pandemic, Amazon ended its bonuses after an economic upheaval swelled the ranks of job seekers. The company ended its $2-an-hour bump for hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers at the end of May. In June, it paid one-time bonuses of as much as $500.More recently, Amazon has faced criticism from some employees for trying to attract new hires with a $3,000 bonus to ensure sufficient staffing to cover the holiday rush while only offering existing workers vouchers toward Thanksgiving turkeys. Earlier this week, a union drive organized by a group of workers at an Alabama warehouse became public, a rare step at a company that has worked to fend off organized labor in its ranks.“Our teams are doing amazing work serving customers’ essential needs, while also helping to bring some much needed holiday cheer for socially-distanced families around the world,” Clark said in the blog post Thursday. “I’ve never been more grateful for -- or proud of -- our teams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-will-spend-500-million-on-holiday-employee-bonuses/story-JgubEhQVo6XXD8Yl5t4XMK.html

27-11-2020||World||Trump rants about polls, pardons Flynn||US President Donald Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn on Wednesday, ending a prosecution in the Russia probe that saw Flynn twice plead guilty to lying to the FBI and then reverse himself before the justice department stepped in to dismiss his case.The US president, meanwhile, yet again railed over the election outcome. He stayed home at the White House, rage-tweeted about his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, saying it was a “rigged election”, then barely mentioned the pandemic or greeted the nation on Thanksgiving, phoned into a packed news conference held by his allies in Pennsylvania, and called for “this election to be turned around”.On the move to pardon his former NSA, the US president tweeted, “It is my great honour to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a full pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!”The Washington Post slammed the decision to pardon Flynn as a “parting disgrace” from the outgoing president.President-elect Biden had a more constructive presence through the day. He called for unity and hope in a Thanksgiving eve address to Americans, reminding them that the country was at war with the coronavirus pandemic “and not with each other”.The contrast in approach between the two leaders, their priorities and their styles played out in full public view over the day on Wednesday. A sombre Biden spoke to Americans from an empty music hall about the need for “solutions, not shouting; reason, not hyper-partisanship; light, not heat”, and urged them not to despair in the face of the pandemic. Speaking of the Covid-19 vaccines in the pipeline, he said, “Hang on, don’t let yourself surrender.”Biden, who has sought to stay above Trump’s attempts to challenge the election result, addressed the issue head on.“In America, we have full and fair and free elections, and then we honour the results,” he said without naming anyone. “The people of this nation and the laws of the land won’t stand for anything else.”Biden said he understood the task of unifying the country is not going to be easy, but he insisted he was determined to bring together Democrats, Republicans and Independents. “Americans dream big. And, as hard as it may seem this Thanksgiving, we are going to dream big again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rants-about-polls-pardons-flynn/story-RMou3XnSRnGlWiBf06iXWI.html

On Wednesday, it spiked to nearly 200,000 cases, with a death toll of more than 2,400 - a six-month high. More than 262,000 people have been killed by the virus in the US so far.In recent days, images on social media of crowded airports fuelled concerns Americans were not taking advice from health authorities to curb travel seriously. In Germany, the government has announced that it will extend its virus curbs until 2021 and plans to seek a deal with European partners to close ski slopes until January 10. A statement from Chancellor Angela Merkel dovetailed with France’s plans to shutter ski resorts through the year’s end. Russia on Thursday registered record numbers for daily infections and deaths for the second time in less than a week. Officials reported 25,487 new infections and 524 new deaths. South Korea reported its highest daily cases since March, with a surge of new infections sparking fresh fears. Officials announced 583 new cases after several weeks of fresh infections ranging between 100 and 300.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-2-400-covid-19-fatalities-in-one-day/story-XfCTZXvWJhtYL374sccrBM.html

Ana Martinez died at 78 on April 1 while recovering at a nursing home from a knee replacement.The family is having their traditional meal of turkey, yams, green beans and rice and beans — but Zayas is removing a seat from the table at her home in Deer Park, New York, this year and putting her mother’s walker in its place as a reminder of the loss.“It’s a painful Thanksgiving. You don’t even know, should you celebrate?” asked Zayas. “It’s a lonely time.”Americans are marking the Thanksgiving holiday Thursday amid an unrelenting pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than a quarter of a million people in the United States.Turkey and pies will still come out ovens, football will still be on TV, families will still give thanks and have lively conversations about politics. But this holiday has been utterly altered after months filled with sorrows and hardships: Many feasts are weighed down by the loss of loved ones; others have been canceled or scaled back with the virus surging.Zoom and FaceTime calls have become a fixture at dinner tables to connect with family members who don’t want to travel. Far fewer volunteers are helping at soup kitchens or community centers. A Utah health department has been delivering boxes of food to residents who are infected with the virus and can’t go to the store. A New York nursing home is offering drive-up visits for families of residents struggling with celebrating the holiday alone.“The holidays make it a little harder,” said Harriet Krakowsky, an 85-year-old resident of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale in New York who misses the big Thanksgiving celebrations of years past and has lost neighbors and friends to the virus. “I cry, but I get over it. We have to go on.”On any normal Thanksgiving Day, Kara McKlemurry and her husband would drive from their Clearwater, Florida, home to one of two places: his family’s home in another part of the state or her family’s house in Alabama. This year, McKlemurry informed her family there would be no visits because of the pandemic. And when her in-laws offered to stop by, the couple said no.She and her husband have been “keeping pretty strict lockdown” since March, and didn’t want to risk infecting anyone or getting the virus themselves.Not everyone followed McKlemurry’s example. Millions of Americans bought tickets to fly somewhere for the holiday, crowding airports despite pleas from officials to avoid travel and gatherings.Still, McKlemurry, 27, wanted to do something unique to mark this unusual holiday. She didn’t just want to soothe any lingering tension in the family — she wanted everyone to know that she and her husband feel blessed this year, despite the lack of physical connection.So, a week before Thanksgiving, she sat in her backyard and hand wrote notes of gratitude to every member of the family. She got out colored pens, stickers of owls with scarves, and cute greeting cards.“We’re so grateful to have you in our lives,” she wrote on a card with a cartoon fox, “even if we can’t actually be together this year for the holidays.”In the nation’s capital, the convention center is empty unlike in previous years, when hundreds of volunteers have worked together to serve a traditional holiday meal to about 5,000 people, who also got access to clothing donations, medical testing and other services. In the era of social distancing, the sponsored event had to be reimagined.Ahead of the holiday, organizers delivered to 20 nonprofits 5,000 gift bags, each with winter clothing accessories, hand sanitizer and a mask, and 5,000 boxes that included a turkey sandwich with condiments, a side potato salad, a cookie and utensils.From start to finish, Thanksgiving is different this year for Jessica Franz, a nurse who works the graveyard shift at Olathe Medical Center, in a Kansas City suburb.For one, Franz, 39, is celebrating without her mother-in-law, Elaine Franz, who died of the coronavirus on Nov. 10, just one day before her 78th birthday. In previous years, her mother-in-law, who was Mennonite, would lay out a spread for her children and grandchildren. At Franz’s work, in a typical year, co-workers would bring food for a potluck.None of that is happening this year.The family is shifting the festivities to Zoom and FaceTime. It’s been hard for her daughters — ages, 2, 8 and 11. Her middle daughter was exposed to the coronavirus at school and is quarantined until Dec. 3, and her oldest daughter is struggling with the concept of a scaled-back holiday.“We had a good conversation that was, ‘This year may be different, and that’s OK. It is one year. If things are different this year and that means we get to see all the rest of our family next year, it is OK,’” said Franz, who has personally cared for patients dying of coronavirus.The Thanksgiving gathering at David Forsyth’s home in Southern California, meanwhile, comes with a uniquely 2020 feel: rapid virus tests at the door to decide who gets inside.The kit costs about $1,000 for 20 tests, each of which involve pricking a finger and putting a drop of blood on a tray. Ten minutes later the results either show someone is negative, has antibodies or is positive.Normally, about 15 to 20 people attend the family’s Thanksgiving dinner in Channel Islands Harbor. But this year, it will only be eight of them: Forsyth, his wife, her four adult sons and the partners of two of them.His wife started cooking Tuesday. She’s planning a cold cucumber soup for a starter and bunch of appetizers for the early afternoon meal. The sons are bringing side dishes. Turkey and the fixings are the main course. Champagne may be cracked.Forsyth hasn’t seen his family much during the pandemic but wanted to save the holiday.“People are trying to live a normal life,” he said. “And, you know, with the second wave coming now, it’s not a bad idea to be prepared.”In Ogden, Utah, Evelyn Maysonet stepped out of her home Tuesday morning to find boxes of food on her front porch overflowing with canned goods, desserts and a turkey. She has been isolating with her husband and son in their home since all three tested positive for COVID-19 over a week ago.None of them has been able to leave to buy groceries, so they were thrilled to receive the health department’s delivery — and the chance to enjoy a meal together and cherish the things that matter most.“As long as you have a life and you’re still alive, just make the best of it with you and your family,” Maysonet said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/empty-seats-delivered-feasts-as-coronavirus-changes-thanksgiving/story-rfR1NnZoSKyy82l5tGk9mJ.html
27-11-2020||World||‘Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief’: British royal Meghan Markle speaks about miscarriage||Meghan, Britain’s Duchess of Sussex, has revealed that she had a miscarriage, an extraordinarily personal disclosure coming from a high-profile British royal.The wife of Prince Harry and former actress wrote about the experience in detail in an opinion article published in the New York Times on Wednesday, saying that it took place one July morning when she was caring for Archie, the couple’s son.“I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second,” Meghan wrote, describing how she felt a sharp cramp after picking up Archie from his crib, and dropped to the floor with him in her arms, humming a lullaby to keep them both calm. Also Watch | Meghan Markle attends ‘The Lion King’ premiere with Prince HarryMeghan described how she and her husband were both in tears as she lay in a hospital bed hours later.“Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few,” she wrote.“In the pain of our loss, my husband and I discovered that in a room of 100 women, 10 to 20 of them will have suffered from miscarriage. Yet despite the staggering commonality of this pain, the conversation remains taboo, riddled with (unwarranted) shame, and perpetuating a cycle of solitary mourning.”The intimate details shared in the article are strikingly at odds with the usual policy of senior members of the British royal family, who reveal almost nothing about their personal lives.Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, has never discussed her private life in any media article or interview in her 68-year reign.However, there is intense global media interest in the senior royals, especially when it comes to family matters such as the birth of children.Harry’s older brother Prince William and his wife Kate appeared in front of TV camera crews and photographers outside the London hospital where Kate gave birth to her three children shortly after each birth, each time with their newborn baby.Despite the media frenzy, however, William and Kate have revealed almost nothing of substance about their home life.“MOTHER, FEMINIST, ADVOCATE”A source close to Harry said the Duke had discussed the article with the royal family beforehand.Meghan and Harry married in May 2018 in a glittering ceremony televised around the world, but the period after their wedding was tumultuous, with the couple falling out publicly with some British media and opening up about their struggles.They stepped back from royal duties and moved to the United States earlier this year to try and forge a new role for themselves outside the constraints of life in Britain’s strictly codified royal bubble.The byline on the New York Times article was “Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex”, and she was described as “a mother, feminist and advocate”.Meghan wrote that 2020 had brought many people to breaking points, and called on people to put aside political differences and other divisions and show some care for each other.“So this Thanksgiving, as we plan for a holiday unlike any before — many of us separated from our loved ones, alone, sick, scared, divided and perhaps struggling to find something, anything, to be grateful for — let us commit to asking others, ‘Are you OK?’,” she wrote.“As much as we may disagree, as physically distanced as we may be, the truth is that we are more connected than ever because of all we have individually and collectively endured this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-royal-meghan-speaks-about-miscarriage-in-new-york-times-article/story-VVqhqWvpCBpnPhrMfU9lBJ.html
27-11-2020||India||CM Mamata Banerjee concerned as Bengal govt’s potato, onion stocks deplete||With onions and potatoes still selling at double their normal price, their dwindling stock in the government-freezers has come as a cause of concern for the Mamata Banerjee administration, which is gearing up for the crucial 2021 assembly elections. When the prices had hit the roof, the state government was providing onions and potatoes at half the market price to consumers from its own stores. But that stock is expected to last till December only. “The prices of potatoes and onions are rising. As of now we are providing them at reasonable prices from our stocks. But that will last till December only. I don’t know what will happen after that. I have written a letter to the Prime Minister,” Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal, said while speaking in an administrative meeting earlier this week. In February this year, the state government had planned to purchase around one million tons of potato from farmers. The government could, however, purchase only around 42,000 tons of potato before the lockdown started. “At a time when potatoes are selling in the local market at Rs 45 per kilo, the government is selling at Rs 25 per kilo from 630 outlets. The stock won’t last long,” said a senior official of the state government. Even though experts are hopeful that the prices of potatoes and onions will go down once fresh supplies hit the market in the winter, the government seems to be concerned and has asked all cold storage units to clear their stocks by November 30. “This will prevent any kind of hoarding and provide some relief before the fresh winter supplies hit the market. The main concern is that if there is a shortage of supply resulting in a price rise the opposition will get a chance to attack the government before the elections,” said a TMC leader. Banerjee had earlier sent a letter to Modi urging the Prime Minister to either control the prices of potatoes and onions or allow the state to do so. The parliament had in September passed the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 to deregulate commodities such as cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes. “Winter vegetables are being harvested. We hope that the prices would come down once the fresh supplies hit the market in the winter. The prices of some vegetable such as cauliflower and brinjal have already come down. The prices of onion and potatoes are also expected to decline,” said Rabindranath Kole, a member of the government’s task force. West Bengal needs around six million tons of potato and around eight lakh tons of onion. While the lion’s share of the potato crop is grown in various districts of south Bengal, 80% of the onions come from Maharashtra and other states in south India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-mamata-banerjee-concerned-as-bengal-govt-s-potato-onion-stocks-deplete/story-rbDjcvfS6MC8jIlvzMFtVM.html

27-11-2020||India||Odisha CM says ready for SIT probe in murder case of 5-year-old girl||With the opposition BJP and Congress unrelenting in their demand seeking resignation of higher education and panchayati raj minister Arun Sahoo over the alleged murder of 5-year-old girl by one of his aides, chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday said the state government was ready for a probe by an SIT if needed.Attending the winter session of the Odisha Assembly through video conference from his residence, CM Patnaik said a probe by the Special Investigating Team (SIT) into the alleged murder of Pari, the 5-year-old daughter of a rickshaw-puller can be ordered, if needed.“My government is always committed to free and fair investigation. I am deeply saddened by the incident and my Government always stand for the rule of law,” said Patnaik requesting the opposition MLAs to cooperate in running of the House. Patnaik early this week had ordered a probe by state CID into the case of murder.However, both Congress and BJP members continued to create ruckus in the Assembly demanding the minister’s ouster from the Cabinet, forcing Speaker Surjya Patro to adjourn the proceedings for the day. BJP leader Jayanarayan Mishra said Patnaik hasn’t ordered an SIT probe. “All that he said was if SIT probe is what is required, the state government will take steps in this regard and do it immediately. In any case, our party did not demand an SIT probe. We want the minister’s resignation,” said Mishra.On July 14, 5-year-old Pari, daughter of rickshaw-puller Ashok Sahu and his wife Saudamini Sahu in Jadupur village of Nayagarh, had gone missing while playing outside. Ten days later, her skeletal remains were discovered in a sack outside their house. The girl’s father alleged that his daughter was killed by one Babuli Nayak, aide of minister Sahoo, as he traded in human organs. As the local police floundered in the investigation, the Sahu couple on November 24 tried to bring attention to the case by attempting self-immolation outside the Odisha Assembly. However, they were saved in the nick of time by cops.Also read: Riding tractor trolleys, farmers from 4 states to join protest in DelhiSenior BJD MLA Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak said it’s unjust on the part of the opposition to create ruckus in the Assembly and mar proceedings of the House. “There is enough scope for the opposition members to discuss the matter in details as home department’s demand of discussion is on the schedule,” he said. Outside the Assembly, BJP activists and youth Congress workers took out a rally demanding the minister’s ouster.On Friday, Soumyaranjan Pradhan, sarpanch of Lakshmiprasad gram panchayat, where the murder occurred, moved Orissa High Court seeking protection for himself and family from the minister claiming that he had received death threats. “I’m receiving threat calls as I’m vocal in this incident. If anything happens to me or my family, Arun Sahoo will be responsible,” said Pradhan, who has made state home secretary, DGP, Nayagarh Collector, SP and inspector of local police station as parties.A public interest litigation has also been filed in the Orissa High Court seeking CBI probe and Rs 25 lakh compensation for the kin of the deceased minor girl.The issue attracted more controversy with BJD vice-president and Khandapada MLA Soumyaranjan Patnaik terming the case as a ‘minor incident’. State BJP leader Lekhashree Samantasinghar said the MLA’s comments were shameful. “The little girl lost her life even before understanding it and her family is completely devastated. What more does MLA Soumya Patnaik think would have happened to the girl to make it a big case,” said Lekha Samantasinghar.Meanwhile, the minister who is under fire for his role in the issue, said he welcomed the CID probe and requested opposition parties not to politicise the issue, instead focus on unravelling the truth.“In my entire political career, I have never supported any kind of violence. I welcome the crime branch probe decision by the state government and hopeful that justice will be delivered. I want to see that the family of Pari gets justice. People involved in the crime should not be left free,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cm-says-ready-for-sit-probe-in-murder-case-of-5-year-old-girl/story-9MHFfAXznolAbbPAclBF9K.html
27-11-2020||India||Yediyurappa’s move to grant reservation to Lingayats deferred after high command’s intervention||Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa’s sudden move to provide reservation to the dominant Lingayat community in the state has been put on hold after the party high command intervened. The move to defer the decision was announced by the CM himself who said, “The decision (on providing reservation to Veerashaiva Lingayats) will be taken after my visit to Delhi as this is a special decision which requires more discussion. Even my cabinet colleagues are of the same view.”The move to provide reservation to the Lingayat community who at 16-17% of the state population are the single largest community was seen as the CM’s signalling rebellion to the party high command. Yediyurappa who hails from the community is seen as its champion. The CM has been upset over continued statements by some leaders in the party about leadership change and him being replaced apart from the inordinate delay in approving cabinet expansion.The party high command and the local leadership are also said to be not in sync on who would be inducted. However, the CM commenting on cabinet expansion said, “It will happen in 2-3 days. I have spoken to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and they will send a list (of ministers) soon.”Currently, Veerashaiva Lingayats come under Other Backward Class category with some of the sub-sects getting preference under Category 3B in which 5% reservation is based on economic criteria. Yediyurappa’s current proposal would enable Lingayats as a whole to get quota under the 27% reservation for OBC’s in central government jobs and educational institutions. The move if successfully implemented would also further enhance his stature as the tallest leader of the community.Law minister J Madhuswamy explaining the reason why the decision to grant reservation to Lingayats was deferred said, “There are various communities which are seen as forward but are actually backward. So we wanted to take a holistic view with the help of anthropological studies and thus the deferment.”Also inclusion of any community in the Central OBC list will happen after the state government recommends it and the Centre accepts it. Home Minister Amit Shah is said to have asked Yediyurappa not to take a decision in this regard though Madhuswamy refused to comment on this saying, “We will take a holistic decision keeping all factors in mind.”Last week Yediyurappa had ordered the setting up of a Veerashaiva Lingayat Development Board with an initial corpus of Rs 500 crore leading to clamour from various other communities for similar initiatives. On Friday, a delegation of Kuruba (traditional shepherd community) leaders met the Chief Minister and demanded a similar corporation for upliftment of their community. BJP MLC Vishwanath speaking to the media said, “We also want a development board with a similar corpus. We also want our community members to be inducted into the cabinet during expansion.”The Kurubas at 11% of the state’s population are the third largest community after Lingayats and Vokkaligas. Numerous Lingayat mutt heads including Basava Peetha head Jaya Murtunjaya Swami and Vachananda Swami of Panchamsali Mutt have demanded that the government immediately announce reservation for Lingayats.Senior political analyst Manjunath commenting on Yediyurappa’s move said, “This is clearly a signal to the BJP high command by Yediyurappa that unless he is allowed to continue as CM and form a cabinet of his choice, he will take counter-measures. In 2012 too, he has walked out of the party. It would be interesting to see how the BJP high command tackles the challenge posed by Yediyurappa.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappa-s-move-to-grant-reservation-to-lingayats-deferred-after-high-command-s-intervention/story-ReDvwPx8tgxY5Q3HieZ4oN.html

The farmers, who were part of the ‘Delhi Chalo’ march against the Centre’s three farm laws, were escorted to the national capital by the police amid tight security.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday reiterated his invitation for talks on December 3 to resolves differences.

They allowed the farmers to hold their protest at north Delhi’s Nirankari Ground - one of the biggest grounds in the national capital. However, farmers gathered at the Singhu border have not entered the city so far.The agitating farmers were let in soon after Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava announced that they will be allowed to enter and continue with their demonstration peacefully at the Nirankari Samagam Ground in the city’s Burari area. “They will have the permission to protest at the Nirankari Samagam Ground in the Burari area,” Shrivastava was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also read | Centre has not ruled out a law to guarantee MSP, hints Narendra Singh TomarBharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal said that the farmers were headed to the Burari ground after their demand to hold their protest at the Ramlila Ground was rejected by the Delhi Police. “We’ve crossed about 10 barriers on our way. We’re thankful to the administration for giving us permission to protest. We’re happy and only want a peaceful resolution to the issue,” a farmer told ANI.Earlier in the day, Delhi Police used tear gas at the Singhu border to disperse the protesting farmers who were trying to head towards the national capital. Farmers also pelted stones at police and broke barricades in an attempt to enter Delhi amid heavy deployment.

Singh also renewed his appeal to the Centre to initiate talks with the farmers to resolve the issue that has been raging for over two months now.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said that no government in the world can stop them from fighting the ‘battle of truth’. “The PM should have remembered that whenever the ego hits the truth, it is defeated. No government in the world can stop the farmers fighting the battle for truth. The Modi government has to accept the demands of the farmers and black laws will have to be withdrawn. This is only the beginning!” Gandhi’s tweet roughly translated from Hindi read.His sister and Congress party’s general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also lashed out at the Centre and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should implement “one nation, one behaviour”, in an apparent jibe at his suggestion for “one nation, one election”.Legislators of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also extended their support to farmers protesting the Centre’s farm laws and said these “dark laws” must be withdrawn. They said that the farmers, mainly from Punjab, reached Delhi after “much struggle”. “Farmers are coming from Punjab, Haryana and other states to protest against farm bills. For our farmer brothers, the Delhi government has made arrangements for water and other facilities,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s party also tweeted.Traffic, Metro servicesDelhi Metro services resumed on all lines on Friday evening after they were interrupted for few hours at several locations due to the ongoing protest march by farmers. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) added that services will be regular on all lines on Saturday.Traffic was disrupted in many parts of the city due to the farmers’ protest. Delhi Traffic Police on Friday posted a series of tweets, asking people to avoid outer Ring Road, Mukarba Chowk, GTK road, NH-44 and Singhu Border in view of the ‘Delhi Chalo’ march by farmers from Punjab against the farm laws.“In view of the rally/ march/protest by All India Kishan Sangharsh co-ordination committee, the traffic police is diverting traffic from Mukarba Chowk & GTK road. Traffic is very very heavy in this area,” it said.Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana marched towards Delhi against the Centre for clearing three farm laws - The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. While the government claims that the laws will eliminate the role of middlemen and ensure fair prices to farmers for their crops, the farmers contend the legislation would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-clashes-tear-gas-protesting-farmers-move-to-delhi-s-burari-ground/story-79WC9vfLNCuLBEbspXgdIJ.html

The raids revealed the lavish lifestyle of the officer disproportionate to his known sources of income. Pathak was suspended by the state government after his arrest.Pathak, a 1987-batch IFS officer, working as the additional principal chief conservator of forests (plan, programme and afforestation) of Odisha since June 2018, was arrested after vigilance officials conducted raids across 13 places, including his official residence in Bhubaneswar, his office, his apartment, the apartment of his nephew, driver’s house, his house at his native village in Bihar, luxury apartments and farmhouse in Pune and residence of his son’s manager at Samata Colony, Pune.His son Abhay Pathak, possessed expensive vehicles like Mercedes, BMW and Tata Harrier as well as high-end bikes such as Yamaha FZS motorcycles, was also arrested.The arrests came after a team of over 150 vigilance officials, including chartered accountants, bank officials and cyber cell, rummaged through documents and other records of Pathak and his family.Also read: ‘Biggest ever catch’ - Odisha IFS officer in vigilance net for ‘unaccounted riches’The father-son duo was medically examined before they were produced before a local court. Both of them denied the allegations of amassing disproportionate assets.“My son gets a salary of Rs 1 crore a month. I have no ill-gotten wealth and everything is legal,” Pathak said while his son said they were being framed. A special vigilance team last night grilled Pathak, his son, nephew Harsh and his driver.During the search ops in the last two days, the vigilance sleuths found that Pathak and his family had made at least 20 trips to different cities across the country through chartered planes at an expenditure of over Rs 3 crores during the lockdown. It was found that Pathak made cash deposits of about Rs 9.4 crores in the bank accounts of his son, out of which about Rs 8.4 crores was deposited in Bhubaneswar through ATMs. During the house search and subsequent inquiry, cash worth around Rs 60 lakh was found along with gold ornaments weighing 800 grams. He was found to own an 8,000 sq ft luxurious apartment with ivory-crusted bed.The officials also found hotel bills worth more than Rs 90 lakhs at Hotel Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai, and a booking amount of Rs 20 lakhs at Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur in Rajasthan for the upcoming marriage of his son with the daughter of a senior BJD politician from Ganjam district.Officials said Pathak was found in possession of disproportionate assets to the tune of Rs 9.35 crore which was 435 per cent of his total income from all known sources. Accordingly, a case under several sections of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018, has been registered against the officer and his son. The father-son duo was remanded to judicial custody till December 9.Vigilance department officials said as huge cash deposits were made in private banks through deposit slips and ATM counters and high-value transactions have been made in the accounts, details of operations of the concerned banks in this regard are being probed. Similarly, since the bookings and payments concerning chartered flights have been made through Bhubaneswar-based travel agencies, their role is being investigated. Details of income tax returns are being ascertained. Investments in shares, mutual funds and other market instruments are also being probed. The aspects of benami transactions and properties are also being looked into.In view of the expanding scope of investigation, a 20 member SIT has been formed to thoroughly investigate all aspects.Pathak’s son Akash was allegedly cheating people of money, promising to get them jobs at Tata Motors by falsely claiming to be a managing director at Tata Motors. The company in May had complained with the CID against Akash, accusing him of committing cheating, forgery and impersonating as the MD of the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vigilance-sleuths-arrest-odisha-ifs-officer-who-allegedly-took-20-chartered-flights-during-lockdown-with-family/story-lA5gEapSrGYkO4anooif4J.html

Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has got two new deputies this time: Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi. The BJP high command’s decision to replace Sushil Modi with new faces came as a surprise to several party leaders and also to BJP’s alliance partner, the JD(U).

The party in a memorandum submitted to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan alleged that the Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao came up with a false narrative of ‘fomenting communal trouble.’ It also alleged the chief minister was trying to divert peoples attention from the core civic issues that people of the GHMC have been facing and the “misrule of TRS and its miserable failure in fulfilling the promises made during the last elections.” Rao on Wednesday in a statement said some forces want to whip up communal passions and create such a communal disturbance so that the GHMC polls are not held and postponed. “BJP demands deployment of special forces to monitor law and order situation and to pre-empt the designs of anti-socials to create problems.BJP demands appointment of special observers to ensure free and fair elections,” the memorandum said.The party also sought instructions to officials not to attend the chief ministers review programmes as they are being used for political purposes until the completion of elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-civic-polls-bjp-urges-governor-to-deploy-special-forces/story-9W2MZHzo7mPKKHomF0urvN.html

Mizoram Assembly Speaker Lalrinliana Sailo disqualified Lalduhoma, who was elected from Serchhip as an Independent candidate in 2018 polls, for defecting to Zoram People’s Movement (ZPM). “After a thorough study of the case and hearing the statements from the respondent (Lalduhoma) and the petitioner, it is clearly verified that the MLA has joined ZPM in theory and practice, which the respondent himself declared in his declaration on September 9,” news agency PTI quoted Sailo. Incidentally, the 71-year-old had been disqualified from Lok Sabha in 1988, the first MP to be disqualified under the anti-defection law for giving up membership of the Congress, the party he represented in Lok Sabha. With Friday’s development, Lalduhoma becomes the first MLA in Mizoram to be disqualified under the anti-defection law.

He had given up the Aizawl West 1 seat and retained Serchhip. Seven different political parties formed the ZPM and contested the polls in 2018. The group won seven seats becoming the principal opposition in the assembly. With Lalduhoma’s disqualification, the ZPM now has six members in the 60 member house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-ips-officer-in-charge-of-former-pm-indira-gandhi-s-security-disqualified-as-independent-mla/story-vvumfSUbg1GrlzYMNxcxSL.html

27-11-2020||India||Ahead of next year’s electoral battle, TMC MLA Mihir Goswami joins BJP||After resigning from the TMC, Mihir Goswami, a legislator from West Bengal joined the BJP in Delhi on Friday. Flanked by party’s national general secretary and in-charge of West Bengal, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Goswami said he was unhappy with the governance of TMC chief and WB chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Goswami, said his leaving the TMC is a “crusade against the immoral and incorrect happenings in the state, especially the injustice to the northern part of Bengal.” As the BJP readies for the 2021 electoral battle in West Bengal, party leaders said there is a long list of functionaries who are keen to join the party. A senior party leader speaking on condition of anonymity said several leaders in the state are in discussion with BJP functionaries in Bengal and will be joining over the course of the next few weeks. On whether Suvendu Adhikari, who resigned as the state’s transport minister is also expected to join soon, the functionary said: “There are several big names who are distressed by the way the Mamata Banerjee government is ruling the state and they want to be part of the BJP’s development agenda.” A second functionary said the violence against BJP cadre has raised an alarm in the state and the issue of providing security to some leaders is being discussed with the Centre. While the party is upfront about negotiating with some TMC leaders who are keen to switch sides, there is consternation among the cadre in the state, with a section of leaders complaining about being sidelined. “The BJP has been building its cadre in the state, but in order to win elections, there is a need to have on board leaders who wield influence in a wider area. For instance Adhikari’s influence spans to at least 30 assembly constituencies,” the second leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-next-year-s-electoral-battle-tmc-mla-mihir-goswami-joins-bjp/story-DFm9QflAhWZavEM0MuxCeK.html

The council of heads of government is the second highest body of SCO and is responsible for handling the grouping’s trade and economic agenda and approving its annual budget. This is the first time India is hosting a meeting of the body since it was admitted to the eight-member grouping in 2017. Modi, Khan and Chinese President Xi Jinping had joined the virtual SCO Summit that was chaired by Russia earlier this month. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India has usually been represented at meetings of the council of heads of government at the level of the external affairs minister, while defence minister Rajnath Singh had attended last year’s meeting in Uzbekistan. “Since India is hosting the meeting this year, the vice president will chair it,” said one of the people cited above. In January, the external affairs ministry had said that the council of heads of government meeting is “held annually at the prime ministerial level” and that India would invite all eight members of SCO and four observer states and other international dialogue partners to the meet in November. According to media reports, Modi is set to visit his constituency of Varanasi on November 30 to launch the Varanasi-Prayagraj highway project and participate in Deepotsav celebrations at the Ganges ghats. The people cited above also said Pakistan is expected to be represented by a minister as Khan would skip the meeting. Though Khan has joined virtual multilateral meetings hosted by other countries, he skipped the online meeting of leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation hosted by India in March to discuss ways to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. Pakistan’s representative at that meeting had created a flutter by raising the Kashmir issue. One of the people cited above said India considers SCO an important regional organisation to promote cooperation in security, trade and economy based on universally recognised international norms, good governance, rule of law, transparency and equality. “India is committed to widening our cooperation with SCO by playing a proactive, positive and constructive role in the organisation,” the person said. The other seven members of SCO are China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and the four observer states are Afghanistan, Belarus, Iran and Mongolia. Turkmenistan, the SCO secretary general and the executive director of SCO’s Regional Anti-terrorist Structure have also been invited for the November 30 meeting. The annual meeting ends with a joint communiqué with major proposals on trade and economic cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/venkaiah-naidu-to-chair-sco-heads-of-govt-meet-india-pakistan-pms-unlikely-to-join/story-9e26m7DUgIWtWGVqEMH0tO.html

The GHMC elections would mark the beginning of the end for TRS in Telangana,” the BJP chief said. Accusing the TRS government of pushing Telangana into a debt trap with heavy borrowings, Nadda said it was wrong on the part of KCR to make more promises to the people without even fulfilling the promises made in the last GHMC elections. He said the BJP was the only party which had the vision to develop Hyderabad in a much better way. “The time is up for the TRS in Telangana and it is going to the BJP all the way in Hyderabad,” the BJP chief said. Reacting to the criticism of TRS working president and state minister for municipal administration KT Rama Rao that BJP was roping in Delhi leaders for “gully elections,” Nadda said the BJP would definitely go wherever there was injustice to the people. “We shall go anywhere to put an end to corrupt and monarchic rule of some leaders and bring the BJP to power. We shall not rest until our party conquers Hyderabad and then Telangana,” the BJP national president said. Along with Nadda, state BJP president Bandi Sanjay, Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy and other seniors took part in the road show. Meanwhile Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath will be campaigning for the BJP on Saturday. He would conduct a roadshow at Jeedimetla which is part of Malkajgiri parliamentary constituency, besides addressing a public meeting at Shalibanda in old city of Hyderabad in the evening.

27-11-2020||India||SC stresses on independence of tribunals, directs Govt to constitute National Tribunals Commission||The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Centre to constitute a National Tribunals Commission (NTC) which would act as an independent body to supervise appointments and functioning as well as take care of the administrative and infrastructural needs of tribunals across the country.Stressing on the “imperative need” to ensure that tribunals discharge the judicial functions without any interference of the executive whether directly or indirectly, the apex court said that till NTC is constituted, a separate wing in the Ministry of Finance shall be established to cater to the requirements of tribunals.Observing that setting up of such commission would enhance the image of tribunals and instil confidence in the minds of litigants, a bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao said dependence of tribunals for all their requirements on the parent department would not “extricate them from the control of the executive”.“Judicial independence of the tribunals can be achieved only when the tribunals are provided the necessary infrastructure and other facilities without having to lean on the shoulders of the executive. This can be achieved by establishment of an independent National Tribunals Commission as suggested above,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat.The observations by the apex court came in its judgement delivered on a batch of pleas challenging the constitutional validity of the ‘Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other Authorities (Qualification, Experience and Other Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 2020.“The Union of India shall constitute a National Tribunals Commission which shall act as an independent body to supervise the appointments and functioning of tribunals, as well as to conduct disciplinary proceedings against members of tribunals and to take care of administrative and infrastructural needs of the tribunals, in an appropriate manner,” the bench said in its 68-page verdict.The apex court said that to stop the dependence of tribunals on their parent departments for routing their requirements and to ensure speedy administrative decision making, “as an interregnum measure, we direct that there should be a separate ‘tribunals wing’ established in the Ministry of Finance, Government of India to take up, deal with and finalize requirements of all the tribunals till the National Tribunals Commission is established.” It said that till amendments are carried out in 2020 Rules, the search-cum-selection committees should comprise of Chief Justice of India or his nominee as the chairperson and others, including the outgoing chairman or president of the tribunal in case of appointment of chairman or president and secretary to the Ministry of Law and Justice.It said that Rule 4(2) of the 2020 Rules shall be amended to provide that the search-cum-selection committee shall recommend the name of one person for appointment to each post instead of a panel of names for appointment to each post and another name may be recommended to be included in the waiting list.“The chairpersons, vice-chairpersons and the members of the tribunal shall hold office for a term of five years and shall be eligible for reappointment. Rule 9(2) of the 2020 Rules shall be amended to provide that the vice-chairman, vice-chairperson and vice-president and other members shall hold office till they attain the age of sixty-seven years,” the bench said.It said that the Centre shall make serious efforts to provide suitable housing to the chairman or president and other members of the tribunals and if it is not possible, the government shall pay the chairman or president and vice-chairman or vice-president an amount of Rs 1.5 lakh per month as house rent allowance and Rs 1.25 lakh per month for other members with effect from January 1, 2021.The apex court said that the 2020 Rules shall be amended to make lawyers with an experience of at least 10 years eligible for appointment as judicial members in the tribunals and while considering their appointment, the search-cum-selection committee shall take into account the experience of the advocate at the bar and their specialization in the relevant branches of law. “Rule 8 of the 2020 Rules shall be amended to reflect that the recommendations of the search-cum-selection committee in matters of disciplinary actions shall be final and the recommendations of the search-cum-selection committee shall be implemented by the Central Government,” it said.It directed that the Centre shall make appointments to tribunals within three months from the date on which the search-cum-selection committee makes recommendations.It said any appointments made after the 2020 Rules came into force on February 12, 2020 shall be governed by it subject to modifications and appointments made under the 2020 Rules till the date of this verdict, shall not be considered invalid. It said in case selection committees have made recommendations in accordance with the 2020 Rules, appointments shall be made within three months from today and shall not be subject matter of challenge on the ground that they are not in accord with this judgment.It said chairpersons, vice-chairpersons and members of the tribunals appointed prior to February 12, 2020 shall be governed by the parent statutes and Rules as per which they were appointed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stresses-on-independence-of-tribunals-directs-govt-to-constitute-national-tribunals-commission/story-jxorniqt0lFjoWzCpgCb3L.html

It said that most of the countries across the world are observing resurgence of Covid cases and given the size and density of population in India, the country has done remarkably well in restricting the spread.   The Centre pointed out that as on November 24, India stands at 9.2 million Covid cases, with over 0.44 million active cases, which make up only 4.75 per cent of the current cumulative cases. “Our recovery rate has gone up to 93.76 per cent, with almost 8.6 million recoveries made. The average cases per day have reduced by 50 per cent since the past 8 weeks. Currently, only 2 two states have more than 50,000 cases and they contribute to almost 33 per cent of the overall active cases,” the Ministry of Home Affairs said in its affidavit. It said that the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of India remains low at 1.46 per cent, when compared to the global average of 2.36 per cent and stands at a total death count of 0.13 million. The Centre said that the government will continue making efforts to bring CFR down to less than one per cent and accelerate efforts in reducing the positivity rate, which currently stands at 6.9 per cent. “The 10 States contribute almost 77% of the active case load for the country. These are: Maharashtra (18.9%), Kerala (14.7%), Delhi (8.5%), West Bengal (5.7%), Karnataka (5.6%), Uttar Pradesh (5.4%), Rajasthan (5.5%), Chhattisgarh (5.0%), Haryana (4.7%) and Andhra Pradesh (3.1%),” the Centre said. It said that India is now testing on an average, almost 1.1 million samples daily and this has been a remarkable increase from 6 thousand tests daily at the start of April.   “We are further trying to reduce the spread with the use of digital innovations such as Arogya Setu/ITIHAS to predict emerging hotspots and they are also aiding contact tracing efforts. Our efforts are also directed towards managing Covid, non-Covid health facilities should also be effectively managed - these include: immunization, maternal and child health services, cancer, dialysis, etc,” it added. The Centre’s 170-page affidavit filed before the top court added that given the ferocity with which the disease had spread, countries have been compelled to take drastic measures which have affected almost every facet of life and India was no exception to the same.   “However, India looked at the challenges imposed by the pandemic as a unique opportunity to demonstrate its self-reliance in areas like manufacturing of critical medical equipment, use of information technology etc. In order to become self-sufficient or “Atma-nirbhar” in all our capacities and enhance our healthcare preparedness, India also worked to boost domestic production and expand our healthcare workforce,” it said. Giving the statistics of various steps taken, the government said that as on November 23, 2020, a total of 24, 17, 085 passengers and crew members have been screened at the airports. It said that the laboratory network is continuously being strengthened and as of November 23, 2020, total operational (initiated independent testing) government laboratories reporting to ICMR is 1166 and in addition, 968 private laboratories have been approved for Covid-19 testing. It added that adequate laboratory reagents are available with ICMR and a total of 133.8 million (13.38 Crore) samples have been tested as on November 23, 2020. “It is submitted that as on November 24, 2020, a total of 15,454 dedicated Covid treatment facilities with 1,54,6983 dedicated isolation beds (including 2, 67, 886 oxygen supported beds) have been identified. Also, a total of 79,005 ICU beds (including 40,183 ventilator beds) have been earmarked in these facilities”, it said. Regarding development of drugs and vaccines, the government said that the principal scientific advisor to the Government of India has constituted a core group on Covid-19 and “thirteen clinical trials of repurposed drugs have been undertaken to build a portfolio of therapeutic options for Covid-19 patients”. “It is submitted that nearly 30 vaccine candidates encompassing a diverse group of vaccines based on multiple technologies / platforms are under development in India, by both academia and industry,” it said. The government submitted that five candidates are in the clinical trial stage, of which two vaccines are in Phase III trials and three are in phase II trials.   “A National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 has been constituted on August 7, 2020, under Member (Health), NITI Ayog, which is working round the clock to ensure that vaccines are developed and introduced for public administration at the earliest and at affordable price,” it said. Dealing with logistics, the Centre informed the top court that total orders for 1.92 Crore Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) have been placed by it so far and States/UTs and Central Government institutions are being supported in terms of supply of logistics.   “So far 1.62 Crore of PPE Kits, 3.89 crores N-95 masks, 11.16 crore tablets of Hydroxychloroquine, 34,279 ventilators and 1,02,400 oxygen cylinders have been supplied to States/UTs/ Central Government hospitals so far.

These rules are proposed to be inserted as sub-rules 81A, 81B, 81C, 81D, 81E, 81F, 81G in the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989,” it said.The draft rules define vintage motor vehicles as all those vehicles that are two-wheelers and four-wheelers (non-commercial and personal use) and are more than 50 years old from the date of their first registration (including imported vehicle).There is a restriction in the definition — no substantial overhaul of the vehicle which includes modification in chassis or body shell, and/or engine.“It is proposed that all applications for registration shall be applied on ‘PARIVAHAN’ portal. It is further proposed that all states registering authority will appoint a nodal officer who will process all applications for registration of vintage motor vehicles,” it said.Further, states will form a committee that will inspect a vehicle and declare whether the vehicle is fit for registration under vintage motor vehicle or not.“If approved, a 10-digit alphanumeric number will be assigned to the respective vintage vehicle. This registration shall be valid for 10 years,” the statement said.The format for the registration mark will be ‘XX VA YY ****’, where VA stands for vintage, XX will be the state code, YY will be a two-letter series and ‘****’ is a number from 0001 to 9999 allotted by state registering authority, it added.The fees for a new registration will be Rs 20,000; while for subsequent re-registration, it will be Rs 5,000.If a vehicle is registered as a vintage motor vehicle, the sale and purchase of the vehicle is allowed under the rules, it said.A vintage motor vehicle is allowed to run on Indian roads only for display, technical research or taking part in a vintage car rally, refuelling and maintenance, exhibitions, vintage rallies, and to and fro to such exhibition or car rally.The government said the objective is to preserve and promote the heritage of old vehicles in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-intends-to-formalise-registration-process-of-vintage-motor-vehicles/story-rXn25uqfKRFZAWjUSnOuHN.html

Talking more about his music Vishal said that for films music has to go with the story and is script bound. “When I do independent music it’s about my vision. It’s like flying in open sky without any traffic police trying to stop me, though I feel lucky to do both kind of music. I did independent songs like ‘Aaj Bhi’, ‘Manjha’, during lockdown ‘Muskrayega India’ besides, ‘Sajna Ve’ and ‘Humko Tum Mil Gaye’. At the same time I did ‘Saand ki Aankh’, ‘Pranam’ and ‘Khuda Hafiz’,” he said. His latest single ‘Woh Chaand Kahan Se Laogi’ is doing well on charts. “My thought for the song was to bring out emotions of love which speaks the universal language. The reason that I asked Manoj Muntashir to pen the lyrics was that he has travelled a full circle from Gauriganj (Amethi) to Mumbai and he understands the language and flavour of these emotions.” Born in Unnao, Vishal has grown up in Lucknow and went to New Way Senior Secondary School, Aliganj, before he went Bhubaneswar to pursue law. “Then I had no plans for a career in music and was rejected in all auditions held in Lucknow. For my internship, I went to Mumbai where I auditioned for a reality show and that’s how my musical journey began. Now, when come to my hometown and see my family all happy with my success it makes me feel elated.” On a parting note he said, “God is very kind. When you are getting love for your work then you feel you are in happy space. I feel blessed when people say my music relaxes and calms them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/with-independent-music-it-s-like-i-m-flying-in-open-sky-says-vishal-mishra/story-jsO9Z1iEEuL7w6nL6tvlTO.html

VTM and RNA extraction both add a significant burden on money and time required for mass testing for coronavirus.“We believe the technique’s merit holds for all kinds of settings and has the potential of bringing down the costs and time of testing by 40-50 per cent.It is a game changing technology as with the existing infrastructure, the output of Covid-19 screening can be enhanced several fold with immediate effect while, at the same time, making the whole process safer,” Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/icmr-nod-for-ccmb-s-dry-swab-testing-for-covid-19/story-PF5uCzICW7JSESVeqwKTFN.html

For reviving the economy after Covid-19, we need to revive and work on the country’s infrastructure. Fast tracking construction activities and completing pending ones not only gives an impetus to economic revival but also generates more employment,” Gadkari said.“Road construction has led to an increase in employment. During the lockdown, a lot of migrant labourers had left for their villages in other states but they have since returned to work on projects helmed by the road transport ministry,” Gadkari said.ALSO READ | HTLS 2020: ‘No impact of Covid-19 on road projects, construction,’ says GadkariMigrant workers are critical to building the country’s infrastructure and the road, transport and highways ministry has put in place a number of measures so that labourers can work safely and complete infra projects amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“We have offered extensions without penalty to contractors so that they can complete pending projects stalled due to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. After the lockdown was lifted, contractors have ensured protective measures for workers. They have taken care of their food and shelter, have provided medical benefits, ensured masks and sanitisers at construction sites and also tried to maintain social distance while the labourers are at work. All this has led to confidence-building among migrant workers and a large section have returned to work on stalled projects,” Gadkari said.

The team is expected to reach the village on November 30 or December 1.When contacted, deputy commissioner of Mon, Thavaseelan K said the incident took place earlier this week after some villagers found some crystals while working in the forest and informed others in the village on the presumption that they were diamonds. Also read: India’s GDP in September quarter contracts 7.5% - Govt dataThe official said it was doubtful that they were diamonds as the stones were found close to the surface. But he hoped the stones would bring some sort of benefit to the villagers even if they were quartz crystals as quartz has many applications.On whether an influx of curious people to the district was expected by the authorities, the DC replied positively if speculations were ruled to be true. However, he pointed out that the situation remains unpredictable until experts examined and declared what the stones were really worth. Although the matter has churned debates among the public, geologists were unconvinced that the small crystals were actual diamonds since there were no records of diamonds being present in the region.“Those are ordinary quartz crystals. They are very common and are found in different parts of Nagaland,” said Professor GT Thong from Nagaland University’s department of geology. He believes that the ‘poor villagers’ were misguided by some people and expressed hope that the team of geologists deputed to the village to investigate would officially shed some light on the matter soon.Meanwhile, the Wanching village council has issued a notice prohibiting anyone to post anything in social media regarding the stones and restricted anyone from other villages or towns from entering the village in search of the same. An elderly from the village informed that the village council was dismayed over the spread of unverified information, therefore in the apprehension of the arrival of many visitors following the news of the purported precious stones being found in the village, it has put up an order that anyone wanting to visit the village would require to obtain the council’s permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diamond-rush-in-nagaland-village-govt-deputes-geologists-to-investigate/story-lcTsjuoiU4jYwz0q3q8DDK.html

Seychelles is the last leg of Jaishankar’s three-nation tour that also took him to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, and his main objective in the capital Victoria is to meet newly elected President Wavel Ramkalawan and present a letter from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Jaishankar is set to be the first senior foreign leader to meet Indian-origin Ramkalawan – who in October became the first opposition candidate to be elected president of the archipelago since 1977 – as Seychelles is under strict quarantine norms. Seychelles made a special exemption for the visit. Also read | S Jaishankar meets UAE counterpart; discusses Covid-19, strategic cooperationThe visit coincides with Seychelles joining Bangladesh and Mauritius as observers for a meeting of the trilateral maritime security cooperation dialogue between India, the Maldives and Sri Lanka in Colombo. India is being represented at the talks, which are being held after a gap of six years, by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. “The meeting in Sri Lanka and the external affairs minister’s visit to Seychelles are part of efforts to ramp up security and development cooperation across the Indian Ocean, especially for maritime domain awareness,” said a person familiar with developments who declined to be named. “The Indian side also wants to understand President Ramkalawan’s development priorities to strengthen bilateral cooperation. India has tried to broad-base its relationship through assistance in the form of grants and concessional loans,” the person said. Though development cooperation will top the agenda – India is currently helping Seychelles build a new Government House, police headquarters and attorney general’s office at a total cost of almost $91 million – the Indian side is also expected to discuss the stalled move to build naval facilities on Assumption Island, located about 1,100 km from the main island of Mahe. Though the two sides signed two agreements for this in 2015 and 2018, the construction couldn’t begin because of protests by Opposition parties. Ramkalawan had led the opposition to the project and political parties had refused to ratify the agreements despite the second one incorporating specific clauses to address concerns expressed by some quarters in Seychelles. While China has provided two light aircraft and two warships and financed the building of Seychelles’ Parliament, India has gifted the archipelago three naval boats and two maritime surveillance aircraft and established six coastal radar stations. Experts say such cooperation is crucial for patrolling the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Indian Ocean states and track the movement of vessels, including Chinese warships.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eam-jaishankar-begins-seycelles-visit-to-focus-on-security-development-cooperation/story-VoTRa5VYfeumUyCIKIFIDI.html

They then sent documents purporting to be job descriptions that were laced with malicious code designed to gain access to a victim’s computer.The hacking attempts targeted a “broad set of people” including staff working on Covid-19 research, said one of the sources, but are not thought to have been successful. The North Korean mission to the United Nations in Geneva did not respond to a request for comment. Pyongyang has previously denied carrying out cyberattacks. It has no direct line of contact for foreign media.AstraZeneca, which has emerged as one of the top three Covid-19 vaccine developers, declined to comment.Read more | North Korea executed people, shut capital: South Korean agencyThe sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss non-public information, said the tools and techniques used in the attacks showed they were part of an ongoing hacking campaign that U.S. officials and cybersecurity researchers have attributed to North Korea.The campaign has previously focused on defence companies and media organisations but pivoted to Covid-related targets in recent weeks, according to three people who have investigated the attacks. Cyberattacks against health bodies, vaccine scientists and drugmakers have soared during the Covid-19 pandemic as state-backed and criminal hacking groups scramble to obtain the latest research and information about the outbreak.Western officials say any stolen information could be sold for profit, used to extort the victims, or give foreign governments a valuable strategic advantage as they fight to contain a disease that has killed 1.4 million people worldwide.Microsoft said this month it had seen two North Korean hacking groups target vaccine developers in multiple countries, including by “sending messages with fabricated job descriptions.” Microsoft did not name any of the targeted organisations.South Korean lawmakers said on Friday that the country’s intelligence agency had foiled some of those attempts.

27-11-2020||India||Woman BJP leader, 4 others arrested in human trafficking case in Chhattisgarh||Police arrested five people, including a woman BJP leader of Raipur, in the last five days for their alleged involvement in human trafficking which took place in Dongargarh area of Rajnandgaon district, a senior official said. Rajnandgaon police in a statement claimed that the arrests were made after a married woman, who was abducted and sold off, managed to reach to the police and told her story. Police said that the accused were identified as Sajda Sayyad (32), Salman Khan (30), Junaid Khan (22) and Shubham Tiwari, all residents of Dongargarh and were arrested on November 23. Another accused, Ganga Pande, was nabbed on Thursday from her residence in Raipur. Pande was a ward-level BJP leader in the state capital and was expelled from the party on Friday afternoon. “After the incident came into light, state BJP president Vishnudeo Sai immediately expelled Pandey from the party. She was ward-level leader from north of Raipur,” said state BJP spokesperson Gaurishankar Srivas. Rajnandgaon police claimed that the 23-year-old victim in her statement said she was befriended by Sajda and on September 11 was invited to her home for tea. The victim’s 3-year-old son was with her when she reached her house. Subsequently, the accused had offered her tea mixed with some sedatives and after drinking it she fell unconscious. Also read: Farmers enter Delhi via Tikri border, told to demonstrate at Burari groundWhen she gained consciousness after a few hours, the victim was at Raipur airport from where she was taken to Delhi on a flight. Three other accused who had accompanied her threatened to kill her son if she narrated the incident to anyone, the police claimed. From Delhi, the woman and her son were taken to Haryana by road and were kept in a rented house there. Tiwari allegedly raped the woman before she was being sold to a person identified as Suresh for Rs 1 lakh. “After a few days, the woman tried to escape with her kid from his clutches but she was caught and handed her over to the gang that sold her. The woman was again sold to another man named Rajesh in Haryana for marriage. However, when the woman narrated her ordeal to Rajesh he informed the local police and facilitated her return to Dongargarh,” police said. “After reaching Dongargarh on November 22, the woman lodged a case in this connection and the four accused of the town were immediately arrested. The investigation revealed the involvement of Ganga Pade, a local politician from Raipur who had arranged for the tickets for the accused to travel to Delhi,” the police said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-bjp-leader-4-others-arrested-in-human-trafficking-case-in-chhattisgarh/story-nlRx74LQLwqYJAXFlgDddN.html
27-11-2020||India||Others should look to follow India-Denmark Green Strategic Partnership, says Danish climate minister||India and Denmark recently signed a Green Strategic Partnership, the first such agreement for either country. Dan Jorgensen, the Danish Minister for Climate and Energy, in an interview with Hindustan Times, explained its significance. Edited excerpts:What is the importance of the Green Strategic Partnership? Is this unique in the world?The Green Strategic Partnership is extremely important to both of us and the world. India and Denmark are in a very fortunate situation in that we can really help each over and learn from each other, Denmark is a front runner in renewable energy, especially in offshore wind where we are in the process of using this technology to create “energy islands”. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted about the partnership, “Denmark has the skills, India has the scale.” India has ambitious plans for renewable energy and I am very impressed by these plans. Denmark has skills which could be used to help India achieve those goals. I hesitate to say the partnership is a first, as I am not certain if other countries do not have similar arrangements. But it is the first time Denmark has concluded such a partnership of this sort. We definitely hope other countries look at this strategic partnership as something that they would like to follow. We, as part of a global community, look to the United Nations in climate issues but we must also create bilateral alliances in this field.Denmark and India are very different in size and climate. Why should they have looked to each other to form a partnership?First of all, there is considerable friendship, trust and good cooperation between our two countries. Our authorities are used to working together. We have a record of efficient transfer of knowledge. The scale of the energy transformation that India is undergoing will be a benefit for not only India but also the whole world. India is a key player in fighting climate change. More to the point, if we are to have a chance to fulfil the Paris agreement, India is a key player given its size. Other countries are looking to India to take a leadership role in climate. All of us are impressed by the level of ambition India has shown in green energy. Denmark has many areas of renewable expertise. I believe we can help a lot in wind. We have the greatest experience in offshore wind, with the first offshore wind park set up in Denmark in 1991. There has been remarkable technological advance in this area. In many places, offshore wind competes with coal. Next level of technology is the energy island where many wind parks are connected to an island which serves as an energy hub. We have two islands already, one gigawatt and three gigawatts. We are increasing the second to 10 gigawatts. The technology exists to scale this up and use this power to create hydrogen which can then be used as a liquid fuel for heavy transport including trucks, ships and airplanes. This would solve key problems in renewable energy: one, how do you store energy and, two, how do you put renewable energy into your transport system. Where will green cooperation go in the future?Indian government officials and experts are looking at our plans for offshore wind with interest. But our plans for the future are to take wind energy into a whole new area. We do not see this as a sector in which we are in competition with other countries, this is something where we have to work with other countries with the ultimate aim of global energy transformation. At the global level, first and foremost, we must fulfil the Paris accord. At present, we are not on track globally. But I am an optimist, thanks to the developments among the world’s major emitters, including India, China and the United States. I am especially pleased that the US has pledged to re-enter the Paris accord.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/others-should-look-to-follow-india-denmark-green-strategic-partnership-says-danish-climate-minister/story-DlYUv3ucYlF68h817iA2eP.html

27-11-2020||India||Germany preps vaccine drive as Covid cases hit 1 million||Hulking gray boxes are rolling off the production line at a factory in the southern town of Tuttlingen, ready to be shipped to the front in the next phase of Germany’s battle against the coronavirus as it became the latest country to hit the milestone of 1 million confirmed cases Friday.Man-sized freezers such as those manufactured by family-owned firm Binder GmbH could become a key part of the vast immunization program the German government is preparing to roll out when the first vaccines become available next month.That’s because one of the front-runners in the race for a vaccine is BioNTech, a German company that together with U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has developed a shot it says is up to 96% effective in trials but comes with a small hitch: it needs to be cooled to minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) for shipping and storage.Ensuring such temperatures, colder even than an Antarctic winter, is just one of the many challenges that countries face in trying to get their populations immunized.The effort has been compared to a military operation. Indeed some countries, including Germany, are relying on military and civilian expertise to ensure the precious doses are safely transported from manufacturing plants to secret storage facilities, before being distributed.Read more| Germany passes 1 million Covid cases since start of pandemicGermany has benefited from the market power that comes with being a member of the European Union. The 27-nation bloc’s executive Commission — led by former German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen — has spearheaded negotiations with vaccine makers, ordering more than a billion doses so far.German officials have said the country hopes to secure up to 300 million doses from the EU orders and bilateral deals with three manufacturers in Germany, including BioNTech and CureVac, a company based in Tuebingen that says its vaccine can be stored at regular refrigerator temperatures for up to three months. Its trials are not as far along, however, as Pfizer/BioNTech and others.The figure of 300 million is contingent on all vaccines being developed making it to market. That would be more than enough to immunize Germany’s population of 83 million, even if two shots are required, as seems likely.How exactly the vaccine is delivered to patients differs from country to country. In Germany, the federal government has delegated the task to its 16 states, which are now working to build large vaccination centers.The city-state of Berlin has drafted in Albrecht Broemme, a veteran of disaster management. The former Berlin fire chief later led Germany’s federal civil protection organization THW, where he helped organize disaster relief operations for floods, storms and quakes around the world.The 67-year-old is now coordinating the setting-up of six vaccine hubs in Berlin in a convention center, two former airports, an ice skating rink, a concert hall and an indoor cycle race track.Authorities want them ready by mid-December to begin vaccinating more than 3,000 people per day at each location. With just a few minutes to deliver each shot and mindful of keeping the number of people in each center at a minimum, Broemme and his colleagues are devising a one-way flow system similar to that found in large stores like furniture company Ikea.Each site will be run by a medical aid group, such as the Red Cross, with volunteers to help register and guide people through the venue.Like elsewhere, the first phase of vaccination in Berlin will likely focus on immunizing health care workers and vulnerable groups such as the elderly and those with chronic illnesses. About 20,000 people will be vaccinated each day, returning after three weeks for a booster shot.Demand is likely to outstrip supply at first, but that will change as more vaccines come onto the market.“We’re hopeful that approvals in the field of vaccination will be issued very quickly,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told parliament on Thursday. “That won’t solve the problem immediately, but there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.”Broemme has said he expects four-fifths of the vaccines initially available to need ultra-low cooling. That means every center will need a pharmacy that handles both the storage and thawing of vaccines.At the other end of the country in Tuttlingen, Binder GmbH, one of hundreds of medical device manufacturers in the town, some with a history dating back to the 19th century, is seeing demand for its freezers surge.Priced at 13,000-15,000 euros ($15,500-17,900), each device can keep tens of thousands of vials of vaccine at optimum temperature, says Peter Wimmer, the company’s head of innovation.“It’s plug and play,” he told the AP. “All you need is an electrical socket, switch it on and the device is ready to go.”Having the whole vaccination system ready to go at the touch of a button is a different matter, though.It is still unclear who will actually administer the vaccines in Berlin. Unlike Britain, which has a centralized National Health Service organizing the immunization drive, Germany is relying on doctors associations to provide the necessary medical staff.Doerthe Arnold, a spokeswoman for the Berlin branch of Germany’s Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, said they are still waiting for the state government to provide details on what will be required of doctors.“Despite the positive feedback from doctors practices that they’re willing to help out even more, providing medical personnel for the six vaccination centers will be a challenge,” she said.The limits of medical logistics were tested in spring, when huge worldwide demand for ventilators, therapeutic drugs, face masks and other protective equipment prompted bidding wars, bottlenecks and reports of faulty products.Global logistics company DHL estimates that to provide worldwide coverage of vaccines over the coming two years may require 15,000 flights.“The challenge is the sheer number of doses and the fact that it’s not clear which vaccine needs to go where,” Sabine Hartmann, a DHL spokeswoman, told The AP. “It’s not something a single company can do on its own. All logistics companies have to work together on this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/germany-preps-vaccine-drive-as-covid-cases-hit-1-million/story-LjP3D4zT5T4Zy9Hnd8BFNM.html

The 31-year-old leader, whose party emerged the single largest party in the just concluded elections, also referred to Nitish Kumar’s ‘8-9 children’ jibe during campaigning.Nitish Kumar seemed very displeased as soon as Tejashwi Yadav once again got up for rebuttal after parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary gave pointed clarification on the charges and urged the Chair to restrain members from making unsubstantiated charges.“I urge the chair to remove objectionable and unsubstantiated remarks from the proceedings, as despite clear court orders, baseless allegations are being made against the leader of the House ,” said Choudhary.However, Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha said that he would get the matter examined and then take action. At this point, Tejashwi again reiterated his allegations.CM Kumar, angry with consistent assault on his image, got up to defend himself.“He is making absurd allegations. He is lying. I kept mum for far too long, as he happens to be the son of a brother-like friend. I did not speak, hoping he will mend his ways,” Kumar said as leaders of the treasury and opposition benched trooped into the well and nearly came to blows before the marshals intervened.“He should know that I was the one who made his father the Legislature party leader.

Everyone knows the court orders in my case and he is still repeating lies. I tolerated everything, but now it is too much,” the CM said.As the pandemonium continued, the marshals stepped in. The Speaker adjourned the House for half an hour. It is the last day of the five-day session.Right from the start of the session, the opposition has been on the offensive and it had also forced election for the Speaker’s post, which also witnessed adjournments and furore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/son-of-brother-like-friend-nitish-kumar-to-tejashwi-yadav-s-sharp-attack/story-zVy12E8wvxTrQmpqXVmTUK.html

We’re thankful to the administration for giving us permission to protest. We’re happy and only want a peaceful resolution to the issue.”Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh also welcomed the move to allow the agitating farmers to enter Delhi and continue with their stir.

Another 3.67 billion baht ($121 million) agreement for the purchase of the trial vaccine, known as AZD1222, was signed by the Health Ministry’s Disease Control Department.“We have followed the vaccine manufacturers globally, but this group has achieved very high progress,” Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said at the signing. “They are likely to be able to produce the vaccine early next year. Most importantly, we have to get ourselves ready for the domestic process including packaging and logistics.”Read more | Malaysia secures 12.8 million doses of Pfizer vaccine, delivery from first quarterGovernment spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri said officials are still considering how to prioritize vaccine recipients. “Those who work closely with Covid-19 patients, for example, doctors and nurses, should be among the first people. But this needs further discussion,” he said.Oxford and AstraZeneca reported Monday that their trial vaccine appeared to be 62% effective in people who received two doses, and 90% effective when volunteers were given a half dose followed by a full dose.They did not mention at the time, but later acknowledged, that a manufacturing issue had resulted in “a half dose of the vaccine being administered as the first dose” to some participants, a development that led to criticism that its test results were flawed.AstraZeneca has said it plans to conduct a new global clinical trial to make a fresh assessment of the vaccine’s efficacy.The AstraZeneca trial vaccine is regarded as having several advantages over rival vaccines being developed so far for less-developed countries, including cheaper cost and the ability to be stored at temperatures not as cold as the others.Under a separate deal in October, the Health Ministry, Siam Bioscience Co. and the SCG business conglomerate signed a letter of intent with AstraZeneca on the manufacturing and supply of the AZD1222 vaccine candidate. It would allow Siam Bioscience to produce the vaccine at its own plant, with a starting date targeted for the middle of next year.Siam Bioscience said that if plans proceed smoothly, Thailand would become the first country in Southeast Asia to produce the vaccine.Thailand has had 3,961 confirmed cases of the coronavirus since January, including 60 deaths. While it has coped well with the health aspects of the crisis, the measures it has taken to combat the disease, most notably stopping tourist flights into the country, have badly hurt its economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/thailand-signs-supply-deals-for-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine/story-D9MckniV3y5J0vgVEpYUnK.html
27-11-2020||India||Farmers protesting against farm laws detained on Lucknow outskirts||Over 60 farmers were detained on Friday after they tried to block the busy Sultanpur Road on the outskirts of Lucknow during a protest against the three agricultural laws, the police said. Other protestors were dispersed. The agitating farmers were from the rural pockets of Lucknow and adjoining districts.Joint commissioner of police (law and order) Naveen Arora said following local intelligence inputs, heavy force had been deployed at various vulnerable points on the outskirts of the city in order to check the entry of protestors into the state capital. He added that some protestors were detained.Despite the elaborate security arrangements, a large group of farmers associated with the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) reached Sultanpur Road to support the anti-farm laws agitation. The farmers said their protest was against the new laws, harassment in the name of stubble burning and several other issues.“The protest was staged on the call of our union against the government’s anti-farmer policies,” said Anil Dubey, a farmer who was heading the protest here in the state capital.The three laws, which according to the farmers would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, are: The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.Also Read: Farmers in western UP block highways in support of ‘Chalo Dilli’ marchSome farmers also criticised the government’s wheat procurement system, saying it was another way to harass farmers.“Wheat is not being procured in an effective way. Also, the farmers are being harassed in the name of stubble burning. FIRs are being lodged against poor farmers. We strongly oppose the harassment of farmers,” another farmer said.A group of farmers staged a march from Bagiyamau to the main Sultanpur highway where they were detained.Also Read: Punjab CM welcomes Centre’s decision to allow protesting farmers to enter DelhiThe protest call was given by several farmers’ unions associated with the All India Kisan Sangharsh Co-ordination Committee.Other than Sultanpur Road on Shaheed Path, heavy police force was deployed on the Faizabad Road near Chinhat in anticipation of protests.

Some of them had even been arriving at former chief minister Rabri Devi’s 10, Circular Road residence since morning. But they were asked to go back and wait for the high court’s order,” said former party legislator and one of Yadav’s close confidantes, Bhola Yadav. A crowd had been building up at Rabri Devi’s residence since morning, holding banners and party flag. “Bihar government would be compelled to toe the line of social justice once Laluji gets out of jail,” said Ram Balak Yadav, a native of Panapur, who was present in the crowd.Talking to media persons, Rabri Devi said she had immense faith in the judiciary and she would welcome whatever the court decided.

The Punjab chief minister also renewed his appeal to the Centre to initiate talks with the farmers to resolve the simmering issue.“The Centre should now move quickly towards holding further talks with the Kisan Unions to thrash out the problem triggered by the agricultural legislations which have threatened the lives and livelihoods of the farmers,” Singh said in a statement.Click here for live updates on farmers protestSingh’s comments came minutes after Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava said that the agitating farmers will be permitted inside the national capital and hold a peaceful protest at the Nirankari Samagam Ground in the city’s Burari area. Expecting a possible law and order challenge, the Delhi Police earlier in the day sought permission from the state government to turn nine of the city’s stadiums into temporary detention centres for the protesting farmers. The Arvind Kejriwal government, however, turned down the request.Singh also slammed the Manohar Khattar-led government in Haryana for its use of force to stop farmers despite the Centre’s nod. “Though the central government has allowed the farmers to enter the national capital to exercise their democratic right to protest, the Haryana government is engaged in a confrontationist approach against the farmers moving towards Delhi,” he said.Commenting on the police action on the agitating farmers on reaching Haryana, the Punjab chief minister said, “What’s the need for such harsh measures? This barbarism needs to stop right now @mlkhattar ji.” “The farmers did not inflict even an iota of damage to any public property over the past three months of their protest, and here is a state government that is brazenly and shamelessly digging up roads made of public money,” he added.Thousands of farmers from northern states including Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, are headed towards Delhi as part of their ‘Dilli Chalo’ protest march. On Thursday, the farmers from Punjab broke barricades and forced their way into Haryana, braving tear gas shells and water cannons en route to Delhi, where security was heightened to stop them from entering the Capital.After high drama unfolded in Haryana over police action, the farmers from Punjab and Haryana then gathered at Panipat on Friday and jointly resumed their march to Delhi for an indefinite protest against the farm laws- The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020- cleared by the Parliament during the monsoon session in September.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to step up its drive of reaching out to farmers across the country in a bid to dispel concerns about the farm legislation. Concerned about the impact that the tussle will have on the ground, senior ministers have also been urged to initiate dialogue with farmers’ unions to call off the stir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protests-punjab-cm-welcomes-centre-s-decision-to-allow-protesting-farmers-to-enter-delhi/story-7jNu3rXY4yAl8gHJM6JOOM.html

Adequate police arrangements were made in the view of the protests and traffic was diverted to other routes to prevent jams on highways, additional director general of police (Meerut zone) Rajeev Sabharwal said.The Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) had given the call for blocking highways in UP to show their solidarity with farmers from Punjab and Haryana who are on the way to the national capital as part of their ‘Chalo Dilli’ agitation against the new farm laws.Farmers fear the three laws-- The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020-- would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations while doing away with the minimum support price (MSP) regime.Also Read: Farmers to be allowed into Delhi, says top cop, identifies protest site for themIn Meerut, a groom and his family members were stuck in the traffic jam and they had to walk to their destination to join the marriage ceremony.Dharmendra Malik, state spokesperson of BKU, said BKU leader Rakesh Tikait led the protest at Nawla on National Highway 58 in Muzaffarnagar.Also Read: ‘Only solution is...’ Haryana CM urges farmers to stop protestsHe said the future course of the movement would depend on Union government’s attitude towards thousands of farmers marching towards Delhi.He recalled that over five lakh farmers had staged a protest in Delhi for seven days in 1988 under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Tikait, compelling the then Rajiv Gandhi government at the Centre to accept their demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-in-western-up-block-highways-in-support-of-chalo-dilli-march/story-r75csKcfSSBqtmYmbPMDEO.html
27-11-2020||India||Britain presses on with AstraZeneca vaccine amid questions over trial data||Britain gave AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine a vote of confidence on Friday when it asked its regulator to assess it for a rollout after experts raised questions about trial data and the company said it may run another study to gauge the shot’s efficacy. The UK government has secured 100 million doses of the vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, the most supplies it has ordered of any shot to fight the pandemic.The British drugmaker expects 4 million doses to be available in the country by the end of next month, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock aims for a rollout to begin before Christmas.“We have formally asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, to understand the data and determine whether it meets rigorous safety standards,” Hancock said.“This letter is an important step towards deploying a vaccine as quickly as safely possible.”Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) started an accelerated “rolling review” of the vaccine at the start of this month as data comes in on safety and efficacy.In the global race to develop vaccines against Covid-19, AstraZeneca’s candidate is viewed as offering one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheaper price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures.Officials in the Philippines said on Friday they would secure 2.6 million shots of the AstraZeneca shot - the country’s first supply deal for a Covid-19 vaccine - and were negotiating a possible purchase of a further 1 million doses.The announcements came despite some scientists raising doubts about the robustness of results showing the shot was 90% effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, by error initially, received a half dose followed by a full dose.AstraZeneca had released trial data on Monday that showed its experimental vaccine prevented on average 70% of COVID-19 cases in late-stage trials in Britain and Brazil.While the success rate was 90% in the sub-group, some experts said the relatively small number of participants made it harder to be confident in the findings.AstraZeneca said the administering of the half dose in the trial had been reviewed and approved by independent data safety monitors and the UK regulator, adding that the regulator publicly confirmed there was “no concern”.CEO Pascal Soriot said on Thursday, though, that the drugmaker was likely to run an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its vaccine using the lower dosage. Pauline Londeix, co-founder of French drug transparency group OT-Med, said the apparent confusion over the trial results was “very problematic for public confidence in vaccines”. “It has largely to do with the race drugmakers are engaged in currently, which leads them to present vaccine candidates in the best possible way and not release full protocols and results. It is the opposite of what is needed in our view.” Nonetheless, Britain’s top science adviser said on Thursday that the interim results showed the AstraZeneca vaccine was successful.“The headline result is the vaccine works and that’s very exciting,” Patrick Vallance said during a news conference with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Shares in AstraZeneca were down 0.8% at around 0830 GMT. They have fallen about 7% since it reported the vaccine data on Monday.Only 2,741 volunteers were in the sub-group of the AstraZeneca-Oxford trial that gave the 90% efficacy read-out, a fraction of the tens of thousands in trials that resulted in the above 90% efficacy data released earlier this month for Pfizer-BioNTech’s and Moderna’s vaccines.“Sub-group analyses in randomised controlled trials are always fraught with difficulties,” said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia.“In order to have faith in the results,” Hunter said, any sub-group analysis “should be sufficiently powered” with large numbers of volunteers to take readings from. In contrast to AstraZeneca’s stock price drop this week, Moderna has rallied 22% since releasing its vaccine trial data on Nov. 16 and Pfizer and BioNTech are up 6% and 14% respectively since announcing their successful data on Nov. 9.The U.S. regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has not commented on AstraZeneca’s vaccine trial results. The European Medicines Agency said on Thursday it would “assess data on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine in the coming weeks once they have been received from the company”.Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for the US government’s vaccine programme Operation Warp Speed, has also highlighted gaps in the trial data.He said no-one in the subgroup that got the initial half dose was older than 55 - suggesting the regimen’s efficacy in crucial older age groups is unproven in this interim data.In the group that received a correct full dose followed by a full dose, he noted, older people were included.“There are a number of variables that we need to understand, and what has been the role of each one of them in achieving the difference in efficacy,” Slaoui told a briefing on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/britain-presses-on-with-astrazeneca-vaccine-amid-questions-over-trial-data/story-pwIsBzH51DF067AybWtQbO.html

27-11-2020||India||BJP promises implementation of Bodo accord, development ahead of BTC polls in Assam||The Bharatiya Janata Party has promised all-round development and peace in Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) apart from implementation of the Bodo accord if it wins the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) polls scheduled next month. Polling for BTC, which administers the four districts under BTR, will take place on December 7 and December 10 and the BJP is aiming to upset Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), its coalition partner in the State government. BPF has been in power in the council for 17 years since 2003. Relations between the BJP and the BPF soured after election to BTC, originally scheduled for April this year, was postponed due to Covid-19 pandemic and the BTR areas were placed under the governor’s rule. Both parties are contesting the BTC polls independently. In a bid to woo voters, BJP released its manifesto for the polls in Kokrajhar on Friday. The programme was attended by BJP state unit chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass, finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, former Rajya Sabha MP Biswajit Daimary (who left BPF this month and joined the BJP) and BJP national general secretary and Lok Sabha MP from Assam Dilip Saikia. “It is our resolve that BJP will come to power in BTC on our own without support from anyone. We have got immense support from the masses wherever we have gone. It clearly shows that the next government in BTC will be formed by our party,” said Sarma. The manifesto promises to implement the Bodo accord signed in Delhi in January this year in letter and spirit. Sarma said there will be fresh delimitation of seats in BTC, which will increase from 40 at present to 60. “Apart from the usual reservations on basis of caste and tribes, there will be an additional 10% reservation for economically weaker sections in jobs. Land certificates will be given to those staying on government land for several years,” said Sarma. He assured that all political murders that took place in BTR in the past 10 years will be probed and the culprits nabbed. The manifesto promised at least 100 km of roads to be constructed in each of the 40 constituencies under the BTC. Also Read: Former Assam CM Tarun Gogoi’s son seeks blessings to fulfil his father’s last wish Other promises include a campus for Bodoland University at Udalguri, a medical college in Tamulpur, formation of a separate district of Tamulpur, a government college in each sub-division, a 30-bedded hospital in each of the 40 constituencies and 40 stadiums in the region. Accusing BPF of large-scale corruption, Sarma said that from now onwards at least 70% of funds allocated to BTC will have to be spent on constructing capital assets. A guideline in that regard will be issued by state government within the next 15 days. “Records show that BTC was getting nearly Rs 3,000 crore each year as funds from the Centre and state government. If we come to power, we will be able to fulfil all our promises and more with that kind of money,” said Sarma. Also Read: Assam reports no new Covid-19 deaths, tally rises to 2,12,171Sarma said that despite getting around Rs 15,000 crore in funds in the past 5 years, there are no roads, schools, hospitals in BTC areas. “We request voters to ensure BJP comes to power in BTC so that there is peace and all round development. In constituencies where we have not fielded candidates, please ensure defeat of BPF and support Independent candidates backed by our party,” he added. BJP state chief Dass stressed that the alliance between the two parties won’t continue in the next assembly polls scheduled in March-April next year and the saffron party would contest all 12 assembly seats in BTR alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-promises-implementation-of-bodo-accord-development-ahead-of-btc-polls-in-assam/story-LfPEbJxSuV7xRNeCEQf9YI.html

While vials for the same arrived in Kolkata on Thursday, the trial is expected to start in December. State urban development minister Firhad Hakim has offered to become a volunteer. “We are looking for volunteers who reside preferably within a range of 10 km radius from the institute. The volunteers will have to sign an undertaking that they will not leave their present address for the next one year, as they need to be closely monitored,” said a senior NICED official. NICED in Kolkata is one of the institutes in India which has been selected to conduct the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO)-approved regulatory trials. It would be conducted in around 25 sites across 10 states. The trial has already started at a few sites. Also read | Beginning 2021, India to produce 100 million doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine“As of now, we have urged volunteers to contact us over phone or email. Around 1,000 volunteers would be enrolled in this trial after screening for their eligibility criteria. The eligible participants will be contacted for further details. The enrolment will continue until the target number is achieved,” said the official. Covaxin – the first indigenously-developed anti-coronavirus vaccine – is being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). As part of the trial application, a dose of 0.5 ml would be given on day 1 and again on day 28. “We have already received a few hundred vials from Hyderabad on Thursday. The clinical trial would start soon,” said an official. Out of the 1,000 volunteers, while 500 will get the trial vaccine, the remaining will get placebo shots. The placebo will help researchers compare the two groups and understand how effectively the vaccine is working. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on November 24 told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Bengal is prepared for vaccination programme. “West Bengal is fully prepared with trained man power and required infrastructure, including cold chains for the vaccination programme. We are ready to work with the Centre and other stakeholders to ensure speedy vaccination drive for every one as soon as the vaccine is available,” Banerjee had told Modi, according to a statement released by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vials-for-phase-3-trials-of-covaxin-arrive-in-kolkata-niced-looking-for-volunteers/story-1isBNzj4t0h1uJ6x8jP1SN.html

Rath later resigned from the channel.Expressing its displeasure over the manner in which the government and its agencies acted, the Guild said such acts undermined the independent functioning of media organisations. The Guild, in its executive committee meeting early this month, had said it would set up a fact finding panels to assess media freedom issues in regions and states like Odisha, Kashmir, Telangana and UP where such rights have allegedly been compromised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-fire-over-press-freedom-odisha-announces-sops-for-journalists/story-3vEKuExpjLqTEGQh1ovwYK.html

This concession is given in view of the reason, also mentioned in my order dated September 28,” Justice Yogesh Khanna said on Thursday.On the court’s direction, Verma and his family members have been provided with three security personnel round the clock.Advocates Maninder Singh and Dinhar Takiar, representing Verma, submitted that he be provided security at least till his statement is recorded in the case.Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Delhi govt refuses permission to convert 9 stadiums into detention centersDelhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain read out the affidavit filed by the state in which the necessity of providing the security cover to Verma was mentioned but only till the polygraph test was conducted on him. Polygraph test has already been conducted on him in December 2018.The counsel further submitted that on assessment of the threat perception by the Deputy Commissioner of Police, he was not inclined to continue the security cover given to Verma and said that the CBI should file a reply if he is required as a witness in this case. The court noted that it was an admitted fact that the Witness Protection Committee has not recommended for security cover.While Congress leader Jagdish Tytler, who has been given clean chit thrice by the CBI, has refused to undergo the test, Verma had given conditional consent saying he is ready to undergo the test if he was provided round-the-clock security as he feared threat to his life.The court had earlier said the submission of Verma’s counsel that his presence may be required at the time of trial cannot be brushed aside lightly and also noted that it has been the CBI’s claim that he is an important witness.Verma had sought direction to the authorities to continue to provide security to him nd his family in view of the imminent threat to life and property of them, if he does not withdraw himself from being a witness in the riots case and also for undergoing polygraph test (lie detection test).Verma was first provided security in 2017.The counsel told the high court that Verma’s lie detection test was conducted for three days from December 4 to 6, 2018 and the next day he received a threat again.The petition said that on December 20, 2019 an open threat letter was received by the CMM giving threat to the presiding officer and the counsel for the Complainant and the witnesses of the case.The case pertains to the riots at Gurudwara Pulbangash in North Delhi where three people were killed on November 1, 1984, a day after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.Also Read | No prima facie case against Arnab Goswami in abetment to suicide case, says SCTytler, who has denied any role in the riots, was thrice given clean chit by the CBI in the case, but the agency was directed by the court to further investigate the matter.

He was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly conspiring with Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists to get their support during the 2019 parliamentary elections. Parra had filed his nomination for the election beginning from November 28.On Thursday, the NIA produced Parra in a Delhi court and sought a transit remand for his production before a designated court in Jammu. Parra was taken to Jammu and produced before a designated NIA court which remanded him to 15-day custody. It has been alleged that Parra has “close links” with some Irfan Shafi Mir, who was arrested along with Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Naveed Babu and suspended Deputy Superintendent of Police Davinder Singh earlier this year.Early on Friday, PDP president and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti and her daughter Iltija claimed that they had been detained at their residence to prevent them from visiting the house of Parra in Pulwama in South Kashmir.“Their cruelty knows no bounds. Waheed was arrested on baseless charges and I am not allowed to even console his family. Even my daughter Iltija has been placed under house arrest because she also wanted to visit Waheed’s family,” Mehbooba tweeted.According to the officials, during the investigation into Singh’s association with Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists, the NIA came across phone records of Mir which showed that he was in close contact with Parra.Mir had claimed during questioning that Parra sought his support during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections for his party candidate Mehbooba Mufti, a former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir and also president of the PDP, the officials said.

I appeal to all the farming brothers to directly talk to the Centre for all their legitimate issues. The movement is not the way. The solution will come only through conversation,” Khattar wrote on Twitter.Punjab Chief Minister Amrinder Singh urged the Centre to hold talks with farmers to diffuse the situation. “The voice of farmers cannot be muzzled indefinitely.

But the government is not ready to show them and tell them where it is written that they have the legal right of MSP. The Prime Minister, who is concerned about one country, one election, should implement one nation, one behaviour,” read the Congress leader’s tweet (roughly translated from Hindi).Farmers from Haryana and Punjab are heading to the national capital as part of the protest march against the Centre’s farm laws. Police deployed on the Delhi border in view of the farmers’ movement and all vehicles heading towards the national capital are being checked.Apart from the presence of personnel, barricading laced with barbwires was placed to stop the approaching protestors.While the government said the three laws will do away with middlemen, enabling farmers to sell their produce in the commercial markets, protestors fear that this could lead to the government not buying produce at guaranteed prices, thereby disrupting their timely payments.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested a single voters’ list for Lok Sabha, Assembly and local polls and reiterated the need for “one nation, one election” in the country.“One nation, one election isn’t just a matter of debate, this is the need for India. Elections are held at different places every few months, the effect it has on development work is known to all. This issue needs to be studied and presiding officers can be guiding force for it,” the Prime Minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-should-implement-one-nation-one-behaviour-priyanka-gandhi-targets-centre-over-farmers-agitation/story-DMU4he7YzpNKv5qUFzhghL.html

Conflicting claims on Lalu’s jail stay adds twist to bail plea||The Jharkhand high court on Friday deferred hearing on RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s bail plea in connection with one of the fodder scam cases to December 11.The former Bihar chief minister has been languishing in jail since December 23, 2017, after his conviction in three fodder scam cases in quick succession.Prasad has already secured bail in two cases. He moved bail application in the third and the last case on the ground that he had completed half (42 months & 28 days) of the seven years sentence awarded to him in the case.But, the CBI, in its reply, said that Prasad in this case had only completed 34 months and some days in custody, which is still about eight months short of the half-sentence mark.In order to clear the ambiguity, Prasad’s senior lawyer Kapil Sibal sought two weeks’ time to furnish a detailed computation of the period served by his client in custody.The bench of justice Aparesh Kumar Singh then posted the matter for further hearing on December 11.The case relates to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 3.76 crore from Dumka treasury during December 1995 to January 1996.A special CBI court, in 2018, had sentenced Prasad to 14 years of imprisonment--seven under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections and another seven under Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act-- in the said case.It had expressly said that both sentences would run consecutively.However, Prasad’s lawyers hope that the high court will strike down this decision, and let the two sentences run concurrently. If that happens, Prasad has to undergo seven-year imprisonment in this case. Also Read: Storm over bribe phone calls ends Lalu Prasad’s VIP bungalow stayThe RJD leader, who has been undergoing treatment in custody at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) for over two years, pleaded that he had completed half of the seven year sentence awarded to him in this case.He argued that in earlier two cases he was granted bail on completing half of the sentences.Prasad’s Ranchi-based lawyer Prabhat Kumar said, “According to our calculation, Prasad has completed 42 months and 28 days in prison. This is more than half of the seven-year sentence.”Prasad had suffered a major jolt in the fodder scam case on September 30, 2013, when a trial court in Ranchi held him guilty in the first of six cases against him. The conviction got him five years in prison, disqualification from the Parliament and a ban on contesting elections. He was given bail by the Supreme Court in December that year.His troubles renewed in 2017-18 when he was convicted and sentenced to different terms of imprisonment in three separate fodder scam cases in quick succession. He is still facing trial in two cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/34-months-or-42-conflicting-claims-on-lalu-s-jail-stay-adds-twist-to-bail-plea/story-ZeHAAOzI9UsVin3ZH8zSxJ.html

Mehta told the bench that the ongoing Covid-19 wave appears to be harsher than before and ten states are currently contributing 77 per cent of the total positive cases. The bench observed that strict measures are needed to deal with the situation and posted the matter for further hearing on December 1. The top court on November 23 had said that the Covid-19 pandemic has “worsened” in Delhi and gone “out of control” in Gujarat and had directed the Centre and all states to apprise it within two days of the steps taken to contain the situation nationwide. The situation is likely to worsen in December and all states have to be ready to “combat” it, the top court had said while expressing concern over the spurt in coronavirus cases across the country. It had said the court was of the view that immediate steps are required to be taken by all the states as well as by the Centre. The bench was hearing the matter in which it had taken cognizance regarding need for proper treatment of Covid-19 patients and dignified handling of dead bodies in the hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-takes-cognizance-of-fire-incident-at-covid-19-hospital-in-rajkot/story-DRSkxZ1w6Mz6p4K8BIlWmM.html
27-11-2020||India||BJP to renew farmer outreach to explain farm laws||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to step up its drive of reaching out to farmers across the country in a bid to dispel concerns about the farm legislation. In the wake of agitation intensifying against the farm laws that were passed in the monsoon session of Parliament amid severe protest from the Opposition, the party has decided to accelerate its outreach, said a person aware of the details. In September, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s instruction to the party cadre to spread awareness about the farm legislation, the BJP carried out a 15-day campaign where senior leaders, ministers, MPs and party functionaries reached out to farmers explaining the intricacies of the new laws. “The Prime Minister had urged the BJP workers to reach out to the farmers on the ground and explain in simple language the importance and intricacies of reforms, which are aimed at empowering them. This exercise was carried out across the country. In villages, chaupals were held, pamphlets were distributed and farmers were explained the benefits they stand to gain from the new law. However, given the Opposition’s attempt to mislead the farmers, this exercise will be renewed,” said a functionary aware of the details. Also read | Amarinder Singh, Manohar Lal Khattar spar over police actionAs protesting farmers continued with the Dilli Chalo march on Friday and faced tear gas shells, water cannons and batons at the Haryana-Delhi border, the party is concerned by the impact that the tussle will have on the ground. Senior ministers have also been urged to initiate dialogue with farmers’ unions to call off the stir. Even as the Opposition claims that the new laws do not protect the rights of the farmers, the BJP has blamed the Congress for creating misapprehension. Congress-ruled states such as Punjab and Rajasthan have drafted their own laws to negate the central laws. The BJP however, refers to its recent win in Bihar, and a clutch of by-elections in states such as Madhya Pradesh, as evidence of its popularity and support for its policies. “The Opposition has been misleading the farmers. If the farmers were not convinced by the laws, then the party would not have won elections in Bihar, Gujarat and MP where farmers are in good numbers,” said Rajkumar Chahar, head of the BJP’s Kisan Morcha. Chahar cited a tweet by Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as proof of Congress misleading the farmers. “She (Gandhi) said the laws take away the MSP, which is grossly incorrect. She says the laws will favour the big players, which is also incorrect. The laws empower farmers with small holdings, it seeks to increase farm income and the only ones who will not benefit are the middle men,” Chahar said. On Thursday, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had tweeted that the government, instead of listening to the voice of the farmer protesting against the law which end minimum support price, is attacking them with water cannons. “Everything is being taken away from the farmers and banks, loan waivers, airport railway stations are being distributed to the capitalists,” she tweeted. On the police action against the farmers, Chahar said farmers need to be shown respect, but the Opposition has put their lives in danger. “Capt. Amarinder (Punjab CM) should have realised that Delhi is in the throes of the Covid-19 pandemic and by pushing the farmers to protest and come out in large numbers, violating social distancing norms, he has put their lives in danger.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-to-renew-farmer-outreach-to-explain-farm-laws/story-HZDh1rLB5d7nnZWwByfwKL.html

Col. Prasad Purohit questioning his prosecution in the bomb blast case without a valid sanction for the purpose.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik on Friday allowed Bilal’s intervention application.Bilal lost his son in the powerful blast outside a shrine in Malegaon on September 29, 2008. In all, six persons were killed and 101 others were injured in the blast.On October 23, 2008, Maharashtra anti-terrorists squad made its first arrests in the case by apprehending Sadhvi and two of her associates. On January 20, 2009, the agency filed a charge-sheet in the case after completing its investigation. Two months later, on April 1, 2011, the case was transferred to the NIA.Purohit has moved the HC claiming that he was being prosecuted for actions while discharging his duty as an army officer, but there was no proper sanction to prosecute him, as mandated under provisions of the criminal procedure code.Purohit’s counsel claims that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had failed to get a prior sanction under section 197 of the CrPC to prosecute him and therefore it was illegal. During the first hearing of Purohit’s plea, his counsel and former attorney general, Mukul Rohtagi, had told the bench that Purohit had been working for the Indian Army’s military intelligence unit.Also Read: Lost vision in one eye, suffered ‘torture’ due to Congress: Pragya ThakurHe said Purohit had attended conspiracy meetings before the 2008 Malegaon blast as part of “discharging his duties” as a military intelligence officer.Bilal had filed an application seeking to intervene and oppose Purohit’s plea. It was, however, strenuously opposed by Purohit’s counsel, advocate Neela Gokhale. She pointed out that Bilal’s intervention in this matter was completely unwarranted as HC was only required to examine whether there is a valid sanction to prosecute Purohit in the case.Bilal’s counsel had argued that he had a right to be heard since he was not only an “aggrieved party” but also an intervening party in the trial in the case pending hearing before a special NIA court in Mumbai.HC, however, accepted Bilal’s contentions and allowed him to intervene in this petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malegaon-blast-victim-s-father-allowed-to-contest-lt-col-purohit-s-plea/story-3bigrIwBbqjqPYwsmumxjP.html
27-11-2020||India||Nepal will be beneficiary when India rolls out Covid-19 vaccine: Foreign secretary Shringla||Five promising Covid-19 vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of trials in India and Nepal will be among the beneficiaries when the vaccine is finally rolled out, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Friday. Shringla reiterated India’s commitment to help countries in the region in the fight against the pandemic on the second day of his two-day visit to Nepal aimed at restoring normalcy in the bilateral relationship after a border row earlier this year. During meetings with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali and foreign secretary Bharat Raj Paudyal on Thursday, Shringla discussed ways to address the boundary issue through existing mechanisms. Both sides also focused on the need to respect each other’s sensitivities. Shringla talked about Covid-19-related cooperation while delivering a virtual lecture at the Asian Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs (AIDIA) in Kathmandu, where he spoke briefly in Nepali. Also read | Beginning 2021, India to produce 100 million doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine“We are on the cusp of the availability of a vaccine for the novel Coronavirus. As the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, India is at the forefront of this effort. We have at least five promising vaccine candidates at advanced stages of trials, and dozens of sites across India are conducting vaccine trials on all ages and social groups,” he said. “I would like to assure the people of Nepal that once a vaccine is rolled out, meeting Nepal’s requirement would be a priority for us.” The similarity of the genetic profiles of both countries means that a vaccine which works in India is likely to work for Nepal as well, Shringla said. “Together we will recover from the pandemic and together will protect our people,” he added. Among the vaccines being tested in India are the AstraZeneca vaccine, Russia’s Sputnik V and another developed by Bharat BioTech. Shringla also said India is determined to emerge from the pandemic with a stronger economy and robust industrial capacities, and called on Nepal to share in the dreams of building a new India. “We cannot do it alone, we need each other,” he said. India’s market is open to Nepal’s companies and the neighbouring country’s hydropower potential could be a source of clean energy, he pointed out. In keeping with his visit’s objective to taking forward cooperation on connectivity and infrastructure projects, Shringla noted that Kathmandu had changed since his last visit about a decade ago but the “hearts and smiles of friends and interlocutors remain unchanged”. “For India, Nepal is fundamental to our neighbourhood first approach. India’s development and modernisation are incomplete and intrinsically and symbiotically linked to the development and modernisation of neighbouring countries such as Nepal,” he said. Shringla said his meetings with Nepal’s leadership had left him with no doubt that the two countries are on the same page and that the relationship rests on four pillars – development cooperation, stronger connectivity, expanded infrastructure and economic projects, and enhanced access to education in India. More than 100 high-impact community projects had been completed in all 77 districts of Nepal since 2014, and a cross-border fuel pipeline – the first of its kind in South Asia – was moving two million metric tonnes of petroleum products and had resulted in savings of more than Nepali Rs800 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-will-be-beneficiary-when-india-rolls-out-covid-19-vaccine-foreign-secretary-shringla/story-VQxWGZ42XW6qnpm6mCx2fM.html

I’m a trained actor who understands that until you add your own nuances to a character, it can never shape up the way it should for a story to look interesting,” said the ‘Phir Bhi Na Maane...Badtameez Dil,’ actor.Pearl’s journey to Mumbai was a rollercoaster ride. Recalling his early days, he said, “My reaching Mumbai for the first time after college was for a three-month acting course. And then I went back to Agra as my father said ‘bas ho gya… no Mumbai, stay in Agra and study further’. But my girlfriend at that time wanted me to reach Bollywood and become a superstar like SRK. Imagine, just to please her, I ran away to Mumbai on my own. I told my father ‘Chahe chane bechna paade…vapas nahin aaonga…’ (laughs)Then Pearl reached Mumbai and it was truly tough for him to reach where he is today. “Absolutely tough and I was very young and naive so kept saying no to TV offers just to keep my promise to my girlfriend that I’ll be a Bollywood star. But with time, I understood work is work, irrespective of the medium and then shows started happening and I never looked back. Playing central characters in shows like ‘Dil Ki Nazar Se Khoobsurat,’ ‘Naagarjuna – Ek Yoddha,’ ‘Naagin-3,’ ‘Bepanah Pyaar’ gave me a firm foothold in the industry,” said the good looking actor, who is currently playing the lead in the fantasy thriller ‘Brahmarakshas-2’.Pearl is also busy with his music. Last year he released a single ‘Peehr Meri,’ and this year too, the musician-actor is ready with another single ‘Zikr,’ that will be released soon, “I enjoy multitasking and can handle multiple projects at the same time. So, in future you can see me doing films, TV, music altogether because I believe in managing my time efficiently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/my-then-girlfriend-wanted-me-to-be-a-superstar-like-srk/story-zfrbS49mlAsNKnu4wjuVBM.html

Nalneesh’s efforts paid off as his role in ‘Bhor’ rewarded him with best actor in negative role award at Caleidoscope India Film Festival at Boston (US), recently. An alumnus of Bhartendu Natya Academy, Lucknow, Nalneesh played a middle-aged. “I was 32-year-old when this film was shot in 2017 while the character that I played was in 45-50 age group. In the film, I play a father to a married youngster so I did lot of preparation to look aged. Before the shoot, we spent two months in a village to prepare and learn about the community which is known to feed on rats. Since, I belong to Bisalpur village (Pilibhit) I have closely seen rural life that was of great help to me,” said the UPite. Detailing his prep for the role, he said,“We exchanged old clothes from Musahar members to get that real look. Once when I went to my hotel in that get-up I was not allowed to enter the premise. That was a tactic applied by our director Kamakhya Narayan Singh to check whether we were on the right track.” Nalneesh took inspiration from actors like Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro for the detailing of the character to make it believable. The film that covers the issues such as open defecation, education and caste matrix also won best film on social issues award. “It’s due to blessings of teachers in Lucknow, my friends and well-wishers that I got his award. It has been ten years since I’m working and never won an award in the country. And now getting an international recognition is truly a special feat for me. It inspires me to work very hard in future too,” said the ‘Fukery’ and Chichhorey’ actor adding that the film will get an OTT release. It was because of his performance in ‘Bhor’ that Shoojit Sircar awarded him role in ‘Gulabo Sitabo’ that was shot in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/international-award-brings-new-bhor-for-nalneesh/story-nXcQNMSakc2KVSZdN16KqN.html

The court called states to rise above politics and take vigorous measures against the Covid-19 wave in the country, which had gone from “bad to worse”.A three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan demanded a response from the Gujarat government by Tuesday when the matter will next be heard. The court said, “It is not the first such incident where a fire has occurred in a Covid-19 hospital. Earlier it has happened in Ahmedabad and Andhra Pradesh where patients died due to fire. No concrete steps have been taken by states nor any mechanism is there to prevent such fires.”Also Read: Covid-19: Beginning 2021, India to produce 100 million doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccineThe court said that it was not interested in a report; instead it wanted the Centre to find the root cause of such problems by inspecting Covid-19 hospitals. In addition, the bench asked the Centre to ensure strict enforcement of the Covid-19 guidelines.“We are watching everyday celebrations and processions being take out. Sixty per cent of people have no masks and 30% have their masks hanging... it’s high time to take some strict measures. From November, situation has gone from bad to worse. If no harsh steps are taken, all efforts taken by Centre will go in vain,” said the bench which also comprised justices RS Reddy and MR Shah.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta called the fire incidents serious and said that an urgent meeting shall be called to address concerns expressed by the court.He agreed states must increase their efforts to deal with the situation. According to him, 10 states must work even harder as they are reporting the highest number of cases. These include Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala, West Bengal, Karnataka, UP, Rajasthan, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh.The bench said, “States must rise above politics. The Centre is issuing guidelines, but where is the implementation by states? The hard fact is there is no medicine yet, vaccine is in trial stage and social distancing is not followed. Officers must enforce that such gatherings are avoided.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-must-rise-above-politics-take-vigorous-steps-to-contain-covid-19-supreme-court/story-983Rlb9ugLnUDlmpR1ZEGI.html

Other parties like Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) won 44, while Congress managed to pocket two wards and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) just one. BJP, after its unexpected victory in assembly by-elections, is all set to give a tough fight in the local polls.BJP entryThe ruling party is eyeing to fortify its presence in Telangana after winning the by-election in the Dubbaka assembly constituency earlier this month.

27-11-2020||India||Covid-19: UP sero survey reveals 1 in 5 people developed antibodies||About one in five of the 16,000 people tested during a serological survey in Uttar Pradesh in September showed the prevalence of antibodies against the Sars-Cov-2 pathogen that causes the Covid-19 disease, the state health department said on Thursday.“Of the total 16,000 samples, 3,536 tested positive for antibodies, which is 22.1% in terms of sero prevalence,” said additional chief secretary, health, Amit Mohan Prasad.Samples were collected in 11 districts with the maximum Covid-19 cases on September 4, he said. From each district, 1,450 samples were collected for tests. These districts are Meerut, Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Kaushambi, Prayagraj, Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Baghpat and Agra.Also read | Uttar Pradesh reports 2,237 fresh Covid-19 cases, Lucknow 348The samples were sent to King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow, for testing to determine the presence of antibodies, he said.Health experts said the sero survey indicated two things. “If 22.1% people had antibodies in September, it means the percentage will be even more than that today,” said Dr Ved Prakash, head of the department of pulmonary critical care medicine at KGMU.Dr PK Gupta, former president of IMA, Lucknow, said, “This report is an indication of community spread in the state. Now, the state government should focus on a mass awareness campaign to break the chain of infection. People should follow the Covid-19 protocol strictly, covering their face with mask, maintaining social distancing and washing hands at regular intervals,” he said.Dr Gupta said the state government should also increase sample tests by engaging private laboratories. The increase in sample tests would ensure that people testing positive for Covid-19 would immediately go into isolation or get admitted in hospital, he said. It would check the spread of the infection among the remaining population, he added.Medical practitioner Dr AK Singh said data of the sero-survey implied that 50 million people out of the 230 million population of Uttar Pradesh might have been exposed to the virus and become carriers of the antibodies by September. The number of the people exposed to the virus must have multiplied by November, he added.The state government had taken the correct decision to increase the sample tests and launch a mass awareness campaign across the state, he said.Dr Amresh Singh, head of the microbiology department at Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur, said the numbers showed that even after infection, a large population may not have developed antibodies due to co-morbidity or a weak immune system. There was a need for regular follow-up to get a clear picture of the extent of infection, he said.Antibodies are immune molecules produced by the body to fight pathogens. The presence of antibodies in the blood typically suggests that people infected with a virus would gain immunity for some period. The latest studies show that antibodies are not sustainable and begin to disappear within three to four months, Dr Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-up-sero-survey-reveals-1-in-5-people-developed-antibodies/story-1gRi4Ly1QIyjTPo6oaHEeO.html

27-11-2020||India||Covid-19: Beginning 2021, India to produce 100 million doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine||India will produce over 100 million doses a year of Russia’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine Sputnik V beginning 2021 following an agreement between the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and Hyderabad-based Hetero Biopharma.Sputnik V is based on a well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors and has demonstrated a 91.4% efficacy rate, according to the second interim data analysis of the largest double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials in Russia’s history involving 40,000 volunteers. The results were announced by Gamaleya Center and RDIF on November 24.Phase 3 clinical trials of the vaccine are approved and ongoing in Belarus, the UAE, Venezuela and other countries, and Phase 2/3 have been approved in India. India, along with Brazil, China, South Korea and others, will provide the vaccine to at least 50 countries that have requested over 1.2 billion doses.Also read | AstraZeneca plans new vaccine trial as efficacy questioned“An application has been submitted by RDIF to the World Health Organization (WHO) for accelerated registration (Emergency Use Listing, EUL) and prequalification of Sputnik V,” said Alexander Gintsburg, director general of The Gamaleya Research Institute, Moscow, in an email interview. WHO’s EUL procedure streamlines approvals for the global use of new or unlicensed products during public health emergencies.“There is now real hope that vaccines -- in combination with other tried and tested public health measures -- will help to end the pandemic. The urgency with which vaccines have been developed must be matched by the same urgency to distribute them fairly. While we work towards rolling out a safe and effective vaccine, we must continue the essential public health actions to suppress transmission and reduce mortality,” said DR Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO, South East Asia.The EUL procedure for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has begun. “WHO has had several discussions with AstraZeneca following the expression of interest that WHO issued for emergency use listing and prequalification of vaccines. We will receive more clinical data in the coming weeks. There are eight sites – some are manufacturing sites – and we will be analysing the data carefully. We expect to finalise assessments beginning of next year,” said Dr Khetrapal Singh.Sputnik V is a human adenovirus-based vaccine candidate and the only late-stage adenovirus-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate to use two different vectors for different injections, human adenovirus types Ad5 and Ad26. In vaccines that use the same vector in both injections, the immune system may launch defence mechanisms against the second one, making the vaccine less effective.The Sputnik V vaccine is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vector platform that has been proven safe and effective with no long-term side effects in more than 250 global clinical trials over the past two decades. It uses two different human adenoviral vectors that have been genetically modified not to cause infection to trigger stronger and longer-term immune response as compared to the vaccines using one or the same vector for two doses.“While we look forward to the clinical trial results in India, we believe that manufacturing the product locally is crucial to enable swift access to patients. This collaboration is another step towards our commitment in the battle against Covid-19 and realising the objective of ‘Make-in-India’ campaign as envisioned by our Hon’ble Prime Minister of India,” said B. Murali Krishna Reddy, director, international marketing, Hetero Labs Limited, in a statement.“The results follow on the encouraging results from the two earlier vaccine candidates from Pfizer and Moderna. Both of those are mRNA vaccines, while the AstraZeneca vaccine is a viral vector vaccine. It’s possible that we will have a number of different vaccine candidates that can be used in the fight against this disease. This is a good development as we would like to provide access to as many efficacious and safe vaccines as possible, so we can cover the population -- billions of people -- around the world,” said Dr Khetrapal Singh.“While there are many challenges in ending Covid-19 to come beyond vaccine introduction, vaccination is the best opportunity we have to halt the transmission of Covid-19 and minimise its associated morbidity and mortality. Based on the currently available evidence, Sputnik V can play a role in the global fight against Covid-19,” said Dr Gintsburg, on email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-beginning-2021-india-to-produce-100-million-doses-of-russia-s-sputnik-v-vaccine/story-ZuVlILfQbPIMvwUxKLpAgL.html

The travel agents’ apex body has 3,000 members across the country.In a letter to its members on Thursday, TAAI said they have been in constant dialogue with the aviation ministry, International Air Transport Association (IATA) and airlines over the last eight months. While most airlines have released refunds of airfares to member travel agents, Air India, Go Air, SpiceJet, Thai Airways, Kenya Airways are yet to do so as per the directions of the Supreme Court and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).Also read | Covid-19 pushes tourism in Delhi to the edge“Our persuasion with said airlines is on and we are trying our level best through intervention of Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) for some prompt action. We have been receiving updates from various authorities, airlines, consumer bodies and passengers that, inspite of full refunds being processed by the airlines, member agents are not settling the account of the travellers,” read the letter. Requesting its members, TAAI stated, “With regards to the refunds already received by agents from the airlines, we would request our members to kindly settle their account with the customers/ travellers, who too are in despair.” TAAI allowed its members to charge a nominal fee, similar to a service charge for their efforts to undertake the procedure of processing the refunds through the Global Distribution Services System (GDS-system) on the IATA portal or with the low cost airlines.A GDS is a computer network system that allows travel agencies and websites to book tickets on any airline for a passenger. While all full-service airlines avail GDS system for selling their tickets, a few budget airlines also use this platform.On October 1, TAAI had said that it needed total cash refunds from the airlines for the cancelled flights, as its members and customers were struggling with liquidity issues and basic interest paid to banks was at higher rates.“We are receiving many complaints about passengers not receiving their refund. In some cases, passengers are being given credit shells after deducting money, which is against the SC order. We have written to DGCA over the non-compliance by airlines and agents. We are also suggesting passengers to write to airlines and DGCA, so that the regulatory body is kept in the loop. As per the order issued by the Apex court, passengers are suppose to receive full refund, including taxes. However, according to the complaints registered with us, this rule is largely being violated, “ said advocate Shirish Deshpande, chairman of consumers’ body Mumbai Grahak Panchayat and party to the plea on the issue of refunds for air tickets booked during the Covid-19 lockdown in SC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/travel-agents-apex-body-directs-members-to-refund-airfares-for-flights-booked-during-lockdown/story-H5HRagHv9BeXPcPAjbZdIO.html

In a repeat of scenes from Thursday, the farmers, most of whom are from Punjab, faced tear gas shells and water cannons from the police.

This was stated by a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee who gave a detailed judgment stating the reasons for granting interim bail to Goswami on November 11.The court said the interim bail will remain in force till Bombay HC decides the quashing petition and will remain in force for another four weeks in order to enable Goswami to approach this court. Also read | On liberty, the lack of judicial consistencyGoswami had approached the SC after the Bombay high court refused to grant him bail. The SC bench gave a prima facie view that the preliminary evaluation of FIR did not establish any abetment to suicide charge. The apex court was of the firm view that the HC ought to have taken a prima facie view of the FIR, nature of allegations and it erred in not granting bail. The court further held that in cases involving liberty of citizens who are targeted by state, the courts must ensure that state does not use “criminal law as a tool to harass or jeopardise liberty (of citizens)”. On November 11, the Bench had said that state cannot target any individual in this manner for keeping divergent ideology or views and that constitutional courts will be duty-bound to protect liberty of citizens.“We are dealing with a person’s liberty. Across the country, if this court is not to interfere today, we are treading on a path of destruction of liberty....you may dislike a person’s ideology and challenge it but if this is what our states will do to nail persons, we have to put across this message to all high courts to preserve the liberty of citizens,” the bench had said on November 11. Senior advocate Harish Salve, who appeared for Goswami, had on that day argued that his arrest was planned to target him for making unpalatable views against the Maharashtra government and state police in his TV debates. Salve stated the suicide note left by the deceased businessman Anvay Naik mentioned only Rs88 lakh as unpaid dues against Goswami while others named in suicide note left by Naik owed him larger sums. The bench even commented on the FIR involved in the case. The court had said, “in a matter of this nature where some amount is already paid and the person commits suicide due to financial stress, will you hold the head of the company for abetment to suicide? In most companies, work orders are given out as a labour contract.... Will it not be travesty of justice to deny bail to such a person when his quashing petition is pending.”Naik’s wife had approached the police with a complaint against Goswami and two others. The state police had filed a closure report but earlier this year, the police began probe into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-prima-facie-case-against-arnab-goswami-in-abetment-to-suicide-case-says-sc/story-NI996Bf8sQxWE3StAWg2yI.html

The high court said the demolition action at her office had malafide intent, passing an order for a valuer to be appointed to ascertain the damage caused in the demolition. However, the court has also asked the actor to exercise restraint. A division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and R I Chagla noted that the action undertaken by the civic body leaves hardly “any manner of doubt” that it was unauthorised. The BMC had alleged Ranaut of unauthorised construction in her office, a portion of which was razed. The high court said it has compared the photographs and found no unauthorised construction. The civic body has proceeded to act wrongfully and illegally against the rights of a citizen, the bench said.The court also commented on Kangana’s allegations that the action (partial demolition of her office) was a reaction to her opinions expressed on social media. “The notice issued by BMC officer, and pasting of that on her bungalow, the reply to the notice, order of demolition of property, arrangements made to demolition, commencement of demolition, attempt to delay hearing, ensuring 40% demolition, demolition of the bungalow.Raut’s statement that bungalow ukhaad Diya..supports petitioner’s case that the demolition was in reaction to that,” it said.Ranaut had filed the petition on September 9 when the demolition process was initiated by BMC.

27-11-2020||India||‘Don’t compel me to come after you’: Uddhav Thackeray’s veiled warning to Opposition||Slamming the Opposition, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has said he should not be compelled to go after them. In an interview to Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Thackeray’s word of caution comes in the wake of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) action against Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik.Thackeray, who completes a year in office on Friday, said he is keeping a “close eye” on political developments in the state. He said that central agencies are misused in the country and the manner in which families are being targeted shows “vindictive” politics of opposition (party in the state). The CM, in the interview to Sena leader and Saamana executive editor Sanjay Raut, spoke on a range of issues, from Mumbai civic polls, to his family being targeted in the Sushant Singh Rajput case, “love jihad”, Anvay Naik’s case, and the performance and plans of the state government.Also Watch | ‘I challenge Uddhav Thackeray to debate with me’: Arnab GoswamiAlso read | Maharashtra: MNS launches state-wide protests against inflated billsThackeray said he does not want to resort to vindictive politics. He said he gets “energised” when he is “challenged”. “We do not want to get into vindictive politics but if you force us, we will use Sudarshan chakra [mythological weapon] against your vindictiveness,” he said.“I am following all developments closely. If I am quiet or I am restrained it doesn’t mean that I am unmanly. The manner in which people’s families and children are targeted does not suit Maharashtra’s culture. The ones targeting families and children must remember that even they have families. They are not clean… Not only the government but the people of Maharashtra will definitely resist such vindictive politics,” he said.In a veiled reference to prime minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, Thackeray said others should remember the cases against them and how Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray supported [PM] Modi. “Practice politics like it should be. If you are going to misuse power then one must remember that power does not remain forever. Even they faced cases earlier, and they must remember how Shiv Sena chief saved them,” he said, adding that the “real power” is the people, which is with them.Responding to a question on the criticism of the Opposition that the CM is merely asking people to wash hands regularly, Thackeray said, “Right now, I am only asking to wash hands... if such attack continues, I will come after them.”Asked how he felt when his family was targeted in the Sushant Singh Rajput case, the Shiv Sena chief said, “Those who have families and children should look into mirror once. Do not compel us to take that step. If I go after you… I do not want to stoop to that level.” Thackeray’s son and Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray was indirectly linked to the SSR case by some members of the BJP and social media campaign was created to target him.Speaking on the death of Rajput and the controversy that followed, Thackeray said, “I look at the entire issue with pity. This is a tendency of profiting from the dead. Such people are not worthy. One young boy lost his life and they are politicising it. It is dirty and perverted politics.”Raut also asked about the Anvay Naik suicide abetment case in which Republic TV editor Arnab Goswami is one of the accused. Thackeray slammed the former BJP government for sweeping the case under the carpet. “One Marathi businessman was cheated by outsiders. He died by suicide and wrote a note. You push the case under the carpet and those who ask for reinvestigation, you make ED run behind them. You want us to turn a blind eye?” he said, referring to Sarnaik who demanded the reopening the case.Attacking the BJP over the issue of inter-faith marriages, Thackeray said that alliance of different political ideologies work for BJP, but not marriage between a Muslim boy and a Hindu girl. “Rather than politics of ‘love jihad’, why shouldn’t the concept be applicable in politics? They [BJP] are opposed to a Muslim boy marrying a Hindu girl. Then how did you [BJP] have an alliance with Mehbooba Mufti or Nitish Kumar or Chandrababu Naidu? Alliance with different political parties with different ideologies works for you, isn’t this ‘love jihad’?” he said.Responding to the demand that Maharashtra government should bring a law against inter-faith marriages, Thackeray said, “We can make a law on it but first tell us when you [central government] will bring in anti-cow slaughter law? Why don’t you make a law in Goa, you have a government there? Enforce it from Kashmir to Kanyakumari,” he said.On the continuing criticism that Sena had abandoned Hindutva ideology by allying with NCP and Congress, Thackeray said that it is not loincloth to change. “Hindutva is not a dhoti (loincloth) to change. It is in our blood and veins. I follow my father’s and grandfather’s concept of Hindutva. They said we do not want a [temple] bell tolling Hindutva, we want a Hindutva that will finish off terrorists and my father proved it in 1992-93. When no one was coming forward to accept the demolition of Babri, he did it. Ram Mandir happened due to the court’s decision. No political party should take credit for it,” Thackeray said.Thackeray added that he does not consider the biggest political fight for Sena will be the BMC election in 2022. He said that nobody can uninstall the saffron flag of the party that is fluttering over the BMC for the last three decades. “I do not think so that it is possible for anybody to remove the saffron flag. I know my Mumbaikar they have stood behind us for the last 25-30 years and will continue to remain. They can try but Mumbaikars will not get anybody close to the saffron flag,” Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-compel-me-to-come-after-you-says-thackeray-in-veiled-warning-to-opposition/story-l4Hjjjlj8U4s0gisZsaffJ.html

The bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee passed an order detailing the reasons why Goswami was granted bail on November 11 after he spent a week in judicial custody following his arrest in the abetment to suicide of architect Anvay Naik and his mother. Justice Chandrachud said it could not be said appellants had abetted the suicide of the head of the architectural firm. “If the HC was carrying a prima facie evaluation, then it could not have seen that there was no nexus between FIR and Section 306 IPC,” Justice Chandrachud said. “It needs to be sent whether the accused can tamper evidence, or whether accused can flee, or whether ingredients of offence is made out along with interests of state. These principles have emerged over time. Here the case is about liberty of a citizen,” he said.“The appellants are residents of India and don’t pose flight risk or can they tamper evidence. We have also added a section on Human liberty and role of Courts: Section 482 recognizes powers of the HC to give effect to other provisions of CrPC. Due enforcement of criminal law cannot be obstructed by accused opting strategies and the court must be circumspect in exercising powers under Section 482 CrPC,” he added. Quoting Justice Krishna Iyer that bail is rule and jail is exception, Justice Chandrachud said doors of courts cannot be closed in such cases and courts should remain open for all cases of deprivation of personal liberty and such deprivation cannot be even for one day.“Our courts should exhibit acute awareness to the need to dispense Justice in cases of personal liberty. The interim order shall remain in operation till further proceedings and it will be open to them to peruse further remedy,” Justice Chandrachud said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doors-of-courts-cannot-be-closed-in-such-cases-supreme-court-gives-detailed-reason-why-it-granted-bail-to-arnab-goswami/story-TYimpiSpKFyg1ah9BB1xlM.html

An inquiry has been ordered to investigate the incident,” said an Indian Navy statement. This is the fourth crash in recent times involving MiG-29K aircraft. In February this year, a MiG29K aircraft which was on routine training sorties had crashed in Goa. However, the pilot was able to eject on time. In November last year, a twin-seater MiG29K had crashed because of a bird hit after taking off from Goa naval air base. However, both pilots had ejected safely. In January 2018, a MiG-29K crashed as it veered off the runaway at the INS Hansa base in Goa; the pilot escaped unharmed. INS Vikramaditya had just finished phase 2 of the Malabar exercises involving navies from US, Japan and Australia in the northern Arabian Sea. The exercises were centered around the Vikramaditya Carrier Battle Group of the Indian Navy and Nimitz Carrier Strike Group of the US Navy. The two carriers, along with other ships, submarine and aircraft of the participating navies, had engaged in high intensity naval operations over four days from November 17 onwards. These exercises had included cross-deck flying operations and advanced air defence exercises by MIG 29K fighters of INS Vikramaditya and F-18 fighters and E2C Hawkeye from Nimitz.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-s-mig-29k-trainer-jet-crashes-into-arabian-sea-1-pilot-rescued-search-on-for-the-other/story-VK4JhZPlO6c0GMCFSGyFaI.html

The Capital has enough infrastructure to cover the entire population in a month if hospital staff and nurses are roped in, the officer has said. And the infrastructure is adequate to vaccinate all healthcare professionals in just three days. Delhi’s Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, meanwhile, has been chosen as the first vaccine storage facility.Here is how the Capital is gearing up for vaccination> There are 600 cold storage points and around 1,800 outreach sites which have been used for the immunisation for children.> While these will be used, according to Centre’s vaccination drive draft, school campuses will also be added to the existing vaccine infrastructure.> At present, Delhi government is collecting data of healthcare workers who will be vaccinated first.> The facilities in Delhi can store vaccines at two to eight degrees Celsius.> Delhi government’s Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital will be converted into a Covid-19 vaccine storage centre, reports said. The centre will become functional by mid-December. Most vaccines in India need to be stored at a temperature of two to eight degrees Celsius. The lowest minimum temperature at which vaccines can be kept to maintain the cold chain in most areas in the country is minus 25 degrees Celsius as there is only one vaccine in India — Bharat Biotech’s Rotavirus vaccine — which needs to be stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius.

On November 9, the bench of justice Aparesh Kumar Singh had sought CBI’s reply in the bail application. The former Bihar chief minister has been languishing in jail since December 23, 2017, after his conviction in three fodder scam cases in quick succession.He has already secured bail in two cases and moved a bail application in this third and last case which relates to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs3.76 crore from Dumka treasury between December 1995 and January 1996.The trial court, in said case, sentenced Yadav to 14 years of imprisonment -- seven under Indian Penal Code (IPC) and another seven under Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act. It had expressly said both the sentences would run consecutively.However, Yadav’s lawyers hope that the high court will strike down this decision, and let the two sentences run concurrently. If that happens, he would have to undergo seven-year imprisonment in this case. The RJD leader, who has been undergoing treatment in custody at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) for over two years, has sought bail on the grounds that he had completed half of the seven years sentence awarded to him in this case.He argued that in the other two cases, he was granted bail on completing half the sentences.The bench, however, sought a reply from the CBI which took time filing a counter affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fodder-scam-case-jharkhand-hc-to-hear-lalu-yadav-s-bail-plea-today/story-5WdFpfd9zhErT85QJBHPGO.html

27-11-2020||India||Dilli Chalo: Why angry farmers want to storm New Delhi||Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh clashed with police on Thursday, travelling toward the national Capital, where they plan to protest three farm laws enacted recently. Cultivators on tractors and trucks flung police barricades into a river near Ambala district, as police stopped them with tear gas and water cannons. The farmers are set to resume their march on Friday. What’s stoking the farmers’ uprising? Farmers want the Narendra Modi government to revoke three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government-controlled agricultural markets. These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Also read | Ready to resolve differences: Union agriculture minister Tomar invites protesting farmers for talks on Dec 3How do the new laws change farm trade? Together, the laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled “mandi system”, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, which earlier only government-approved agents could, and lay down new rules for contract farming. Why do farmers oppose these new rules? Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed prices. What is the MSP system? Farm unions fear the new rules could pave the way for the government to stop buying grains at guaranteed prices, officially called minimum support prices (MSP), leaving them at the mercy of private buyers. The government, on the other hand, has insisted it will continue to purchase farm produce at MSPs. An MSP is a federally determined floor price aimed at preventing distress sale. What’s the government’s argument? The government has said these new rules will bring big retailers, online grocers and exporters to farmers’ doorstep. The amended Essential Commodities Act will spur investment in supply chains. The contract farming law will allow farmers to tailor their production according to a corporate buyer’s requirement. Is the crisis going to be resolved anytime soon? Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal had held day-long negotiations with farmers on November 13. The discussions were inconclusive, but both sides had agreed to continue negotiations in the future. The next round of talks is slated for December 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dilli-chalo-why-angry-farmers-want-to-storm-new-delhi/story-jXPjzqOmTgxralskj1e7HI.html

The virus has also claimed more than 1.4 million lives, the tally shows.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn the latest updates on the coronavirus vaccine development front, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Saturday visit vaccine development centres in Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad. Britain’s AstraZeneca, meanwhile, is under the scanner for an ‘error’ in the trial results of its vaccine candidate.Here are the latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccine front:1. PM Modi’s visit to vaccine development centres will include Pune’s Serum Institute of India (SII), Hyderabad’s Bharat Biotech International Limited and Ahmedabad’s Zydus Cadila. While SII will manufacture the AstraZenecea-Oxford University vaccine, Bharat Biotech is working on the country’s first indigenous vaccine-COVAXIN. Zydus Cadila, meanwhile, is developing its vaccine candidate, ZyCoV-D.2. AstraZeneca is planning a second global trial to clear the discrepancy between two separate trial results. The efficacy of its vaccine candidate, AZD1222, came out to be 90% in earlier trial, in which first a half dose and then a full dose were administered. However, a second trial, in which two full doses were administered, the vaccine was found to be 62% effective. Also Britain, where the firm expects four million doses to be available by December-end, has asked its medicine regulator to assess the vaccine candidate for a temporary supply.3. Russia’s Gamaleya research institute, has suggested that a shot of its Sputnik V vaccine candidate might boost the efficiacy of AstraZeneca’s AZD1222. “Current full dose AstraZeneca regimen resulted in 62% efficacy. If they go for a new clinical trial, we suggest trying a regimen of combining the AZ shot with the #SputnikV human adenoviral vector shot to boost efficacy. Combining vaccines may prove important for revaccinations,” the Gamaleya institute tweeted.4. Canada’s drug regulator, Health Canada, has said it could approve the Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE Covid-19 vaccine candidate “around December.” Supriya Sharma, senior medical adviser at Health Canada on Thursday said that the vaccine “is most advanced” in Health Canada’s reviews. Also in December, Canada’s neighbour, the United States, will decide if Pfizer’s vaccine is safe enough to be given emergency use authorisation (EUA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-pm-modi-to-visit-vaccine-development-centres-astrazeneca-eyes-second-global-trial/story-n1LC3OueOE8m1LeauVuC5J.html

With the Jharkhand BJP cornering the Hemant Soren-led JMM-Congress-RJD government alleging that the RJD chief was flouting jail manual and using mobile phones from the director’s bungalow, inspector general (IG) (prisons) Birendra Bhushan had ordered an inquiry into it. Bhushan though confirmed that the RJD chief has been shifted to the ward and added that only RIMS authorities could comment on it further.“The decision was not taken at our level. RIMs authorities could explain the reason better if any health condition required his shifting in the ward,” said Bhushan. On the inquiry he ordered on Wednesday, Bhushan said he was yet to receive a report from the jail authorities. RIMs authorities could not be reached immediately for their comment. The former Bihar chief minister has been languishing in jail since December 23, 2017, after his conviction in three fodder scam cases in quick succession. He is currently under treatment in custody here at RIMS. In August, he was shifted to the hospital’s director’s bungalow due to covid-19 spread.Also Read: Jharkhand orders probe into Lalu Prasad Yadav’s phone call Prasad has already secured bail in two cases. He moved bail application in the third and last case in the Jharkhand high court, which has fixed November 27 to hear the case. The latest controversy surrounding Prasad arose after Bihar’s former deputy chief minister and BJP leader Sushil Modi alleged that Prasad was attempting to topple the elected Bihar government. On Wednesday, he also tweeted an audio clip, purportedly of Prasad talking to a BJP legislator on phone. “Lalu Yadav making telephone call (8051216302) from Ranchi to NDA MLA & promising ministerial berths. When I telephoned, Lalu directly picked up. I said don’t do these dirty tricks from jail, you will not succeed,” Modi said in his tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/storm-over-bribe-phone-calls-ends-lalu-prasad-s-vip-bungalow-stay/story-X76O262c81S8tKFnMUmFEP.html
27-11-2020||India||Farmers march: Thousands headed to Delhi today amid heavy police deployment||In a clarion call, thousands of farmers are headed to the national capital on Friday with their echoes for rollback of three farm laws enacted by Parliament in September growing stronger. Thursday witnessed high-voltage face-offs between police personnel and the protesting farmers, who forced their way and entered Delhi’s adjoining areas like Panipat, Sirsa, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad and Jind. The farmers, hailing from Punjab and Haryana, in their “Delhi Chalo” march are demanding the ruling dispensation agrees to hear their objections on the clearance of farm laws which, collectively, have paved way for agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming.Also read: Farmers force way into Haryana, head to DelhiIn the last 12-15 hours, farmers have moved closer to Delhi, prompting Delhi Police to scale up deployment of security personnel, stationed sand-laden trucks and water cannons and using barbed wire for fencing at the Singhu Border to prevent the protesters from entering the city.Here is all you need to know about the farmer’s march:- Police said they will not allow the farmers protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws to enter Delhi if they reach the borders of the national capital. - Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava, who visited the bordering areas, said “Due to Covid-19 guidelines have been issued in which political gathering is not permitted here and for this, their (the farmers’) request was rejected. If they still make an attempt, we have deployed personnel at the borders to not let them enter the national capital. We are also in contact with Punjab and Haryana Police.”- Traffic movement is likely to be disrupted in the border areas. The traffic was also closed from Bahadurgarh towards Delhi on Thursday evening, officials said.- Delhi Metro services from neighbouring cities to the national capital will remain suspended on Friday in view of the ‘’Delhi chalo’’ protest march. However, metro services will be available from Delhi towards the NCR sections.Also read: Farmers brave water cannons, tear gas, push through Haryana barricades- Five sand-laden trucks and three water cannons have also been stationed at the Singhu Border to stop tractors being driven by the protesters, news agency PTI reported. Officials have stated that drones have been deployed to keep a tight vigil to maintain law and order. - Areas affected by the police deployment include - NH-24, DND, Chilla Border, Tigri border, Bahadurgarh border, Faridabad border, Kalindi Kunj border and Singhu border.- Authorities in Haryana have imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in several parts of the state to prevent assembly of the protesters.- Reports of altercation surfaced from Ambala on Thursday where barricades erected by the police on an overbridge on the Ghaggar river were thrown into the river by the farmers after facing tear gas shells by law enforcement personnel. The police, on loudspeaker, asked farmers on the Punjab side to disperse, but that did not help. As smoke from tear gas clouded the skies and farmers outnumbered security personnel, they were allowed to enter Haryana around noon.- In political development, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal were among those who criticised the Haryana Police’s action.- Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal too criticised attempts to thwart the protest. “Today is Punjab’s 26/11. We are witnessing the end of the right to democratic protest,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-march-thousands-headed-to-delhi-today-all-you-need-to-know/story-bB8g84pW8yhuTJ9NjnMy8I.html

Even the lowest efficacy results are at 60-70%, making it a viable vaccine against the virus. That said, varied age groups with different dosage forms will result in slight variations and efficacy. We must be patient and not panic,” Pune-based Serum Institute of India said in a statement.Also Read: AstraZeneca may run additional trial“The Indian trials are running smoothly with strict adherence to all the necessary processes and protocols. So far, there are no concerns. However, we are going through the data that is available and will make further statement, if needed,” SII said.Astrazeneca-Oxford vaccine candidate became the third one after Moderna, Pfizer to announce promising results to fight Covid-19. It claimed 70.4 per cent efficacy overall — 90 per cent efficacy in one dosing regimen when the vaccine was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least a month later, while another dosing regimen showed 62 per cent efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart.Later, Astrazeneca admitted that the administration of half dose and then a full dose — which showed 90 per cent efficacy — has been actually a dosing error. As Astrazeneca is planning to run additional trials, Serum Institute of India has said there is yet no reason to worry as far as trials in India are going on.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday visit the SII campus to review the mechanism of Covid-19 vaccine production and its distribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-need-to-panic-says-serum-institute-of-india-amid-concerns-over-oxford-astrazeneca-trial-error/story-RWZCZsmu5BvynBpjjdae5J.html

Railways’ Security Helpline 182 “proved to be effective, leading to their arrest”, he said. On November 24, the Alipurduar Security Control of the Railway Protection Force received a call from a passenger on the helpline regarding misbehaviour by a few, following which RPF officials informed the matter to their counterparts at New Jalpaiguri under Katihar Division, where the train had its next scheduled stoppage. Upon its arrival, the group was questioned and their ticket details revealed that all of them were travelling with fake names, he said. The spokesman said during interrogation, it was learnt that they fled from a “refugee camp at Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh” and entered India. A case has been registered under the Foreigner’s (Amendment) Act. The arrested persons were produced before the magistrate and later sent to judicial custody, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-foreign-nationals-arrested-from-train-for-illegally-entering-india/story-JmxrQv6SdP4P1nW4jOYNBM.html
27-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine may well be effective – as the developers claimed earlier this week – but enough questions have been asked about the trials and the reporting for drug regulators around the world to think long, and hard, and perhaps wait for more trial data – after all, trials are also on in the US and India – before approving the two-shot vaccine that offers protection from Covid-19.In September, amidst rising concerns that vaccine developers would rush through trials, ignoring safety concerns as well as detailed and nuanced analysis of efficacy, companies including AstraZeneca (it is developing its vaccine in collaboration with the University of Oxford and Vaccitech Ltd, the company that has licensed the adenovirus vector platform used in the vaccine from the university’s Jenner Institute), Moderna, and the Pfizer/BioNTech combine, released elaborate protocols for their Phase 3 trials – unprecedented in the annals of vaccine development.The coronavirus disease has resulted in huge public interest in a process that is usually restricted to the research departments of pharma companies, laboratories and research institutions, and peer-reviewed academic journals with readership in the thousands (or tens of thousands). Indeed, the results of clinical trials are usually announced in such journals, not in press releases and briefings with analysts at investment banks. But with cases exceeding 60 million, deaths nearing 1.5 million (and actual deaths being much higher), and lives and livelihoods disturbed by a virus that is airborne, it isn’t surprising that everyone is more interested in the results of vaccine trials than they are in, say, a royal wedding. Both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech followed this approach while disclosing the results of the trials of their vaccines, both based on a hitherto untested mRNA (or messenger RNA platform). The results were good, 90% in one case, later updated to 95% based on more readings, and 95% in another. That’s very high for a vaccine. Even better, a close reading of the results by analysts, scientists, and experts – including many amateurs with the ability to convert complex scientific papers and research into language laypeople can understand, and built huge followings on social media in the process – didn’t turn up any gaps or unpleasant surprises. Both vaccines work.There was more riding on the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, though. It only required refrigeration, compared to the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech ones that needed sub-zero temperatures, and it was going to be inexpensive (which meant it would end up being the vaccine of choice for low-income and poor countries). It was also going to be the first vaccine available in India – thanks to a deal between Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, and AstraZeneca/Oxford. There may also have been some pressure on company executives to announce the results of the trials following the success of the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. Whatever the reason, AstraZeneca/Oxford seem to have hurried the announcement of the results – and it shows. Following the initial announcement of the results on Monday, it has emerged that what was reported as a trial involving an alternative approach to dosing was actually a mistake that was converted into an experiment; that the results announced combine those from two separate trials with two different protocols and demographic groups; and that the data used was from sub-groups within these groups. These are worrying lapses – and have rightly been called out by scientists, epidemiologists, and bio-statisticians. They are dodgy from the perspective of science, data, and clinical trial protocols.This is a pity – especially because the findings were also encouraging in terms of the vaccine candidate’s ability to prevent transmission (protecting infected people from developing Covid-19, and preventing transmission are two very different things) – something that is especially critical in the case of a disease that has been found to be transmitted significantly by infected people that are asymptomatic.More trial data may substantiate the efficacy of the vaccine (some experts believe that there is a high likelihood of this), but the episode once again highlights that unlike in the case of food and fashion, there is no such thing as fast science.PS: Late on Thursday, Bloomberg reported AstraZeneca’s CEO Pascal Soriot as saying that it may conduct an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of the vaccine after some studies raised questions over its level of protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-JIGFRQGGIekevQ4Q5RMsNI.html
27-11-2020||India||AstraZeneca may run additional trial||AstraZeneca said on Thursday it was likely to conduct an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccine it was developing along with University of Oxford after some studies raised questions over its level of protection and a lack of transparency around the late-stage clinical trials.The new trial would be run instead of adding an arm to an ongoing US trial and would evaluate a lower dosage that performed better than a full amount in AstraZeneca’s studies, according to a Bloomberg report. “Now that we’ve found what looks like a better efficacy we have to validate this, so we need to do an additional study,” the pharma group’s chief executive officer Pascal Soriot told Bloomberg. It will probably be another “international study, but this one could be faster because we know the efficacy is high so we need smaller number of patients”.Also Read | Russia’s Sputnik V developers call on AstraZeneca to try combining vaccinesHealth experts are concerned about the data that showed the vaccine candidate was up to 90% effective, citing a lack of transparency around the late-stage clinical trials that could make or break the chances for billions of people to get early access to a cheap coronavirus inoculation.The questions surround the use of the half-strength initial dose, which the developers said had higher efficacy but also revealed as having been administered as a mistake, and the possible lack of uniformity in the way the trial was split and its findings reported from locations in two countries: the United Kingdom and Brazil.“AstraZeneca/Oxford get a poor grade for transparency and rigor when it comes to the vaccine trial results they have reported... AZN is evaluating their vaccine in multiple trials across the world, yet these are not embedded under a unified protocol. In fact, the trials seem to be quite different by country, in terms of populations, subgroups, etc...,” wrote Natalie Dean, assistant professor of biostatistics at University of Florida, in a series of tweets on Wednesday.Oxford and AstraZeneca announced that their trial findings were based on 131 infections among 20,260 people split across trial sites in the UK and Brazil. Among these, those that were given a half-strength initial shot appeared to be more protected than those who were given two full-strength shots, a difference that the university’s scientists as well as the pharma firm’s executives said were unexpected.The announcement of the vaccine’s efficacy raised hopes for countries like India, since AstraZeneca has committed a billion doses to the Covax Facility which aims to distribute vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. Among producers of the vaccine is Pune’s Serum Institute of India, which has committed to supplying half of the doses it makes to India, making it the first vaccine likely to be available in the country.According to a top expert, in India, where the vaccine is undergoing a separate late-stage trial, the approval process can be based on the lower-efficacy, two full-strength dose approach, which too exceeds the 50% efficacy bar set by regulators. “Since the Indian trial is with two full doses, we can bridge to two full doses of the vaccine in the UK and Brazil and should not bridge to a dosing that we have not evaluated in India. Perhaps after the application to DCGI is done, they could propose additional studies in India, based on which they could apply for a labelling change,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, former executive director, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, a Department of Science and Technology (DST) organisation.Kang said that the questions now being raised do not mean the trial results should be rubbished. “The results are good. Better than we hoped for when WHO, FDA and DCGI laid out the 50% efficacy point estimate criterion. All vaccine trials are different, and these are not head-to-head comparisons between vaccines that claim 90, 95 or 60 or 70% efficacy,” she added.However, the controversy could have an impact on the approval process itself, which could itself depend on what regulators in the UK decide. “…Reporting out a secondary analysis that was not pre-specified is not desirable. If they seek to get the half-dose approved, they should wait until they have a compelling result,” Dean wrote, seemingly referring to the trial protocol AstraZeneca released for the experiments in the US. Protocol for the UK and Brazil trials have not been disclosed but are expected to be the same.According to a report in the New York Times, AstraZeneca executive Menelas Pangalos said the error was made by a contractor and regulators were notified of it and signed off on continuing to test the vaccine at different doses.But experts added that there are now multiple questions that need to be addressed. “Isn’t the different efficacy a subgroup analysis, and couldn’t the differences be statistical variability,” said Paul Bleicher, a former Harvard Medical School resident who now works as a strategic adviser, in a series of tweets on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/astrazeneca-may-run-additional-trial/story-Byhjrg56vr074cy34WLwFO.html
27-11-2020||India||Set up four courts of appeal, make SC constitutional court: KK Venugopal||Anticipating a pendency of cases when courts restart operations in full swing after the Covid-19 pandemic, Attorney General KK Venugopal Thursday said that the need of the hour is to set up a National Court of Appeal, which can have four benches with 15 judges each — who will be at par with Supreme Court judges and can decide all appeals arising from high courts, leaving only issues of national and constitutional importance to be decided by the apex court.Speaking on the occasion of the 71st anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution at an online event organised by the Supreme Court — with President Ram Nath Kovind, Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in attendance — the top law officer said: “At present, the Supreme Court is hearing close to 400 categories of cases related to matrimonial disputes, bail petitions, land acquisition matters and so on, when the Supreme Court is supposed to be the constitutional court dealing with issues of national importance. The Supreme Court must regain its stature. This does not mean cases should end at the level of High Court. A Court of Appeal is to be constituted between apex court and High Courts that can give finality to all appeals.”Venugopal proposed four benches of Court of Appeal — north, south, east and west — having 15 judges each having same calibre as judges of the Supreme Court. He cited a Yale University research that most cases filed in Supreme Court are from north India. “This will require a constitutional amendment. This will leave Supreme Court with a pendency of only 2,000-3,000 cases a year as compared to present figure of 60-70,000. It will allow top court judges more time to patiently read and write judgments, as currently they sit till midnight reading case files listed for next day,” Venugopal said.CJI Bobde, in his speech on the occasion of the Constitution Day, which commemorates the adoption of the Constitution in 1949, acknowledged that huge pendency will arise when the pandemic ceases, but he felt that the judiciary displayed resilience in the face of the crisis as the Supreme Court did not lock down even for a single day.Speaking at another event by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), CJI Bobde said: “The biggest and the highest challenge the courts faced was delivery of unhampered justice in the midst of lockdown as it gives a sense of security and well-being to citizens…Closing physical hearing in courts was the first step, as otherwise the disease would have spread like wildfire.”President Kovind, who presided over the event by the Supreme Court, said: “Justice can be secured to the extent it can be accessed. Access to justice has two major hurdles – cost of litigation and language.” He reiterated his passion for rendering pro bono (without cost) services to poor litigants.Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad complimented the judiciary for administering justice despite all the odds and said the judiciary’s biggest asset was public trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/set-up-four-courts-of-appeal-make-sc-constitutional-court-kk-venugopal/story-bhm3CNoAyIGMIO1bT123AM.html
27-11-2020||India||CBI books former Congress minister in J&K land grab case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday booked former Congress minister Taj Mohiuddin in connection with alleged irregularities in securing proprietary rights to state land in Jammu and Kashmir under a two-decade-old law that the Union territory’s high court has described as unconstitutional and unsustainable.Mohiuddin denied having benefited from the now repealed Roshni Act, which the administration said was misused to cause a loss of ₹25,000 crore in revenue to the erstwhile state. The Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to annul all land dealing under the Roshni Act.“I have never deposited any money in the Roshni scheme, nor has any land been transferred to my name under the scheme. I am not able to understand which case is this. I had never applied for any transfer of land under the Roshni Act,” Mohiuddin said.The Jammu and Kashmir State Lands (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, popularly known as the Roshni (light) Act , was enacted in 2001 with the twin objective of generating resources for financing power projects and conferment of proprietary rights to the occupants of the state land in return for a payment. It was repealed in 2018 by then governor Satya Pal Malik. Mohiuddin is the second Kashmiri politician contesting District Development Council (DDC) polls in J&K to have been booked by a central investigative agency. On Wednesday, Waheed ur Rehman Parra, president of the youth wing of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was arrested after two days of interrogation at the National Investigation Agency’s headquarters in New Delhi in connection with a a case against a senior police officer who was caught in January while ferrying two alleged militants in his car. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party president, Mehbooba Mufti blamed Centre for using agencies to harass Kashmiri leadership.“Kashmiri leaders are being harassed by GOI’s pet agencies like CBI,NIA & ED. They are being hounded & punished for participating in DDC polls. BJPs designs of foisting puppets & proxies has been derailed much to their chagrin,” Mehbooba tweeted in response to a tweet from news agency ANI in which tge agency said Mohiuddin had been booked by the CBI.Mohiuddin, who served as minister in the PDP Congress and Congress-National Conference governments twice, has filed his nomination papers as a candidate for the Parenpilla Uri DDC. PDP has launched a social media campaign in support of Parra, who is contesting the DDC election from Pulwama. “Arrest of @parawahid on fabricated grounds is brazen show of jackboot approach to curb dissent. We can’t & won’t be forced into accepting the loot perpetrated on our rights and identity. #ReleaseWaheedParra,” tweeted Syed Suhail Bukhari, a PDP spokesman who is contesting the DDC election from Sangrama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-books-former-congress-minister-in-j-k-land-grab-case/story-LBW9ICqACSl9oP1yAeBouO.html
27-11-2020||India||Centre has not ruled out a law to guarantee MSP, hints Narendra Singh Tomar||Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday said he could neither say yes nor no to the demand by farmers for a law to guarantee minimum support prices (MSPs), hinting for the first time that the Union government is not ruling out such a possibility. “Abhi mein iske baare me haan bhi nehin keh sakta aur naa bhi nehin keh sakta (At this point, I can neither say yes nor no on this),” the farm minister said in an interview with HT at his office, when asked if the government would even consider the demand.Farmers’ representatives in their November 13 meeting with the farm minister and food minister Piyush Goyal demanded a repeal of three farm laws or amending them to outlaw the sale of farm commodities below federally fixed MSPs. “The recent laws have a different mandate. They are in the interest of farmers. They deal with marketing and contract farming, etc. MSP is outside their scope,” Tomar said. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other states are protesting a set of laws approved by Parliament in September to open up agricultural markets in the country, throwing a political challenge to the Narendra Modi government. On Thursday, police detained hundreds of farmers in Haryana and security on the Delhi-Haryana border was tightened to stop cultivators from entering the national capital, where they plan to hold rallies. The government has defended the recent reforms, saying these changes will bring big buyers, supermarkets and exporters to farmers’ doorstep. Farm unions, however, say the new rules could pave the way for the government to stop buying grains at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers. The government, on the other hand, has insisted it will still purchase staples at guaranteed prices. Tomar said the Modi government had increased the MSP of rice by 43% between 2013-14 and 2020-21. He also said payments made to farmers for paddy procurement had doubled under the National Democratic Alliance government compared to those under the previous United Progressive Alliance government. Total MSP value paid to farmers for paddy had gone up to Rs 4.34 lakh crore during 2014-19, up from Rs 2.88 lakh crore paid during 2009-14, he said. “So, our commitment to MSP is clear. The procurement system will continue,” the minister added. “I want to appeal to our farmer brothers. We are ready to talk about all issues and resolve differences. That is why I have invited them again for talks on December 3.” The government fixes MSP for 23 crops, but buys mostly grains from farmers at these prices. This tends to benefit staple growers. For most other items, farmers get what markets dictate. Experts say a law barring sale of farm produce below MSP makes little economic sense. “If it is not profitable to buy at MSP, say, when demand is low, then the private sector will simply exit the mandi (markets). On the other hand, it is not possible for the government to buy everything at MSP,” said Pravesh Sharma, a fellow at New Delhi’s Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. “Support to farmers is not in question. But support in the form of MSP, which is market-distorting, raises questions, such as ‘whether can we move to other ways of supporting farmers that cause less collateral damage,” Sharma said. Analysts also say higher MSPs or procurement could raise greater scrutiny of India at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). WTO rules cap government procurement for subsidized food programmes by developing countries at 10% of the total value of agricultural production based on 1986-88 prices in dollar terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-has-not-ruled-out-a-law-to-guarantee-msp-hints-narendra-singh-tomar/story-L3zUZFEoCVlAAHPeuYFD0I.html
27-11-2020||India||HTLS 2020: Centre should clear its stand on vaccine pricing, says Bhupesh Baghel||Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel asked the Centre on Thursday if it will provide Covid-19 vaccines free of cost, demanding clarity on the immunisation funding strategy at a time when the race for vaccines has entered the last lap and focus is shifting to regulatory approval and distribution logistics. Speaking at the 18th Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Baghel also criticised Congress leaders such as Kapil Sibal and Ghulam Nabi Azad for publicly attacking the party, and suggested that grievances should be laid out in the party’s internal forum. Also Read |No slowdown in Chhattisgarh during pandemic: CM Bhupesh Baghel at HTLS 2020Baghel, a five-time Congress legislator who swept to power in December 2018 with a two-thirds majority, referred to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) manifesto promise in Bihar of free vaccines and asked if the poll pledge hinted that the onus of funding immunisation would be on the states. “The Centre should clarify if it will make the vaccine free. How much will the states pay? How much will the Centre pay? How much subsidy will the Centre give?” he asked. He pointed out that his state was doing its bit to keep the economy running and following central guidelines on vaccine and distribution strategy, but added that central ministers should be asked if the Union government planned to subsidise the vaccine. “Does the Bihar election promise mean that the Centre won’t spend money and only issue guidelines? We will do our best but the Centre should clarify if it will provide states with the vaccine for free. If we have to spend money, then why should we follow central guidelines and not make our own guidelines?”Baghel’s comments came at a time when four vaccine candidates from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Russian government have published encouraging late-stage clinical trial results. The Oxford-AstraZeneca candidate, called AZD1222, which has an efficacy of up to 90% according to data released this week by the company, and Russia’s Sputnik V with an efficacy of 95%, are considered India’s best hopes. The Oxford vaccine is being manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII).Baghel was one of eight chief ministers who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday to discuss plans to arrest the spread of the virus and inoculation strategies. After the meet, Modi said the Centre was working with states and assured them that a detailed plan for vaccine distribution will be shared soon.But Baghel, 59, appeared dissatisfied with the Covid response, and blamed the Centre, and major metropolitan cities, for failing to quarantine international travellers to break the chain of infection that has claimed around 2,800 lives his state. “When it (Covid-19 pandemic) goes out of control, you put the responsibility of all failures on the states. The PM gave clear hints at uncertainty around the rate, dosage and timing of the vaccine’s availability. It will be good if the Centre bore this one cost,” said Baghel. In his session, Baghel – who has previously called for Rahul Gandhi to take over the Congress – also hit out at swirling controversy over the party’s internal functioning, especially after its dismal showing in the Bihar polls, where it won just 19 of the 70 seats it fought. In media interviews and articles, leaders such as Sibal and Azad have decried the lack of accountability and introspection within the party, drawing criticism from other sections of the Congress. The two were also part of 23 leaders who wrote to party chief Sonia Gandhi in August, asking for internal reforms.Baghel said Rahul Gandhi was best suited to lead the Congress because he had acceptability from the party cadre, and was unafraid to confront the government on a range of issues.“Who has stopped Kapil Sibal or Ghulam Nabi Azad from speaking [against the Union government]? If there are national issues or attacking the government, they never speak. They only attack the party in public,” Baghel said. “These leaders would tell us earlier that we should present our stand in the party forum. The same should apply to them,” said Baghel. The Chhattisgarh chief minister also detailed his government’s strategy to keep the state’s economy running, stopping the outflow of migrant labour and keep a lid on hunger and poverty during the pandemic, and elaborated on how the disease had transformed politics. “Earlier, politics couldn’t be done without road shows, rallies or meeting people. Now it’s confined to one room.

The PM maintained that simultaneous elections at every level should be held using a common voter list. “Every few months, we see an election in some part of the country. You all know what is the impact of these polls on development. There is a need for a deeper study and discussion on the issue and I suggest that presiding officers may lead such discussions,” Modi said. The One Nation, One Election idea was first pitched by Modi in 2015. It is also on the agenda of his Bharatiya Janata Party. The idea, which entails one election every five years for the Lok Sabha, states, even corporations, has met stiff resistance from rival parties. Last year, the Congress skipped a meeting called by the PM on the issue and the Left parties called it a “back-door way of replacing our parliamentary democracy”.The issue has starkly divided India’s political parties. Its advocates have argued the move will help focus on governance, reduce expenditure, and help channel security forces more efficiently. Its critics, including the Congress, have alleged that the move will undermine democratic accountability, the federal structure and also pointed to its lack of feasibility within the constitutional scheme.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the Prime Minister has been pushing for simultaneous elections but any such measure requires structural changes in Constitution. “It is also against the very essence of democracy. So, we think it is just a rhetoric,” he added. Describing the presiding officers as a bridge between the public and the Constitution, Modi hit out indirectly at the Congress for imposing Emergency rule in the 1970s. The PM said that was an attempt to dilute the separation of power of the three wings of the state, but that the Constitution eventually provided a solution.“After the emergency, the system of checks and balances kept getting stronger as the legislature, executive and judiciary moved ahead, learning from the episode,” he said. On Constitution Day, which commemorates the adoption of the Constitution of India, the PM said the national charter had also helped India tackle the challenged posed by Covid-19 by enabling the passage of several laws to help the people. He praised parliamentarians for accepting pay cuts and working more to increase the productivity of Parliament. The Prime Minister cautioned against a tendency of keeping projects pending, citing the example of the Sardar Sarovar dam, which was stuck for years, delaying the benefits that accrued to the people of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan when it was finally constructed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-again-pitches-one-nation-one-election-system/story-XPwSN2CipS5KqlQs6x73aO.html
27-11-2020||India||Attachments up to Rs 40k-crore remain pending as key tribunal stays headless||The country’s top tribunal that hears cases under the money laundering law and other key laws has been without a head for the past 14 months, seriously affecting its functioning. Called just the Apellate Tribunal under SAFEMA Act, the forum hears appeals from individuals and businesses facing seizure and attachment of their properties under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act (SAFEMA), and Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Worse still, it has only one member, out of a sanctioned strength of four members and a chairman . This member, GC Mishra, formerly a top bureaucrat in the law ministry is its acting chairman. People familiar with the functioning of the tribunal and lawyers who appear before it said that attachments worth approximately Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 crore , across hundreds of cases, are pending, significantly affecting the value of these assets. Banks, which expect to recover their money by disposing off properties attached by ED, are also suffering, the people added on condition of anonymity. Some high profile money laundering cases pending before the tribunal include ED’s attachment of properties of former finance minister P Chidambaram, his son Karti Chidambaram, Sandesara brothers of Sterling Biotech Group, former Haryana Chief Minister O P Chautala, the accused in the 2G scam and the coal block case, the AgustaWestland case, the Nirav Modi bank fraud, and a case involving Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Prasad Yadav’s daughter Misa Bharti among others. Most appeals filed in the tribunal relate to the quashing of orders of the adjudicating authority confirming attachments by ED or banks . ED too often approaches the tribunal against any court order where its action to attach an asset is questioned. The appellate tribunal, the only body where individuals and companies, even banks, can appeal against any attachment of a property, usually comprises a Chairman (who is or has been a Judge of the high court or Supreme Court) and four members. The four members can be from the judiciary or Indian Revenue Service (IRS) and held the post of Commissioner/Joint Secretary or equivalent in the Indian Legal Service, Income Tax department, Indian Economy Service, Indian Customs and Central Excise Service or Indian Audit and Account Service. The previous Chairman Justice Manmohan Singh retired on September 21, 2019. Several people HT spoke to said Mishra has been deferring the finalization in majority of cases. “The Acting Chairman has, on days, 50-60 cases listed before him. Because he Acting Chairman, or maybe because his decisions can be challenged since he doesn’t have a judicial background, he isn’t going into the interpretation of law in PMLA or SAFEMA cases,” said a lawyer who didn’t want to be named.It isn’t clear why a new chairman is yet to be appointed. When contacted, a Ministry of Finance Spokesperson said - “There is a case in Supreme Court pertaining to appointments to Tribunals”. The ministry didn’t elaborate further.Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, who is defending several high profile accused including Chanda Kochhar, Ratul Puri, Nirav Modi, and Mehul Choksi said: “Men are fallible, judges are also men. The right of appeal is in accordance of principle of natural justice. When there is no appellate authority, this right of appeal is being denied”. “When there are so many retired judges already, why can’t government appoint them in tribunal”? he added. Samudra Sarangi, Partner at Panag and Babu, said:- “There are several cases with thousands of crores of attached property currently pending before the appellate tribunal. The tribunal is burdened with a voluminous caseload. In the absence of it operating in full strength, private parties, public and private sector banks and financial institutions potentially face delays in the matters being finally decided”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attachments-up-to-rs-40k-crore-remain-pending-as-key-tribunal-stays-headless/story-PhbMorXJZGDL6kj0uNeXUM.html
27-11-2020||India||Trade unions’ strike affects life in Kerala, West Bengal, J’khand||The nationwide general strike called by trade unions in protest against the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s economic policies was near complete in Left-ruled Kerala and some parts of West Bengal and in coal-rich areas of Jharkhand on Thursday. Elsewhere in the country, the strike had limited impact. Shops downed their shutters and most buses stayed off the roads.In Kerala, the lone state in the country ruled by a Marxist government, normal life was badly hit as the 24-hour protest, called by a central committee of trade unions, hit all major sectors, including government offices, banking and insurance .Pilgrims bound for the hill shrine of Sabarimala in Kerala were spared by the strikers. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation buses operated on the temple route, carrying pilgrims. In some districts, tiny store owners complained about the strike hurting their earnings at a time when they are already struggling in the aftermath of Covid-19.The strike has been called to protest against new farm and labour laws that the unions believe promote corporate interests at the expense of farmers and workers.Because of the pandemic , trade unions shunned mass rallies and instead organised limited protest meetings and human chains across Kerala. Marxist leaders and workers took part in the state-level inauguration of the protest by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) at Gandhi Park in Thiruvananthapuram, following social distancing norms.In West Bengal, trains services were disrupted and roads were blocked. Supporters of the general strike clashed with the police at multiple places in West Bengal. At some places, passengers were asked to get off buses by strike supporters who didn’t allow public transport to ply. Shops were damaged in central Kolkata where protestors hurled bricks. In Cooch Behar, they broke the windshields of buses.At Taratala in Kolkata, a scuffle broke out between the police and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers who organised a rally against the strike. The police caned the activists and arrested a few of them. Protests were staged outside Metro stations in Kolkata. “Some groups were protesting outside Dum Dum, Chandni Chowk and Central Metro stations. There were attempts to enter the metro stations but (they) failed. There was no disruption in metro services,” said a spokesperson for Kolkata Metro. Elsewhere in the state, protestors dumped banana leaves and tree branches on overhead wires and sat on railway tracks to block trains. “I had to go down to Kolkata for work but had to abandon the idea as train services were disrupted and bandh supporters were clashing with the police at many places,” said Arindam Das, a resident of Gosaba in South 24 Parganas. Police had to use force to disperse crowds and clear the traffic in many places such as Barasat, Kamarhati and Durgapur. In Jharkhand, the strike was complete in the coal-bearing areas of Bakora and Dhanbad, where unions held protest rallies and prevented buses from plying.. In other towns of the state such as Ranchi and Jameshdpur, the impact was partial, officials said. Trade unions such as Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS), Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), All India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC), Trade Union Co-ordination Centre (TUCC) and Self-Employed Women’’s Association (SEWA) joined the strike. BJP-aligned Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) did not participate in the strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trade-unions-strike-affects-life-in-kerala-west-bengal-j-khand/story-n0PUz8cxYWRqvSuxH8z9VN.html
27-11-2020||India||AstraZeneca plans new vaccine trial as efficacy questioned||AstraZeneca said on Thursday it was likely to conduct an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccine it was developing along with University of Oxford after experts questioned its current studies and cited a lack of transparency around the late-stage clinical trials.The announcement comes days after the vaccine developers said their two-shot inoculation was 70% effective in preventing Covid-19 in an interim analysis of their clinical trial, with a particular regimen in which the first shot was at half-strength showing a higher 90% efficacy. “Now that we’ve found what looks like a better efficacy we have to validate this, so we need to do an additional study,” the pharma group’s chief executive officer Pascal Soriot told Bloomberg in his first interview since the data was released. It will probably be another “international study, but this one could be faster because we know the efficacy is high so we need a smaller number of patients”.AstraZeneca and its partner Oxford University have been under pressure since the release of data on Monday, which initially raised hopes that billions around the world could have early access to a cheap coronavirus inoculation, but that has since been overtaken by confusion over what these disclosures mean. The questions particularly surround the lack of information around the dose that uses a half-strength shot, which AstraZeneca executives later suggested was administered by mistake, and the split of infections among participants who were spread across two countries -- the United Kingdom and Brazil.“We do not have enough information to know what to think. There needs to be a peer-reviewed publication and the company has to submit all its data to the FDA (US regulator Food and Drug Administration) and MHRA (UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) for evaluation and approval,” said John Moore, professor of microbiology and immunology at Cornell University’s medical school, in a conversation over email with HT.Moore said a new study with the half-strength dose was the only way to address some of the most pressing concerns relating to the efficacy estimates. “I believe the company CEO has said today that they will be doing that new trial. It makes sense,” he added.How the vaccine performs is being closely watched in countries such as India, since AstraZeneca has committed a billion doses to the Covax facility to distribute vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. Among the producers of the vaccine is Pune-based Serum Institute of India, which has committed to supplying half of the doses it makes to the country.According to a top expert, in India, where the vaccine is undergoing a separate late-stage trial, the approval can be filed on the lower-efficacy, two full-strength dose, which still meets the 50% efficacy bar set by regulators.“Since the Indian trial is with two full doses of the vaccine, we can bridge to two full doses of the vaccine in the UK and Brazil and should not bridge to a dosing that we have not evaluated in India. Perhaps after the application to DCGI is done, they could propose additional studies in India, based on which they could apply for a labelling change,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, former executive director, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, a Department of Science and Technology (DST) organisation.Kang said that the questions now being raised do not mean the trial results should be rubbished. “The results are good. Better than we hoped for when WHO, FDA and DCGI laid out the 50% efficacy point estimate criterion. All vaccine trials are different, and these are not head-to-head comparisons between vaccines that claim 90, 95 or 60 or 70% efficacy,” she added.AstraZeneca’s CEO indicated on Thursday that the company is likely to follow through with this approach, telling Bloomberg that didn’t expect the additional trial to hold up regulatory approvals in the UK and European Union. Soriot also said that it was wrong the call the half-strength dose an error. Oxford and AstraZeneca announced that their trial findings were based on 131 infections among 20,260 people split across trial sites in the UK and Brazil. The aggregate efficacy was 70.4%, but it was a much lower 62% among those who got the two full-strength doses as planned. “AstraZeneca/Oxford get a poor grade for transparency and rigor when it comes to the vaccine trial results they have reported... AZN is evaluating their vaccine in multiple trials across the world, yet these are not embedded under a unified protocol. In fact, the trials seem to be quite different by country, in terms of populations, subgroups, etc,” wrote Natalie Dean, assistant professor of biostatistics at University of Florida, in a series of tweets on Wednesday.According to a report in the New York Times, which was among the first to report these concerns on Wednesday, AstraZeneca executive Menelas Pangalos said the dosing error was made by a contractor and that regulators were notified of it and signed off on continuing to test the vaccine at different doses.It is unclear what impact this controversy will have on approval process in India, which could itself depend on what regulators in the UK decide. “We need more time to better understand what is happening. If this vaccine is indeed less effective than others, the Indian government and people will need to decide whether it’s good enough for use. They are fully capable of making that decision when it’s time to do so, and based on as much information as possible - much more than we have now,” said Moore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/astrazeneca-plans-new-vaccine-trial-as-efficacy-questions/story-fFLlaYaQxzgQFhgkWB8MBN.html
27-11-2020||India||Bhima Koregaon: Court pulls up prison officials for not replying to Dr Anand Teltumbde’s plea for home food||The special NIA court pulled up prison authorities for not sending a report on the application filed by activist Dr Anand Teltumbde for home food. Teltumbde had moved an application for home food on August 28 where he had also raised issues related to his health. The court had directed the superintendent of Taloja jail to submit a report and also take him for a medical check-up. The prison authorities were asked to submit a reply by September 4. The prison has still not filed a report on the plea before the special court. Annoyed with this the court observed, “In number of matters this court has observed that whenever a report is called for either from the Superintendent of Taloja, Central Prison or Mumbai Central Prison they do not bother to submit timely reports, resultantly it compels the court to keep such application pending for want of reports from the prison authorities. Hence the Superintendent of Taloja Central Prison and Mumbai Central Prison are directed to submit the reports on fixed dates, else this court will be constrained to initiate action for not following the orders of the court.” The court has informed the concerned commissioner of police for information and also to take necessary action. The court has now asked the prison authority to submit the report on the next hearing scheduled in December. Teltumbde, an engineer and Indian Institute of Management (IIM) graduate who used to teach at the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) and at the Goa Institute of Management, was arrested after the Supreme Court refused to grant him protection. On April 14, Teltumbde surrendered before NIA in Mumbai. NIA had said it needed to probe Teltumbde’s alleged links with the banned outfit, Communist Party of India (CPI, Maoist). According to the prosecution, Teltumbde delivered a “provocative presentation” and speeches on December 31, 2017, during an event at Shaniwarwada in Pune, which led to the violence at Bhima-Koregaon in January 2018, state-wide agitation and loss of life. NIA has alleged Teltumbde was the convener of the programme and his call data records show he was in touch with the other arrested accused present at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhima-koregaon-court-pulls-up-prison-officials-for-not-replying-to-dr-anand-teltumbde-s-plea-for-home-food/story-XrmuVeXvroMFHnD2smnwnI.html

27-11-2020||India||‘Biggest ever catch’: Odisha IFS officer in vigilance net for ‘unaccounted riches’||A day after a team of around 150 vigilance officials started the raid on residential and other premises of 1987 batch Indian Forest Service officer Abhay Kant Pathak, senior officials said they were stunned by his alleged unaccounted riches. Since Wednesday, vigilance officials have been carrying out raids to ascertain Pathak wealth at several locations like Bhubaneswar, Pune, Mumbai, Khagaria and Udaipur.It is alleged that Pathak spent about Rs 3 crore on 20 chartered flights alone, mostly during lockdown. A flat and farmhouse in Pune was also allegedly taken on a monthly rent of Rs 5 lakh for his son while he owned many luxury cars.“He would be the biggest ever catch in the history of vigilance department. Though we are yet to arrive at a final figure, the amount would cross Rs 20 crore,” said a senior vigilance official who is part of the raid. Also Watch | ‘PM Modi never interfered in defence, home ministries’: Rajnath Singh #HTLS2020According to officials, Pathak and family have been detained and are being interrogated.His family and his lawyers could not be contacted for his comments despite several attempts.Also read: Astrazeneca likely to run additional global vaccine test, CEO saysPathak, who is working as additional PCCF of afforestation and planning in the state forest department since June 2018, was reportedly in charge of a huge budget for afforestation that included money from CAMPA fund, NREGS as well as plantation under state schemes. In 2019, Centre had released Rs 5,933 crore of CAMPA fund to Odisha, the highest among all states.Giving details of his trips by chartered flights, officials said Pathak visited Mumbai, Pune, Delhi and Patna with his family using the services of a city-based company Kalinga Aero and Allied Services Pvt Ltd. He had last flown in a chartered flight on September 13 with his wife, son and other family members to Pune. After the September 13 visit, Pathak came under the radar of financial intelligence unit of a central agency.Officials wondered how the IFS officer with a monthly salary of Rs 2.7 lakh could afford a lavish 8,000 square feet apartment in Bhubaneswar allegedly laid with Italian marbles and an ivory-encrusted bed worth Rs 50 lakh as well as deer horns. During the raid, Rs 50 lakh cash was recovered from his dentist nephew and Rs 20 lakh from his driver. The vigilance sleuths also seized over half kilograms of gold and Rs 10 lakh cash from his house.Vigilance officials said cash deposits worth around Rs 9.4 crores were found to be made in the bank accounts of Pathak’s son of which about Rs 8.4 crores alone was in banks located in Bhubaneswar. The huge money deposits were mostly made through ATMs at Saheed Nagar and Nayapalli in Bhubaneswar. Expensive vehicles like Mercedes, BMW and Tata Harrier and three Yamaha FZS motorcycles were found registered in the name of his son, who also hired expensive vehicles like Mercedes on rent in Pune. In Pune, Pathak’s son had hired two Mercedes cars for Rs 25 lakh.Besides costly household articles and gold, ornaments weighing around 800 grams were also recovered.Also read: Two-thirds majority cannot be ruled out for BJP in Bengal next year - Rajnath Singh at HTLS 2020More than Rs 1 crore was paid towards house rent of the luxury flats and the farmhouse at Pune. Hotel bills of more than 90 lakhs at Hotel Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai, and a booking amount of Rs 20 lakhs at Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur in Rajasthan were also found during the search.During the raid, the vigilance officials found about Pathak’s son’s impending marriage with the daughter of a senior BJD politician in a palace hotel of Udaipur next month. Since last week, the family was hosting numerous pre-wedding receptions in top-end hotels of Bhubaneswar.Meanwhile, officials found that in May this year, Pathak’s son was accused of misrepresenting himself as the managing director of Tata Motors Passenger Car division and duped people after assuring of getting them jobs at the company. In the complaint (a copy of which has been accessed by HT) to Odisha CID, the deputy general manager(ethics) of Tata Motors accused Akash of forgery, misrepresentation and cheating as he had printed his visiting card with Tata Motors logo. The company cited Akash’s Facebook and Linkedin profiles, wherein he showed him to be working for Tata Administrative Service, as evidence of his forgery.In its FIR, the company said that there is no person in the name of Akash Kumar Pathak who worked as the MD for Tata Motor Pune Passenger Division or CEO designate. It also cited web articles to show how Pathak donated Rs 5 lakh to chief minister’s relief fund posing as managing director (in-charge) of Tata Motors.In the last 3 years, there have been at least 3 cases of forest officials getting caught over disproportionate assets. In 2016, divisional forest officer of Athagarh, Sudhansu Mishra was arrested for disproportionate assets worth Rs 5.5 crore worth including cash amounting to Rs 93 lakh.In February 2017, income tax officials had raided houses and office of deputy conservator of forests Sarat Chandra Panda after it was found that he had deposited large amount in bank accounts of his family members during demonetization. The Enforcement Directorate also lodged a case against Panda.In June 2018, vigilance officials had arrested Divisional Forest Officer Ghumusar (South), BK Acharya for allegedly amassing unaccounted assets, investments, cash and gold worth more than Rs 3.51 crore. Cash worth Rs 16.8 lakh and gold weighing over 1 kilograms were seized from his lockers.Noted environmental activist Biswajit Mohanty alleged that he had lodged several complaints to the state forest department secretary and suggested a list of measures to prevent corruption by officials.“Corruption is often linked with long tenures of officers/staff beyond the normal posting period of 3 years. Very often people in lucrative posts pay heavy bribes or get political influence to ensure that they are not transferred after the normal tenure of 3 years. This is one of the chief breeding grounds for corruption. It also leads to the breakdown of discipline as the Range Officers do not obey orders of the DFO due to political links. There is a dire need for utmost transparency in operations of the forest department so that corruption can be curbed with the help of citizens. I have been demanding increased disclosures to be made in the website of the PCCF, Odisha for transparency. Sadly no steps have been taken so far,” said Mohanty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biggest-ever-catch-odisha-ifs-officer-in-vigilance-net-for-unaccounted-riches/story-987x9GXvlCdonLV02bE7hN.html
27-11-2020||India||IIT, NIT students to get option to study in Hindi, local languages||The Union education ministry announced on Thursday that from the coming academic session students at elite institutions like some Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs)will get a chance to study engineering and other courses Hindi and regional languages.The decision, which is in line with a key recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) was taken at a review meeting on various schemes chaired by Union Education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank in which Higher Education secretary Amit Khare and School Education secretary Anita Karwal were present.According to an official statement released by the ministry, in the meeting Pokhriyal directed UGC to ensure all scholarships, fellowships are disbursed in time and to start a helpline for the same. He also directed that all the grievances of the students be redressed immediately. “A seminal decision was made to start technical education, especially engineering courses imparting education in mother tongue will be opened from next academic year. A few IITs and NIT are being short listed for the same,” said a statement released by the ministry.The New Education Policy (NEP) released earlier this year emphasises on promoting Indian languages.When asked if the plan was only to begin with Hindi, or other languages would be included, a senior official said other languages would also be promoted. For Hindi, it is learnt that a pilot project is being considered at the IIT-Banaras Hindu University (BHU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-nit-students-to-get-option-to-study-in-hindi-local-languages/story-T7z2n7nclccTNWUJWeKtaK.html
27-11-2020||India||India, Nepal discuss boundary issue||India and Nepal on Thursday discussed ways to handle the boundary issue, which had recently hit bilateral ties, through existing mechanisms as foreign secretary Harsh Shringla met the country’s top leadership to bolster cooperation in key areas such as connectivity and infrastructure. Shringla met Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali and foreign secretary Bharat Raj Paudyal on the first day of his two-day visit aimed at putting the relationship on an even keel and enhancing joint efforts aimed at post-Covid-19 recovery. Ties took a hit when Nepal issued a new political map in May that laid claim to the Kalapani region, which is controlled by India, after New Delhi opened a new road to the strategic Lipulekh region. India rejected the map but said it was open to discussing the matter through appropriate mechanisms. A person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Shringla’s discussions with Oli included a “candid review of the state of the bilateral relationship”. The importance of respecting each other’s sensitivities was noted and both sides stressed on the positives in the special relationship, the person said. During the various meetings, the two sides “shared their perspectives on boundary matters and discussed ways to take it forward under the appropriate bilateral mechanisms”, the person added. A statement issued by Nepal’s foreign ministry said Shringla and Paudyal “discussed the boundary matters and exchanged views on completing the boundary work in the remaining segments”. Almost 98% of the 1,770-km India-Nepal border is demarcated and the two sides only have differences in the Kalapani and Susta regions. Much of Shringla’s discussions focused on bilateral development projects, including key connectivity schemes and post-earthquake reconstruction work, and ways to expedite their implementation. At the meeting with Oli, discussions were held on specific steps that could help finalise important projects at the earliest, including the Pancheshwar multipurpose project and the launch of new economic initiatives. Specific meetings to maintain high-level engagement and address issues of mutual interest were also discussed. The need to resume people-to-people contacts, including the launch of an air bubble between India and Nepal, also figured in the talks. At the meeting with foreign minister Gyawali, Shringla handed over 2,000 vials of Remdesivir injections as part of India’s support for efforts to combat Covid-19. Noting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said India will use its vaccine manufacturing capabilities for the world, Shringla said, “We will make this vaccine accessible and affordable and it goes without saying that the first priority will be for our closest neighbours, our friends like Nepal.” Shringla, who spoke to the media in Nepali, described India and Nepal as “close friends” and said his meetings were aimed at seeing how the two sides can take the relationship forward.

27-11-2020||Editorials||Safeguarding India’s borders | HT Editorial||Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit on Thursday, defence minister Rajnath Singh made a series of important statements. On China, he said that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would not be allowed to make any unilateral change at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and India’s armed forces were fully authorised to challenge them. On Pakistan, Mr Singh had an interesting formulation — it was because of the slow collapse of its model of terrorism that Pakistan was seeking to destabilise the Line of Control (LoC). On 26/11 — he was speaking on the 12th anniversary of the terror attack — Mr Singh said such an attack was next to impossible on Indian soil due to the manner in which India’s national security infrastructure had been reconfigured.All of this merits attention. But the most significant takeaway from the raksha mantri’s speech was his preliminary articulation of what can be called India’s new national security doctrine. Mr Singh said that India wants peace, but to prevent war, it has to be ready for one. Deterrence is, of course, an established precept. He also said, however, that India has both crossed the border to attack terror locations in Pakistan when necessary, and has given a robust response to China. If this meant that New Delhi was now inching towards what is being termed as “offensive defence” — a willingness to be aggressive to secure itself — the minister was guarded. But India’s actions, more with Pakistan and less with China, suggest that a new normal is here, which should make Islamabad think before it plans another move to inflict terror in India.Equally, what he did not say was as significant. Mr Singh was careful, citing sensitivities, not to elaborate on the ground situation at LAC, except saying both the Chinese and Indian armies were mobilised. He was reluctant to share details of talks with China, except to say that the process was ongoing and the outcome remained uncertain. While acknowledging the bravery of India’s armed forces, he was intriguingly silent about the other brave steps they had taken besides Galwan — avoiding a pointed question on whether this included taking over the heights on the southern banks of Pangong Tso. While it is tempting to be critical and demand more answers, his approach indicates that the government wants to be moderate in rhetoric, defuse tensions, and leave room for a mutually acceptable solution. This is an act of responsibility in the face of grave provocation – and one born from a quiet confidence and resolve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/safeguarding-india-s-borders-ht-editorial/story-5Gb8HP4LUEhbMyToLA1IVN.html
