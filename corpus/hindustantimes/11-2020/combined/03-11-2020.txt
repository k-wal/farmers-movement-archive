After all, Pakistan had lured China into its fold under the pretext of showing Jammu and Kashmir as part of its territory.Warning from Foreign SecretaryForeign secretary Harsh Shringla warned against debt-trap diplomacySpeaking to think tanks in Germany, Shringla said the world was increasingly witnessing debt-trap diplomacyHe also said that countries should be cautious about terms of engagementPakistan does not have territorial contiguity with China; it is only through the Occupied Kashmir and Northern Areas, precisely through the territories of Gilgit-Baltistan that Pakistan has been able to link with China. Earlier, Chinese interest in the area was limited to Shakshgam Valley as it wanted continuous connectivity through the area to its Xinjiang region. Pakistan was only too happy to comply with the Chinese request and handed it over 5180 sq km of its territory in 1963.This was the first reality check of the so-called ‘love and affection’ of Pakistan for the people of Jammu and Kashmir it has continued to project for decades now.Right from the beginning, Pakistan tried to project Northern Areas, as they were then called, in different light. It abrogated many of the privileges associated with erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in the region, including abolition of state subject law in 1974, and making the home of Shias into a Sunni majority area. The people of G-B still do not have even the most basic rights and privileges. They cannot elect their leaders freely as all the leaders are first screened and allowed to contest only after they swore allegiance to Pakistan.Pakistan got China to construct Karakoram highway in order to have a backup plan for the region. The ecologically fragile region witnessed the folly of human intervention when in 2010 in Hunza, a landslide killed 20 people and blocked the flow of River Hunza. The resultant flooding displaced more than 6,000 people and inundated about 20 km of the Karakoram highway.Undeterred by the tragedy, Pakistan again approached China for the construction of a realigned road. China, by this time flush with funds and carrying the impression of an emerging power, had realised the potential of the route which could have provided it alternate access to the Arabian Sea and through that to the Middle East and other countries.This would have not only provided it an alternate trade route, but also acted as a backup plan should its access through the Malacca Strait is choked in any eventuality. China realised the value in having a friendship with Pakistan, which in any case would never be in a position to oppose Beijing’s desires and decisions. The Chinese thus sold them the idea of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Pakistan, misgoverned right from the inception, did not have the capacity to evaluate the pros and cons of the Chinese intentions. In any case, it did not have an alternative development plan to show to the people and therefore lapped the offer. However, Chinese were adamant that the legality of the area through which the corridor would pass should not come into the question.China realised the precarious legal position Pakistan has over these territories when international lending agencies backtracked from financing the Diamer Bhasha Dam project, located in Kohistan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Diamer in Gilgit-Baltistan, based on Indian opposition. The project for which the foundation stone was laid in 1998, has suffered innumerable delays on account of the untenable legal position of Pakistan in the territory. However, China under Xi Jinping decided to come to the rescue of Pakistan and the Imran Khan government entered into an agreement with China Power in May, 2020.It is interesting to note that not so long ago, in 2017, Pakistan had dropped the idea of getting the project financed under CPEC framework as China had placed strict conditions including the ownership of the project. Going by experience, China has always thought of undertaking construction projects in other countries as those fulfilling its own interests, as the investment potential of these are neither evaluated nor realised. It is not difficult to imagine what conditions China would have imposed to an even more desperate Pakistan in 2020 while agreeing on Daimer Bhasha Dam.China has other interests in the Gilgit-Baltistan region as well - the projects financed and undertaken by it include Sust Dry Port, upgradation of Karakoram Highway (KKH), 820 km OFC project connecting Khunjerab to Rawalpindi and Jaglot-Skardu road. All these projects can be seen to be actually catering to the Chinese interests, a fact gradually sinking into the minds of an average Pakistani, who does not see any opportunity coming his way. The Chinese banks finance the projects undertaken by their companies involving their engineers and machinery and even labour. The markets in Pakistan are flush with Chinese goods and the Chinese people never deny an opportunity to snub a local in Pakistan.Shops selling pork have become the mainstay in the majority of Islamic Republic of Pakistan’s towns to cater to the Chinese demands. There is so much mistrust between the Pakistanis and Chinese community that in a recent advertisement for renting out an upscale house in Islamabad, the owner specially mentioned that the offer was not for the Chinese.It was in this background that when India decided to abrogate Article 370, the Chinese sensed threat to their strategic as well as investment plan and put pressure on Pakistan to find a way out. Imran Khan visited Gilgit-Baltistan on the so called 73rd Independence Day of the region on November 1 to announce provincial status for the state. Interestingly, Khan visited the region last year also on the same occasion when, going out of sync, he announced that Gilgit-Baltistan has always been the bridge between Pakistan and China. It is worth mentioning here that previously at no point of time in its entire history, the day had been celebrated with Pakistan PM’s visit to the region.People of Gilgit-Baltistan are apprehensive not only about Pakistan’s intention but China’s too. Some of the pro-independence parties, including JKLF, have opposed Pak government decision to grant provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan. So called PM of Azad Kashmir, Farooq Haider Khan, along with local units of the mainstream parties of Pakistan have also opposed the move, fearing it may be overtaken by the Chinese.The Emir of Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir, Khalid Mahmood, rejected Khan’s announcement of giving provisional provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan, saying this is direct interference in the region’s elections. He added that it weakened Pakistan’s stand internationally and is a violation of United Nations resolutions. His fellow party leader and convener of the All Parties Kashmir Coordination Council, Abdur Rashid Turabi, said that before making Gilgit-Baltistan a province broad based consultations must be held.People of the area have already been expressing their resentment against Chinese projects. Residents of Chilas organised a protest (September 18) against non-payment of compensation for the land acquired for the construction of the Diamer Bhasha Dam. Earlier, under the banner of Graduate Alliance and Geologists Association Diamer, the residents had staged a protest (on September 9 and 11) asserting their claim on the jobs and opposing inadequate employment of the local youth.People have also been vehemently opposing Islamabad’s decision to lease pasture land to Chinese companies for mining.Mirza Hussain, a member of the Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly, had alleged in 2019 that 300 mining leases were awarded to Chinese companies without consulting people. Pakistan, at the behest of China, introduced web-based customs duty at Sust Port in 2018. Despite protests by the local traders that this will lead to loss of jobs for the local population and threat to boycott the trade, Pakistan did not relent. It is interesting to note that when a number of girl’s schools were burnt in Tanger and Darel region in Gilgit-Baltistan in 2018, Pakistan had shown complete apathy for the people of the region. Lt Gen Nadeem Raza, Commander of the 10th Corps, while addressing a public gathering at Chilas, completely ignored the importance of the education of girls, and instead chose to caution that such incidents negatively impact the implementation of CPEC.In Pakistan, it is well known that the establishment calls the shots. It is for this reason that the Chinese, instead of relying on the political leaders, wanted that the Army should be spearheading the CPEC. It pressurised the Pakistan government to establish CPEC Authority and appoint an army officer as its head. Accordingly, Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa was appointed as the Chairman of the authority in 2019. It is also interesting to note that despite the plethora of allegations regarding corruption by him, the Pakistan government has not been able to take any action against him. Moreover, there is also a proposal to exempt the CPEC from the purview of the National Accountability Bureau.The present political structure of Gilgit-Baltistan suits Pakistan to undertake such decisions about it. With no political representation and no opposition, it is free to do whatever it wants with the territory. It is this relationship that permits Pakistan to play the role of a client state to the Chinese, a job it has always been willing to undertake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/gilgit-baltistan-pakistan-plays-the-role-of-supplicant-to-chinese-expansion-analysis/story-8f0r5UPmP7E8R7EsXrpojO.html
03-11-2020||News||A financial model for higher education||India’s gross enrollment ratio (GER) in higher education is 28%. It lags behind the global average of 38% and behind China’s 51%. If India wants to become a knowledge economy, our higher education institutions (HEIs) will have to play a leading role in boosting the innovation ecosystem while, at the same time, increasing GER to 50%. This calls for the scaling up of existing institutions as well as the creation of new premier ones. To put things in perspective, 23 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) will admit as many as 15,000 undergraduates this year, while just one state university in the United States (US), Arizona State University, admits 13,500 undergraduates each year. While the scaling-up of existing institutions and the creation of new institutions require additional budgetary allocations, running them well calls for money on a recurring basis. As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the nation’s expenditure on higher education remains low. This lower investment per student also has a strong correlation with global rankings. The new National Education Policy (NEP) is trying to address this issue by allocating a fixed percentage of GDP for higher education. It also talks about granting administrative autonomy to higher education institutions. Currently, these institutions receive upwards of 80% of funds from the government. They must explore 21st-century financial models to secure financial and administrative autonomy.What is needed is a structural overhaul and creation of a diversified financial model for our institutions. Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) have been able to achieve autonomy by charging a higher tuition fee, contributing up to 85% of their funds. Is charging high fees the only viable financial model? It need not be if we follow the best practices of various countries and use a combination of these models. Tuition fees contribute up to a quarter of the income for the most universities in the US, Australia and Asia. In the IITs, it contributes to only 6-7%, since only a fraction (approximately one-third) of students pay the upper limit of tuition fees. Others pay a much lower amount, based on their social category and economic status. This contribution can be increased not only by charging market competitive tuition fees, but also by bringing all students into the fee-paying category. This can be achieved by decoupling students and their families from the upfront financial barriers by offering them collateral-free and interest-free Income Contingency Loans (ICLs) through a centralised financial structure. Australia’s Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) is a widely-praised ICL model that is managed by the Australian taxation office. The repayments are linked to the debtor’s income level and are collected directly by the Australian tax authorities. ICLs are different from the education loans offered in the US that have caused massive student debt problems. A scheme can be piloted in India with IITs, which could also offer professional, executive and online programmes that do not require the infrastructure conventional degree programmes do.A third of the income could come from the research activities. Though research is primarily government-sponsored, universities such as UC Berkeley, Harvard and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne raise up to a third of their research funds from non-government sources. Research at IITs is predominantly government-sponsored. A critical challenge has been managing and operating research facilities with insufficient overheads (ranging 5-10%) from these government grants. Alongside the expected increase in overheads, IITs could tap funds from the private sector, invest in and incubate research start-ups, and strengthen technology transfer and intellectual property licensing mechanisms. Mechanisms such as Foundation of Innovative Technology Transfer (FITT) at IIT Delhi and Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE) at IIT Bombay may facilitate institutional equity investment in deep-tech start-ups. The recent launch of the world’s most affordable Covid-19 testing kit by IIT Delhi and the supply of over 4.5 million export-quality personal protective equipment by IIT Delhi start-ups are small demonstrations of the potential such investments by HEIs can generate. For boosting industry participation in research, IIT Madras has shown a way through the creation of technology parks. IIT Delhi is currently developing three technology parks for various industry sectors. Harvard, Stanford and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have pioneered the concept of endowments, now adopted by public universities across the world. Endowment investment returns can easily contribute up to a third of the university’s income. Endowments are raised not only from the alumni but also from industry, philanthropists and governments. Last year, IIT Delhi launched an endowment fund with a target of raising $1 billion, that will provide a conservative investment income of ₹700 crore every year. A successful endowment model will require the creation of fund-raising teams and investment policy changes to overcome bureaucratic hurdles. The new financial model for HEIs will be fuelled by the income from, one, deferred tuition payments; two, research grants/equity investments in startups/technology transfer fees; and, three, endowment donations. The transition is imminent, and it is up to us whether to lead or follow.V Ramgopal Rao is director, IIT-Delhi, and Anurag Sachan is executive, IIT-Delhi The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-financial-model-for-higher-education/story-FQGCKDvFaDjykPUcXmhveN.html
03-11-2020||News||China’s quest to control Tibet’s spiritual space | Opinion||The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) first acknowledged the importance of the religious authority of Tibetan lamas in 1992 when it approved the elevation of Ogyen Trinley Dorje, a boy recognised by the Dalai Lama as the 17th Karmapa, the head of the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. Three years later, China asserted its claim of sovereignty in the centuries-old tradition of reincarnation by the resurrection of the Qing dynasty method of using the golden urn for the selection of the 11th Panchen Lama, Tibet’s second highest spiritual leader. Elliot Sperling, the world’s foremost authority on the subject, argues that the anachronistic resurrection of the golden urn is meant to establish legitimacy through historical continuity. But the existence of the golden urn in Tibetan religious and political affairs offers little evidence to confirm whether the Qing dynasty exercised any control over its impartial use. Many sources indicate that the urn was merely symbolic as the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas were chosen according to the wishes and traditions of the Tibetan Buddhist authorities. In the selection of the 11th Panchen Lama, the Chinese authorities rigged the golden urn and literally handpicked their candidate. Arjia Rinpoche, a revered religious leader who was part of the selection committee, exposed this underhand operation in his book Surviving the Dragon: A Tibetan Lama’s Account of 40 Years under Chinese Rule. The Chinese authorities are said to have abducted the Dalai Lama’s chosen boy and his family members. Their whereabouts still remain shrouded in secrecy. Similarly, Ngabo Ngawang Jigme, the then vice-chairman of the standing committee of the National People’s Congress, exposed Beijing’s claim of sovereignty in the recognition of Tibetan lamas on the basis that Kuomintang’s representative Wu Chung-tsin presided over the enthronement ceremony of the 14th Dalai Lama in 1940 in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. Basil Gould, the British representative at the ceremony, observed that the Chinese delegates were not given priority over other foreign representatives. In recent years, the Chinese government has further strengthened its control over the recognition of Tibetan lamas in Tibet through quixotic laws and orders. In July 2007, the state administration for religious affair issued an administrative diktat called the Order No 5 or formally known as the Management Measures for the Reincarnation of Living Buddhas in Tibetan Buddhism. This consists of 14 articles designed to control the core belief system of Tibetan Buddhism. The regulation asserts control over the searches, testing, recognition, education, and training of religious figures. The United Front Work Department, the CCP organ that deals with religious and ethnic affairs, organised a patriotic training programme in October 2016 for a group of 20 young incarnate lamas on what could be described as a communist pilgrimage, visiting military bases, a defence academy and revolutionary sites, including Mao Zedong’s memorial museum. In addition, the Chinese government, under the aegis of the Chinese Buddhist Association, launched an online database in January 2016. The database exclusively carries profiles of 1,311 Party-approved lamas. Although Beijing maintains that the database will “help protect the legitimate rights and interests of Tibetan Buddhism”, it is clear that it will use this database as a tool to further alienate the Dalai Lama and curtail the influence of all the top lamas of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism, all of whom are in India, and that of Bon, Tibet’s homegrown religion. In 2011, the Chinese government established the Tibetan Buddhist Academy near Lhasa and instituted a separate class for young incarnate lamas under 16. Six of them are currently in the academy. The grooming of these young lamas, including the 7th Reting Rinpoche and 6th Dedrug Rinpoche, whose immediate predecessors served as regents before the Chinese occupation of Tibet, clearly illustrates Beijing’s political intention; these cherry-picked lamas will be used to validate the potential Beijing-selected 15th Dalai Lama and to show the world that the Tibetan Buddhist clergy’s acceptance of its choice. The urgency became evident when China began promoting its chosen Panchen Lama both domestically and internationally. The Panchen Lama’s appearance at the Third World Buddhist Forum held in Hong Kong in 2012 and his visit to Thailand in 2019 as a part of a Buddhist delegation are seen as Beijing’s intention to boost his international standing and recognition. Beijing will gradually increase his visits to Asian Buddhist countries, including Mongolia. His frequent visits to the Tibet Autonomous Region and other Tibetan areas incorporated into the neighbouring Chinese provinces reflect the urgency with which Beijing seeks his acceptance by the Tibetan people. It hopes that this will give him the spiritual gravitas to select the next Dalai Lama given the tradition of mutual recognition between the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas. This way, China can control the Tibetan spiritual space, something it has long sought to do.

03-11-2020||News||A Suitable Boy: Where love is intricate and the personal is political||I first read Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy in the mid-2000s. I watched Mira Nair’s Monsoon Wedding in 2001. Both these works, though ostensibly about deliberations of spouse-selection and the mayhem of organising weddings, offer insights into Indian social and political realities. So, I was looking forward to watching Nair’s adaptation of A Suitable Boy. Seth’s novel in tracing a 19-year-old girl, Lata’s choice of spouse from among three suitors, lays out how an individual’s quest for companionship is shaped by society, and, in so doing, convincingly explains how the personal is political. Similarly, Nair’s film addresses difficult and sensitive issues of child abuse and infidelity in the joyful framework of weddings. Nair has been bold to undertake an adaptation of this 1,500-page masterpiece. This certainly runs the risk of not being able to capture the complexities of the characters, political situations, and personal struggles. Nonetheless, this series is appealing for it has captured two key themes of the novel, which resonate with contemporary times, namely, inter-religious marriages and the different meanings of love. Lata’s attraction and compatibility with Kabir Durrani, her first suitor, is set against the backdrop of Hindu-Muslim relations in post-Independent India. Amid rising communal tensions (due to construction of a temple right next to a mosque), Kabir’s declarations of love remain insufficient to make him a suitable choice. Lata’s family has nothing against Kabir, they claim, yet marrying a Muslim in those troubled times, they remind Lata, is far from wise. Written in the 1990s, this novel was set in the 1950s, but Seth could well have sketched this character to suit current times, as furore over Hindu-Muslim unions continues, evident in the reaction to the now-retracted advertisement by the jewellery brand, Tanishq. Seth’s novel has generated debates on who would have been the ideal suitor for Lata. To some, Lata’s choice in Haresh Kapoor, the career-focused man, was conservative. The romantics would have opted for the suave, charming, lawyer-turned-poet Amit Chatterjee, and the daring would have liked to see Lata with the handsome, cricket-playing Muslim classmate, Kabir Durrani. In developing these characters, Seth generated a poignant discussion on whether there exists different types of love (passion, compatibility, duty), and which of these should motivate marriage. A strength of this series is that it has developed Haresh’s character well, and in doing so, contributed to this debate on different meanings of love. Nair has not presented Haresh simplistically as that choice which fits well with middle-class values and moralities of having a good job and being of an appropriate caste. Rather, she has been able to draw out that Lata chose Haresh for his sincerity, willingness to make adjustments for her, and a sense that he would let her grow into an individual of her own. This nuanced lens, however, is not adopted for Amit Chatterjee’s character, who is only depicted as a society man, charmed by Lata but too modern for her. Whereas in the novel, we see how Amit and Lata are deeply attracted to each other, perhaps due to a shared passion for poetry, but Amit’s expressions of interest are inconsistent and too few and far between, which makes Lata think of him as unpredictable to venture into married life.These experiences and deliberations of love and attraction seem quite relevant particularly for the urbane youth who seem to believe that romantic and passionate love must be the only worthy basis for marriage. This series, then, has reopened this debate in the Indian context, on whether marriage can be based on a love that does not emanate from intense passion, without necessarily questioning one’s sense of modernity. Nair’s adaptation has captured well how the personal is always political, and has explained well that religion, pride, and intent create an intricate web that is to be traversed in order to find a suitable spouse.

03-11-2020||News||Donald Trump and the future of the Republican Party | Opinion||Donald Trump upturned the political applecart in 2016 by assembling a coalition of anger. Now he’s arousing them to new heights of fear and loathing. He is losing parts of the coalition as a result but hopes enough fence-sitters and fellow-travellers who stayed home in 2016 will rally to him. In addition, the Republican Party is using every administrative trick to put up obstacles to Democratic voters and counting on a Right-tilting Supreme Court to wink at them. But the American Right-wing should be praying for a Trump defeat. If he were to come back, he would put the Republicans on a path to ideological perdition. The 2016 polls undercounted the number of working-class and small-town White voters who wanted an anti-establishment candidate. As a team under political scientist Loren Collingwood showed, dislike for their national elite was so strong millions of them voted for Barack Obama because he was an outsider even though many were unhappy about his colour. Trump repudiated almost every element of traditional Right-wing ideology along the way, including free trade, open borders and fiscal conservatism, and won their backing in large part because he did so. Trump is hurting today because Covid-19 showed his administrative competence was not on par with his ability to tap this anger. He also didn’t deliver on his promises to overturn the establishment. Lots of noisy immigration bashing, racist signalling, tax cuts and so on, but the system is largely intact. Finally, his own misogyny, entitlement and boorishness appealed to no one. His support among White women of all classes has flagged. Elderly Whites are appalled by his pandemic response. College educated White men align with his policies but find the man distasteful. He has picked up new support. Twice as many young Latinos and Blacks like his elite-bashing. But almost every election analyst in the US says Trump has lost more than he has gained – and this makes returning to the White House more a maze than a path. It could yet happen, thanks largely to vagaries of the US electoral college system. If he can hold onto all the southern and western states he won in 2016, he would need only two largish Midwestern states, say Pennsylvania and Ohio, to breast the tape. Or it could end up in the Supreme Court. But the odds are against him. Democratic candidate Joe Biden has the 232 electoral college votes that went for Hillary Clinton in the bag. He only needs 38 more to win and he can get them from roughly any three of the dozen swing states in play. And most polls have him leading in two-thirds of them. The polls, the pocketbooks and the pandemic are lining up for Biden. The real question for the Republican Party is their own future. In 2012, the party realised its base was increasingly Whites in non-metropolitan areas, an aging and shrinking demographic. A famous party analysis, called “the autopsy,” laid out a strategy to target Latinos and youth. The party began implementing it, but then Trump came along. He broke the party’s fraying coalition of blue-collar Whites and business, doubling down on the first part and discarding the second. He energised the base so they came out in numbers, picked up discontented in other groups as well, but has put the Republicans on a dismal path.If Trump returns, the Republican Party will be fully redrawn as a caricature: Protectionist, isolationist, anti-immigrant, blue collar and deeply racist. The party will jettison its belief in free markets, minimal government and balanced budgets. More importantly, it will lose its ability to attract socially conservative minorities, the party’s best hope to create a winning electoral coalition. For history buffs: he will resurrect the short-lived Know Nothing Party of the 1850s, imbuing it with a similar sense of paranoia. It is one reason big business, both Silicon Valley and Wall Street, leans against Trump. If he returns, they will fully turn against the Republicans. It is true that there is much less political space in the US for free trade and untrammelled markets. Trump pressed the accelerator on an existing bipartisan trend. Biden’s election manifesto is all about industrial policy and managed trade. But, as the Pew Research Center and others have shown, today a Democrat is more likely to be in favour of trade agreements and foreign policy alliances than a Republican. Trump 2.0, by driving away minorities, college-educated Whites and Big Tech, will push his party further down this path. The problem is the residue he will have left are what Hillary Clinton called “deplorables” — disgruntled working-class Whites steeped in racism and QAnon. Hence the many anti-Trump Republican groups, like the Lincoln Project, and so many traditional conservatives have endorsed Biden. They hope a Trump defeat will allow them to recapture the base, return to “the autopsy” and align the US Right with an increasingly more diversified and digital America. The New Yorker recently cited Indian-American Nikki Haley as the standard-bearer of this school. However, there are strong signs that even without Trump, the Republicans will not change their present path. Too many of their Nextgen leaders see his formula as a winner. They will be less crude and polarising, but they will be about preserving a mythical White America and using state intervention and evangelical rulebooks to do so. The US’s fate under them can be summed up in Trump’s quip, “I think if this country gets any kinder or gentler, it’s literally going to cease to exist.”pchaudhuri@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/donald-trump-and-the-future-of-the-republican-party-opinion/story-8u8GaCoBFmgWPSUHyEbFgO.html
03-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai gets Rs244 crore from Centre to fight air pollution||The Centre allocated ₹396.5 crore to Maharashtra, the biggest share from a total of ₹2,200 crore to all states, to improve the air quality in its cities, under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as per the recommendations by the 15th finance commission. Of the amo-unt allocated to Maharashtra, ₹244 crore will be for Mumbai.The Union finance ministry released the funds for 42 urban agglomerations in 15 states as the first instalment of the programme. Mumbai received the biggest share among cities, followed by Kolkata (₹192 crore), Bengaluru (₹139.5 crore) and Chennai (₹90 crore). Maharashtra has six cities — Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Nashik, Pune — featured in the list. Pune got ₹67 crore, Nagpur ₹33 crore, Nashik ₹20.5 crore, while Vasai-Virar and Aurangabad received ₹16 crore each. The state government has been directed to release the funds to the civic bodies within 10 working days. “The funds are expected to be utilised for the capacity-building of local bodies and meeting needs of the state pollution control board to achieve the goal of maintaining ambient air quality within the jurisdiction of the cities,” a letter tweeted by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, against the backdrop of the ongoing tussle between the state and Central government, tweeted about the highest allotment to the state. A November 2 communication from the Finance Commission Division to the accounts officer at the Chief Controller of Accounts in the department of expenditure, ministry of finance, details the allocation. The 2020-21 report of the finance commission had recommended the grant of ₹4,400 crore to NCAP. The programme, launched in January last year, aims to reduce by 20-30%, the PM 2.5 (respirable, pollution particles) concentrations in over a hundred cities compared to 2017 levels.Meanwhile, according to officials from the environment department, “We are also expecting guidelines from the Central government along with the funds. The cities selected are with a high level of pollution and we call them ‘atonement cities’ which need more focus. We have been implementing measures to arrest the pollution from industrial and vehicular transmission, which are the biggest contributors. The efforts will definitely get a boost by the central funds.”The local bodies in the list shall entrust one urban local body as a nodal entity to receive the grants. This nodal entity shall also have the responsibility of achieving the performance indicators for the entire urban agglomeration, the ministry’s statement said.(with inputs from Jayashree Nandi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-gets-rs244-crore-from-centre-to-fight-air-pollution/story-AMMfIZITv195R0lw5ILr7J.html

03-11-2020||Noida||Noida garment exporters stare at uncertain future amid fresh lockdown in European countries||NOIDA: With reports of fresh lockdown in some European countries, apparel exporters of Gautam Budh Nagar district are staring at an uncertain future. Lalit Thukral, chairman of Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC), said that one of the worst-hit business sectors in the Covid-19 pandemic is textiles – particularly the garment exports in that segment. “A sharp fall in domestic and export demand due to Covid-19, and lower profitability are enough to give a major setback to the apparel industry. We saw some hope with fresh orders coming from European countries for Spring-Summer Collections 2021. But, with fresh lockdown in the UK, Italy, Spain, France and Germany – which have at least 40% share in overall apparel exports worth over Rs 50,000 crore from India – the Indian exporters have started sulking again as it will result in higher revenue loss,” Thukral said. He further said that with the lockdown in these countries, the apparel exports’ revenue of Rs 2 lakh crore will certainly go down by 30% in this fiscal. “For the apparel exporters, the fall will be more because of tepid discretionary spending in these countries,” he said. Amid this uncertainty, the exporters have started surfing the avenues in the domestic market to make up the financial loss. However, they said that the domestic market won’t be able to make up for the loss.Echoing similar views, Neeraj Prakash, who runs a garment export company in Noida, said, “Now, there is a lot of uncertainty. Even the orders ready to be shipped are dumped in the customs office. If the situation persists, the future of Indian apparel industry is very bleak. Only Noida is all set to lose the export orders of Rs 5,000 crore this year. The domestic demand is nothing more than a drop in the ocean for us,” he said. However, Kulmani Gupta, chairman of Indian Industries Association (IIA), said that the lockdown in European countries doesn’t have much impact on India. “They are still banking on China for apparel. But, if fresh lockdown is imposed in the US, which had restricted Chinese exports, Indian apparel industry will certainly have a body blow,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-garment-exporters-stare-at-uncertain-future-amid-fresh-lockdown-in-european-countries/story-yhIOKg81PamuPciSlTi95H.html
03-11-2020||City||UP-Rera welcomes SC order on home buyers seeking justice from consumer forums||The Uttar Pradesh-Real Estate Regulatory Authority(UP-Rera) on Tuesday said that they welcome the recent order by the Supreme Court, which enables home buyers to seek justice under the Consumer Protection Act even though their rights are protected by the Real Estate Regulatory Act of 2016.“We welcome the Supreme Court’s order because the homebuyers now have more choices. If they feel they can get speedy justice in consumer courts, then they can seek justice there. On the other hand, if they believe that the Rera will provide them justice in a timebound manner, then they can approach us,” said Balvinder Kumar, a member of UP-Rera. However, earlier, in March 2019, the UP-Rera had written to the ministry of housing and urban affairs, seeking amendments in the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. In the letter, the regulatory body had mentioned three points: First, the regulatory body should be vested with directive powers; second, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission should not hear home buyers’ cases, and third, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which hears realtors’ cases under the Indian Bankruptcy Code (IBC-2016), should not hear a case in a housing project until more than 10% buyers — out of the total number of purchased flats in a housing project — approach it for justice.SC Justice UU Lalit, on Monday, in its order, said that the Section 79 of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority Act, 2016, does not stop consumer forums to hear pleas of home buyers seeking justice under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act. The order came in response to a counter plea filed by a Gurugram-based developer, who had sought the quashing of an order by the consumer forum in response to a plea filed by a homebuyer, who was given relief. The consumer forum had imposed a penalty of ₹50,000 penalty against the developer for a delay in delivery.Real estate experts pointed out that the SC order was a landmark judgement for home buyers as Rera, over the years, has failed to protect the rights of the home buyers.“Homebuyers are happy because UP-Rera has become ineffective in safeguarding their rights. Rera was hoping that homebuyers should only file cases only with them stop going to consumer forums. We feel that the consumer forums will provide justice in a better manner,” said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension flat owners association. “It is a very logical order because you cannot restrain a homebuyer from seeking justice at consumer forums. Rera is an additional remedy. However, it does not stop the homebuyers from going to consumer forums. Rera’s orders are not being implemented because it does not have power to direct the government bodies. Therefore, either the government should give more powers to Rera or let the buyer decide where to seek justice,” said Kumar Mihir, a Supreme Court lawyer and an expert on issues concerning home buyers.City-based real estate developers, however, had a mixed reaction to the order.“The SC order will impact the real estate sector negatively because it will create confusion in the minds of home buyers, investors and others. When Rera was formed by the government of India as expert body exclusively for the real estate sector then it should have powers to settle issues that crop up. Rera understands all realty projects better and can come up with better solutions. The SC order defeats the very purpose of the formation of an expert body,” said RK Arora president of the UP Chapter of National Real Estate Council. Developer Suresh Garg, member of legal committee of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI) said, “The SC order gives liberty to home buyers to seek justice either at a consumer forum or with Rera. However, we have seen that home buyers get justice in a lesser time and at a lesser cost at Rera.”Prashant Kumar Tiwari, president of Western UP wing of CREDAI, said, “Rera is an expert body and home buyers also prefer it over the consumer court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-rera-welcomes-sc-order-on-home-buyers-seeking-justice-from-consumer-forums/story-F8G3GjcVLvVLIVy16vXPLP.html
03-11-2020||Chandigarh||Hiked parking rates on the cards in Chandigarh from December 1||If everything goes according to the municipal corporation’s plan, then come December 1, get ready to shell out more at paid parking lots in Chandigarh. Implementation of the hiked rates, which were approved in September last year, is contingent upon the contractors providing smart features at the 89 parking lots in the city.The MC General House on October 29 had directed the contractors to introduce the smart features (see box) within 30 days.“The new rates will come into effect automatically after the parking contractors provide the smart features. They should be able to do so by December 1,” said SK Jain, additional commissioner, MC.The directions from the House came after it took up the agenda on licence fee exemption to parking contractors. It rejected it, as financial activity in the city has picked up and markets and offices have been allowed to open. In the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown, the MC had given complete licence fee exemption for April and May. It had also given waiver to contractors thereafter.Charges depend upon parking durationAfter the new rates kick in, parking fee for the first four hours will remain the same as the flat rates charged right now: ₹5 for two-wheelers and ₹10 for four-wheelers.Thereafter, these will be doubled. The charges will further be doubled if vehicles are kept parked beyond 12 hours (see box). However, there will be free entry for pick and drop in the first 10 minutes.At Elante Mall, Piccadily Square Mall and Fun Republic, flat rate of ₹20 and ₹40 will be charged for two- and four-wheelers, respectively. All parking lots will also allow day passes for multiple entries besides monthly passes.Parking lots in the city have been divided into two zones: 32 in Zone 1 and 57 in Zone 2. The MC had auctioned both zones for around ₹10 crore annually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hiked-parking-rates-on-the-cards-in-chandigarh-from-december-1/story-IaTcUGrMQpdnFPFieUT03I.html
03-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration mulling ban on sale of crackers||Amid fear of second Covid wave, the Chandigarh administration is considering banning the sale of crackers in the city this Diwali.Some states have already taken the decision to ban the sale of crackers. UT administrator VP Singh Badnore will take a final call on the issue on Wednesday.“There is a concern that pollution caused by firecrackers may cause spike in coronavirus cases in the city. Health experts have said that there is a possibility of a second wave during the festival season due to this pollution,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida on Tuesday. Even though a draw of lot for allotment of 96 licences for the sale of crackers was held in Chandigarh on Tuesday, the administration withheld the issuance of temporary licences.The three-day sale of crackers is slated to start at 14 designated sites from November 12. Diwali is on November 14.During the Covid-19 review meeting on Monday, Badnore had appealed to the residents to avoid bursting of crackers. “Doctors have opined that toxic air arising out of crackers is likely to affect the lungs and, hence, residents should avoid or minimise bursting of firecrackers during festival season,” he had said.On Tuesday, the administration also issued a health advisory, stating: “People should stay indoors and desist from bursting firecrackers in order to prevent air pollution and to protect the elderly and people with comorbidities. Public cooperation in this will help in keeping the transmission of Covid-19 under control and decrease the risk of mortality due to the virus in the coming winter month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-mulling-ban-on-sale-of-crackers/story-MmG7oyNQk4mCRQqutkMb0O.html

Bholu is a relative of Manjit Singh. All six were produced in court and sent to three-day police remand. “They worked for Manjit Singh, who is an active member of the Bishnoi gang. Their main motive was to free him from police custody while on way to court hearing, for which they had hatched a conspiracy in Sonepat,” said Hans.The interrogation further revealed that the six planned to execute a bank robbery to arrange funds.One of them involved in Chandigarh shootingPolice also learnt that Billu, along with one Vijay, had shot at a trader in Sector 25, Chandigarh, on October 19.

03-11-2020||Noida||With cleaning of Ganga canal underway, Noida residents complain of erratic water supply||Residents of several areas in the city have complained of erratic water supply due to the month-long cleaning drive of the Upper Ganga Canal, which is responsible for supplying water to the city. Residents have demanded that the cleaning activity should be delayed for a month, at least till the end of the festive season. Last year too, the city residents faced water shortage before Diwali, during the annual cleaning drive of the canal. The Ganga Canal cleaning started on October 15 and it is expected to be completed by November 15 this year. Residents said that if the water crisis continues they will have to resort to protest. Residents also complain of muddy water supply and that too for a short period unlike on normal days, when water is supplied for 3 hours in the morning, between 6am to 9am, and 3 hours in evening, between 6pm to 9pm.The Upper Ganga Canal, which supplies Ganga water to Noida, is cleaned annually for silt, usually in the month of October or November. Currently, the total demand for water in Noida is 332 million litres per day (MLD). The authority supplies 240 MLD of Ganga water to the residents, while the remaining is procured through groundwater resources. In other words, while the authority supplies 70% Ganga water and 30% of the water comes from groundwater resources, said officials. During the annual cleaning of canal, the water supply gets affected for a month or so every year.In the past, the authority had supplied drinking water in tankers to areas from where it was receiving complaints about shortfall. Residents in some areas generally witness low water pressure during the cleaning drive. This year too, the authority is supplying water via tankers on demand. In Sector 10, people are getting water supply via tankers, said officials. Residents, however, said that this year the water crisis is worse.“In morning, there is water supply only for 20 minutes with extremely low pressure. We have been receiving complaints from all of sectors. We have requested the authority to look into the issue immediately. However, there is no respite is in sight. We have demanded that canal cleaning should be done in such a manner so that water supply does not get affected during festive season,” said Sanjeev Kumar vice-president, Gautam Budh Nagar district development residents’ welfare association (DDRWA) — an umbrella body of RWAs of the district.According to the authority, water supply is affected because 6 out of 11 rainy wells are not working. Also, 125 pumps are shut due to technical glitches, while water reservoirs are not adequate to store water.“Earlier, in 2019, the authority had assured that water supply will be restored by Diwali, when the cleaning was over. But it had failed to restore the supply. We fear that this year too, the authority will fail to restart the supply of Ganga by Diwali, which falls on November 14,” said Arun Kumar, a resident of sector 34. The authority, when asked about the water situation, said it will address the issue.“Hopefully once our ongoing Ganga water supplement project gets completed this year, the issue will be resolved,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer (CEO), Noida authority. The authority is working on a project that will ensure additional supply of Ganga water and construction of a reservoir for supply during a crisis, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-cleaning-of-ganga-canal-underway-noida-residents-complain-of-erratic-water-supply/story-9iZ0xdNvwwoLrASKRfJ1NL.html
03-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 4.9K Covid cases, draws up action plan for winter surge||Maharashtra on Tuesday reported 4,909 new Covid-19 cases, taking the state’s tally to 1,692,693. For the second day straight, the state reported fewer than 5,000 new cases. Maharashtra also reported 120 fresh fatalities, pushing the toll to 44,248. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 746 new cases, taking its tally to 259,857. It also reported 15 deaths, taking its toll to 10,323.In a bid to tackle a potential second wave in the winter, a state-appointed committee has submitted an action plan to the state health department. A winter surge is common for respiratory viruses, and many experts believe that the number of Covid-19 cases is likely to rise as temperatures dip.A senior health department official said that they are unaware of how coronavirus would react in the winter in the state and, therefore, people have to remain cautious and follow all safety measures. An official said H1N1 (swine flu) has a similar trend, of an increase in cases during winter, however, the jump is not as high as it is in monsoon. The health department is also hoping that herd immunity will also help tackle a second wave.“Frankly, we do not know how the virus will react in winter. We are a tropical country, therefore, there is a major difference in our winter and European nations. Swine flu has a similar transmission pattern. Swine flu, too, increases in winter, but it is still lower than what happens in monsoon. Basing on that, even if there is an increase in cases, it will not be as high as the first wave. Like more rain in Maharashtra, the meteorological department has predicted there will be a cold wave in India. If this happens, then the numbers could go up. We have to take all precautions,” an official said.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, member of a state-appointed committee on communicable diseases, said that like all virus, Sars-CoV-2 too will get a boost during the winter. “Covid-19 is a virus which is transmitted through the respiratory route. Colder the weather, the chances of transmission increases. Weather impacts the organism, but more than that, it affects humans. People’s movements are reduced, they remain in places where ventilation is poor, so these things put together increases the risk of viral transmission, which are respiratory in nature. It is also known that the capacity of the virus to survive is more in winter. We have to be prepared to tackle the covid-19 after changes in weather,” he said.The state health department official added that a significant number of the population has been exposed to coronavirus, therefore there could be herd immunity. We are currently only checking for antibodies [through tests], but there is also innate immunity in humans. Therefore, herd immunity is more than what we have measured so far [in serosurvey]. Looking at the epidemiology, if the virus sees a surge in winter, a large number of people has been exposed and will have herd immunity,” he said.The Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee has already submitted its action plan, according to Salunkhe, to prevent a wave in winter. It its plan, increased surveillance and preparedness are key points, Salunkhe said.“We have already discussed and submitted a plan of action on preventive steps to tackle Covid-19 in winter and to prevent a potential second wave. We have to intensify surveillance through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme. We must now lower the guard, we must keep an adequate number of beds, oxygenated beds, and ventilators, etc so in case there is a spurt in cases we should not be caught unaware. We also have to identify potential superspreaders,” he said.With cases of cough and cold increasing in winter, health experts said that differentiating the symptoms of Covid-19 is likely to be a challenge. Salunkhe said that there could be initial confusion but there are significant markers to differentiate Covid-19 from influenza or the common cold.Health department officials said that the curve is on a “descending limb”, but Salunkhe is wary and said it could be a “fluctuation” and not a real drop. Between September and October, Maharashtra has seen 50.33% decrease in cases and a nearly 40% (39.98%) decrease in fatalities. The positivity rate has reduced to below 10%. In September, out of 100 tests conducted, 25 would test positive, now it has come under 10.“The drop that we seeing right now may not be a real drop, but a mere fluctuation. If we see Pune’s picture, numbers lowered a few days ago, but again increased. We have to remain cautious,” he said.The health department official echoed the caution and said, “In Europe, we are seeing a new wave. For us, we are entering winter, Diwali is approaching and with further unlocking measures, people are going to mingle around more than earlier. Even if the cases are reducing, the threat of coronavirus has not ended. It is a new normal. We have to take precautions to live with it.”With the latest figures, the active caseload in the state stood at 116,543. Of the active cases, the most are from Pune with 24755, followed by Mumbai with 17,570 active cases. The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state stood at 2.61%, while the recovery rate improved to 90.46% with 6,973 discharges, taking the overall tally of recovered patients to 1,531,277.So far, Maharashtra has tested 91,20,515 samples and has an overall positivity rate of 18.56%. In the last 24 hours, Maharashtra tested 55,347 samples. Currently, 17,95,666 people are in home quarantine and 11,969 people are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-4-9k-covid-cases-draws-up-action-plan-for-winter-surge/story-GFF8t6goqFm1zLhaAGpg5I.html
03-11-2020||Noida||Health department official robbed of ₹33K by four men in Greater Noida||A health supervisor, working with the Firozabad health department, was allegedly assaulted and robbed by four unidentified men on the pretext of providing him a lift near Pari Chowk in Greater Noida .The victim, identified as Devender Singh Chauhan, hails from a Tundla and was visiting his brother in Dadri.“My nephew is getting married soon. So my brother was coming to visit us so that we could go to Delhi for some shopping. On Tuesday morning, he got dropped off by a roadways bus at Pari Chowk. He was waiting for public transport to take him to Surajpur, from where he would come to Dadri,” said Chauhan’s brother Satendra, who is a health education officer with the Gautam Budh Nagar health department.The victim was approached by a white Hyundai i10 car, in which four people were already present. It appeared to be a shared cab to the victim. When the passengers seated inside the car offered to drop him at Surajpur, he got inside.“However, soon afterwards, he realised that they were on the wrong route and asked them to drop him off. That’s when, they assaulted him and took ₹33,750 cash that he had with him. They also took his phone but returned it afterwards. They left him near Jaidpur village and fled the spot,” said Satendra.The victim immediately contacted the police helpline, but the family alleged that police took a long while in registering the case claiming it to be a jurisdictional issue. A case was finally registered at the Knowledge Park police station against the four unidentified suspects under Section 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Police officials said they are working on identifying the vehicle through the CCTV cameras installed in the area.“It was a white i10 car. We have located it in some footage but the number plate is not very clear. We are working on identifying the suspects. Due action will be taken against them. They only took the cash the victim was carrying,” said Varun Pathak, station house officer(SHO), Knowledge Park police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/health-department-official-robbed-of-33k-by-four-men-in-greater-noida/story-BSqvgH36JkHFAokfPql4fO.html
03-11-2020||City||Central Vista project won’t harm heritage buildings: Centre reiterates in SC||New DelhiThe Centre on Tuesday informed the Supreme Court that the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, which involves construction of a new Parliament building and a Central Secretariat housing all government offices, will “protect and preserve” heritage buildings while keeping with the laws and environmental safeguards.Making opening arguments on a batch of public interest litigations (PIL) challenging clearances related to the project, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought to put at rest apprehensions that the project will destroy heritage buildings and alter the landscape of the Central Vista area where the constructions are supposed to come up.Appearing for the Centre, Mehta said, “The petitioner’s arguments on heritage structure proceeds on a deliberately misunderstood factual position that heritage buildings are being demolished and a new project as “greenfield project” is coming up...The petitioner has purposefully misunderstood the ambit and scope of consultancy contract and presented a false picture that the respondents (Centre and statutory agencies) have abdicated its functioning to a private consultant.”“Heritage buildings will not be destroyed. The stress on them will be reduced by shifting out government offices from them into the newly planned Central Secretariat building,” Mehta said.The Central Vista project envisages a new Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, a common Central Secretariat housing 51 ministries in 10 buildings. At present, these offices are housed in 47 buildings in different locations. A three-km underground shuttle is being planned to provide connectivity with the Udyog Bhawan and Central Secretariat metro stations. The project is estimated to be built at a cost of Rs 20,000 crore to be paid over six years. On the lack of public participation in the decision-making process, Mehta said, “The entire procedure for getting approval for new Parliament building as per category 8(a) mentioned in the Environment Impact Assessment Notification dated September 14, 2006 is followed to the hilt. The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) has applied its mind in detail. Though no direct participation process is contemplated, detailed representations were received at the stage of grant of environmental clearances, which were examined by the EAC.”Mehta said the Parliament and common Central Secretariat projects are not integrated but mutually exclusive. “The construction of one does not depend on the other. The year 2022 coincides with the 75th year of India’s Independence by when the new Parliament building is sought to be completed. This was the urgency for beginning with the Parliament project,” Mehta said.He took the court through the elaborate action plan prepared by the Central Public Works Department, which worked out a plan for noise pollution, air pollution, traffic management, security and waste management. The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjeev Khanna said, “The petitioners have argued that these plans that you prepared were not in public domain. The whole argument is built on the ground that nothing about the project is available in public domain.” Mehta said much of the information that he has shared with the court was available on government websites. The bench asked Mehta to give a list of such information available for public consumption on government websites.The bench asked Mehta about the need for undertaking a study, assessing the option of building a new Parliament as against refurbishing the existing Parliament. Mehta replied, “For us to decide that a new Parliament building is needed, we do not need a separate study.” He compared it by saying, “If feel the house I am living in is not acceptable, do I really need an expert to determine that?” He pointed out that the old building had seepage issues due to the old construction and faced space crunch as members of Parliament during joint sittings were forced to sit on plastic chairs. He said the existing building was not fire-proof or earthquake-resistant.The proposed Lok Sabha chamber is expected to accommodate 876 seats and the Rajya Sabha chamber 400 seats. At present, the Central Hall has 440 seats and during a joint session of Parliament, temporary seats have to be arranged in the aisle. The new complex will provide for 1,224 seats in the Central Hall, equipped with state-of-the-art technology and seamless movement between the two HousesOn the allegation that the project will be a drain on the public exchequer, the Centre said the government was paying a huge rent to maintain its offices in different buildings. In most buildings, office space was lying unused and commuting between these was proving to be a costly and time-consuming affair. The rent saved will work out to be roughly Rs 1,000 crore annually, Mehta said, adding, “This will be a cost-saving project.” The petitions challenging the project have been filed by one Rajeev Suri and former Armyman Anuj Srivastava and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/central-vista-project-won-t-harm-heritage-buildings-centre-reiterates-in-sc/story-xcliBxutrc3hY6qPBrK4MP.html
03-11-2020||Noida||Cops suspended after audio clip of money exchange goes viral||Two police personnel deployed at the Jewar police station were suspended from duty after an audio clip of them talking about monetary exchange related to a drug peddler was circulated on social media.The incident came to light on Monday when the audio clip started doing rounds on social media. In the clip, a head constable and another person, who appears to be a peddler himself, can be heard allegedly discussing the legal status of another peddler, who was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act on the same day.The person was heard saying that if the suspect in question had only 150 grams of weed with him, then why was he booked for two kilograms. The conversation also mentioned the name of another constable, who had allegedly assured the him of the suspect’s release.  “I spoke to the constable who was suspended, and he said that the suspect had ₹10,000 with him, which was taken at the time of his arrest. In addition to this, I paid ₹30,000 to you when we spoke about a lesser amount for his release,” the person was heard telling the head constable. The person in the audio clip also said that the suspect should have been booked for the genuine amount of marijuana found with him. Further, if he was not being released, then the money taken should be returned. To this, the head constable was allegedly heard saying that the money was at his home and that he would take care of the matter in a couple of days.This audio clip was also shared with senior police officials, after which the orders for suspension were given.“We have immediately taken action against the cops in question, and the assistant commissioner of police has been given the charge of the investigation of the case to verify the bribery claims being made in the audio,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 3.Despite repeated attempts, the constable and head constable couldn’t be contacted for comment.The suspect in question has been identified as Aleem, who was nabbed with 450 grams of marijuana, said the police, adding that efforts were on to identify the second person in the audio and take action against him as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/cops-suspended-after-audio-clip-of-money-exchange-goes-viral/story-ff3oRDIV7d1As47SRaXtLJ.html
03-11-2020||Noida||Noida’s Sector 125 air quality monitoring station dysfunctional for 20 days||Ghaziabad: The air quality monitoring station at Sector 125 in Noida is out of order since October 15, affecting the calculation of the air quality index (AQI) value for the city. Officials of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said the equipment of the station is under repairs and is likely to be in running condition in a day or two. As a result of the system crash, AQI for the Noida city is getting calculated by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) only on the basis of readings of the other three monitoring stations at sectors 1, 62, and 116. “The system completely crashed and it could not be repaired despite repeated attempts. It is now under process to bring it up and data connections to CPCB are also in process of getting restored. It is expected that the system will be repaired in the next one or two days,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB at Noida. Sector 125 is a commercial and institutional area and on the banks of river Yamuna right across Faridabad. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the air quality in Noida and Greater Noida witnessed a mild deterioration in air quality, while Ghaziabad saw a slight improvement in its air quality. However, the air quality in all the three cities largely remained under the ‘very poor’ category. According to CPCB’s bulletin, the AQI values for Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida were recorded at 321, 340 and 356, respectively on Tuesday, as against 299, 355 and 310, respectively, recorded on Monday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. In Ghaziabad, the Sanjay Nagar monitoring station which was running under “severe” category from November 1 onwards stood under “very poor” category on Tuesday. “There was improvement in AQI on Tuesday as the high levels of pollution recorded by Sanjay Nagar monitoring station came down. We took up extensive water sprinkling at the dusty areas around the station and it helped. Overall, the AQI of Ghaziabad was less on Tuesday as compared to AQI on Monday,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB. On the other hand, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) on Tuesday predicted that marginal deterioration is forecasted for November 4 and 5 towards the middle of “very poor” category. “The SAFAR synergized stubble fire counts over Punjab, Haryana, UP, Uttarakhand, and neighbouring areas are significant and stood at 3,068 yesterday. However, the boundary layer wind direction became unfavourable (South-westerly today morning) after a long spell, fire-related stubble burning share in PM2.5 in Delhi’s air has significantly decreased and is estimated as 10% for today,” the SAFAR forecast said. The contribution of the stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 had gone to all-time high of 40% this season on November 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-sector-125-air-quality-monitoring-station-dysfunctional-for-20-days/story-6c5KdjKdn9SOSeHQ1L8G0I.html
03-11-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad suffers 189 garbage-related fires this year so far, corporation plans removal of 90 solid waste dumping points||Ghaziabad: Incidents of fire at garbage dumps continue unabated in Ghaziabad as the district has reported about 189 garbage-related fires this year so far. Environmentalists said that there is hardly any enforcement against such fires which are one of the common contributing factors to the air pollution. The records of the fire department revealed that 68 garbage-related fires were attended by Kotwali fire station while Vaishali station attended 20, Modinagar 14, Sahibabad 26 and Loni attended 61 such fires during the period from January 1 to October 31 this year. “The 189 fire incidents, related only to garbage this year, were attended by our five stations. The total number of garbage-related fire incidents was 392 from January 1 to December 31 last year. This year we have less number of such fire incidents due to the Covid-induced lockdown for several months. However, we are prepared ahead of Diwali festival. Last year on Diwali, we attended to about 32 such fire calls on the festival day,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer. Last year, Kotwali fire station attended to 117 garbage-related fire incidents, Vaishali 76, Modinagar 32, Sahibabad 72 and Loni attended to 95 such fire calls. “The number of garbage-related fires is likely to be on higher side as many go unreported and only bigger fires require intervention of the fire department. The practice of garbage burning is rampant in the city throughout the year. It has to stop now. The administration for the purpose of pollution abatement must come up with a dedicated control room which should be operational throughout the year,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. Officials of the UP pollution control board (UPPCB) said that there have been 10 fire incidents related to garbage during the period from October 15 to November 3 when the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) is already in place. “It is a major issue in the city and our teams, along with the teams formed by the municipal corporation, are keeping track of garbage-related fire incidents. In many instances, the fire department is also requisitioned to douse the fire. Such incidents also aggravate the PM2.5 levels,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. This year, the UP pollution board officials have identified garbage burning hotspots at Morta, Hindon Vihar, Sahibabad, Surya Nagar, open garbage dumping sites in residential areas, below Hindon elevated road and Arthala, among others. On Tuesday, the officials also rushed to Dasna where a major fire took place at garbage dumps. Last week, there was another major fire reported from Abhay Khand in Indirapuram. Officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation said that they have taken up a drive in which they have planned to get rid of about 90 garbage dumps across the city where solid waste is getting dumped. “These spots are apart from the solid waste transfer stations and also probable sites for garbage fires. As of now, we have closed down about 54 of such dumping sites, and alternate place is being identified for the rest of the garbage points. We are also planning to construct boundary walls around the spots so that there is no trespass. The boundary wall will be made with mud and plastic bottles in which road dust will also be filled up,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. He also said that five different teams of the municipal corporation in as many zones are tasked to keep track of garbage-related fires. “The teams are sent, along with the other teams, for checking of streetlights at night. Although our teams are not deployed 24x7, they do work till late night and report if they come across any fire,” Tanwar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-suffers-189-garbage-related-fires-this-year-so-far-corporation-plans-removal-of-90-solid-waste-dumping-points/story-BQtP1y18vrq7tuWANb0HXN.html
03-11-2020||Noida||73% water bodies in Ghaziabad encroached, NGT directs UP officials to prepare work plan||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has come down heavily on officials of Uttar Pradesh and has directed officials to convene meetings with all district magistrate within a month to address the issue of protection of water bodies and also to prepare a uniform action plan which will be applicable throughout the state of Uttar Pradesh. The tribunal was hearing a petition filed by Sushil Raghav, city-based environmentalist, who had moved NGT i in March with a plea to free up encroachment of ponds and other water bodies in Ghaziabad district. He said that there were about 1200 water bodies in the district as per revenue records and about 400 of these were completely encroached. The tribunal, during a hearing of the petition on October 29, had come down heavily on officials and has also asked the UP chief secretary to file an action taken report by February 28, 2021. The order was uploaded on November 2. In response to the petition, Ghaziabad district magistrate on October 28 filed an affidavit before the tribunal and maintained that 251 ponds/water bodies had been identified under the jurisdiction of municipal corporation area (146) and three tehsils of Loni (2), Sadar (44) and Modinagar (59) that were encroached. The affidavit, which is now part of the court records, also mentions that 49 ponds were free from encroachment while another 19 had partial encroachment. Around 183 ponds, or nearly 72.9% of water bodies in Ghaziabad, were fully encroached or disputed. The affidavit was filed by district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey. “We have submitted the affidavit before the tribunal and will abide by all directions given by NGT. We have also initiated the process of freeing up encroached ponds and all efforts will be taken up in this regard,” Pandey, said. However, the tribunal came down heavily on officials during the hearing and expressed displeasure over the state of affairs related to preservation of water bodies. “Having seen alarming level of encroachments at Ghaziabad, it is not difficult to assume that there are similar encroachments/damage to water bodies throughout Uttar Pradesh. This needs attention of authorities at the state level and special planning and drive is necessary for identification and conservation of such water bodies for enforcement of rule of law and protection of environment (sic),” the tribunal said in its order. “It seems that orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and this tribunal on the subject are not receiving any attention. It is high time that the issue is seriously addressed. We also find that the authorities are stuck up in cumbersome procedure of revenue law, without invoking prompt and summary procedure of environmental law. There is no monitoring at higher level (sic),” the order further added. Raghav said that the numbers indicated in the affidavit were actually less than the total number of encroached water bodies in the state. “As per our petition and revenue records there are about 1200 ponds/water bodies and about 400 of these were encroached. We will contest the contents of affidavit in due course of hearing. It is high time that all the water bodies are made encroachment free and restored. Otherwise, the groundwater recharge is getting affected,” Raghav, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/73-water-bodies-in-ghaziabad-encroached-ngt-directs-up-officials-to-prepare-work-plan/story-MqK8yJikr0jiAnRg6oEckJ.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||North civic body to impound and auction abandoned vehicles||Ahead of Diwali, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (North DMC) will start impounding and auctioning vehicles left abandoned in residential areas and on streets under its jurisdiction. The decision was taken by the standing committee in a meeting Tuesday. According to civic body authorities, a survey to ascertain the number of abandoned vehicles has already started. “After the survey is completed, notices to remove vehicles from streets and colonies will be pasted on dumped vehicles and if they are still not removed within three days, we will impound the vehicles and send them for auction,” a senior official of the north corporation said Tuesday, while requesting anonymity. The official added that as per the previous records, there were nearly 200 vehicles dumped on roads and colonies in different areas of the north corporation. “Since we don’t have the exact and latest figures, a fresh survey was started and it will be completed in a few days. We hope to remove abandoned vehicles from the streets before Diwali,” Chail Bihari Goswami, chairperson, north corporation standing committee, said. He said it was a common sight to find rickety and mud-crusted vehicles in residential colonies or on streets which not only lead to snarls but also create a hindrance in sanitation work. “People generally park their scooters or cars on streets to reserve space right outside their houses but that affects the cleaning and sweeping work. Many a time, it is seen that people dump garbage beneath the abandoned vehicle. To discourage this and improve sanitation, we have decided to impound and auction such vehicles. This exercise is also expected to bring in revenue for the cash-strapped corporation,” Goswami said. Besides, the corporation will also carry out a special cleanliness drive ahead of Diwali. Garbage will be lifted daily from local area collection points, instead of on alternate days. More vehicles will be pressed into service to clean dump sites and roads. Junior engineers of the area have been made nodal officers for the drive. The corporation will also prune tree branches, which are less than 20cm in width. However, due to the fund crunch, beautification of parks and painting and polishing of park gates and grilles will not be conducted this year, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-civic-body-to-impound-and-auction-abandoned-vehicles/story-3dkGzFFulvjbXr6S58bgSI.html
03-11-2020||Gurugram||Cracker bursting allowed from 8-10pm on Diwali||Bursting of green crackers will be allowed between 8pm and 10pm in the district on November 14, on the occasion of Diwali festival, as per the order issued by the district administration on Tuesday.In compliance with the Supreme Court order to reduce air and sound pollution from bursting of firecrackers, Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, issued multiple directives, including regulation on production, storage and sale of crackers for Diwali. “The sale of green crackers or those with reduced emission are permitted to be sold through licensed traders. Production, selling and use of other kinds of crackers (series crackers or laris) has been prohibited,” Khatri said in the order.Firecrackers with low-emission sound and light that produces particulate matter less than 30-35% from other crackers and significantly releases less NOx and SO2 are allowed. Even those crackers which have already been produced, having high emission, are not allowed to be sold in Gurugram.Manufacturers of green crackers will be publicised by the district administration for easy access.Owing to the air and noise pollution caused by high emission crackers and the solid waste generated by it, an array of steps is being taken. To closely monitor the air quality, data would be collated on pollution caused by the bursting of firecrackers. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has been directed to collect air quality data of the week prior to Diwali and a week after the festival gets over on November 14. They will monitor the use of aluminium, barium and iron used in the manufacturing of firecrackers.The public relations and the education department have been directed to raise awareness about the harmful effects of firecrackers, while the police has been directed to ensure the implementation of the order.As per the order, in case any violation is found, station house officer (SHO) of the police station of the area shall be held personally liable for the violation. The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has issued a toll-free number — 18001802738 — and email id — cmc@mcg.gov.in — to register complaints related to cracker bursting.Under the Explosive Rule, 2008, and Explosive Act, 1884, Khatri issued the order which came in into force from Tuesday onwards and would expire on November 15 at 6am in the morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cracker-bursting-allowed-from-8-10pm-on-diwali/story-mH2O69bMtHqInQiBB9SRAK.html
03-11-2020||Gurugram||Air quality picks up due to favourable weather conditions||Pollution levels in the city dipped significantly on Tuesday, recording an air quality index (AQI) of 270, in the ’poor’ zone, on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin. This is a sharp improvement from Monday’s AQI reading of 304, which indicated ‘very poor’ air quality. Experts and officials attributed the improvement to strong northwesterly winds, and a reduction in farm fires toward the end of stubble burning season. They also cautioned, however, that any relief from the improvement would be short-lived, with colder temperatures approaching in the next two weeks. Experts also said that an increase in nighttime minimum temperature, from 10.2 degrees Celsius on Monday to just under 12 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, had also facilitated an improvement in air quality. “This, coupled with strong northwesterly winds, and a reduction in farm fires toward the end of stubble burning, allowed a fair bit of pollutants to be meteorologically dispersed on Tuesday, resulting in ‘poor’ air for the first time in over a week,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist. However, experts also said that the improvement is only temporary, with the India Meteorological Department predicting cold-wave conditions in isolated pockets of north India on the morning of November 4. As per a forecast by the CPCB’s central control room for air quality monitoring, Gurugram is likely to experience ‘very poor’ air once again on Wednesday, with a predicted AQI reading of 360. The air quality is expected to turn ‘severe’ by November 6, with a predicted AQI of 420. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality is likely to remain in lower end of ‘very poor’ category on 04.11.2020 and higher end of ‘very poor’ category on 05.11.2020.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-picks-up-due-to-favourable-weather-conditions/story-IAsjgnnxVFXOaJtyrWTACK.html
03-11-2020||Gurugram||Grap violations under pollution board scanner||Unauthorised parking, open burning of biomass (including leaves and horticultural waste), and vehicular emissions were recorded as the most prevalent air quality violations in the city over the past week, according to an action-taken report compiled by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board’s regional office in Gurugram.As per the report, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, 203 violations of biomass burning were detected between October 26 and November 1, followed by 104 violations by visibly polluting vehicles, in addition to 666 violations of unauthorised parking. These were followed by pollution caused due to garbage dumping (69 violations), construction and demolition activities (67 violations) and unauthorised entry of heavy vehicles within city limits (51 violations).Other polluting activities, such as garbage burning, resuspension of road dust, industrial waste dumping and use of coal by industrial units, were also observed by enforcement teams. However, these violations were observed to be fewer in number, as per the HSPCB’s enforcement report, which compiles enforcement data from multiple bodies engaged in the pollution response, including the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), Public Works Department (PWD), National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC), Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) and the traffic department.Between October 26 and November 1, the report states, a total of 3,812 field inspections were carried out, yielding a total of 1,217 violations of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to curb air pollution in Delhi-NCR.A total of Rs 34,13,600 were issued in fines during the same period, HSPCB officials confirmed. “These enforcement reports are compiled weekly, and show where we have been successful in curbing violations. We will use the data from these when planning subsequent inspection drives. Areas, where high number of violations are detected, will require more vigilance going forward,” said Kuldeep Singh, HSPCB’s regional officer in Gurugram.Singh added that vehicles and biomass burning were recorded in such high numbers due to their ubiquitous nature, but said that other violations — such as road dust, garbage burning, and construction activities — may have gone under the radar and may require a more concerted response. Experts agreed with this view.Abhishek Srivastava, a city-based environment engineer and sustainability consultant, said, “While it is important to detect violations, these numbers likely do not reflect the real situation on the ground. In my view, it is hard to believe that only 67 construction-related violations were detected in one week, since we can all see how prevalent the issue is in Gurugram. Similarly, the report shows only two violations of road dust-related pollution, which is again a bit hard to swallow. If these violations were really so low in number, we wouldn’t be dealing with such a large pollution load.”Srivastava said, “The HSPCB report lacks any information on corrective action. It reports the violations, but does not give any information on how they are systematically addressed. If one detects a construction site releasing fugitive emissions, is there any water sprinkling done on the dust piles? Are the active piles covered up? Or are authorities simply fining the violator? The report requires a little more clarity, in that regard.”A senior HSPCB official who is involved in compiling enforcement data from different departments, seeking anonymity, explained, “The traffic department is widely deployed, to begin with, so naturally traffic-related violations will be detected in higher numbers. Biomass burning happens mainly at night, and it is easily detected by the eyes, so it is easy for our teams to note these as violations. Most of our patrolling also happens at night, when construction and industrial activities slow down. This makes it harder to detect.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/grap-violations-under-pollution-board-scanner/story-yJEcl9no48KTHf7KSChocO.html
03-11-2020||Gurugram||MCG starts inquiry into funds embezzlement||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has initiated an inquiry into allegations of embezzlement of funds on the basis of fake certificates, officials said on Tuesday. At least 10 MCG ward councillors have complained in this regard, stating that certificates bearing their signatures had been illegally replicated and doctored, based on which MCG officials had issued funds to the civic body’s contractors.MCG has so far found at least 12 such “fake” certificates.Last year in June, the MCG had introduced a policy whereby its officials can only disperse funds to its contractors after the ward councillor of the area issues a “work satisfactory” certificate. Localised works, such as repair of roads, sewerage, stormwater, footpaths, green belts and streetlights, come under this policy.Under the policy, ward councillors have to physically examine the said work and accordingly decide whether the project has been completed and that the quality of work done is according to the contractual agreements, based on which approvals are issued.On Monday, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh issued an internal officer order, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, stating that the civic body has found certificates, based on which funds were issued to contractors, which did not mention the date or the type of work being executed in the area. He further said that the absence of such key details raises suspicion of fake certificates being issued repeatedly and hence, the matter needed an inquiry.“Until the completion of the inquiry, no further payments will be made by the account branch of the MCG regarding projects which are under scanner. Further, until the inquiry period is over, I have directed that all current charges and responsibilities of all executive engineers concerned and the assistant engineers and junior engineers will remain withheld. The matter is of great concern and action would be taken against officials concerned, contractors found to be negligent or guilty of discrepancies as per law,” said Singh.In his order, Singh appointed MCG joint commissioner Pardeep Ahlawat as the inquiry officer to look into the matter and submit a report within two weeks.As per Singh’s order, Ahlawat will check the details of all bills that had been raised and paid to contractors through this process. Further, he will physically check the execution of all such works on-site and subsequently, verify the credibility and authenticity of the certificates issued by the respective ward councillors, including their signatures.“We have found at least 12 certificates bearing the signature of councillors where details such as type of works and dates are found to be absent. Concerned MCG officials, councillors, and contractors have been issued notices to come to my office on Friday where versions of each of them would be sought and the inquiry would subsequently be taken forward,” said Ahlawat.As per MCG officials privy to the matter, on late Saturday night, Singh had attached copies of such fake certificates on a WhatsApp group having all MCG councillors and officials, and asked councillors if they had sanctioned any of these. Subsequently, 10 councillors replied in the negative, terming them as fake.“The certificates are completely fake and I have already submitted this in writing to the MCG. Councillors keep a registry number of each certificate they issue in such matters, and the corresponding numbers on the fake certificate do not match this. Further, even the area jurisdiction in most certificates does not match the area coming under the councillor’s purview. It is a clear case of certificates being scanned and accordingly doctored for getting funds sanctioned,” said RS Rathee, MCG councillor of Ward 34.The area jurisdiction of MCG’s engineering wing is divided into eight zones across the city. As per MCG officials privy to the matter, the “fake” certificates have been issued for works relating to zones 4 and 7. Rathee’s ward falls under Zone 8.In the last 12 months, there have been several instances wherein the MCG has paid the entire project amount or a majority of it to contractors despite work not starting or work being midway. In each of these cases, the “work satisfactory” certificate was never sought.As per the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, municipal bodies can only make payments to contractors for running costs or once the project is entirely completed.In December last year, the MCG’s engineering wing had allegedly paid Rs 35 lakh to a contractor for constructing a 1.7-kilometre track between Khusbhoo Chowk and Bristol Chowk, along the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road, even though only 600 metres of work, worth Rs 11 lakh had been completed. In February, this year, it was discovered that the engineering wing had paid Rs 1.67 crore, the total project cost, to a contractor for building a two-kilometre road in Ward 1 even before the construction had started.In September, the MCG’s engineer wing had allegedly paid a contractor Rs 50 lakh, nearly a quarter of the total project cost of Rs 2 crore, despite only 10% work being completed on ground. The project involved laying of pavement tiles across MCG’s Ward 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-starts-inquiry-into-funds-embezzlement/story-EO8X0h1O8crfUL2xngULFN.html
03-11-2020||Gurugram||Health dept issues guidelines to curb spread during festivals||Expecting an uptick in Covid-19 cases over the next few days as festivals inch closer, the district health department on Tuesday issued an advisory to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The infection is already showing a record spike in the district since the outbreak of the pandemic.On Tuesday, 460 new cases were recorded, taking the count of active cases to 3,842 in the district, the highest till now. The total tally has also crossed 31,000 mark in just two days, after it reached 30,000 on November 1. Cases are growing exponentially with daily positivity rate fluctuating between 12% (October 24) to 21% (recorded on November 1). On Tuesday, the positivity rate stood almost 13%.To curb the infection, the health department has advised citizens not to conduct any festival-related event in containment zones. In case of a fair or exhibition, staggered timing and restricted entry have to be considered. To ensure people are wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in crowded places, associations concerned are advised to use close circuit cameras. For market areas, there should be separate entry and exit, along with thermal screening and the wearing of masks. Also, in religious places, no-touch practice of deity idols has to be followed. Besides, basic respiratory etiquette — use of mask, face cover — has to be followed, as per the guidelines.People above 60 years of age or those with co-morbidities, pregnant women and children below 10 years are advised to stay at home.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Cases will continue to increase. Therefore, we have issued the advisory to prevent further escalation. Our focus is on contact tracing and surveillance in containment zones. Since hospitalisation of seriously-ill patients is under control for now, the department will hold a meeting with the district administration and private hospitals post Diwali.”Currently, 236 Covid-19 patients are admitted to hospitals, while 3,595 are in home-isolation and 11 are in district Covid care centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-dept-issues-guidelines-to-curb-spread-during-festivals/story-SbPD8Q013hhedKKV4wE7VK.html
03-11-2020||Gurugram||NHAI appoints three new operators for upkeep of Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has appointed three companies to oversee the upkeep of the stretch of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway that falls between Rao Tularam Marg in Delhi and Kherki Daula toll plaza from November 1.Officials of the highways authority said that the tenure of the previous and the only operator so far, Skylark, had come to an end in 2018 but it was given extension on a temporary basis. The concessionaire of the highway, Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), had called for bids through an advertisement on October 14 and three new agencies were subsequently selected for this purpose. Skylark officials said that they had handed over the operations to the new operators on October 31, as directed by the NHAI. The three new operators will now have different responsibilities, which will include maintaining the road, keeping a watch on traffic through the control room, and collecting toll at the Kherki Daula toll plaza, said officials. Vikas Mittal, senior manager, NHAI, said, “These new agencies will together oversee the maintenance of the highway,” said Mittal. NHAI officials added that they had installed new RFID card readers at Kherki Daula toll plaza, which shall resolve the problems being faced by commuters due to slow reading of Smartags. “The new RFID card readers have been installed at the toll plaza. This will solve all the issues pertaining to the reading of Smartags. Also, commuters facing such problems can send us emails, and we shall look into the matter,” said Shashi Bhushan, project director, NHAI. An official of Skylark, the previous highway operator, said that new RFID readers were installed between October 1 and October 10 and this has improved the card-reading efficiency from 70% to 85%. “We oversaw the installation and the reading is likely to improve now,” he said.Around 70,000 vehicles cross the Kherki Daula toll on a daily basis. A large number of toll-paying traffic has been diverted to KMP Expressway and there is strong demand from the local residents to get this toll plaza shifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nhai-appoints-three-new-operators-for-upkeep-of-delhi-gurgaon-expressway/story-AORPDf6ejmmQm6zsLkhrDK.html
03-11-2020||Gurugram||DTCP demolishes 600 illegal hutments on Golf Course Road||The enforcement wing of the department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Tuesday carried out a large-scale demolition drive on Golf Course Road, in which over 600 illegal hutments were demolished. DTCP officials said that an enforcement team, supported by around 100 police personnel, carried out the demolition drive amid stiff resistance from local residents. The drive started around 11am and continued till evening, said officials. The illegal tenements had come up on a five-acre land, which is a part of Saraswati Kunj colony and hundreds of persons were living in them. “Several complaints were received from local residents regarding the illegal hutments and, therefore, it was decided to remove them. Action would also be taken against those who had set up this illegal colony,” said RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement). During the demolition drive, the enforcement team also sealed 10 properties that had carried out illegal construction work and were running commercial activities in the residential colony in violation of DTCP rules. The department had deployed three earth-moving machines, which cleared the five-acre land. Bhath also said that two large illegal dhabas on Golf Course Road, which were also operating on plots in Saraswati Kunj colony, were also demolished.Earlier on Monday, the department had cleared an illegal colony coming up on a two-acre land at Baganaki village near Panchgaon. Officials said that boundary walls had been constructed with the intention to of building houses. “We are keeping an eye on all the illegal colonies inside the city as well as on the outskirts. Action will be initiated either on the basis of information obtained by department itself or on complaints lodged by citizens. The department appeals to all land owners to get valid licences and colonise legally. Buyers too must refrain from spending money on illegal properties,” said Bhath. The department last week had called for applications from land owners for development of affordable housing projects and had also increased the land available for developing such projects. The reason for this is to curb unauthorised colonies and push for affordable housing, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-demolishes-600-illegal-hutments-on-golf-course-road/story-S7bzXxU9L9dUON2OcFrCdJ.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Farm fires rage, but favourable wind helps Delhi’s air||Delhi’s air on Tuesday deteriorated and touched the outer margins of the ‘very poor’ category.Even though farm fires continued raging in Punjab and Haryana, with more than 3,000 cases being spotted on Tuesday again, a change in the wind direction helped keep the share of stubble fumes on the city’s pollution under check. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the overall air quality index of Delhi was 302, in the ‘very poor’ category. On Monday, the city’s AQI had improved to ‘poor’ category, at 293. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that though the city choked, high wind speed helped keep the situation from deteriorating. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said that the AQI levels are likely to remain in the early end of ‘very poor’ category till November 5, after which there could be a marginal deterioration again. “On Tuesday, in the morning, there was a spike in the pollution levels but by noon the wind speed picked up and the air cleared up. The wind speed post-noon was around 15kmph, which helped disperse the pollution,” said Soni. Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) data showed that stubble burning count over Punjab and Haryana on Tuesday was 3068. The crop burning count has been above 3000 for the last five days now. “The boundary layer wind direction became unfavourable (south-westerly on Tuesday morning) after a long spell, fire-related stubble burning share in PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers) in Delhi’s air has significantly decreased and is estimated as 10% for Tuesday. Today (Tuesday) is a typical example of high fire count and low impact in Delhi’s air, due to unfavourable transport level winds demonstrating as to how meteorology can play a decisive role,” read the Safar air quality analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farm-fires-rage-but-favourable-wind-helps-delhi-s-air/story-LpPNWMbcdfC1tayRI4L5LM.html
03-11-2020||City||Delhi govt kick-starts anti-cracker campaign||New Delhi: Environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday kick-started the Delhi government’s anti-cracker campaign, urging people to avoid fireworks on Diwali, or to at least to ensure they buy only the ‘green’, low-emission varieties, in an attempt to cut down on air pollution, which is a greater concern this year owing to the Covid-19 crisis.As part of the campaign, which started on Tuesday, Rai visited Sadar Bazar, one of Delhi’s biggest wholesale firecracker markets, for an inspection and to ensure only green crackers are sold. Diwali this year will be celebrated on November 14. Every year, pollution levels in the city see a major spike after the festival as people openly burst polluting firecrackers. Under this campaign, 11 teams of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) have been directed to ensure no traditional, polluting crackers are used or sold across Delhi. Apart from these teams, Delhi Police personnel and sub-divisional magistrates of all the districts will regularly inspect markets to ensure old stocks of traditional varieties are not sold clandestinely. “According to directions of the Supreme Court, polluting crackers have been banned in Delhi and only pollution-free green crackers have been allowed this year. The teams will ensure only the less-polluting varieties of crackers are sold. I would also like to request Delhiites to avoid bursting crackers, as much as possible,” said Rai. Rai said, “For the implementation of the campaign, we are ensuring two things -- first, the firecrackers must have a ‘green cracker’ logo on them. Second, the crackers sold in shops must be from authorised companies. We are following Supreme Court guidelines. The Delhi government will follow any new directions to curb pollution as and when issued.” Narendra Gupta, president of the fireworks and general traders association, Sadar Bazar, said traders assured the government that they will comply with its directions and sell only the green varieties. In 2017, ahead of Diwali, the Supreme Court had put a temporary ban on the sale and purchase of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR. In the last two years, however, the court had ordered that only low-emission and improved fireworks could be sold in Delhi, owing to concerns over rising air pollution. Residents were allowed to burst only green crackers between 8pm and 10pm. These green crackers are said to have 30% lower emission as compared to traditional fireworks. The noise levels are lower -- 125 decibels against 160 decibels in traditional ones. Surendra Kumar, a trader in Jama Masjid area, said even though more green crackers are available this year, the number of traders selling these is much less compared to previous years. “If shops selling the less polluting varieties are fewer, then there is possibility of unauthorised dealers selling old stock. Business has taken a hit over the last two-three years because of lack of clarity on rules till this year,” Kumar said. He said since the new varieties are more expensive, many people prefer to get old ones from NCR towns such as Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Noida. “What’s the use of such a restriction in Delhi, when you can get old crackers across the border,” he said. Parvati Kandasamy, president of the joint resident welfare association (RWA) in west Patel Nagar, said they have been sensitising residents to avoid cracker bursting this year.“Through our WhatsApp groups and through social media pages, we are getting people to join our cracker-free Diwali campaign. With Covid-19 cases increasing, it is imperative we do not add anything to worsen the condition of vulnerable people,” said Kandasamy. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said the focus should be to save the city from the annual air emergency that hits Delhi right after Diwali. “Even last year, we saw that we were doing reasonably well in maintaining the pollution levels from falling into the dangerous levels, but with Diwali, we were back facing the severe category,” said Roychowdhury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-kick-starts-anti-cracker-campaign/story-paC2EvbrTXqQmQXPYW3uPM.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Restaurants in Delhi no longer require a tourism licence; govt notifies order||The Delhi government on Tuesday issued an order notifying that restaurants in Delhi will no longer have to acquire a licence from the tourism department in order to function, the government said in a press statement.The notification comes around a month after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that the process was on to ensure that restaurants in the city can operate round the clock, and to do away with the requirement for obtaining tourism and health trade licences, apart from a police verification. He said his government was also tweaking certain fire safety norms in heritage buildings of Connaught Place and Khan Market and a few excise rules to allow serving of liquor in open spaces within the premise of an enterprise and to ensure more flexibility regarding storage of liquor.These measures were part of the government’s “ease of doing business” policy, aimed at boosting the capital’s economy in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic.While tourism licence and excise rules directly come under the city government’s domain, the other measures would involve multiple agencies such as the Delhi Police and the three municipal corporations.“The notification will come as a major relief to the restaurant industry in Delhi, especially after a major economic downfall due to the Covid-19 crisis,” the government statement said.The statement further said the tourism licence was initially issued by the Union government and came under the state domain only in 2003. Since then, the government of Delhi had made it mandatory for all restaurants with seating capacity of 30 and above to seek this licence.The tourism department’s approval is required to be sought afresh every five years. Restaurateurs have to pay a fee of ₹10,000 (up to 100 seats), and ₹20,000 for more than 100 seats.“Various reviews and considerations were done by the state tourism department over the last few months on the request of restaurant associations. However, owing to the recent circumstances concerning Covid-19, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has ordered the removal of the voluntary scheme of granting approval for standalone restaurants,” the statement said. Sandeep Khandelwal of Delhi hotels and restaurants owners’ association said, “This is a welcome move. Such licences and permits are often unnecessary as they lead to duplication. They waste the time of the authorities as well as entrepreneurs on a periodic basis. We hope the government succeeds in doing away with the other such licences too at the earliest.”Regarding health trade licences, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government has already run into a standoff with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations (MCD). While the AAP has been asserting that the health trade licence now comes under exclusive domain of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), which comes under the central government, the MCDs have maintained that they are reviewing the protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/restaurants-in-delhi-no-longer-require-a-tourism-licence-govt-notifies-order/story-hmyWGF9Wmt9lrM7c8n8BiP.html
03-11-2020||City||Slots for 10,000 high-security number plates booked||New Delhi: Slots for more than 10,000 high-security registration plates (HSRP) and around 1,000 fuel stickers have been booked so far, including 750 orders for doorstep delivery, ever since online booking for the fitment of HSRP and the stickers restarted in the city from November 1.Slots for fitment can be booked through www.siam.in, which will redirect the vehicle owner to the respective HSRP manufacturer’s websites.For home delivery, vehicle owners will have to pay an extra amount of Rs 125 for two-wheelers and Rs 250 for four wheelers, a senior government officer said. “The rates have been decided in consultation with Delhi government and SIAM,” a spokesperson of one of the three HSRP manufacturers, Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited (RSSPL) said.At the moment, doorstep delivery of HSRP and fuel stickers is available in areas such as Mayur Vihar, PatparGanj, Janak Puri, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, Kirti Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Vasant Vihar, Mohan Garden, Rajender Nagar, Maya Puri, Dilshad Garden and Ghazipur. The spokesperson said after the festival season, doorstep delivery will be available in others areas as well.Last month, state transport minister Kailash Gahlot had directed stopping if online booking after complaints were received from vehicle owners about delays in getting HSRP and fuel stickers affixed. Bookings then were reopened from November 1.Approximately 30 lakh existing vehicles, including 16 lakh two wheelers, 12 lakh four wheelers and two lakh commercial vehicles,are required to be affixed with HSRP. The transport department had issued a public notice on September 22, stating that an enforcement drive would be started against vehicles without HSRP or fuel stickers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/slots-for-10-000-high-security-number-plates-booked/story-T3mm4nqLVY3Ivgg4sSUXbP.html
03-11-2020||Gurugram||39% across state did not take precautions against Covid: Sero survey||Nearly 39% of the respondents covered under the second round of the Covid-19 serological survey of Haryana said that they did not wear a mask or maintain physical distance from others. Findings of the survey, released on Monday, showed that usage of masks in districts with high seropositivity, like Faridabad, Nuh, Jind, Ambala, among others, was less.Of 16,512 people covered across the state, nearly 6,373 (39%) did not follow mask discipline and social distancing norms, while the rest (61%) did follow norms. The situation was better in Gurugram, where 80% of the 800 respondents claimed to have used masks.“The data has been collected for the first time by the state health department,” said Dr Meena Rajput, professor, department of community medicine, PGIMS Rohtak, who also compiled the sero survey of the state. “The purpose of adding the two components – wearing of mask and social distance is to understand citizens’ response to precautionary measures,” she said.The second round of survey found seropositivity of 14.8%, which is higher than the 8% recorded in August. At present, enforcement of mask discipline and social distancing are the measures to curb transmission of the infection.“The initial survey carried out in August across all 22 districts served as a baseline to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community, while the subsequent round helped in monitoring the trend of infection. The findings show that in districts with high seropositivity, half of the respondents did not practice mask discipline and physical distance,” said Rajput.In Faridabad, which has the highest seropositivity in the state, over 60% of respondents did not follow any precautionary norm. In Jind, where the prevalence of IgG antibodies increased from 11% in August to 26.6% in October, nearly 40% of the people did not use mask/social distancing.Rajput said that in these districts, asymptomatic cases have been high as people were not aware of contracting coronavirus.Experts say that mask is crucial in containing the infection as symptoms appear after four to five days of getting infected. It is likely that in this period patients might not develop usual symptoms of cough, fever or difficulty in breathing, but can still spread the infection to others. A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June found that Covid-19 is also spread by those who have a very mild disease and do not show any symptom.Studies show that mask can reduce the growth rate of coronavirus infection by 40%. A recent study by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, found that mask usage and social distancing measures may help prevent over 200,000 Covid-19 deaths in India by December 1.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that it is equally important to know how people are using masks. “Most of the time, the mask is below the nose or placed at the chin,” he said when asked about the increase in seropositivity rates.Rajib Dasgupta, chairperson, Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, said that ideally, mask usage should be 100% to see the impact. “In such a study, it is important to find how people use masks and did they wear it seven or ten days before the survey.”Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine and public health, PGIMER-Chandigarh, said, “As the lockdown has been lifted and there are no chances of it being imposed in the coming time, wearing mask, social distance and hand washing are the only ways to control soaring Covid-19 infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/39-across-state-did-not-take-precautions-against-covid-sero-survey/story-UATaVbMJl37GtnoBE90WbO.html
03-11-2020||City||GB Pant Engineering College students sit on indefinite hunger strike||New Delhi: At least five students of GB Pant Engineering College -- affiliated to the state-run Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (IP University) until now -- have started an indefinite hunger strike, demanding that the Delhi government reconsider its decision not to conduct admissions in the college this academic year. Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia had on Monday said the state-run college will not enroll students this year, and that it will soon be a part of the upcoming Skill and Entrepreneurship University with better courses and infrastructure.IP University has already removed the college’s name from the list of its affiliated institutes and stopped admissions this year. A group of GB Pant students led by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) are protesting since Monday, demanding clarification over the matter. “Five protesting students have commenced an indefinite hunger strike near Vikas Bhawan at 1:30 PM on Tuesday. The Delhi government did not even take cognisance of students’ grievances. The protestors have resolved to keep fighting until the Delhi government includes the institute in the counselling process for admission this year,” the students said in a statement.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Vijay Goel visited the protesting students on Monday. “The Delhi government should not stop admissions in GB Pant College this year. We demand the government should issue a notification and enroll students this year so that over 200 students who could take admission in the first year do not miss the opportunity of studying in an affordable engineering college,” he said.IP University vice-chancellor Mahesh Verma had on Monday said existing students will continue with the university and will get degrees from it.GB Pant college offers three BTech courses (computer, mechanical and electronic) and caters around 600 students (excluding first-year students). The Delhi government did not issue any notification or statement about the matter on Tuesday. But Sisodia had on said Monday, “Instead of it being a normal college under IP University, the government plans to bring it under the upcoming Skill and Entrepreneurship University and develop it as a better institute...I assure everyone it won’t make any difference to students studying there if the college remains under IP University or the Skill and Entrepreneurship University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gb-pant-engineering-college-students-sit-on-indefinite-hunger-strike/story-pO2dFP2CCkJdWJcIdNrkQJ.html

The call was made through a video posted on twitter on Tuesday in which Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, introduced as general counsel of SFJ, appealed supporters to boycott flights AI 111 and AI531 from Delhi to London on Thursday. Immediately after the tweet, Delhi Police’s anti-terror unit alerted police at the Delhi airport and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) that secures the airport.Senior officers from the Delhi police and CISF held meeting on Tuesday to review the security at the airport. Deputy commissioner of police (IGI airport) Rajeev Ranjan said the security has been beefed up adequately. “We have increased number of pickets and every vehicle entering the airport is being checked. Armed plainclothes men have been deployed at the airport as well as in the terminal,” Ranjan said, adding that additional deployment has been made as required, keeping also in mind the festive season.Ranjan said if any incident takes place, action will be taken accordingly. Police have also alerted Air India and other officials at the airport.A police officer who wished not to be named, said SFJ is the same group that had called for hoisting a flag at the Red Fort on the Independence Day this year.The MHA had declared the SFJ as an ‘unlawful association’ under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in July last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/security-ramped-up-at-igi-airport-after-banned-outfit-calls-for-boycott-of-flights/story-7hb7gZncaMbkxeoFru04vN.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Police contest court order to supply hard copy of Delhi riots chargesheet||The Delhi police have challenged two orders of the trial court, where the judge had directed them to supply physical copies of the charge sheet filed in the conspiracy case related to the north east Delhi riots to 15 accused in the case.The police have contended that the document runs over 17,500 pages and the direction was passed in a “mechanical manner”.In its plea, filed through Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad, the special cell of Delhi police challenged the legality and validity of orders dated September 21 and October 21 passed by additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat, directing the supply of physical copy of charge sheet.The court had on October 9 directed the police to file fresh copies of the charge sheet, running over 17,500 pages, after it was informed that they “have inadvertently” put a document in it which contained the details of some of the protected witnesses and its copies were supplied to the accused booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.It had directed the police to file fresh copies of the charge sheet redacting the details of the protected witnesses and supply it to the 15 persons chargesheeted in the case and their counsel.On October 21, the court was informed by the investigating officer (IO) that he has submitted 16 new pen drives containing the redacted version of the charge sheet and accompanying documents in terms of the earlier order. However, the court directed the accused and their counsel \be provided with both the hard and soft copies of the fresh chargesheet.The judge had also said that it was not impressed with the submission of the Investigating officer who had sought 15 days time for the sanction for funds from the Delhi government for taking out the hard copies for every accused. The judge had directed the police to supply the documents at the earliest.Challenging these orders, the city police have contended that the mandate of law under section 207 of CrPC is to provide “COPY” of each of the report/ statements/ document subject to reasonable exception. It said that law does not specify supply of “hard copy” or “soft copy” nor does it draw any distinction between “hard copy” or “soft copy”.The plea, which is likely to come up for hearing on Wednesday, said that Section 207 CrPC does not cast any duty upon the investigating officer/ agency to bear the cost of supply of copy to the accused but casts the duty to supply copy upon the magistrate or court.It also added that the direction of supply of physical copies is also a violation of the Information Technology Act.The city police had earlier filed a charge sheet on Sep 16 against 15 accused namely-- Pinjra Tod members and JNU students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha, Gulfisha Khatoon, former Congress Councillor Ishrat Jahan, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, Meeran Haider, Shafa-Ur-Rehman, suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, activist Khalid Saifi, Shadab Ahmed, Tasleem Ahmed, Salim Malik, Mohd Salim Khan and Athar Khan.-- for allegedly being part of a larger conspiracy in the riots.JNU student Sharjeel Imam and former JNU student leader Umar Khalid have also been arrested under the anti-terror law in the case but not charge-sheeted yet.The court had taken cognisance of the charge sheet on Sep 21 and directed the supply of physical copies to the accused. Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters snowballedl leaving at least 53 people dead and 607 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-contest-court-order-to-supply-hard-copy-of-delhi-riots-chargesheet/story-hOOsrPTnrqTxBfjP7E2bXN.html

However, due to the confusion over the implementation of the Maratha quota at present, the state has decided to ask students to only submit documents at the time of registration. The verification of documents will be done at the time of admission.“We will start the registration process soon and the schedule for the same will be uploaded by the state common entrance test (CET) cell at the earliest. This year we will verify all documents submitted by students at the time of admission,” said TP Lahane, director, state Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). Every year, students who apply for UG medical and dental seats submit all necessary documents at the time of registration, especially those who are applying for seats under various quotas, that at present constitutes around 62% of total seats. The fact that this process will be conducted once seats are allotted to students has not gone down well with students, as well as their parents.“Every year, many students don’t get considered for quota seats as they don’t have the required documents. They get rejected even before the admissions begin. If the state plans to conduct this process once seats are allocated, it will lead to unnecessary confusion at the time of admission,” said Ruiee Kapoor, parent and activist.The state CET cell will be releasing the admission schedule for Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) and Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) courses within the next two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ug-medical-dental-admissions-in-maharashtra-to-begin-on-nov-6-students-to-only-submit-documents-at-the-time-of-registration/story-gY0IuHWyZgwkWVn0P2nVSN.html

The doctors running the online clinic have reported that the preliminary experience in patients showed that e-Knee Schools(eKS) are a viable option that could reduce costs and logistical issues of both patients and doctors during these difficult times. E-Knee School has provided a way to remotely deliver non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), disease education, and monitor patients via real-time online platforms.As many as 25 eligible patients, previously recruited during the pilot phase, were invited to join a virtual platform for a modified protocol, with discussions and exercises, that included stretching, strengthening, warm-up, and cool down.“The general precautions were explained and family assisted training was encouraged among participants. Diet management, lifestyle modification, meditation, weight counselling, and experience sharing sessions were held on the shared platform,” said Dr MS Dhillon, head of orthopaedic department.The doctors have reported that applications of the eKS model seem encouraging, which is prompting them to explore its role further in the recruitment of new cases and expanding its applicability. Dr Dhillon added that in the coming days, more people will be recruited in the school and, the outcome of the patients attending the same will be compared, based on which a new combined protocol will be created.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-s-knee-school-for-patients-suffering-from-osteoarthritis-goes-online/story-bPsQmPW9E76FOQizQY48bL.html
03-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana’s crop diversification drive figures are as diversified||Six months after the Haryana government launched a financial incentive-linked diversification drive to encourage farmers to switch over to alternate crops in place of water guzzler paddy, facts regarding the flagship scheme remain unclear.In May, farmers switching over to alternate crops were promised ₹7,000 per acre incentive under the Mera Pani-Meri Virasat Scheme. Under this policy, 25% of the total incentive is given to the farmers after physical verification of the crop sown while the remaining 75% is paid after the second round of verification during harvesting. The objective of this scheme is to encourage farmers to cultivate alternate crops such as maize in the area that was under paddy cultivation last year. Reason: The cultivation of paddy has contributed to degradation of natural resources such as water and soil. Also, the ground water table of Haryana has been declining steadily.The state government had launched the crop diversification drive ahead of paddy transplantation that began in mid-June. The land under paddy transplantation in the state is about 32 lakh acre. According to agriculture department data, about 1.11 lakh farmers have opted for the scheme and registered 1.26 lakh acre agricultural land on the Mera Pani-Meri Virasat portal for sowing crops such as maize, bajra, cotton, pulses, vegetables etc. Contrary to the initial excitement that the farmers’ response triggered, about 39,000 hectare land where paddy was not sown was identified during the first stage of physical verification. The revenue officers committees were set up for physical verification in every district. During the second stage of verification before harvesting, the agriculture department has so far identified only 5,000 hectare land where alternative crops were sown, as per the data compiled till October 29. “Though the second stage of verification has been done, the data is still being tabulated,” said Vijay Singh Dahiya, director general, agriculture department. He pointed out that it is a voluntary scheme that targets to diversify one lakh hectare. Dahiya said during the first round of physical verification, about 40,000 hectare land was identified to have been diversified and ₹2,000 incentive each was released to the farmers. Sources say the second round of verification has thrown data that may leave the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government red-faced. “The second physical verification data also raises a question mark over the authenticity of the first verification,” said a well-placed source. The largest number of farmers (12,403) opting for this scheme were from Jind district who had registered 14,583 hectare for diversification. In the first stage, 5,342 hectare was verified and in second stage it came down to 751 hectare. Similarly, in Sirsa district, 10,536 farmers had registered 14,338 hectare land but the first verification found crop diversification in 4,937 hectare. In his October 15 affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, chief secretary Vijai Vardhan while listing various steps including ‘crop diversification’ to contain stubble burning had stated: “The flagship scheme of Mera Paani Meri Virasat under which an area of about 1,00,000 acres has been diversified to another alternative crops.” In yet another spin into the land diversified so far, agriculture minister JP Dalal on Monday claimed that the farmers have cultivated alternative crops “other than paddy over 1.27 lakh hectare area...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-s-crop-diversification-drive-figures-are-as-diversified/story-OY6uTmLVxwHAS6bXABv8aM.html
03-11-2020||Election:||Bihar elections: Polling for 2nd phase largely peaceful, provisional turnout at 54.44%||Bihar recorded a provisional voter turnout of 54.44 percent during the second phase of polls which passed off peacefully in 94 assembly constituencies across 17 districts on Tuesday. The provisional voter turnout was 1.73 percent less than the last assembly polls (56.17 percent) in these constituencies in 2015. It was also less than the first phase polls (55.69 percent) in 71 assembly constituencies on October 28. However, Bihar chief electoral officer (CEO) HR Srinivasa expected the final voter count to go up by Wednesday. “The final vote count in 13 assembly constituencies is yet to come. We expect the voting percentage to go up. We will be ready with the final figures by 10-11 am tomorrow,” said Bihar chief electoral officer HR Srinivasa while addressing a post-poll presser in the evening. Patna recorded the lowest voter turnout at 48.23 percent, pointing towards the growing lack of interest among urban voters to exercise their franchise. The district election office, however, reported 51.2 percent voter turnout in Patna. Patna’s Digha, which was the largest assembly constituency in terms of the number of electorate (4.50 lakh), recorded the lowest voter turnout at 34.5 percent, followed by Bankipur at 35.9 percent) (3.91 lakh voters) and Kumhrar at 36.4 percent (4.06 lakh electors). Also read: Delhi records 6,725 new cases of Covid-19, its highest single-day spikeThe Muzaffarpur district topped with a provisional voter turnout of 59.98 percent, followed by West Champaran (59.69 percent), Begusarai (58.82 percent), Sitamarhi (57.40 percent), East Champaran (56.75 percent), Khagaria (56.10 percent), Sheohar (56.04 percent), Samastipur (56.02 percent), Gopalganj (55.09 percent), Bhagalpur (54.85 percent), Madhubani (54.67 percent), Vaishali (54.52 percent), Darbhanga and Saran (54.15 percent each), Siwan (51.88 percent) and Nalanda (51.06 percent), according to information shared by the chief electoral officer. Women, who comprise 1.35 crore of the 2.86 crore voters enrolled in the second phase, came out in large numbers to exercise their franchise.Voting was peaceful barring sporadic instances of violence arising out of stone-pelting and sparring between two groups at Paharpur in Saran district and near booth number 58 at Kanti in Muzaffarpur district and alleged breaking of an electronic voting machine (EVM), by a youth who managed to give the security personnel the slip, at Jugni Parsa in Saran. A total 62 preventive arrests were made and 726 illegal firearms seized across the 17 districts in the run up to the polls as well as police action taken on the polling day Tuesday. As many as 18,823 of the total 41,362 polling centres were housed in buildings of which 986 buildings were in Naxal affected areas, said a communique from the CEO office. Reports of temporary disruption in polling due to EVM malfunction was also received early in the day. Srinivasa said 152 control units, 219 ballot units and 540 VVPAT (voter verification audit rail) were changed following snag after commencement of polls during the day. As many as 375 control units, 333 ballot units and 647 VVPAT were changed during mock polls, before commencement of actual polling at 7 am.

Arvind Sharma, a resident, said, “There is no end to the woes of residents as the department has failed to resolve the issue which has been taking a toll on our health for over a month now. The sewerage board teams are working in the area but they have also failed to solve the problem. Foul smell emanates from the water being supplied in the area and we are forced to purchase water bottles. Staffers of the sewerage board were also not allowing the health department team to collect samples from particular points in the area on Monday.” Another resident, Balraj Chopra, said the authorities should find a solution for the problem at the earliest as residents are falling ill. It is shocking that the authorities have failed to resolve the issue even after a month, he added.PWSSB executive engineer, GP Singh, however said he does not know about the issue. “We had received complaints in the past and those have been resolved. There is no such problem in the area as of now.

As per the data shared by the board, the maximum level of PM2.5 recorded during the day was 342.Requesting anonymity, an official from the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) said that the pollution levels deteriorated further due to the rising incidents of stubble burning.As many as 1,803 stubble burning incidents have been reported from September 21 to November 3 in the district, whereas 796 and 557 farm fires were reported in the corresponding period in 2019 and 2018 respectively.Dust began to form since the daybreak and continued throughout the day.The rise in the cases had witnessed despite repeated requests from Ludhiana deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma to refrain from burning paddy straw especially amid the pandemic, which can further lead to serious implications in aggravating the health issues of those who are already suffering from several diseases.To prevent crop residue burning during Kharif season especially amid the pandemic, the district administration had appointed nodal officers for paddy growing villages where stubble was being traditionally put to fire.Nodal officers were appointed for each village where the paddy is grown and its stubble is being burnt, but they failed to plug the menace.The staff of municipal cooperation, revenue, rural development, and panchayats, agriculture, horticulture, and soil conservation departments and PPCB besides guardians of governance were asked to spread awareness to stamp out the unhealthy practice of stubble burning in the state, but the employees have failed to keep a check on farm fire incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-air-quality-remains-poor-data-says-stubble-burning-up-by-50-in-district/story-2vEjZPNv9L0Tjhx0YVgwSL.html
03-11-2020||City||Sofas made out of stubble catch visitors’ fancy at PAU||After converting stubble into jewellery, floor mats, Punjab Agricultural University has now turned straw into outdoor sofas and centre tables. The furniture made from straw is catching people’s fancy and has become an attraction for those visiting the university.The judicious use of stubble has been showcased amidst raging debate of rising incidents of stubble burning across the state.Anil Sharma, assistant director, Communication Centre, who is also known for writing jingles to exhort farmers not to set paddy straw on fire, is the brain behind designing the furniture from paddy residue.He said that half-acre stubble was used for building the outdoor arrangement, consisting of four sofas and centre tables.“Going through the paddy fields recently, I spotted these rectangular bales strewn in the fields by a progressive farmer and thought why not use these bales for outdoor sitting arrangement. I shared the idea with TS Riar, additional director of communication and skill development centre, who encouraged me to go ahead with the project,” said Sharma. He arranged the bales with the help of other employees in his office. The bales were first wrapped with polythene and covered with garden net and other waste material. “The set of four sofas and centre tables cost us Rs 2,000. As the stubble is compressed and wrapped with polythene it is unlikely that it could gather moisture and fungus so it could be used for a few years,” Sharma added.The move also earned the appreciation from vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon. He said that even the community sciences department was making jewellery, artwork, floor mattress and other items from stubble. “We are encouraging farmers to take such initiatives, but there are some who are setting their fields on fire and causing air pollution,” said Dhillon.Riar said that instead of constructing cemented sitting arrangements in villages and cities, such cost-effective measures should be adopted in public parks and gardens across the state to tackle the stubble burning menace.Recently, additional chief secretary-cum-financial commissioner, development, Anirudh Tiwari during his visit had shown keen interest in the artwork from paddy stubble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sofas-made-out-of-stubble-catch-visitors-fancy-at-pau/story-qYtDx9ksUde1f76qimCJHI.html

Also, the venue for the meeting will be finalised keeping in view the social distancing requirements. On October 21, SAD councillors had met mayor Sandhu and given an ultimatum of 15 days to call the meeting. The MC house last met in March. The councillors rued that there are several issues that need to be resolved at the earliest including potholed roads, non-functional streetlights, etc.The delegation had said that 12 road samples had failed quality tests in the past, with the mayor himself catching embezzlement of around ₹44 lakh in the Jagraon Bridge reconstruction project, but no action has been taken against any contractor or the officials concerned.Leader of opposition in the MC general house and SAD councillor, Harbhajan Singh Dang said, “I had met mayor Sandhu on Tuesday and he has announced to conduct the meeting on November 11. The failure of MC in acting against officials concerned and road contractors is among the major issues which will be raised in the meeting.”“Residents have also been raising a hue and cry over non-functional streetlights, choked sewer lines, potholed roads among other issues, and all these problems will be raised during the meeting,” said Dang while adding that a meeting has to be held every month but the mayor has been deliberately delaying the same to cover up the civic body’s failure.

The councillors will have to undergo the Covid-19 test before participating in the meeting. The venue for the meeting will be finalised in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-seven-months-ludhiana-mc-house-to-finally-meet-on-november-11/story-VC5PrQxV2AXzYR49sIMeyL.html

The accused, a resident of Grewal Colony, here, is a school dropout and has been working as a freelancer for an online web channel ‘Punjab Star Daily for the last four years. Due to “poor content”, the channel refused to telecast any news or information given by him, following which he hatched the conspiracy to make a “sensational news” by desecrating the holy books. The police have recovered the torn pages of Gutka Sahib and Sanchi Sahib from his house. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said the accused had even shot some videos of the torn pages of holy books. Before he could edit it, the police had arrested him. The police chief said that on Monday evening, Baldev Singh, president of a gurdwara at Tibba road informed the police about the torn pages of Gutka Sahib lying in a field. “The teenager claimed that he had seen two motorcycle-borne turbaned men escape after throwing the torn pages in the field. When the police scanned CCTVs installed in the area, they did not spot any such incident. The cops became more suspicious when the accused started continuously changing his statements,” said the police chief. “The accused later confessed to committing the crime. He stated that he wanted to make sensational news so he had torn the pages of the holy book and thrown it in the fields,” he added.The police chief added that the accused had recently converted into a Sikh. He had purchased some holy books from a shop outside Gurdwara Sahib and also joined a religious WhatsApp group. A case under Sections 295-A (malicious acts intended to outrage the religious feelings ) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code has been lodged against the accused at Tibba police station. The police are investigating the involvement of other persons in the matter. The police have also called a forensic team from Chandigarh for investigation. On Tuesday morning, the locals had staged a peaceful protest against the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-18-year-old-school-dropout-arrested-for-tibba-road-sacrilege/story-piUZatE3TLoVj8N5JED2FL.html

His father alleged he was denied entry into the police station to meet his son.Later, talking to media, he said, “Is hoisting the Tricolour in this country a crime? I was not allowed to meet my son and got pushed around by the constable at the entry of the police station. They didn’t let me meet the SHO. It is my right to get a copy of the FIR and know under what sections my son has been arrested. They came to my residence without any search or arrest warrants and whisked him away to the police station in my absence.”“Has my son revolted against the nation? He had hoisted the national flag, which is our pride. I served in the navy and we live and die for the Tricolour. We will hoist it wherever we want in India… even at PM’s residence,” he added.Panthers Party has strongly criticised the police action and demanded immediate release of the youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ex-serviceman-s-son-hoists-tricolour-at-pdp-office-during-protest-held/story-8xzuz7fConBY7sTuUw6peJ.html

He had last visited the state on March 1.The home minister’s visit assumes significance with West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar criticising the “worsening” law and order situation in the state.Dhankhar had met Shah in New Delhi last week and discussed the “state of affairs and affairs of the state”.BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said that Shah will arrive in Kolkata on the night of November 4. He will visit Bankura the next day and hold an organisational meeting with BJP leaders of East and West Midnapore, Birbhum, Purulia and Bankura districts.“He will return to Kolkata in the evening. On November 6, he will visit the Dakineshwar Kali Temple and meet classical singer Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty. Later, he will hold a meeting with the state BJP leaders,” Basu said.Shah is also likely to have lunch at the house of BJP activists both in Bankura and in Kolkata, he said.Shah, along with BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, vice-president Mukul Roy and state chief Dilip Ghosh, will interact with booth and district-level leaders and various social groups, party sources said.State BJP leaders have been demanding imposition of President’s Rule in Bengal citing “breakdown of the rule of law”.Shah’s visit will take place days after the major organisational change in the state BJP. Its general secretary (organisation) Subrata Chattopadhyay was removed and his deputy Amitava Chakraborty was elevated to the post by the central leadership.The 2021 Bengal assembly polls, due in April-May, has assumed significance for the BJP as it will try to cash in on its growing prominence in state politics, while Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will seek to return to power for the third straight time.The saffron party after having a limited presence in the politically polarised state for decades, has emerged as the main rival of the TMC by winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the 2019 general election.With the BJP’s strength increasing in the state in the last few years, where it has never been in power, its leaders are upbeat that the party will end the TMC’s 10-year-long rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/amit-shah-to-commence-2-day-bengal-visit-from-thursday/story-tEaO9k8SdJWnKbMowPnrCN.html

Youth Congress candidates backed by leaders opposed to former chief minister Virbhadra Singh and his legislator son Vikramaditya Singh have emerged victorious in seven of the 12 districts in the elections. Nigam Bhandari from tribal Kinnaur district, considered close to state Congress general secretary Raghubir Singh Bali got 40,010 votes, while Yadopati Thakur, a loyalist of Shimla rural MLA Vikramaditya Singh got 37,372 votes. Though top-rung leaders refrained from directly interfering in the elections but they backed their sponsored candidates. “It’s good that youth from common background bagged maximum votes in the election, Nigam is hardworking,” said Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, who has strong organisational background. Sukhu had remained the longest serving youth Congress president, prior to taking over the reins of Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee. He was also the longest serving president of NSUI.Raghubir is the son for former transport minister GS Bali and had contested for the post of Youth Congress president in 2010 against Vikramaditya Singh, who eventually won. Yadopati Thakur, who also headed the Congress’ students’ wing, NSUI, was backed by Vikramaditya, while another candidate, Amit Pathania, was ranked third. State Congress chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore also supported Yadopati Thakur. The party had launched an online membership drive for the Youth Congress that ended in September with 3.39 lakh new members joining. Prashant Negi, a candidate for the post of Youth Congress president, alleged that certain leaders had used money power and influenced the membership, while his complaints were ignored. RAHUL TO INTERVIEW TOP CONTENDERS The top three candidates will be interviewed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi .It’s likely that the process would start after the Bihar assembly elections. The election results have intensified factionalism as the group owing allegiance to former congress chief Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu has been demanding the removal of state party chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore. The legislators and the leaders owing loyalties to Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu are keen that the high command either appoints him as state party chief or leader of opposition in the state assembly. Rathore, who was once close to Congress’s deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma replaced Sukhu ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. The party high command removed Sukhu at the behest of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh. In Shimla district, candidates covertly backed by rival factions of Vikramaditya Singh performed impressively in the elections. Ravinder Thakur Tinu secured 4,112 votes for the post of district president against Ankur Sharma who got 2,170 votes. SUKHU’S CANDIDATE FINISHES SECOND IN HOME TURF NADAUN Kapil Thakur, who was backed by former legislator Rohit Thakur in Jubbal-Kotkhai got 900 votes, while his rival, Lavesh Ranta, polled 284 votes. Bhupinder Sharma in Shimla rural secured 815 votes defeating Dharmender Kumar, who got 439 votes. Baldev Singh secured the highest 394 votes for Rohru block against Ashok Dhanda with 343 votes. Anil Chauhan got 1,541 votes for Theogh Kumarsain, defeating Sagar Kainthla, who got 1,231 votes. Anish Dewaan got 311 votes against Basant Singh Chopal. Thakur secured 1,186 votes in Rampur against his rival Rahul Soni, who polled 873 votes. The candidate backed by Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu in Nadaun, Ajay Kumar, secured 1,009 votes, while Ashok Kumar got 1,675 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/youth-congress-elections-bring-infighting-in-himachal-unit-to-fore/story-kkDRkjthrpGyJ7QLACgzzI.html

03-11-2020||Pune||NCP wants ban on firecrackers ahead of Diwali||Ankush Kakade, spokesperson of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the party’s state unit general secretary, has written to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar urging him to impose a ban on firecrackers during Diwali, to prevent the air quality from worsening. Kakade, in his letter, has stated that many citizens are suffering from the Covid-19 infection and are still recuperating from its impact, affecting immunity. “Corona creates breathing issues and inhalation of toxic cracker fumes will further increase the problems of Covid-19 patients and other citizens. There are a number of scientific reports which have exposed the dangers of bursting fire crackers and the life-threatening smoke and fumes. This might lead to an escalation in the number of Covid-19 patients. In view of the dangers to the lives of citizens, bursting of Diwali crackers must be banned,” Kakade stated in the letter. Kakade said that he had drawn the attention of the state government towards the grave concerns arising from the bursting crackers and the threat it poses to the lives of citizens. “We are positive and hopeful that the crackers will be banned this Diwali in the larger interests of public health. Many social organisations have risen to the occasion and supported our initiative,” he said. The doctor community backed the call to ban crackers this Diwali. Prominent Camp-based physician, Dr Yunus Inamdar, said, “Crackers must be banned. Covid-19 is creating serious challenges for public health. The cracker smoke will further aggravate respiratory tract infections. Pollutants released from the crackers stay suspended in the air for a long time and cause severe respiratory complications. This year, it must be a completely smoke-free Diwali for Puneites,” he said. Dr Vaishali Sharma, another specialist doctor from NIBM, said, “Bursting crackers will be a major blow to the efforts of the government in curbing Covid-19. We have already suffered a lot and letting people burst crackers will worsen the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ncp-wants-ban-on-firecrackers-ahead-of-diwali/story-qhYHPScCKVJ6AYsPehCw1K.html
03-11-2020||Pune||MCCIA survey: Festival demand pushes Pune industry production up from Oct’s 55% to 72% in Sept||A survey by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), its seventh since the Covid-19 lockdown began in late March, has concluded that the current level of production has gone up from 55 per cent in September to 72 per cent in October, among the companies surveyed. The rise in production, according to industry players, is mainly due to an increased demand attributed to the festival season, currently underway. The survey, findings of which were released on Tuesday, has also revealed that on average, the number of employees working has gone up from 68 per cent in September to 77 per cent in October. At least 175 organisations in the Pune district participated in the survey, where the factors like current level of production, number of employees working and future expectations were analysed. The surveyed companies were also asked about when their production levels were expected to be the same as it was in January 2020. Thirty per cent of the companies said production was already at pre-Covid levels while 11 per cent of the respondents maintained that they expect production levels to go back to pre-Covid levels in less than three months. As many as 28 per cent of the respondents said they expect it to take between three and six months, while 16 per cent said it would take between six and nine months. Three per cent said it would take beyond nine months and 11 per cent were uncertain. The distribution of organisations surveyed - micro, small, medium and large – is 27 per cent, 33 per cent, 17 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively. Sixty-six per cent of the organisations surveyed are from the manufacturing sector and 16 per cent from the services sector. The rest are involved in both manufacturing and services. Sudhir Mehta, president, MCCIA, said, “In the MCCIA’s monthly survey on economic recovery in the Pune Region, we are very glad to see a substantive jump in economic activities from September to Octover, especially among MSMEs. We need to cross the hump of the possibility of the second-wave uncertainty due to winter, to benefit from the further reduced levels of uncertainty. We are on the right track, but it’s important to not forget about some sectors and employees who are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic; e.g. MSMEs unbanked by the formal sector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mccia-survey-festival-demand-pushes-pune-industry-production-up-from-oct-s-55-to-72-in-sept/story-qlskFKHTy6IUJ6jf1SGucN.html

03-11-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Voters shy away; Digha, Bankipur, Kumhrar witness lowest polling||Three constituencies, including Digha, Bankipur and Kumhrar, having the highest of number of electorate among nine assembly constituencies in Patna district, witnessed the lowest polling in the second phase of Bihar assembly elections held on Tuesday, while total polling in the district was 51.20 percent. The polling in the three constituencies was also lowest among the 188 seats that went for polls today.In 2010 and 2015 assembly elections too these three constituencies had seen a low polling percentage.This is true to the prophecy of poll pundits that the urban voters in constituencies falling under Patna district would shy away from casting their votes. Call it fear of Covid-19 or considering poll day as a holiday, many voters did not step out of their homes in urban areas, however, in rural Patna, this was not the case.As per the figures provided by the Election Commission of India (ECI), the lowest voting of 34.50 percent in nine constituencies falling in Patna district was witnessed in Digha, followed by Bankipur (35.90 percent) and Kumhrar (36.40 percent). The highest polling of 61.80 percent among the 188 constituencies was recorded in Maner under Patna district.Also read: ‘Won’t have any impact’ - Nitish after onions thrown at poll rallyDigha is the largest assembly constituency, electorate wise, among the 188 seats that went to polls on Tuesday.There are a total of 2,85,50,285 electorate in Patna district comprising Bakhtiyarpur, Digha, Bankipur, Kumhrar, Patna Sahib, Fatuha, Danapur, Maner and Phulwari (SC) constituencies.While there are a total of 1,50,330,34 male voters, the female electorate are 1,35,16,271 in the nine constituencies. Digha has the highest number of voters (4,60,165), followed by Kumhrar (4,27,078) and Bankipur (3,91,517). Bakhtiarpur constituency has the lowest number of voters (2,83,264).Fearing low turnout of voters, this time the BJP candidates of Digha, Bankipur and Kumhrar had set up special cells to maintain direct contact with the voters. They had also set up call centres through which the voters were contacted to know whether they faced any problem in casting their votes. “Individual SMS and Uniform Resource Link (URL) were sent by the contestants to search the name of the electorate in the voters’ list,” said Ankit Raj, a call centre staff working with a BJP candidate.“In this assembly election, it is a challenge to pull out the urban voters to the polling booths. People in urban areas are more conscience towards ways of preventing Covid-19 and so they are avoiding going to polling booths, however, in rural areas, this is not the case so the polling percentage is more,” said DM Diwakar, former director of AN Sinha Institute.The Patna district administration had taken several measures to encourage voters to cast their votes on Tuesday, which included setting up 251 model polling booths, 13 eco-friendly stations, sanitisation of booths and adhering to social distancing norms for the prevention of Covid-19. It had also arranged 30 vehicles to ferry physically challenged and old aged voters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-voters-shy-away-digha-bankipur-kumhrar-witness-lowest-polling/story-5qA5ZWIOowR80tQEAS5QLI.html
03-11-2020||City||13 cars with manipulated engine, chassis numbers, worth Rs 1.39 crore, seized; 4 arrested||PUNE: Four men have been arrested and 13 cars, with manipulated engine and chassis numbers, worth Rs 1.39 crore have been seized on Tuesday. On January 26, Pimpri-Chinchwad police had recovered of 12 stolen cars with manipulated engine and chassis numbers in a similar raid, with the arrest of one person.The Pimpri-Chinchwad police have now recovered 25 such cars, collectively worth at least Rs 3.5 crore.The five men arrested so far have been identified as Chanprit Harvindarpal Singh (43); Manjit Jogindersingh Marwa, a resident of Walhekarwadi in Chinchwad and a native of New Delhi; Deepak Chamanlal Khanna (40), a resident of New Delhi; Pratik alias Nagesh Chagan Deshmukh (28), a resident of Khopoli in Raigad; and Harun Sharif Shaikh (39), a resident of Chikali in Pune, according to police. “Theirs was a unique modus operandi. They bought damaged cars from insurance companies. They identified the make, year, model, and colour of the damaged vehicle and stole vehicles with similar configurations from other states. They assembled the new car with parts from the insurance company scrap vehicles and sold them at a cheaper cost,” said Krishna Prakash, commissioner, Pimpri-Chinchwad police. The men had devised a method of deriving maximum cost benefit from the situation by simply wiping or scrubbing the engine number and selling dismantled spare parts of the stolen cars separately. “Depending on the age and brand of the vehicle, they put it on sale at any price between Rs 3 lakh to Rs 18 lakh. And because they also offered papers and insurance with the manipulated car, people bought them. The scrapped car would cost around a lakh of rupees or so. The stolen car was then fitted with these refurbished parts from the damaged insurance cars and sold at a rate lower than market price,” said assistant police inspector Ganesh Mane, who went to various states to make the arrests. The first to be arrested, in January, was Singh. The second and third to be arrested were Marwa and Khanna, followed by Deshmukh and then Shaikh, according to police. Marwa and Khanna were arrested on October 24 when the police tracked them to Chakan. After a chase of around 30km, the two were caught at the Moshi toll plaza. They were found to be the brains behind the scam. Immediately afterwards, Deshmukh and Shaikh were arrested for helping them sell the manipulated vehicles. Marwa bought the damaged insurance cars, Khanna stole the vehicles, and the two others helped them sell the manipulated vehicles. While Marwa has a history of 12 cases against him, Khanna has 38 previous cases registered against him.Recovered stolen vehicles included four Innovas; and one each of the brands of Fortuner, Ertiga, Maruti Swift, Honda City, Toyota Etos, Alto, Nissan, Creta, Bolero Camper, according to the police. They have been reported missing in various states including Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi. They are all now in police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/13-cars-with-manipulated-engine-chassis-numbers-worth-rs-1-39-crore-seized-4-arrested/story-0HMMx6yeyLyEETP0TyNX1J.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Change in wind direction reduces stubble burning share in Delhi pollution to 10 per cent: SAFAR||The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution dropped to 10 per cent on Tuesday due to a change in the wind direction, according to a central government forecasting agency. The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said 3,068 farm fires were spotted over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand on Monday. The boundary layer wind direction became southwesterly on Tuesday morning after a long spell, which is unfavourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, according to the agency. The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM 2.5 pollution has “decreased significantly” and is estimated at 10 per cent for Tuesday, it said. SAFAR said it was a typical example of high fire count and its low impact on Delhi’s air quality due to unfavourable transport level winds, “demonstrating how meteorology can play a decisive role”. Stubble burning accounted for 16 per cent of Delhi’s pollution on Monday and 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season. It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday. Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. SAFAR has predicted a marginal deterioration in the air quality on Wednesday and Thursday. The national capital’s air quality slipped back into the “very poor” category again on Tuesday after recording a marginal improvement over the last 24 hours. Officials at the India Meteorological Department said the air quality had improved on Monday with high wind speed aiding dispersion of pollutants. However, stagnant nighttime conditions led to accumulation of pollutants. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 311 at 3 pm. The 24-hour average (AQI) was 293, which falls in the “poor” category. It was 364 on Sunday, with stubble burning contributing 40 per cent to Delhi’s pollution. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’,201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/change-in-wind-direction-reduces-stubble-burning-share-in-delhi-pollution-to-10-per-cent-safar/story-JszYxNbX7Ptw7POh3lJtML.html
03-11-2020||Chandigarh||Goods suspension by Railways in Punjab causes power cuts as coal stocks dry up||Punjab residents braced for massive power cuts on Tuesday after coal stocks in the state completely dried up as a result of the prolonged suspension of goods supply trains by the Indian Railways. As per a statement, power cuts will be imposed on all residential, commercial and agricultural consumers from Tuesday evening by the Power Department. The day-time power shortage rose to 1000 to 1500 megawatts and the state’s last power plant, GVK Thermal, has also run out. The statement also quotes a government spokesperson saying that the supply of power was inadequate for the demand during the day, which stands at about 5,100 to 5,200 MW, and 3,400 MW at night. Only agricultural power (AP) load of vegetable feeders are being given power supply of 800 MW for four to five hours a day. “The situation is grim as the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is left with no generation control and market rates of power continue to be highly volatile. They could further spike any time, resulting in the increase in the cost of power purchase, on which the state is now completely dependent to feed its cables,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson further said that one unit of the GVK plant that was operational at around 12 noon headed for a shut-down by 5 pm when the coal stock was slated to completely run out. Other Private Thermal Power plants have already exhausted their coal supplies and are out of operation. The state’s own thermal power stations of Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat were also boxed up. However, one unit at each of these plants was being synchronized to make up for GVK generation loss and to provide stability to the system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/goods-suspension-by-railways-in-punjab-causes-power-cuts-as-coal-stocks-dry-up/story-MRhbLu1kLTeCKRAHhLyzMI.html

In December 2019 elections, Bermo had recorded 60.91 percent polling while Dumka polled 66.89 percent votes.Polling went off peacefully in the both the seats. While voting was conducted from 7 am to 5 pm in Dumka, in Bermo the polling was conducted from 7 am to 4 pm. Counting of votes would be done on November 10.In both the seats, ruling JMM and Congress candidates are locked in a direct contest with the BJP candidates. While the JMM has fielded Basant Soren, younger son of party patriarch Shibu Soren from its traditional stronghold Dumka, Congress has fielded Jaimangal Singh, son of the deceased six-term party legislator Rajendra Singh from Bermo.The BJP, on the other hand, is banking on its old faces, former minister from Dumka Lois Marandi and two term-legislator Yogeshwar Mahto Batul from Bermo.Claiming victory for the ruling alliance, JMM general secretary Supriya Bhattacharya said their candidates in both the seats would win with a bigger margin than the 2019 polls.Also read: Onions thrown at Nitish Kumar at poll rally, he says ‘won’t have any impact’“People have shown their trust in the Hemant Soren government. Three former chief ministers of BJP were campaigning in the polls. People have made it clear that they are no more relevant to the state politics,” said Bhattacharya.Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said the high turnout in the bypolls shows the BJP will win both the seats hands down. “The good turnout in the bypoll, despite the pandemic, shows that people are disillusioned with the government. And when people come out to vote in large numbers in bypoll, usually it is against the government. So we are very much hopeful that we will win both the seats hands down,” said Shaheo.Though both sides are claiming victory in both seats, the electoral outcome is unlikely to make any immediate impact on the stability of the 10-month old government as the numbers in the 81-member assembly are stacked in favour of the ruling JMM-Congress-RJD combine with support of at least 48 legislators of the existing 78 members.One seat fell vacant last month after demise of JMM legislator and minority affairs minister Haji Hussain Ansari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-bypoll-dumka-registers-65-27-turnout-bermo-at-60-20/story-Z2csb2ZS12hGzVLBPgwXuO.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality turns ‘very poor’ after marginal improvement||The national capital’s air quality slipped back into the “very poor” category again on Tuesday after recording a marginal improvement.However, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution dropped to 10 per cent during the day due to a change in the wind direction, a central government agency said.Officials at the India Meteorological Department said the air quality had improved on Monday with high wind speed aiding dispersion of pollutants. However, stagnant night-time conditions led to accumulation of pollutants.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 332 at 10 am. It improved to 302 by 4 pm as wind speed picked up.The 24-hour average AQI was 293 on Monday which falls in the “poor” category. It was 364 on Sunday, with stubble burning contributing to 40 per cent of Delhi’s pollution.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’,201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM 2.5 pollution has “decreased significantly” due to a change in the wind direction and is estimated at 10 per cent for Tuesday.It said 3,068 farm fires were spotted over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand on Monday.The boundary layer wind direction became southwesterly on Tuesday morning after a long spell which is unfavourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, according to the agency.SAFAR said it was a typical example of high fire count and its low impact on Delhi’s air quality due to unfavourable transport level winds, “demonstrating how meteorology can play a decisive role”.Stubble burning accounted for 16 per cent of Delhi’s pollution on Monday and 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season.It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday.Last year, the farm fire contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.SAFAR has predicted a marginal deterioration in the air quality on Wednesday and Thursday.According to the India Meteorological Department, the maximum wind speed was 12 kilometers per hour on Tuesday. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the season so far.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the city’s ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was expected to be around 8,000 metre square per second on Tuesday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.In a bid to control pollution, the Delhi government has also said that only “green firecrackers” can be manufactured, sold and used in the national capital in accordance with a 2018 Supreme Court order.‘Green crackers’ are not as polluting as the conventional types of firecrackers and they contain at least 30 per cent less particulate matter such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.Fireworks can take place between 8 pm and 10 pm only on festivals like Diwali and Gurpurab etc. On Christmas eve and New Year eve, it would be from 11:55 pm till 12:30 am only, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee.The National Green Tribunal has also issued notice to the Centre, Central Pollution Control Board, and the governments of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, asking if crackers could be banned between November 7 and November 30 in the interest of public health and environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-turns-very-poor-after-marginal-improvement/story-moKJ1uF12NrcO0DD7UQNrM.html

The booth was set up on October 28 in association with Genestrings Diagnostic Centre Pvt Ltd, an ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research)-approved laboratory, which is currently associated with Delhi government to test for Covid-19, DIAL said.Rajat Arora, director, Genestrings Diagnostic Centre, said they have increased the manpower of lab technicians at the facility in Delhi airport as the lab is expecting more number of samples in the coming days.“The facility will be beneficial to those who are taking international or domestic flights but don’t have an RT-PCR test result. Such passengers can come to the airport around six hours early and get their Covid test done. They will have to pay ₹2,400 for the test and will get the result in four to six hours,” the airport operator said.The DIAL statement said each counter can conduct up to 40 to 50 registrations per hour, and sample collection booths can collect approximately 120-130 samples an hour, it said.DIAL said the lab will get a disclaimer signed from each passenger at the time of testing, wherein the passenger agrees to take full responsibility to follow all government-mandated laws, including quarantine, in case they test positive for the virus.On September 12, DIAL had launched Covid-19 testing facility for arriving international passengers.

03-11-2020||Election:||Voters’ woes in Bihar polls: Many find their names in dead persons’ list||Voters in many constituencies in Patna had a tough time today in exercising their voting rights during the second phase of polling at 94 constituencies of the state Assembly elections. Importantly, many voters failed to cast their votes in absence of their voting slips.Though many of them tried finding their names in the list of voters, some finally found it in the list of dead voters.Many others had serious lapses in their voting slips. While some found their gender changed in the voting slip, others had their relations changed. Someone’s father was mentioned as her husband in the slip while many had their photos changed.Shambhu Nath Jha, a voter from Kumhrar constituency, said it was surprising to see his mother’s name in the list of dead persons.Also read: Tejashwi Yadav’s critics will be ‘khamoshed’, says Shatrughan Sinha“My mother is alive and still very active. When I didn’t get her voting slip, I made enquiry about and was surprised to see her name in the list of the voters who are no longer alive,” Shambhu said.“Interestingly, my neighbour’s father is no more but he has got his voter’s slip,” he added.Yet another voter from Kumhrar, Kiran Devi, said she failed to exercise her voting rights for the first time. “I didn’t get the slip while all others in the family received their voters slip. It’s been surprising as I have been the daughter of this constituency and have been exercising my voting rights for over two decades,” she said. Far more surprising was the situation for another voter from Kankarbangh of Kumhrar assembly constituency. Praveen Kumar said his gender was changed in the voter slip. “There’s a photo a woman on my slip,” he said. His wife’s slip bore a picture of a senior citizen, he added. Rekha, a voter from Kadam Kuan under Bankipur constituency, said there was a blunder in her voter slip. “My late father has been mentioned as my husband in the slip,” she said.

03-11-2020||Pune||Fire blazes for second day at Pune garbage unit; case registered||PUNE: After a day of firefighting, fire brigade officials were able to partially douse the fire at the garbage processing unit in Ambegaon in the absence of equipment required to reach the inner part of the wall created by heaps of burning garbage. “The fire is massive and we have sprayed water using almost 30-35 tankers till now. The wall of garbage that is visible is completely wet and doused and settled. The fire is still on behind it. To get to that, we need to pull down this wall of garbage, but the JCB that is available is not able to do the job. We need a poclane machine,” said Sanjay Ramteke, an official of the fire brigade’s Katraj division which is tasked with the operation. Meanwhile, the police have registered a case against unidentified people who started the fire. A case under Sections 435, 427, 143, 147, and 149 of Indian Penal Code was registered at Bharti Vidyapeeth police station. “We have registered a case. To determine the extent of damage, the fire needs to be doused. There is considerable damage,” said inspector (crime) Vishnu Tamhane of Bharti Vidyapeeth police station. The smoke bellowing from the site of the plant covered the entire area and the residential buildings that are in close proximity. The fire was allegedly lit by angry villagers and residents who were attending a meeting with PMC officials and politicians. “A PMC official told one of us that the villagers were charging towards the facility and were angry. So, we all left the plant and ran for our lives. One driver later told us what had happened. There were five CCTV cameras at the facility, each one of them was broken. Their feed is recorded in the office on-site which was also damaged,” said an official of the private company that built and manages the plant. He, however, insisted on remaining anonymous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fire-blazes-for-second-day-at-ambegaon-garbage-unit-case-registered/story-YI8VZHGdfhTPJmOIFt4oQK.html

03-11-2020||Pune||Student volunteers find strong Pune link in Bihar polls||As part of the political campaigning during the Bihar assembly polls, political parties are raising the issue of job opportunities in Pune and its surrounding areas. As similar opportunities are lacking in Bihar, due to what these workers call, a failure of government, many from various districts, such as Katihar, have migrated to Pune. “We have come to Bihar on October 28 to support our candidates contesting the elections. My responsibility here is to campaign for our candidate Tauquir Alam from Pranpur constituency in Katihar district. I go door to door and take corner sabhas to get the maximum votes. I also look after social media campaigning and the news publicity for our candidate,” said Satish Gore, a student leader from Pune and Maharashtra state secretary of the Indian National Youth Congress. Talking about his experience about campaigning, Gore said, “Specifically in Katihar there are lot of labourers from here who come to Pune and Mumbai in search of work. Now they have returned to their villages due to lockdown and also for the elections. The lack of jobs in Bihar is now a poll issue.” According to Gore, there is the major connect between Pune and Katihar district, with many Bihari voters fluently speaking Marathi, which was a surprise for him. “It was easy for me to talk with them and place our agenda in front of them. One of the major demands is about creating job opportunities in their own district. They don’t want to travel to other places in search of work. People who have come back to Bihar after leaving their work in Pune are struggling to survive,” he added. Another student leader, Vaibhav Parwat, who is a volunteer of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in Pune, was in Bihar for a month to study the elections. He said, “I was in Bihar to study the election and what are expectations of Bihar citizens from the political parties. There is a strong connect between Bihar and Pune which I realised during my tenure there.” “Another major issue is about the flood affected parts of the state. People feel nothing has been done to resolve this long-pending issue. There is good production of agricultural goods, but compared to Maharashtra there is not much development in the industrial sector. So, a majority prefer to come to Pune and other cities in Maharashtra in search of work,” Parwat added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/student-volunteers-find-strong-pune-link-in-bihar-polls/story-8CsZMV5EQciAN3nyfeIl1J.html
03-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Come Nov 10, Tejashwi Yadav’s critics will be ‘khamoshed’, says Shatrughan Sinha||Critics of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav will be “khamoshed” (silenced) when results for Bihar assembly polls are declared on November 10 as the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ is headed for a “landslide” win, senior Congress leader Shatrughan Sinha said on Tuesday. The actor-turned-politician also said personal attacks were being made against the grand alliance’s chief ministerial candidate by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) leaders as they were “totally rattled” by Yadav’s well-thought and researched promise of providing 10 lakh jobs to the youth of Bihar. In an interview with PTI, Sinha said the “writing on the wall is clear” that the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ will be ‘maha vijayi’ (grandly victorious) as everyone can see the attraction and euphoria for the grand opposition alliance. “The writing on the wall is absolutely clear, the youth brigade led by our very own, dynamic, most talked-about man of aspirations and expectations, Tejashwi Yadav, along with his young team, is going to form the government with a massive landslide victory of the RJD, the Congress and the Left parties,” he said. “The success of the grand alliance in Bihar is inevitable because people want that. The kind of euphoria that has been generated by national youth icon Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav, I would say -- seeing is believing,” said the former Union minister, who had switched to the Congress before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls after spending several years in the BJP. Asked about the criticism that Tejashwi Yadav was inexperienced, Sinha, in his inimitable baritone while improvising on his trademark dialogue ‘khamosh’, said, “The critics will be totally ‘Khamoshed’ on the day of the election results on November 10.” Sinha, whose son Luv Sinha is also in the fray for the Bihar assembly polls, also alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not talking about development issues and said he had often talked about a ‘Congress-mukt Bharat’, but the country is now becoming a ‘Congress-yukt Bharat’. “Congress is a party that has made the maximum contribution to the independence of the country. It has been a party of big leaders. It is an old, gold, bold and beautiful party and you say that you will make a Congress-mukt Bharat, but since you have said this, leave aside Congress-mukt Bharat, it is becoming Congress-yukt Bharat,” he said. “The prime minister is a friend of mine and a guardian of the nation by virtue of being the prime minister. But even once, he has not talked about solutions to problems. Unfortunately, he has not been able to fulfill a single promise made to Bihar. He says will give Rs 1.25 lakh crore package -- (but that amounts to) tall talk, hollow promises,” Sinha said. Hitting out at the NDA for “taunting” Tejashwi Yadav and allegedly making personal attacks, the 74-year-old Congress leader said the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader’s promise of 10 lakh jobs has “totally rattled them”. The situation is going to get worse because the NDA government is “selling” all the PSUs of the country and Yadav has done such a good thing by raising the issue of jobs in the current scenario, Sinha said. “But he is being taunted where will the money come from and then Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman makes an announcement about 19 lakh jobs. Where will the money come from for that?” he said. “They (NDA) are totally rattled and the announcement (of 10 lakh jobs) has created a euphoria. This is a well thought out announcement, it is also well researched and made after consulting intellectuals and experts,” Sinha said. He also criticised Modi for using terms like “jungle raj ka yuvraj” for Tejashwi and asked how would the prime minister feel if someone uses such language against him. “I won’t say, but If someone used such language for him, how would he feel... In Bihar he is talking about China, triple talaq, Article 370, when he should be talking about development, education, health, unemployment, jobs, per capita income, farmers etc,” he said. Pointing to large crowds Tejashwi is drawing in his rallies, Sinha claimed the crowd for PM’s rallies is brought in busses and trucks, but despite that “thin” attendance was being seen in his public meetings. “The kind of enthusiasm and response you see everywhere for our dynamic leader Tejashwi Yadav and also for the Mahagathbandhan at large... the attraction of the Mahagathbandhan is amazing,” he said. The prime minister, his people and the Bihar government are not answering any questions raised by any of us, whether it is Rahul Gandhi or Tejashwi Yadav or people like me, said Sinha. Sinha also hit out at those raising questions over Tejashwi’s qualifications and pointed that there was earlier controversy over the prime minister’s qualifications also. “These are not the issues. You have to answer how come every second person in Bihar is unemployed and how come from every second household, a person has migrated. There is neither infrastructure nor jobs. Health and the education sectors are in shambles,” he said. On Lalu Yadav’s absence from the assembly polls, Sinha said the RJD chief is a mass leader in a true sense and many people feel that he has become a “victim of the conspiracy of political circumstances”. “We hope, wish and pray that we are able to live up to this slogan -- ‘Jail ka phatak tootega, Lalu Yadav chhootega (the prison doors will break down and Lalu Yadav will be set free),” he said.

Cabral admitted that while consultants had recommended the expansion of the capacity, those plans had been shelved.“Goa will not be a coal hub at all. This is a strong statement which I want to make on behalf of the government. An apprehension has been created that more coal will be brought to Goa. Currently, 10 to 12 million tons of coal are being imported annually. This will not increase. The government will make sure that the [quantum] will not increase.”Cabral’s comments come a day after midnight protests against the railway expansion, which many believe will be used to ferry coal. Existing handling of coal has been blamed for dust pollution in the port town of Vasco da Gama, which repeatedly reports the worst air quality in Goa. Coal handling has also cited as the reason for mercury in edible oysters.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant has refused to scrap coal projects even as members of his Bharatiya Janata Party have supported those opposed to them.In 2010, the railways sanctioned the doubling of the existing Hospet-Tinaighat-Vasco railway line from Karnataka and Goa. The first phase of the project between Hospet and Tinai ghat has been completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/goa-amid-protests-against-railway-line-minister-says-coal-handling-won-t-be-expanded/story-Y14VwhAIYeUL8VC3vwJMVP.html
03-11-2020||Mumbai||Centre asks Maharashtra govt to stop work for Kanjurmarg metro car shed||In what may become another point of conflict between the two, the Central government has asked the Maharashtra government to stop the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority from developing a metro car shed at Kanjurmarg, sources said on Tuesday.According to sources, the Centre’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade has written to the Chief Secretary of Maharashtra asking them to stop the construction of the proposed metro car shed in Kanjurmarg area.The Maharashtra government had earlier halted the work of Aarey metro car shed, over which protests were held by hundreds of people in October last year, and announced that the project will be relocated to Kanjurmarg.According to sources, the 102-acre land at Kanjurmarg comes under the salt commissioner, who reports to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Government of India.Speaking on the development, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya accused the state government of “fooling the people of the state” and bypassing the recommendations of two committee reports.“Manoj Saunik Committee has clearly said that shifting the car shed project is not a viable option and that it will add a burden of Rs 5,000 crore and delay the project by five years. I dare Uddhav Thackeray government to make public the reports of the Manoj Saunik Committee and Ajay Mehta Committee,” Somaiya said.He said that the two committee reports also mentioned whom the land belongs to.Back in October last year, the felling of trees in the Aarey Colony had drawn a wedge between former allies BJP and Shiv Sena, with then Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis pushing for the project and Thackeray-led party coming out in protest against the proposed car shed.Aarey metro car shed project, stayed by the Maharashtra government, was opposed by environmentalists and others last year in a bid to protect the stretch of forest area considered as the lungs of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/centre-asks-maharashtra-govt-to-stop-work-for-kanjurmarg-metro-car-shed/story-YNuiY3uwqs2nPHg0iKphWP.html
03-11-2020||Pune||Covid-19 recovered patients in Pune complain of cardiac, psychiatric issues||Pune: City hospitals have been running post-Covid-19 OPDs for over a month and are reporting various health issues among patients. In addition to the pulmonary issues reported in patients, hospitals are now seeing cardiac and psychiatric issues in those recovered from Covid-19. In some cases, the issues have been reported even two months after discharge from hospitals. Dr Sanjay Gaikwad, head of the department of pulmonary medicine at BJ medical college, said, “We have seen about 85 Covid-19 recovered patients and the most common complaint is general weakness, breathlessness and cardiac complaint in a few patients. For such patients, we recommend 2D echo and check their heart rate. Another common complaint which we see in patients is fear and anxiety needing psychiatric help. We recommend them dietary supplements, exercises, and supplementary medications if needed.” Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director of Sahyadri Group of Hospitals said, “We started the OPD about a month ago and we get about three to four patients every week. The most common complaint being breathlessness and weakness, however, their parameters are steady. We are also getting patients complaining of cardiac issues and we must be prepared for that in the future too. We get such complaints more in patients who had moderate symptoms during the infection. It has nothing to do with comorbidity or age. The impact of the virus on the organs is independent of such factors, but depends on the severity of the symptoms. We see some patients complaining of breathlessness even two months after recovery and mostly we recommend breathing exercises but sometimes they may need steroids.” Dr Parikshit Prayag, Covid-19 consultant at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital said, “The most common complaints we get are breathlessness, bacterial fever or might even need more oxygen when at home. We are also getting patients with cardiac issues, anxiety complaints, and stress post Covid-19. We are also reporting a few patients with pancreatitis in the case when the infection spreads out of the lungs. The peak in Pune was in August and September and it would be still too early to say how long these effects stay in patients.” According to Noble hospital executive director Dr HK Sale, the hospital is seeing more patients complain of higher sugar levels among diabetic recoveries and higher stress levels in those who suffer from hypertension. “Cardiac complaints are also coming up, but they are fewer in number since we get patients who live nearby the hospital and are regular patients. We are seeing more patients come for non-Covid19 related issues as Covid-19 cases come down,” Sale said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-recovered-patients-in-pune-complain-of-cardiac-psychiatric-issues/story-i7DF1z3IL1CScFeRCoMb9J.html
03-11-2020||Pune||BJ Med College doctors go on leave, en masse||At least 69 assistant professors and doctors who are posted at BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital on a temporary basis have stopped work since Monday and taken mass leave to protest over various demands.Their major demands include regularising them as permanent employee, implementing the 7th pay commission and giving them the status of “Covid warriors”.Sassoon Hospital is one of the prominent hospitals and currently is at the forefront to treat Covid-19 patients and the current strike will impact treatment of such patients in various departments. Patients from across Pune district and even from outside district come here for treatment.“For the last six months we are repeatedly demanding the implementing of 7th pay commission to assistant professors and doctors and to give us Covid warrior status as even we are tirelessly working,” said Dr Nandkumar Salunkhe, assistant professor and B J Medical College representative, Maharashtra State Medical Teachers Association.“None of our demands were heard and so we have decided to stop work and go on mass leave from today (Monday),” said Dr Salunkhe.“Most of our assistant professors were working in Sassoon Hospital from last few months. During the lockdown and even today our doctors are risking their own lives to treat the Covid positive patients. Still, they have not been given the Covid warrior status and we have not been made permanent employees,” he said.“We were given false assurances, but none of them were implemented by the government. We are regularly following up with the government authorities about our demands but they are not fulfilled yet. Until our demands are not met, we will continue our strike,” he said.Dr Murlidhar Tambe, dean, BJ Medical College and Sassoon Hospital, said, “We are in talks with the protesting assistant professors and doctors, their demands will be forwarded to the state government. We will try to normalise the situation as early as possible, there won’t be any impact on treatment at the hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bj-med-college-doctors-go-on-leave-en-masse/story-kLOoeTZvXHUZ8G7OZGDuQK.html
03-11-2020||Pune||PMC’s duct-less 24x7 pipeline build prompts inquiry demand||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has completed 300-kilometres of the 1,700-kilometre pipeline project that will install a 24x7 water pipeline, however, despite a prior approval the civic body has failed to lay the duct for optical fibres in tandem.The failure of constructing the ducts along with the pipeline has thrown up a major political slugfest in the city with the opposition demanding an inquiry into the project. The PMC will be digging a majority of the roads in the city to install the 1,700-km water pipeline in the city. The general body had decided to lay the ducts for the fibres at the time of the construction of the pipeline to prevent future diggings, and the PMC would not need to give separate permission for mobile companies to lay their cables. It would be mandatory to them to lay their cables through only ducts. PMC road department chief Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “It is true that the general body of the PMC gave a nod for laying ducts along the 24x7 water project but the ducts were not erected. The PMC administration is undergoing a discussion on it.” Former Pune municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar had promised that as the work would be awarded to the same contractor, it would help save cost and time for digging the duct. One of the officials confirmed that laying the duct was part of the tender; the company which got the contract for the pipeline got the permission to lay the ducts. Chetan Tupe, MLA and NCP city unit president said, “It was decided to carry the duct work along with the 24x7 water pipeline. The ruling BJP and municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar were aggressive on it. It is shocking that despite getting a nod and mentioned in the tender, why is the work not happening on ground. It is the ruling party’s responsibility to monitor the work. MP Girish Bapat has now decided to look into this project. He should check why his own party members did not check the work. We would raise this issue and ask the municipal commissioner to take appropriate action.” Another officer from PMC said on anonymity, “It is true that the PMC administration and the elected members decided to lay the ducts along the water lines. There were two groups within the administration; one was in the view that it is not possible to erect the duct in the whole city as almost half the road would need to be dug. Another backed the laying of the ducts to maintain the condition of the roads. Every year, mobile companies, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and other utilities use to dig the road for laying the lines and it affects the road quality as well as creates nuisance to the citizens.” Former Pune municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar was aggressive on constructing the duct along with the 24x7 water pipeline. Earlier it was not part of the tender document, but Kumar convinced the elected members why it is important. Ujwal Keskar, Apale Pune organisation founder and BJP leader said, “It is a must to carry the optical fibre duct work along with the water pipeline work. It is a good chance to do it in the whole city as already the roads are being dug for the water pipeline project. It is serious that despite the approval from the general body meeting and mentioned in the tender document, this work is not happening on ground.” Former deputy mayor and RPI leader Siddharth Dhende wrote a letter to the PMC road chief and the municipal commissioner demanding an inquiry into the project. “The general body meeting had approved the project. On the ground, it is not happening as per tender document as it was decided to lay the ducts along with the pipeline work. Recently, I wrote a letter to the municipal commissioner and road department head Pawaskar and pointed out that the contractor is not laying ducts anywhere in the city. Our demand is to do an inquiry. While issuing bills, it needs to be checked whether the bills were paid for duct work,” he said. Aba Bagul, Congress leader said, “The municipal commissioner must do an inquiry of this project. Every year PMC spends a lot on road improvement. After a lot of discussion, the general body had approved the ducts along with the 24x7 water project. If the water pipeline work is in progress and ducts are not carried out, the ruling party must answer.” BOX PMC approved Rs 195 crore for laying duct along the pipeline project in Feb 2018The PMC approved Rs 195 crore for the optical fibre duct project along with the 24x7 water pipeline project. The PMC had given an approval for this project in February 2018. Former Pune municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar promised that as the work would be given to the same contractor, it would help save cost and time for digging the duct. Even citizens would not need to face road digging works repeatedly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-s-duct-less-24x7-pipeline-build-prompts-inquiry-demand/story-cIB2kXRMP0xh0xRSc0wYXK.html

03-11-2020||Pune||Fresh Covid cases dip, but high number of critical patients worries Pune administration||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Sunday (November 1) reported 377 new Covid positives and 579 critical patients with 335 on oxygen support and 244 in ICU without ventilator. The high number of critical cases has left the concerned administration to appeal to doctors to focus on these patients to bring down the case fatality rate which continues to be over 2.6% as recorded on Sunday for the city. The number of critical patients as of October 14 was 839 with 453 on ventilator and 386 in ICU without ventilator when 528 fresh cases were reported. In mid- September, when over 2,100 fresh cases were detected, the number of critical patients stood at 936 of which 480 were are on ventilator and 456 in ICU without ventilator. Experts believe that the number of critical cases has not gone down as proportionately as fresh cases which is a concern and needs to be attended to to bring down the deaths due to the infection. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “The critical cases is a cause of concern for us. Close to 600 are critical in Pune city alone which is why the case fatality rate remains high. Now that the caseload on doctors is less, we have asked the task force to focus on critical patients and change treatment protocol if needed for their speedy recovery.” Dr Subhash Salunkhe, epidemiologist and chairman of the state technical committee on communicable diseases, said, “The current treatment protocol is tried and tested and its rightful implementation will surely give better results. It is also true that patients remain in a critical condition longer especially if they have comorbid conditions, which is why the number seems to remain constant for days. However, the decline has not been proportionate to new cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fresh-covid-cases-dip-but-high-number-of-critical-patients-worries-pune-administration/story-8acfSbVed1nlNLm19C1SkJ.html

03-11-2020||Dehradun||Haridwar temples, shrines to don saffron look for Mahakumbh 2021||Taking a leaf from saffron colouring of temples, ashrams and other buildings during last year’s Prayagraj Kumbh in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand government has decided to paint all such religious structures adjacent to Ganga in Haridwar in saffron colour for next year’s Mahakumbh. Saffron and yellow colours will be used across the Kumbh mela zone in and around Har-Ki-Pauri area in Haridwar. Some ashrams, local priests and traders have already started colouring their religious structures in saffron and yellow. The Kumbh Mela administration, which had been dwelling on the move for quite some time, approached Akhadas, saints, pontiffs of ashrams-maths, traders and local people for more suggestions and cooperation in this regard. Haridwar-Roorkee Development Authority (HRDA) has already completed a survey of 150 buildings and structures from British era Damkoti Ganga canal regulator Bridge till Sarvanand Ghat, adjacent to Badrinath-Mana-Ghaziabad Highway-58. Kumbh Mela officer-in-charge Deepak Rawat has been pressing for one colour-look of the mela zone during the Mahakumbh for which he has been getting a good response from stakeholders. He has also suggested having the same size, font and signage boards of shops at city markets. Also read: How ‘Made-in-India’ Sonet is powering Kia the world overAccording to additional district magistrate Kumbh Mela administration Harbeer Singh, temple managing committees, ashramites, hotel and trader associations and the locals have given their consent in carrying out the saffron and yellow colouring of their buildings. Expressing happiness over the Mela administration’s move to give structures a similar look for the Mahakumbh, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad said that they have been pressing for this for the past few years. “In our Mahakumbh related meetings with chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, we had raised saffron colouring of buildings at Har-Ki-Pauri and mela zone to give a unique identity to the area. As pilgrims arrive in millions during Mahakumbh, the saffron colouring will add to the aura of the mega fair,” said Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj general secretary of Akhada Parishad. Notably, after Mahakumbh 2010, the then district magistrate Nidhi Pandey in 2013 had decided to get the buildings and structures in and around Har-Ki-Pauri in pink to have a uniform look. “One of the first hotels to be donned pink colour was mine at Subash Ghat in mid-2013. But in the initial phase of the pink colour drive, she got transferred and the pink drive got halted. But now we are ready again to have a uniform colouring of buildings for Mahakumbh,” said Aadesh Marwadi, a hotelier. Meanwhile, Kamal Brijwasi, leader of the local trade body, has urged the state government and mela administration to allow pilgrims for Kumbh mela bath (snan) and set aside the e-pass system. Brijwasi pointed out that for the past eight months the trader fraternity suffered a great deal due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Trade activities in Haridwar are directly related to pilgrim influx and Mahakumbh is held after every twelve years, therefore, he said, free movement of pilgrims should be allowed with Covid-19 precautions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/haridwar-temples-shrines-to-don-saffron-look-for-mahakumbh-2021/story-2inlOwPnqZdKgiDDcF0NhK.html

The NGO stated that Bapat participated in a debate in the parliament to support the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) bill and requested the government to start an IIT in Pune. Besides, Bapat has also raised a question on whether the government has released a five-year vision and action plan to transform higher education by doubling enrolment and employability and whether the government was looking for allowing top foreign universities to set up off campus universities in India. According to the report, Bapat also raised a question on whether the government has any mechanism to monitor and assess the forest or green cover in the city. He also asked critical questions like whether the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has formed a central monitoring committee to prepare and enforce a national plan to make over 350 river stretches across the country pollution free and whether the central monitoring committee has prepared an integrated plan for conservation of environment. The report further adds that the parliamentarian participated in debates to raise the issue of housing and safety measures for construction labourers in Pune and requested the government to implement provisions meant for welfare of such workers. The MP during a zero-hour brought the governments attention to expedite the construction work on Pune-Nashik National Highway No 50. Avinay Sanyogita, researcher, MumbaiVotes, said, “The entire exercise is aimed at strengthening grass roots democracy through accountability of public representatives. We sent the data and the report to the MP but he has not responded so far. Also, whatever oral announcement has been made don’t have reached fruition keeping the performance report as blank. Promises made to the electorate are to be fulfilled so that development of the citizens takes place at large strengthening grassroots democracy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/punevotes-org-gives-bapat-an-a-for-voicing-grievances-but-ground-performance-missing/story-Sj9OJBqU5Fr6rY7DGAv6ZN.html

This is his response to some of the questions. What is the latest on infrastructure projects, including the airport and railways in Pune? My attendance in Parliament is 97 per cent, where I have voiced the needs of my people and raised issues of critical importance. We took up the issue with the defence ministry for infrastructure development at Lohegaon airport. Due to this discussion, the airforce authorities made land available for upgradation and this will benefit citizens at large. Also, it will give a major boost to cargo services at the airport in Pune. I was recently appointed president of the Pune Railway Division and immediately thereafter, I took up the upgradation of the Pune-Miraj, Pune–Belgaum and Pune-Nasik railway routes. I also held a meeting with officials of the Union ministry of surface transport, seeking early completion of the Chandni chowk highway widening. What is the status of funds under the MP Local Area Development Fund (MPLAD) scheme? I have spent Rs 1.45 crore for ambulance services; Rs five lakh for setting up libraries for Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) aspirants; Rs 50 lakh has been spent on upgradation of drainage infrastructure in Pune; and Rs 60 lakh has been spent for road infrastructure development in the city. We had received a total of Rs 2.60 crore from the Union government under the MPLAD scheme. Currently, due to the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, funds under MPLAD scheme have been frozen. What are the other city initiatives undertaken which have yielded results ? I resolved the Bhama Ashkhed crisis and the issues related to farmers’ lands, due to which round-the-clock water supply system will come become functional soon. I have taken up issues of the Khadki and Pune Cantonment areas with the respective CEOs. I held 10 meetings with Maha Nagar Gas Limited (MNGL), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and police authorities, and between 52,000 and 60,000 households will have direct MNGL connections at their residences. What about the Covid-19 crisis in Pune? We have carried strong grassroots work among citizens, where we did our level best to mitigate the crisis through provisions of medicines, setting up of quarantine centres, and enrolling doctors and nurses for Corona care. All the work has been documented in the form of booklet, “Bringing Society on one platform while combating the Corona crisis”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bapat-lists-mplad-spending-achievements-in-18-months-as-mp/story-iPhDL3eDMTgT8xxX9Ikg6O.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots case: Accused say they’re denied basic facilities, court calls for jail inspection||A Delhi court on Tuesday expressed displeasure with the city prison authorities after seven out of 15 accused in a conspiracy case related to the February north-east Delhi riots alleged they were being denied basic facilities such as warm clothes and slippers and directed an officer not below the rank of additional director general (prisons) to appear before it on the next date of hearing.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat directed the director general (prisons) to take stock of the situation and ensure all issues/problems flagged by the accused or their counsel are heard, apprised and disposed of.The judge said in case the grievances are not resolved by the next date, he would be compelled to visit the jail with the special public prosecutor (SPP) and defence counsel. “In these circumstances, the court directs that an officer not below the rank of additional director general (prisons) shall appear on the next date of hearing,” the court said.Also read | Delhi Police to seek funds to distribute hard copy of 17,000-page riots charge sheet to 15 accusedThe judge said the presence of the jail superintendent might not be helpful as he is responsible for only one jail whereas the grievances seems to be running through all jails.“Since the court is constantly receiving complaints from the accused in judicial custody and their counsels, who have been moving successive applications for directions to the jail superintendent, it appears there are some issues regarding administration in the jail complex as the applications have been made for basic important but avoidable issues/grievances”.Gulfisha Fatima, Ishrat Jahan, Asif Iqbal Tanha, Devangana Kalita, Meeran Haider, Shadab Khan, Athar Khan were among those who complained. All of them have been charge-sheeted by the Delhi Police special cell for their role in hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate the riots.Former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan sought interim bail for two months, saying she was concerned as several inmates at Mandoli jail had developed Covid-19 symptoms. Her counsel alleged she had asked a pair of slippers from her home but they refused. “When her (Jahan’s) parents went to jail yesterday with warm clothes for her, the jail authorities did not permit it,” her lawyer contended.Advocate Mehmood Pracha, counsel for Gulfisha Khatoon, said an application to give winter clothes had to be filed since the jail authorities said they won’t permit it unless there was a court direction.The judge said, “Why do the accused have to approach the court every time for such basic things? This is too much. This is not done. Why is everyone complaining (about the facilities in jail).”“This has to end. DG (prisons) is directed to take stalk of the situation, to order someone, who can take a call, to look into the grievances. If things do not improve, I would go for a physical inspection myself. And the lawyers may accompany me too.”Another accused, Athar Khan, claimed about the lack of health facilities. “Two of the inmates were admitted to hospital and a few have been isolated. There are no health facilities available and so we are not being allowed to step out of our barracks.”Student activist Asif Iqbal Tanha said he was not being given a copy of the bail rejection order. “I have not been allowed to meet my family for the last two-and-a-half months, unlike others. When I complain, the jail authorities say this is not a place for activism,” Tanha alleged.Meeran Haider said he was down with fever due to cold and without any winter clothes, but he has been unable to put forward his grievances to the prison authorities.Fatima said she had written to the higher authorities two months ago, but her letters were not forwarded. Pinjra Tod member Devanagana Kalita also alleged she had not been given a letter from her mother.The court asked the jail authorities to address all the grievances and posted the matter till November 23.Sandeep Goel, director general Delhi prisons, said basic facilities are not denied to anybody. “As such, these allegations seem far from truth or at least exaggerated. If at all there is some such minor issue it will definitely be resolved,” Goel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-case-accused-say-they-re-denied-basic-facilities-court-calls-for-jail-inspection/story-S2efcBtNvx3VFhPngk1n8I.html

03-11-2020||Pune||Atal buses transport 1 lakh commuters in nine days||The newly started Aligning Transit on All Lanes (Atal) bus service by the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has now begun receiving a warm response by commuters from Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad with over 1 lakh commuters in nine days. The Atal bus runs a distance of 5 kilometres with a 5-minute frequency and a ₹5 ticket on 62 new routes in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, the service was ushered in on October 25. “We are getting a good response to the new ATAL bus service, as we crossed the 50,000 commuters mark in the first five days. Now the number has crossed more than 1 lakh and daily the number of passengers is increasing. It is a shuttle bus service for a short distance and we are hoping that maximum citizens return to public transport,” said PMPML chairman and managing director Rajendra Jagtap. According to Jagtap, in the last three days which were public holidays, the buses received a decent number of commuters on all routes. “So, with about 160 to 170 buses on all these 62 new routes, passengers are accepting new facilities of transit from one station to another in the core city and the feeder at terminal depot stations. Some of these routes have high passengers while on some there is a slow response. Things will get clear over a period of time. In the future we are going to take this feeder bus service project for the metro services too, as people once got down from the Metro can travel by PMPML feeder service buses to their nearby destinations. For the next three months, we will take a review of this project, take feedback of passengers and accordingly changes and up gradation will be done on it,” Jagtap said. Shantanu Helanwar, a regular commuter from Jambhulwadi to Katraj depot said, “I am travelling in this newly started shuttle bus service for my work since the past one week, and it seems to be efficient. In such a low fare we reach our nearby destination, or else we had to pay around Rs 20 to share an auto rickshaw. We hope that this service continues and remains constant for commuters like us who travel to nearby distances.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/atal-buses-transport-1-lakh-commuters-in-nine-days/story-sOUoALBfkGlKsUI0Jf43tL.html
03-11-2020||Chandigarh||After President declines meeting request, Punjab CM announces relay dharna in Delhi||With the President of India not giving time for a meeting, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday announced that he will lead a relay dharna of MLAs at Delhi’s Rajghat on Wednesday “to highlight the state’s power crisis and critical essential supplies situation amid the Centre’s adamant refusal to allow movement of goods trains”. The chief minister said he had decided to hold a symbolic relay dharna at Rajghat to bring the state’s grim situation to the Centre’s notice. Since Section 144 of the CrPC is in place in Delhi, MLAs will go from Punjab Bhawan to the samadhi of the Father of the Nation in batches of four only, he said, adding that he will lead the first batch at 10.30am. Captain Amarinder reiterated his appeal to MLAs of other Punjab parties to join the dharna in the interest of the state. SAYS STATE HAS RUN OUT OF COAL, FERTILISER SUPPLIES “GVK has announced it will close down operations at 3pm on Tuesday since coal stocks have completely run out. The public and private power plants in the state have already shut down,” he said in a release. The chief minister claimed that the situation on the ground was grim as the state had run out of coal, urea/DAP and other essential supplies due to the decision of the railways not to ply goods trains even after the farmers eased their blockade to allow such movement. GETS COLD SHOULDER FROM CENTRE Soon after the Vidhan Sabha session, in which all parties had resolved to seek time from the President for November 4 to seek his intervention on the farm bills issue, the chief minister’s office (CMO) had, on October 21, sent a letter to Rashtrapati Bhavan seeking a meeting. A reminder was sent on October 29, in response to which the CMO received a DO letter on Monday rejecting the request for a meeting on grounds of the State Amendment Bills still pending with the governor for consideration. Subsequently, the CMO sent another letter on Monday itself, stating that the chief minister and other MLAs needed time to bring to the President’s notice the situation on the ground and to seek his intervention for resolution of the issues that have cropped up. However, the President’s Office responded saying “the request cannot be accepted at this juncture for reasons cited earlier”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-president-declines-meeting-request-punjab-cm-announces-relay-dharna-in-delhi/story-m93rblgbolB6QhTM8d2NSP.html
03-11-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand paddy scheme put on hold, farmers may not get MSP promised in budget||The Jharkhand government may not purchase paddy at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs2,500 per quintal from the farmers this fiscal as it promised in its budget this year, two people aware of the matter said. The Dhaan Utpadan Evam Bazar Sulabhata scheme for the purpose has been put on hold for a review. The scheme was one of the major poll promises of the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal ahead of the 2019 election apart from the farm loan waiver.State agriculture minister Badal Patralekh said they are reviewing the scheme as they found the maximum benefit of it could go to middlemen if it was implemented without proper homework.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren allocated Rs200 crore for the scheme in the budget.Also read | Jharkhand rejects Centre’s loan offer in lieu of GST compensationPatralekh said he visited villages across the state along with finance minister Rameshwar Oraon and spoke to farmers to understand the status of paddy procurement. “...we found middlemen purchased the paddy from farmers at Rs1,300 per quintal and sold it at government procurement centres at Rs2,000 per quintal [Central MSP plus state bonus]. This way, the traders took away the benefit of MSP and bonus, while actual beneficiaries remained deprived.”He said merely 57,000 people sold paddy at government procurement centres during previous fiscal and most of them were traders. “If the scheme is launched without proper study, the money will not go to actual beneficiaries and traders will grab the maximum benefit,” he said. “A committee has been set up, which would review and suggest ways how to implement it so that the benefit could go to actual beneficiaries.”Patralekh said farmers should not worry as the government is committed to implementing the scheme. “But we have to strengthen the delivery mechanism first.”The paddy procurement in Jharkhand generally begins from December 1 but the government is planning to begin it in November in view of a bumper harvest. Jharkhand reported a record paddy sowing of 97.12% of the total target this year after facing two consecutive drought years.Food and public distribution department director Binit Tirkey said they are planning to begin the procurement from this month. “A proposal in this regard will soon be sent to Cabinet for approval.” He refrained from divulging the bonus amount from the state to be added to the Centre’s MSP.The Centre has increased MSP for paddy to Rs1,868 per quintal from Rs1,815 last year. Paddy was procured at Rs2,000 per quintal in Jharkhand. This included Rs185 bonus provided by the state government last fiscal.But the MSP failed to attract the farmers as most of them sold their produce to private parties at lower prices for cash. Kapildeo Kumar, a paddy farmer from Palamu district, said the government purchases paddy only from the registered farmers but its payment system is very poor. “The money is not given in form of cash. It is credited to bank accounts, which takes at least 15-20 days.” He said if the government wants to make paddy procurement popular, it has to ensure same day payment system.Tirkey claimed all pending dues have been cleared.Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said no promise made to farmers has been fulfilled. “The government promised Rs2,500 MSP for paddy and waiver of loans. The government has taken U-turn on these promises. It has added to woes and withdrawn the BJP government’s Mukhya Mantri Krishi Ashirwad Yojana, which ensured financial assistance of Rs5,000 per acre up to five acres,” said BJP spokesman Prataul Shahdeo.Officials said funds shortage due to Covid-19 period is also one of the main reasons for the delay in implementing the scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-paddy-scheme-put-on-hold-farmers-may-not-get-msp-promised-in-budget/story-ETWIHdw5cqCr1JT4cpvH5N.html
03-11-2020||Gurugram||Karwa Chauth: How Delhi-NCR women will fast in Covid-19 times||The celebrations might be smaller, but won’t loose their sheen say Delhi-NCR women who are set to fast this Karwa Chauth amid the pandemic. It won’t be like any previous year, but the women in the city are all geared up to make it #memorable nonetheless. Think smaller groups, sitting in separate balconies, matching masks and gloves with fancy attires, using sanitiser after every ritual, and the likes. Prayer and games while sitting in separate balconies For Delhi-based lecturer Anshu Popli, “health and safety” are priority. “We have decided to carry out the puja and thali ritual in small groups of no more than four ladies, and mostly from the same building. We’ll be wearing masks and will thoroughly sanitize our hands before and after the ritual. To keep the sense of community intact, we have decided to sit in balconies during the puja, so that we can see each other, talk, pray and play games until we spot the moon in the evening.”No outside food, only homemade prasadRisshma Aggarwal, a Gurugram-based academics officer, says, “Every year I celebrate this day with my close friends and the lovely ladies in my residential society. We indulge in lots of preparations beforehand. But, this year it’s going to be different because of the pandemic. I’ve decided that my joy, happiness and respect for this day will be more like any other year, but the number of people with whom I will celebrate will be less. I’ve decided that this year I’ll celebrate it with only few close friends whom I know are healthy and safe in the pandemic, so far.” She adds, “Keeping all safety measures in mind like sanitisation of place in the residential apartments, gloves and mask, continuous use of sanitiser, homemade prasad and social distancing during puja, we will celebrate this day with great enjoyment and devotion. We will also pray to Goddess Parvati to consecrate us with a healthy life and Mother Earth.”Matching masks with attiresA teacher by profession, Nitima Arora, who used to go to Suncity Park for the puja, in presence of as least 20 women who used to sit in a circle, is planning it differently this year. She says, “I would prefer a group of four to five women only. I’ll hear the story narrating significance of Karwa Chauth in an audio inside the house, and when moving out for exchange of thalis, will of course wear mask and gloves. If matching ask is the need of the hour, then so be it. Life has to be beautiful, individuals will become appealing any way!”Pooja with fewer people: Sanitised placeBhawna Shakadwipee, a home baker, says, “This time due to Covid-19, I am planning to do the puja at my friend’s place only with my very close friends whom I know have been very cautious and careful in taking Covid-19 precautions throughout these last eight months. We will ensure safety by sanitising the place where everyone sits for the puja, and will use masks, gloves etc. Prasad and all offerings will be strictly home made this time. We will celebrate this pooja with fewer friends but loads of joy, and also a prayer that things get better soon.”A safety bubble! Monalika Sabharwal, an entrepreneur, says: “Few of my friends and me have decided to create a “safety bubble “ for the coming festivities and Karwa Chauth puja specially. Puja will be done with my closed group of friends experiencing safety bubble in a well sanitised place using masks, gloves but with same energy, joy and vigour.”“We have also decided to savour on home made snacks and sweets for the Pooja . We will pray together for the safety and well-being of our loved ones,” she adds. Looking #festive ready this #KC this 2020The salons were abuzz with crowds this time around, with many offering a huge discounts. “We have launched exclusive Karwa CHauth head to toe packages. We have also introduced value cards, where customer gets services for more than the value they pay.

Another popular salon chain is offering 25% discount on beauty services and highlights/keratin/smoothening at ₹5999, and global at ₹4999.While some were kicked up getting ready at salons, others chose to stay in due to corona scare. City-based wedding planner Sidhi Mitra was excited about visiting the salons. She says, “I’m visiting Looks Salon for a complete transformation today. Pretty excited for this Karwa Chauth. I am having a Covid-19 era wedding on November 25, so video call is a part of all my rituals. Also I would be doing a ritual over with my mother-in-law as she is in Canada.”While some like homemaker, Sonakshi Chopra will be doing the makeup and hair myself. “Will be doing over video call this time around for rituals.

03-11-2020||Delhi||Posters won’t be pasted outside homes of Covid-19 patients: Delhi govt tells high court||The Aam Aadmi party (AAP)-led government on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court (HC) that it instructed all its officials not to paste posters outside homes of COVID-19 positive persons or those in home isolation and those pasted have been ordered to be removed. The government said that it would be putting out a circular soon on its website against pasting of posters outside houses of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients and for the existing ones to be removed immediately. The Delhi government was responding to a plea which had contended that posters outside houses of Covid-19 patients was a serious infringement of the right to privacy, an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution. A two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad, directed the Delhi government to issue a circular, where the authorities are ordered not to circulate the names of Covid-19 patients, especially with members of Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) or other social media groups. Also read | West UP districts, NCR on alert after Covid-19 surge in Delhi“It is, however, directed that the respondent No.1/GNCTD shall issue a circular to all the Home Isolation Nodal Officers directing them not to share the personal details of the COVID-19 patients with their neighbours, or the Managing Committees of the RWAs of various localities,” the bench said.The direction came after the petitioner’s lawyer advocate Chinmoy Pradip Sharma drew the HC’s attention to the fact that the Delhi government did not pass any order or direction with regards to the circulation of name on the whatsapp groups of the various RWAs. The petitioner, Kush Kalra, a lawyer, had objected to the names of Covid-19 patients being freely circulated with members of RWAs and other social media groups, which he claimed “is leading to stigmatisation and drawing of unnecessary attention”. He urged that Covid-19 patients “ought to be given privacy to cope with and recover from the illness in peace and away from prying eyes”. On Tuesday, advocate Satyakam, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, informed the court that an email has been sent on October 7 to the Isolation State surveillance Unit, Delhi to all Home Isolation Nodal Officers directing that no posters shall be posted outside the residence of any home isolation patient and all the posters which are already posted outside the residence of home isolation patients must be removed immediately. He said that the Delhi government officials were not given any directions to share the names of Covid-19 patients with RWA members or any other person. The court disposed the plea, which had also sought other reliefs such as more aggressive testing mechanism in the national capital, use of indigenously developed kits, reformulating Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) advisory on conducting tests and validation of rapid antigen detection (RAD) test kits. The court said it is examining all these aspects in a separate plea. Kalra had cited that the Delhi government’s posters had led to a dip in Covid-19 tests in the national capital because of “public embarrassment and stigmatisation”. It had added: “It is because of these sound reasons that Punjab has rescinded its earlier decision of pasting posters outside Covid-19 patients’ house in a bid to mitigate the stigma attached to the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/posters-not-to-be-pasted-outside-homes-of-covid-19-patients-delhi-govt-tells-high-court/story-6sx6Xo369jF0rN1nahP8jJ.html

The complaint cited commission of a cognisable offence, they added.Nikhil Kapse, a senior inspector, has filed an affidavit in the court saying an Out Patient Department (OPD) prescription of Kumar and certain WhatsApp chats exchanged between Rajput and Priyanka Singh, were cited in the complaint. The affidavit said the complainant also produced an OPD registration bearing the actor’s name, room and queue number. It added Chakraborty alleged that Priyanka Singh had sent Rajput prescriptions of medicines containing psychotropic substances in violation of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, without any actual examination of the patient. The consumption of the psychotropic substances “may have caused and contributed to the suicidal death of the actor”, she alleged.Also read | Why is CBI silent on status of probe in Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, asks Maharashtra Congress“This version of the informant [Chakraborty] disclosed commission of cognisable offences, warranting investigation,” Kapse said in the affidavit justifying registration of a First Investigation Report (FIR).The affidavit was filed in reply to Priyanka and Meetu Singh’s plea seeking quashing of the FIR.In the plea filed through advocate Madhav Thorat, they claimed the medicines were not banned and Medical Council of India’s April 11 guidelines about telemedicine allowed “the medicines to be prescribed to a patient even at the first consultation”.“A bare perusal of the complaint along with the FIR shows that the statements made therein do not make out any cognisable offence,” the plea said. It called Chakraborty’s complaint nothing but a feeble attempt on her part to scuttle the investigations against her and blame Rajput’s family for his suicide as she was on the verge of being arrested.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing Rajput’s death, has backed the actor’s family and called Chakraborty’s allegations “mostly presumptive and speculative in nature”. It has said the FIR was “bad in law”.The CBI has said the Mumbai police ought not to have registered a second FIR over Rajput’s death. “It is settled law that two FIRs cannot be registered on the same cause of action,” the CBI said in an affidavit. “It is a fact that the CBI is already investigating the causes relating to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput...”Kapse has maintained their FIR was neither against the same accused persons nor was it based on the same version.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-obligated-to-register-case-against-late-actor-s-sisters-mumbai-police-tell-high-court/story-2OrCzjq1RqA9l1AwVND5II.html

In a letter dated October 15 to Maharashtra chief secretary, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) said the 102-acre land has been handed over also without following due procedure. The land was handed over to Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) after the state’s government decision to shift the shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg.The letter said MMRDA had sought transfer of land for Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli), but the matter was in process and DPIIT had also asked for a joint survey.“However, the transfer of land took place on Collector’s order before the joint survey materialised and the officials from MMRDA and DMRCL [Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited] started soil testing on the land,” the letter said. The DMRCL is executing Metro-6 on behalf of MMRDA.The letter said the collector and MMRDA’s “improper and unilateral action” has caused severe loss to DPIIT. “I would request you to take necessary steps and restrain MMRDA from taking any further steps and to direct the collector to withdraw the orders passed in this regard in order to protect the interests of the Government of India.”A Maharashtra government official said unless the Centre issues a statutory order, they might not have to stop the work. “However, with this letter, it is clear that there is a title dispute that needs to be resolved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-centre-objects-to-land-transfer-for-kanjurmarg-metro-car-shed-sans-its-approval/story-OIYRtZsZUMdkRZ6cCw7H4J.html

03-11-2020||Delhi||Dehi’s interstate bus terminals reopened, 1542 buses come on Day 1||As interstate bus services resumed in Delhi after more than seven months, the scene at the city’s two major bus terminals (ISBTs), at Kashmere Gate and Anand Vihar, were in stark contrast. While Kashmere Gate had mostly all Covid-19 safety mechanisms in place, the latter was in disarray.On Day 1, 542 interstate buses carrying over 20,000 passengers arrived in the Capital through the three ISBTs (the third of which is at Sarai Kale Khan) till 5.30 pm. Passengers arrived from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, with some returning to the city for work, and many others travelling to celebrate Diwali with their friends and family.The Kashmere Gate ISBT saw a fair rush in the morning, with long queues at the entry gate as passengers were thermally screened and frisked using contactless devices, while staff members sanitised luggage inside the premises. Yet, social distancing norms were often thrown to the wind as people would rush in a horde, jostling to either get entry to the terminal, collect their luggage or to buy a ticket. Despite a properly designed waiting area, people crowded the narrow bus bays, even while drivers waited patiently till all the seats were occupied.Kavalpreet Kaur, who arrived at Kashmere Gate ISBT from Punjab on Tuesday morning pointed out that the terminal did not have any Covid-19 testing centre or camp for those who voluntarily wanted to get themselves checked.“I travelled all night in a bus that was full of passengers. A Covid testing centre here would not just help me, but also the city administration to identify and quarantine those who have the infection,” she said.Apart from a few security guards at the entry gate, Kashmere Gate ISBT had absolutely no police officer, district official or civil defence volunteer to warn or prosecute violators of Covid-19 norms. The situation was much worse at the other two ISBTs, especially at Anand Vihar, which shares its border with Uttar Pradesh. On Tuesday, the Anand Vihar ISBT received 257 interstate buses, followed by 242 buses in Kashmere Gate and 43 buses at Sarai Kale Khan.Despite being host to the most passengers, the Anand Vihar ISBT was short of proper arrangements. Four people were deployed for screening and sanitisation, two of who were deployed to check the temperatures of only the driver and conductor, and two others who sanitised buses — mostly from the outside. The Anand Vihar terminal had no temperature screening facility for passengers or their luggage. It also did not have any sanitiser spray available for public-use. Female passengers, said they were especially hassled, saying the washroom was too dirty to use.Several also complained about passengers’ displaying a lack of hygiene.Yadunath Singh, and his family were boarding a bus from Anand Vihar ISBT, headed for his hometown in Ram Nagar, Uttarakhand, to celebrate Diwali.“I am fed up of people spitting here. This problem is peculiar to Anand Vihar ISBT. Don’t people know that Covid-19 spreads from droplets? There is not a single official to prosecute violators. While walking around the ISBT, most passengers had their masks either on their chin or hanging from their ears,” said an angry Singh.The testing centre, located between the bus terminal and Metro station, was not conducting any Covid-19 tests when HT visited the facility at 4pm. A district official deployed to oversee testing there said they wrapped up by 3.30pm. “We do 1,000-2,000 tests daily, most of which are performed using the rapid antigen method. The most RT-PCR tests we have conducted at this facility are around 300 on a single day. Very few have tested positive so far, but we immediately send those who do to the Covid Care Centre at Akshardham on an ambulance,” said an official deployed there. KK Dahiya, managing director of the Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (DTIDC) Limited that manages and operated all the ISBTs, said people are being de-boarded at the entry gate of the ISBTs, from where they are being allowed to leave for their respective destinations in the city. “There was no crowding observed on day one, as the number of buses allowed to enter the terminal has been slashed to 50% until November 15. Moreover, it was the first day, so fewer buses arrived. The number will gradually go up,” Dahiya said. Before the onset of the pandemic, the three ISBTs would witness a combined footfall of over 250,000 every day. On a daily basis, there were 3,500 trips of interstate buses and 2,000 trips of local buses.According to the SOP prepared by the Delhi government, interstate buses have to be sanitised by the respective depots of bus operators at the point of origin and before departure from the respective ISBT. The conductors or the drivers of interstate buses were also to submit a certificate issued by the respective depot of the bus being thoroughly sanitised, but only five such certificates of the 257 buses that arrived at Anand Vihar were submitted at the terminal. The story was same for the other two terminals as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-interstate-bus-terminals-reopened-145-buses-arrived-in-national-capital-till-9-30am/story-SEBbzNtufJoXxRnkiuijiI.html

03-11-2020||City||Maharashtra: In keeping with NGT orders, demolition of skywalk over heritage wetland begins||The Sindhudurg district administration in Maharashtra has complied with the orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which was issued in October, by starting the demolition of an illegal skywalk built by the state public works department (PWD) over Dhamapur Lake at Malvan, a 490-year-old heritage wetland.In a compliance affidavit filed on October 23 and received by applicants last week, the Sindhudurg district collector, K Manjulekshmi, told the NGT that a departmental enquiry had been initiated against the PWD authorities for neglecting previous decisions of the tribunal and failing to take remedial steps to destroy the skywalk.The Dhamapur Lake, an inland wetland and a permanent freshwater lake that is spread over 61.7 hectares (ha), was constructed in 1530 AD between villages Are and Katta in Sindhudurg district. The wetland has been recognised by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) among top 100 wetlands in the country that need ecosystem restoration.Also read | Centre notifies protected buffer around Maharashtra’s Radhanagari Wildlife SanctuaryThe NGT had been hearing a plea by Sindhudurg residents Dr. Harishchandra Purshottam Natu and Omkar Keni since 2017 alleging various encroachments and the construction of skywalk around Dhamapur Lake by the PWD authorities, which was leading to shrinking of the lake and causing environmental degradation.“Due to the lethargic and negligent attitude of the PWD in implementing NGT orders and collector Sindhudurg, the district administration proposed departmental enquiry against PWD authorities following which the state body has shown efforts in the removal of illegal structures,” read Manjulekshmi’s submission.The district administration had acted sincerely and made efforts in implementing NGT’s orders, he added.HT had reported on October 15 that NGT’s principal bench of Justice Sheo Kumar Singh and expert member Dr Satyawan Singh Gabryal directed the Sindhudurg district collector to ensure that an amount of Rs 1.5 crore is attached in the bank account of the PWD till the time it does not transfer the sum to the State Biodiversity Board to restore the heritage wetland.“The district treasury officer, Sindhudurg, has ordered ICICI Bank to attach an amount of Rs1.5 crore from the official account of the PWD Sawantwadi executive engineer. Accordingly, ICICI Bank marked a loan of Rs1.5 crore from the account,” read the compliance affidavit.NGT had also directed the district administration to take necessary steps to remove all obstructions and illegalities as far as construction work is concerned in violation of the Wetland Rules, 2017.The compliance affidavit said around 20% of the demolition work had been completed till October 23, including removal of flooring tiles of the skywalk, dismantling of the concrete slab and debris collected was disposed of 4 kilometres (km) away from the wetland.The collector refused to comment, as the matter was sub-judice.An official from the Sindhudurg district administration said around 50% of the skywalk demolition had been completed till Monday (see images), and the rest would be completed by mid-November. Environmentalists and petitioners before the NGT welcomed the steps taken by the district administration and hailed the bid to protect the heritage wetland.“In the next hearing, we are going to raise issues on plans of the district administration to spend the restoration amount (Rs1.5 crore) on Dhamapur Lake,” said Keni.He said that the lake was affected by sundry activities such as washing of clothes and immersion of idols. “We will suggest that reed beds should be constructed at the spillway of the wetland, which can facilitate activities such as washing of clothes and immersion of idols,” he said.There is also another challenge in ensuring that green cover around the wetland is protected. “An effective management plan is needed to protect salt-marsh wetland plants such as teevar and other red-listed rare flora species reported at the lake’s unique habitat,” Keni added.Win after 3-year-long battle to protect 500-year-old wetlandThe Dhamapur Lake, an inland wetland and a permanent freshwater lake, spread over about 61.7 ha was constructed in 1530 between villages Are and Katta in Sindhudurg district . The lake is surrounded by hills and dense plantations of mango, coconut and areca palm. The water body is a source of both drinking water and irrigation. The lake is one of the top 100 wetlands in the country identified by the MoEFCC for rapid restoration and improvement, and also a projected Ramsar site by the Maharashtra government. The wetland is a natural habitat of 193 and 247 floral and faunal species, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-in-keeping-with-ngt-orders-demolition-of-skywalk-over-heritage-wetland-begins/story-8p1pzN55WrgFw2ndBOw88H.html

On Monday, its case count reached 1,687,784 with 4,009 fresh cases, lowest since June 24, when the state had reported 3,890 cases.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said chances of a second wave in Maharashtra were low and the state machinery was prepared for a surge, following relaxations in restrictions and festivals like Diwali.“The state health department made a presentation during the cabinet meeting last week. The officials have said although a second wave is being witnessed in a few other countries, its chances in the state and even in India are low. Even if it is witnessed, the state administration is prepared for it. But people should follow Covid-19 protocol, especially during festivals. There are reports of second waves in France, Spain and other countries compelling the governments to impose a strict lockdown. We too will have to take due precautions,” he said. Tope said the state government was positive about reopening temples in the state after Diwali. “We are in favour of opening religious places, but the decision will be taken after closely monitoring the situation. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will take a call after Diwali by consulting our department,” he said.Meanwhile, the toll went up to 44,128 with 104 casualties reported on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-active-cases-in-maharashtra-drop-by-182-000-in-46-days/story-8BtPfHFoQWSxv1Ax008p1K.html
03-11-2020||City||Assam: Eye on next assembly elections, BJP, Congress focus on tea garden community’s vote||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition Congress in Assam are trying to outpace each other to woo the tea garden community, as the north-east’s most populous state readies for assembly polls due in March and April next year. On Sunday, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, his cabinet colleagues and members of the Assam legislative assembly (MLAs) from the ruling coalition launched the ceremonial construction of 119 model high schools in tea gardens across the state. Around Rs 1.20 crore will be spent on the construction of each school and the total cost is estimated to be Rs 142.50 crore to set up the schools, which are expected to improve academic excellence among children of tea garden workers. Also read | Assam resident dies in Mizoram police custody, CM Sonowal writes to Amit Shah“The tea community is an integral part of greater Assamese society and it has contributed immensely to the state’s socio-cultural development,” Sonowal said at a programme held at Mekipur tea garden in Sivasagar district in Upper Assam on Sunday. He blamed the erstwhile state governments of neglecting the community and listed the initiatives by the BJP-led government after the latter came to power for the first time in the state in 2016. The initiatives include money transfer to bank accounts of over 7.21 lakh tea garden workers, wage compensation to pregnant women associated with the industry, Rs 10,000 each to students who pass Grade X and Grade XII students, mobile phones to “sardars”, Rs 25,000 each to 34,000 youth to start their businesses etc. The opposition Congress, too, has started wooing the community, which was once considered its traditional vote bank. Jitendra Singh, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and the party’s newly appointed in-charge for Assam, landed at Dibrugarh in tea-rich upper Assam on Sunday for a seven-day visit. His visit coincided with CM Sonowal’s laying of foundation stones of schools for the tea garden community.Singh spent his first day interacting with leaders from the tea garden community, took part in their folk dances and even spent the night at the house of a tea garden worker. “My first interaction has been with tea garden workers because they are an important part of Assam’s identity. Their biggest concern is uniform minimum wages. While the state’s BJP government has been doling out money, it hasn’t done anything on this front. We promise to implement this initiative, if we are voted to power,” Singh told media persons. The tea garden community comprises several indigenous tribes, who were brought to Assam by the colonial Britishers from Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal over 150 years ago. The community makes up around 20% of Assam’s total population and about 1.1 million of them are employed in over 800 tea gardens in the state. Their votes are a decisive factor in many assembly seats in upper Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assam-eye-on-next-assembly-elections-bjp-congress-focus-on-tea-garden-community-s-vote/story-G9Ddvj0lhjfHnKqPeWzzRP.html

The new clause prohibits the “movement of any person in public place, public transport, private transport, work place or at any social, political, general function or gathering without properly covering his mouth and nose with face mask or face cover”. In a statement of the objective and reasons for introducing the bill, the government said health experts all over the world are of the opinion that use of mask can help control the spread of Covid-19 considerably and save the lives of millions of people. “The State Government is also of the view that wearing mask should be made mandatory in public place, public transport, private transport, work place or at any social, political, general function or gathering and decided to prohibit movement of persons without wearing mask at such places,” the statement said. The state had passed the Rajasthan Epidemic Diseases Act, 2020, in August this year. Section 4 of the Act allows the state government to issue an order to be observed by the public to prevent the spread of epidemic disease. An experiment conducted by researchers from Duke University in September found well-fitted valve-less N95 masks, triple-layer surgical masks and double-layer pleated cotton masks (that can be tied tightly) are the most effective in stopping the spread of Covid-19. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot earlier in the day tweeted that Rajasthan will be the first state in the country to enact a law making it mandatory to wear masks for protection against coronavirus infection. Rajasthan is already running a campaign called ‘no mask, no entry’ to make use of face masks compulsory to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The state has reported 200,495 cases of Covid-19 so far, with 15,889 active infections till Monday. As many as 1,926 people have succumbed to the viral disease in the state so far||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-passes-bill-to-make-masks-mandatory/story-Qy73eMnFf55Wq49HZOpW2H.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Eavesdropping at Pahadi Imli||There is no one to be seen. It is totally empty. And yet this is the same Old Delhi, that historic quarter, very picturesque—but usually so cramped and noisy. This neighbourhood is tucked upon old Delhi’s Pahadi Imli. There’s is no imli tree to spot but the pahadi, the hill, remains. One can perceive its height by the gradually rising walkway. A few steps ahead, the alley splays out into two by-lanes, going further up the hill. All passages around here are intermittently punctuated with stairs.This afternoon, despite being empty, the place is alive. The alleys are lined with private houses. The air is echoing with the voices of the (unseen) residents, coming through partially opened doors, windows, balconies and roofs. Indeed, there’s so much (hushed) cacophony of household sounds that you can almost see all the cries, scoldings, coughs, giggles—and pressure cooker whistles too—dancing together in the air in a great jumble.Even so, one can distinguish each sound and mull upon it to imagine the life in the house it is originating from.Here’s a woman’s rebuke coming from a window up in the heights. “Why are you screaming?! Close your eyes and let me run the soap on your face”—probably a mother bathing her child.A male voice is streaming out from an adjacent door: “Are you Nawab Fanney Khan that people will obey you?!”And somewhere someone is humming a mournful ditty to herself (or himself).There is absolutely no way of putting together these words and the mouths that utter them—which may not seem that odd in the days of face masks. Suddenly an elderly man steps out of a house—was he the one who mentioned Supreme Court some time ago? Eavesdropping on the lane doesn’t reveal anything sensational. The babble is as uneventful as in any family. But encountering a host of these homey phrases, pronounced simultaneously, gives an otherworldly texture to everyday utterances. Besides, they also draw an outsider closer to Pahadi Imli’s intimate life. Soon enough, you reach the last houses towards the top and you have to climb down back to the base camp—which is the Matia Mahal bazaar. Where it’s very noisy, and you can hear nothing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-eavesdropping-at-pahadi-imli/story-oq3Mr2pOBJ81SDWLXRqnVJ.html
03-11-2020||City||Punjab: Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Sandhu’s murder cracked, 8 held||Police on Monday said they have cracked the murder of Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu and arrested eight persons. Sandhu, who was felicitated for fighting terrorism in Punjab, was gunned down by two bike-borne masked men at his Bhikhiwind house on October 16. “We have cracked the case,” said Ferozepur Range deputy inspector general of police Hardiyal Singh Mann, who heads the special investigation team that was formed on chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh orders. Mann, however, refused to divulge the details, including motive of the crime. Police sources said a press briefing in connection with the case would be held on Tuesday. Those arrested are Sukhraj Singh alias Sukha, Ravinder Singh alias Gian and Rajbir Singh of Gurdaspur district, Ravinder Singh alias Ravi, Chand Kumar Bhatia, Akasdeep Singh and Ravi Kumar of Ludhiana, and Prabhdeep Singh of Kartarpur, Jalandhar. Gian had an old enmity with Sandhu’s son and he had given a contract to gangster to kill Sandhu, said police sources. A senior police official said, “Besides arresting eight accused, we have rounded up around six more persons. More arrests are expected in the coming days.” Police have also recovered the parts of Bajaj Pulsar motorcycle that was used for committing the crime from a canal. “The accused had dismantled the bike before throwing it into a canal in Harike. Two of the arrested accused used to work as mechanics,” said another official. “Though we have arrested the accused, our investigation is still on to ascertain their exact roles. It will be premature to disclose anything at this moment,” he said, adding that they are actively probing the “gangster angle”. Last week, Tarn Taran police had brought notorious gangster Jaggu Bhagwanpuria from Patiala jail on a four-day production warrant. Police officials said Bhagwanpuria was questioned in connection with Sandhu’s killing. Police had been probing the personal enmity angle in Sandhu’s killing as his sons were involved in criminal cases. Sandhu’s wife Jagdish Kaur, however, had termed the killing as “sheer act of terrorism.” She alleged that her husband’s security was withdrawn despite their complaints to police about threats to the family from pro-Khalistan elements. A senior police official, who didn’t wish to be named, ruled out any radical angle in the killing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-shaurya-chakra-awardee-balwinder-sandhu-s-murder-cracked-8-held/story-xiAmHQthz2MTZowsLW7NXN.html

03-11-2020||City||Will jail Dharamsot for scholarship scam if voted to power: Sukhbir||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) led by president Sukhbir Singh Badal protested against the state government against its alleged inaction against cabinet minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot. “Dharamsot should be sacked, arrested and jailed for embezzlement of Rs 64 crore from the Scheduled Caste scholarship scheme. This is injustice with dalit students,” alleged Sukhbir, adding that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh must disclose why he was shielding the corrupt minister.Addressing the gathering, Sukhbir said, “If we form the government after the next assembly elections, a probe will be launched and Dharamsot will be put be behind bars within three months.”He alleged that Dharamsot’s co-conspirator and welfare department director-turned-Congress legislator Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal was successful in securing a Congress ticket for himself immediately after taking premature retirement last year, bypassing other contenders from Phagwara.“Dharamsot was responsible for the entire fraud as he had directed officials that all files relating to disbursement of funds should be put up before him,” he said.“Congress MLAs are running liquor, sand and drug mafias. Even then, the CM is oblivious to the situation and remains cut off from people,” he claimed. Former minister Bikram Singh Majithia said instead of trying to befool Punjabis with new promises, the Congress government should explain why it made budgetary provisions of Rs 2,440 crore for the SC scholarship scheme over the three years, but did not release even one paisa. “A CBI probe is needed to ascertain the real scope of the SC scholarship scam as the Punjab government has said only Rs 7 crore that had been given wrongfully to private institutions,” Majithia claimed, alleging that Dharamsot had even indulged in corrupt practices, while purchasing land in Nurpur Bedi. Senior leader Prem Singh Chandumajra sought the immediate sacking and arrest of Dharamsot, adding that the CM should not protect someone who had destroyed the future of lakhs of dalit students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-jail-dharamsot-for-scholarship-scam-if-voted-to-power-sukhbir/story-G8cvsMdutt9Ohy4LFDWKdO.html

03-11-2020||Delhi||Winter chill is here: Delhi records 10.8 degrees Celsius||The mercury fell to 10.8 degrees Celsius on Monday morning, over four degrees below normal, as the Capital continued to stay sharp and chilly before the onset of winter, leaving weather scientists intrigued by how early the minimum temperature has started dropping this year. The temperatures are unusually low for this time of the year, according to data from the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Regional Meteorological Centre. At least in the past 10 years, the temperature in the first two days of November ranged between 15 and 17 degrees Celsius, and the “normal” minimum temperature from November 2 to 6 is 14.9 degrees Celsius. Normal temperatures are assessed based on average maximum and minimum temperature for 30 years.“We usually start recording 10 to 11 degrees Celsius in the last week of November, or at least after November 20. This year it’s a fortnight early. It’s very unusual. This is possibly both because of early onset of cold and snowfall in higher reaches of Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh for the last two days. There was also snowfall in Lahaul and Spiti today,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre. The minimum temperature is likely to range between 10 and 12 degrees Celsius for the next three to four days, the RMC scientists said. The minimum temperature in Gurugram on Monday fell to 10.2°C, while it dropped to 10.8°C in Faridabad. Data for Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad was not updated on the day.This October was the coldest Delhi has experienced in 58 years, IMD had said on Saturday. “Climatologically we are moving towards winter, so temperature will gradually fall but there is also subsidence of air over the Delhi-NCR region which is bringing down minimum temperatures. There are cold northerly winds also but they are not as strong,” explained M Mohapatra, director general, IMD. Subsidence, Mohapatra said, is the downward movement of cold and dry air closer to the surface. IMD considers December, January and February to be winter months. Delhi’s air quality improved marginally on Monday from “very poor” category to “poor” with the air quality index (AQI) at 293.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/winter-chill-is-here-delhi-records-10-8-degrees-celsius/story-ePG3k5XoGHpOhNze1cZszH.html
03-11-2020||Chandigarh||Expand Covid contact tracing to 15 persons, make RT-PCR rule: Capt||Despite a decline in Covid cases in the state, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday ordered expanding the contact tracing of positive patients to 15 persons and made it mandatory for hospitals and radiology labs conducting CT scans to report such persons to the state administration in case of suspicion of coronavirus.CM made this announcement as part of a slew of measures to strengthen the Covid management systems amid the apprehension of a second wave.To streamline and prioritise the process of Covid vaccination, the CM ordered a state-level 3-tier vaccine supervision mechanism, comprising a steering committee as well as state and district task force, to be put in place.In sharp contrast to some other states that are depending heavily on the less reliable Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT), Amarinder directed the health department to make RT-PCR the rule, with RAT to be treated as exception, while ordering another serosurvey to assess the ground situation.In other steps, he directed 24x7 testing facility to be made available at district hospitals, all fever/other symptomatic cases and those attending the flu corners to be tested with RT-PCR.The CM asked the health department to get information from private and public hospitals regarding Covid mortality and complete the audit by November 9 so that remedial action can be taken by mid-November.Amarinder was chairing a virtual meeting of medical and health experts and officials.Noting that people were now relying on CT scans in a big way instead of getting themselves tested for Covid, the CM directed the health department to make sharing of information regarding those coming for CT scans with the health authorities.The state government’s health expert committee head, Dr KK Talwar, earlier said unless checked, the practice of patients confining themselves to CT scans could be dangerous for the state.To ensure that distribution of the vaccine, once available, is prioritised among the vulnerable groups, including health workers and people with comorbidities, Amarinder ordered the constitution of a state steering committee, to be headed by the chief secretary, with monthly meetings to supervise the progress.The state head has asked the concerned departments to dedicate the month of November to carry out testing of all staff, including health, police, revenue and other civilian staff. He said his government had already sanctioned approximately Rs 900 crore for Covid response and added that funds will not be allowed to become a constraint for ensuring full preparation and best response. He directed the health department to increase testing to 30,000 a day, with at least 100 tests per lakh population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/expand-covid-contact-tracing-to-15-persons-make-rt-pcr-rule-capt/story-UKIU6BMr9r9TLC4LUchmjP.html

The woman, Jaishree Barkya Pawar, 26, had delivered two premature babies at Kasa government hospital on October 6 and was later shifted to Cottage Hospital in Dahanu on October 10. Pawar went missing hours after she was shifted to Cottage Hospital, said senior inspector Appasaheb Lengare of Jawhar police. She had allegedly sent her husband away to purchase water and then ran away from the hospital. A search was launched by her husband, Barkya, and relatives, but later her husband filed a missing report with us, said Lengare. Meanwhile, one of the twin girls died a few days later and the other was receiving treatment at the hospital.“On Friday, we were informed about a decomposed body hanging from a tree in the jungle. Pawar’s husband identified the body based on the mangalsutra and the saree,” said Lengare. No suicide note was found. The police have sent the body for post-mortem and are awaiting the report. A case of accidental death report has been registered. “It seems to be a case of suicide as she was found hanging. Pawar was allegedly depressed after learning that the newborns were not in good health as they were born premature, but we are investigating all possible angles,” said Lengare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/missing-tribal-woman-s-body-found-hanging-in-palghar-jungle-after-20-days/story-g35mcphmjgAbe697peZ7AJ.html

We had to go for a vascular intervention. It lasted for about an hour. For all certainty, it (the bleeding) will not happen again. Now we would be in a better position to manage the overall situation. There should not be any drop of haemoglobin or platelets or any derangement in the physiology,” Dr Arindam Kar, head of the team of doctors treating Chatterjee, said around 10 pm on Monday. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award winner was admitted on October 6 after he tested positive for Covid-19. Chatterjee tested negative for Covid-19 on October 14 but his neurological system was affected by Covid encephalopathy. As a result, Chatterjee’s condition deteriorated drastically over the past week. The noted actor has been in a drowsy state since last Monday. “In the coming two or three days we will try to recover the ground that had been disturbed and correct most of the things. Once all the organ functions start recovering we will focus on making his consciousness improve by some way or the other,” said Dr Kar. Also read: 19 Indians test Covid positive on Vande Bharat flight to Wuhan, China“This could be a good news for him but once again I am reiterating the fact that having been inside a hospital Intensive Care Unit for 26 days with a prolonged period of unconsciousness or reduced consciousness with life support, it would be difficult for an octogenarian person to have a very favourable outcome. But he is putting up a valiant fight,” Dr Kar added. “We have rarely seen someone with such a good physiology. We really hope that if the consciousness level returns he still has the vigour, energy and same organ functions,” Dr Kar added. Millions of people in Bengal and beyond have been praying for Chatterjee’s recovery ever since he was admitted. In a bid to offer a holistic treatment, the doctors initially made Chatterjee listen to music and literature of his choice. He even communicated with his daughter Poulomi Basu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/veteran-actor-soumitra-chatterjee-undergoes-vascular-surgery-internal-bleeding-stopped/story-fRMC9c9ZGhrsBoqsHVc3MI.html

03-11-2020||City||Stubble burning: PPCB has collected only 2.5% of fine imposed in 2019||With the number of cases of stubble burning in the state seeing a 33% rise this year, one of the reasons could be the poor enforcement of punitive measures. Of the fine of Rs 6 crore imposed on farmers for stubble burning in 2019, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has collected only Rs 15 lakh (2.5%) to date. In 2019, 450 First-Information Reports (FIRs) had been lodged, even as the number of cases of stubble burning touched 52,000. This season, only 20 FIRs have been registered, even as the number of cases is over 33,000.Board member secretary Krunesh Garg said, “Only 15 lakh of the Rs 6 crore fine imposed last year has been recovered. An application has been filed before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to find ways to collect the pending penalty. This year, we have imposed a fine of about Rs 1.25 crore in 4,672 incidents of stubble burning. In another, 3,269 spots, we are yet to find ownership details. Once owners are identified, fine will be imposed here as well.”The board claims that early harvesting of paddy has led to the increase in number of stubble burning incidents. Krunesh added, “Last year, 22,503 incidents of stubble burning were witnessed till October 31; the number this year in the corresponding time period is 33,165. Early harvesting of paddy is the main reason. The state had procured 114 lakh tonne paddy till October 31 in 2019, against 148 lakh tonne this year. It suggests 30% increase in early harvesting. We hope that by the end of the procurement, we will have some improvement in cases of stubble burning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stubble-burning-ppcb-has-collected-only-2-5-of-fine-imposed-in-2019/story-2O9zBWPoz277oQ8cwDgk2L.html
03-11-2020||Mumbai||Stringent medical checks needed before issuing driving licenses, say experts||With India accounting for the most road deaths globally in 2018 and 2019, one area of concern is the medical condition of those applying for driving licences. Two recent accidents in the city have highlighted the problem of driving licenses being issued to drivers with medical conditions that make them accident-prone.On August 31, Sameer Ali Sayyed, 46, drove his Maruti Suzuki Esteem into a restaurant on Carnac Bunder Street in South Mumbai, killing five and injuring three people. Sayyed had lost control of his vehicle because of an epileptic attack. Three months ago, in May, Sayyed had been in another accident when he had again lost control of his car and crashed into another vehicle, injuring one person. At the time, Sayyed had not revealed his epilepsy to avoid his license being suspended. On October 20, bus driver Haridas Patil suffered a heart attack while he driving a Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) bus. He crashed into a signal near Chembur and damaged a small vegetable shop. Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, additional director general of state highway police, Maharashtra, said, “Although accidents due to unfit medical conditions of the driver may comprise a small portion in overall road accidents numbers, it’s a serious issue. Unfit medical conditions impact drivers physically as well mentally, and may [indirectly] contribute to circumstances that lead to accidents.”India ranked first in road accident deaths across 199 countries in a 2018 report by World Road Statistics, followed by China and the United States of America. A report in the same year by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that 11% of all accident-related deaths globally were in India. According to a 2019 report by the ministry of road transport and highways, there were 4,49,002 road accidents last year in India and 1,51,113 people were victims of road deaths.The Motor Vehicles (Driving) Regulations, 2017, require that at the time of driving, a driver “is in full control of his physical and mental abilities and physically and mentally fully fit to drive a vehicle”. Existing rules require applicants to compulsorily submit a self-declaration to prove they are of sound mind and physical fitness when being evaluated for a driving license for non-commercial vehicles. Only those above 50 years must submit a medical certificate. Drivers of commercial or transport vehicles need to submit a medical certificate. A senior transport official said on the condition of anonymity said that the existing procedure to check a driver’s medical fitness is ineffective. “After getting the license, a driver undergoes a medical examination for fitness only after five years, when renewing their license. What if he develops any serious medical condition in between?” said the officer. Experts also pointed out that the regional transport office (RTO) does not inspect these documents rigorously and false certificates are easily supplied by agents working outside RTOs.Vinayak Joshi, an expert in defensive driving, said, “Driving license seekers in Mumbai can easily get a medical certificate from a ‘doctor’ practising right outside the RTO office for just ₹50. Because of such unprofessional, unethical and corrupt practices, there is no strict scrutiny as far as the medical fitness of the applicant is concerned.”Sanjay Sasane, deputy regional transport officer, Pune, said RTO officers should not be expected to evaluate an applicant’s physical or mental condition. “Only medical professionals would be able to asses it,” he said. Former director general of Maharashtra Police, Dr PS Pasricha, said the government should form a team to study the rules regarding assessing the fitness of a driver. “There should be legal obligation on doctors to report unfit medical conditions of a driver to the RTO as a preventive measure, but then the matter of breach of privacy would arise. The issue needs some brainstorming to think of a solution.” General practitioners (GP) in countries like Denmark, Finland, the United Kingdom, Norway, Poland, Portugal and Sweden are required to report at-risk drivers to the authorities.“The road safety system in our country has always been affected by a very casual approach. There are some sections in the existing road transport laws and rules which need to be seriously looked at and medical fitness certification is one of them,” said Pasricha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/stringent-medical-checks-needed-before-issuing-driving-licenses-say-experts/story-OcG73AkfqsIClAiNB2UJTP.html

In separate emails sent to both bodies on Monday, students and parents have demanded that the admission schedule along with a brochure and seat matrix for the upcoming academic year be shared at the earliest.“The Centre’s medical counselling committee (MCC) recently clarified that the admissions process for UG medical and dental seats should begin across states on November 6, and if the state has to follow this, students need to be made aware of basic details including the schedule,” said Sudha Shenoy, parent and activist. She added that with no information on admissions released in over two weeks since the announcement of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET UG) results, anxiety and stress levels among students is very high.In their letter, parents and medical aspirants have highlighted that the admission process in the state needs to start by November 6 as prescribed by the Centre, so that students who bag a seat in the all-India quota (AIQ) are not deprived of trying their luck on state quota seats as well.“Many students opt for admissions in an institute outside Maharashtra in the AIQ round and later withdraw admissions as per the provision and confirm seat in a state institute of their liking. This year, AIQ admission is already underway but there’s no information yet on when the same will start in the state,” said Archit Kumar, a medical aspirant.Earlier in September, the state government announced their decision to abolish the 70:30 regional quota in medical admission that reserved 70% seats for those from the region. However, this decision of the government was challenged by a student from Vidarbha. The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court has put a stay in medical admissions until November 10. “Admissions could begin after November 10, but the pre-admission process of registration and document verification is a long process, so the state needs to start the process. This will help calm nerves of lakhs of medical and dental aspirants,” added Shenoy.While a DMER spokesperson said that a schedule for undergraduate medical admissions has already been approved, the state CET cell confirmed that the schedule should be released soon.At present, the state CET cell is yet to release any information on the admissions process. Parents are also planning to approach the Bombay high court if the state fails to start admissions by November 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/medical-dental-aspirants-from-maharashtra-seek-clarity-on-admission-process/story-kXYesD8JtHa4rTpFsd1lDM.html
03-11-2020||Chandigarh||BJP misleading farmers through shocking lies, say Punjab ministers||Punjab cabinet ministers on Monday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and labelled its allegation that the state government and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh as responsible for the continued farmer protests and suspension of the goods trains as atrocious and a bunch of shocking lies. “The BJP leadership in state is misleading farmers and spreading shocking lies to save their skin, after being cornered on the Centre’s draconian farm laws,” the 16 ministers said. The ministers claimed that the saffron party, which was at the centre of the ill-conceived farm laws, was either oblivious to the concerns of the farmers or simply did not care. “The farmers don’t need any instigation. They are hurt and shocked at the treatment being meted out to them by the BJP-led central government. They are fighting to save their livelihood and to survive. Clearly, Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma, like other BJP leaders, has no realisation of this,” they said. Punjab’s industry, agriculture and the economy that has been severely impacted by the Centre’s failure to release the state’s dues amid Covid-19, was further being weakened as a result of the suspension of goods trains, the ministers added.Responding to Sharma’s allegation of Amarinder failing to maintain law and order in the state, the minister suggested he should go and speak to people, who had seen first-hand under the SAD-BJP regime what failure of law and order meant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bjp-misleading-farmers-through-shocking-lies-say-punjab-ministers/story-sV9OOdi7u7upi8CMLf80wK.html
03-11-2020||Mumbai||BMC plans ₹3.61-crore viewing deck at Mumbai’s Chaityabhoomi||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to construct a viewing deck extending over the Dadar seashore at Chaityabhoomi, the cremation site of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. The civic body plans to build the elevated platform over a non-functioning stormwater drain (SWD) outfall. The elevation of the deck will be 16 feet above sea level and will allow visitors to enjoy sunset views. According to the BMC’s plan, the structure will be spread across 1, 500sqm. The estimated cost of the project is ₹3.61 crore, and tenders for the same were floated on Monday. The plan includes building ramps on the deck to provide accessibility to the differently-abled and senior citizens. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G-North ward (Dadar), said, “The SWD outfall is redundant, and there are many visitors who climb on it to take selfies or photos of the Bandra-Worli sea link. We decided to strengthen the drain outfall area and construct this deck as a tourist attraction. All necessary coastal permissions have been sought for this project.” The existing SWD outfall earlier functioned to drain the water from mills in Dadar area. Since most of the mills have shut down, the outfall has been non-functional.Dighavkar said that the height of the elevation was decided based on the height of the highest tide in the past 10 years. Another senior civic official said, “Electric lamp posts will be installed, which will be similar in style to the proposed railing on the deck. Since the deck will be over the SWD outfall, covering it completely, the drain will be protected from any further damage. All coastal norms are being followed.”Activists, however, are sceptical that the project will make headway. Nikhil Desai, citizen activist from Matunga, said, “We keep hearing about such attractive projects, but very less is implemented on the ground. Authorities had also planned the Mumbai Eye, a giant Ferris-wheel on the lines of the London Eye, but nothing has been implemented so far. One can only say something about such projects after they have been implemented.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-plans-3-61-crore-viewing-deck-at-mumbai-s-chaityabhoomi/story-cdbL5aAr1NFaIGPVzLioyH.html

The authority wants to carry out a total of 19 maintenance works related with the horticulture department, officials said.The authority has already sanctioned the amount for maintenance of green space on 130-metre wide road near sector Knowledge Park-V, maintenance of green space in sector Zu-2, park in Udyog Kendra, maintenance of green belt in sector Omicron 1A, green belt maintenance in sectors 1, 4 and Sigma 2, among others.“The authority floated the tender for these works in October to select an agency or a contractor that will take care of the maintenance of parks, green belts and other green areas across the city. We are likely to hire the agency by end of November to start the work at the ground,” said Deep Chandar, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.The authority had awarded 10 works related with horticulture department with a budget of ₹24 crore last month. The authority’s chief executive officer has also directed the staff to make sure that all contractors, who work for these projects, must display their names, mobile numbers and other details on a board to be put at the park, green belt or other site, where the particular work has been done.“This is to be done to give an opportunity to residents to know who has done the maintenance of green belt, park or other green areas. If not satisfied with the maintenance work, then they can complain and get the issue resolved,” said Chandar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-to-hire-contractor-for-13-crore-horticulture-work-by-nov-end/story-AuTsnM65s6a38NgLf8VS0J.html
03-11-2020||Noida||Create wetland in six months to clean Kondli drain: CPCB tells UP||NOIDA: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has asked the Uttar Pradesh irrigation department to create a wetland in six months to clean waste water of Kondli drain, one of the major sources of pollution of river Yamuna in Delhi-NCR.The irrigation department in August this year had proposed to create six wetlands at different sites of the 17.1km drain that cuts Noida into two parts and finally merges with Yamuna at Sector 168. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) in February had ordered in-situ treatment of the drain jointly by the UP irrigation department and the Noida authority. The green tribunal had passed the order after the CPCB suggested that such a treatment can clean the waste water of this drain that is also polluting the groundwater in the city.“In continuation to NGT order, the UP irrigation department said that it wants to create six wetlands to clean waste water of the drain. We have asked the department that first, as a pilot project, they should create one wetland in six months. If this works out well, then it can work on remaining five wetlands too,” said Vishal Gandhi, scientist with CPCB.The irrigation department said that it will issue a tender to start work on this project soon. “We have discussed the plan with the Noida authority after CPCB instructions. As a pilot project, we have decided to develop the first wetland near Sector 50 at this drain to clean waste water. We will implement the NGT order and work as per the directions in this regard. The tender will be issued at the earliest after completion of formalities,” said Davendra Thakur, executive engineer of UP irrigation department.The Noida authority has already sanctioned ₹6.5 crore for this project. “We will fund this project and the irrigation department will be executing the same,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority. However, the authority may have to increase the budget for this project because CPCB has suggested some changes in the proposal submitted by the irrigation department.CPCB has suggested that while creating a wetland, the irrigation department must keep in mind some things like organic loading of drain, hydraulic retention and monsoon period, among other ecological issues.Residents have been demanding that the drain should be cleaned as it causes pollution in many residential areas that include sectors 11, 12, 22, 23, 23, 33, 34, 35, 50, 51, 77, 78, 137 and 168, among others. In November 2018, a petition was filed in NGT in this regard. “CPCB has further suggested removal of deposited silt in space between gabions. We hope that once this plan is implemented, the waste water of this drain will be cleaned. It will make major impact on the ecology of Noida as the unclean drain is also polluted the groundwater,” said Abhisht Gupta, petitioner in this case and a resident of Sector 137. The 20km-long Kondli drain originates from Kondli village in Delhi and enters Noida (via Ghaziabad) near Hari Darshan police post in Sector 11. After travelling in Noida for about 17km through sectors 11, 12, 22, 50, 92 and 168, it empties into the Yamuna near Chak Mangrola in Sector 168.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/create-wetland-in-six-months-to-clean-kondli-drain-cpcb-tells-up/story-bjEHWVPPbpgbJY6MQQVuaM.html
03-11-2020||Noida||With rise in wind speed, Noida, Ghaziabad see decline in pollution levels||Ghaziabad: Monday gave the residents of Gautam Budh Nagar a breather from the heavily polluted days the district has been experiencing since more than a week, with the air quality coming down slightly due to the dispersal of pollutants.Weather experts attributed the dispersal to wind speeds picking up, which they said is likely to stay till November 4.According Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s data, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida was 299 on Monday, just about enough to make it to the “poor” category, however, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad were at 310 and 355 on Monday, respectively, still inside the “very poor”. While Noida and Greater Noida’s AQI on Monday was the lowest the two cities have seen in the past 11 days, Ghaziabad’s AQI on Monday was its lowest in past six days; on October 23, Noida and Greater Noida were at 369 and 381 on the AQI scale, respectively, while Ghaziabad, on October 28 was at 317 on the AQI scale. Noida’s AQI on Sunday had reached the upper echelons of the “very poor” category with a reading of 384.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. “The average wind speed on Monday stood in the range of 12-15 kmph and helped in speedier dispersal of pollutants. Wind speed is likely to remain the same for the next two days, until November 4,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi. Meanwhile the Sanjay Nagar monitoring station is proving to be a challenge for Ghaziabad authorities, which remained under the “severe” category on Monday as well as Sunday. Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that this could be the result of scant water sprinkling nearby.“The “severe” AQI level could be the result of inadequate water sprinkling on Sunday at pollution sources near the monitoring station. We have observed that AQI deteriorated during the peak hour timings when there is a rush of vehicles owing to the festive season. This could be one of the reasons for the deterioration,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB. “On the other hand, water sprinkling activities have also been intensified at the Loni monitoring station, where the AQI came down to the “very poor” category on Monday, as compared to the “severe” category on Sunday,” he added.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), a private weather forecasting agency, in a bulletin Monday said that improved wind conditions led to better ventilation during the night, which was so far limited to the day time.“A marginal deterioration is forecasted for November 3 and 4 towards the middle of the “very poor” category. However, the Safar synergised stubble fire counts over Punjab, Haryana, UP, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas impacting Delhi air stood at 3,045 yesterday (Sunday). The stubble burning share in PM 2.5 has significantly decreased and is estimated as 16% for today (Monday),” the Safar forecast added. On Sunday, the contribution of stubble-burning to PM2.5 levels in the Delhi region this season’s high of 40% but declined to 16% on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-rise-in-wind-speed-noida-ghaziabad-see-decline-in-pollution-levels/story-05PzgN4CFviAbOWVttcPOM.html
03-11-2020||Noida||43 big construction sites install CCTV cameras for real-time monitoring in Noida and Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: At least 24 major construction sites in Ghaziabad and 19 in Noida have installed CCTV cameras on their premises for real-time monitoring by the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). The measure has been taken up on directions of UPPCB for the 16 non-attainment cities in the state which have high levels of air pollution. The state pollution board had issued directions in September, asking big construction sites, having area of 20,000 square metres and above, to install CCTV cameras on their premises. Following the directions, 24 of 34 big construction sites in Ghaziabad have installed cameras and also handed over the control to the UPPCB’s regional office. In Noida, 19 such sites were identified and officials said that the work for handing over their control will be completed within this week as all the 19 sites have installed the cameras.“We have now received control of 24 sites in Ghaziabad. Of the rest 10, seven are shut at present while we have recommended penalty for one site where the cameras were not installed. Two other sites have been issued notices for three days after which we may recommend penalty if they fail to provide us control,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB at Ghaziabad. Apart from the construction sites, UPPCB had also directed all the air polluting units to install cameras facing their chimneys and provide their control to the regional officer. “Initially, the directions were given by us at local level, but later in October, the state pollution board gave directions for all polluting units to install cameras in 16 non-attainment cities. Since the directions were received late and the state board had given deadline of October 15, we have asked the units to get the work completed within this week. Else, we will recommend penalties against them. The units, which are shut at present, will also have to install cameras before they open up,” Sharma added. According to the officials, the Ghaziabad district has presence of about 290 air polluting units which use fuel such as wood and coal, and need to install cameras facing their chimneys so that emission can be monitored real-time during day or night. Most of the construction sites have installed cameras near the place of storage of construction material and the area where loading and unloading of construction material from vehicles is taken up. In Noida, the officials said that all the major construction sites have installed the cameras. “All sites have installed the cameras. We have only two air polluting units, of which one is shut. The other unit has installed the cameras,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB at Noida. This is for the first time that UPPCB has given such directions for construction sites and air polluting units in order to keep an eye on emission. “This activity was long due. Now, it will prove helpful when it comes to monitoring and will also act as a deterrent. However, the controls of cameras should be placed under a dedicated 24x7 control room which should be monitored by dedicated staff and should also have fixed numbers for residents to lodge pollution related complaints,” said Akash Vashishtha, a Ghaziabad-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/43-big-construction-sites-install-cctv-cameras-for-real-time-monitoring-in-noida-and-ghaziabad/story-g61gerg3Kvh2oeep4cj6gL.html
03-11-2020||Mumbai||‘Discovery of new species from Mumbai’s Aarey Colony pushes need to protect entire green lung as forest’||One new animal species was discovered and a new record of one has been documented from the city’s recently designated forest area in Aarey Colony, Goregaon, while 17 other new species and records have been identified from Maharashtra in 2019, according to the ‘Animal Discoveries 2019’ annual report by the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), under the Union environment ministry. Experts said the new species discoveries encouraged the state’s recent decision to declare Aarey a forest. Not just last year, but the 1,287-hectare (ha) green lung had witnessed six new discoveries and another five rediscoveries of spiders, scorpions and geckos over 10 years. Each of these discoveries has been published annually by ZSI.“The recent designation of Aarey as a forest is important as the commitment made to ensure the natural vegetation of any area remains protected automatically develops a network for the safety of the area’s biodiversity and livelihood. We expect more discoveries from this green lung in coming years,” said Kailash Chandra, director, ZSI.Around 25% of Aarey or 328.9 hectares was last month declared as a reserved forest by the Maharashtra government. The area will soon be made part of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) by the state. In 2019, a new species of jumping spider was discovered, identified as Jerzego sunillimaye. This was the first ever species of genus Jerzego, whose taxonomic details, mating behaviour, and egg development were documented. However, this was the fourth species under this genus in the world and second from India. The species was named to honour senior Maharashtra forest officer Sunil Limaye. The ZSI 2019 report also showed a new record from Aarey of an insect species (heptacarus neotropicus), originally described from France and recorded from Aarey last year. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, who led the move to declare Aarey a forest, said, “It is undoubtedly exciting that even in 2020 as we think we know everything about our environment, and we deal with a pandemic, we have so many species being newly described. These findings only tell us how less we still know about our own planet and nature. The good news is that the present Maharashtra government is pro-environment, working on sustainable development and we are committed to the cause.”Aarey has been identified to have the fourth-highest butterfly species diversity along the Western Ghats and in Maharashtra. Combined with this, a checklist of 48 species of reptiles and 12 amphibian species was collated by wildlife biologists and researchers — Zeeshan Mirza and Rajesh Sanap — to highlight the importance of Aarey’s biodiversity.The group had presented their records in 2019 in their attempt to save the green lung from proposed development.“Declaring Aarey a forest was crucial as in such ecosystems, every single component is essential right from a leopard to something as small as a spider or an insect,” said Sanap adding, “When the land is protected, these species are protected too, which gives us [as researchers] opportunities to keep working. Such policies will ensure that we are tackling environmental issues in a right way and that we put our environment above all else for our own benefit.”Researcher at National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru Mirza said, “Saving an area as a forest in a place like Mumbai where the value of every square metre is so high and precious, is commendable. However, forest declaration is just the first step.There are specific conservation measures needed such as developing a nature interpretation centre, allowing focused accessibility, and involving locals through employment for eco-tourism to ensure this area remains protected.”Last month, the Maharashtra government also decided to move the Metro-3 car shed out of Aarey and shift it to Kanjurmarg. However, the fate of other projects such as the 32-storey Metro Bhavan, a slum rehabilitation project for SGNP encroachers across 90-acres, and the plan for a ramp (for Metro-3 connecting the underground metro to overhead Metro 6) are all yet to be decided by the state. “Discoveries at Aarey have not happened randomly. It is a natural process, which has taken millions of years for the coming up of this forest. Cutting trees and acquiring spaces for construction projects at this green lung followed by compensatory afforestation was always a cosmetic idea. Destroying biodiversity does not take much time but restoring it takes a lifetime,” said noted herpetologist Varad Giri, after whom a new gecko species (Giri’s geckoella) described to science was discovered from Aarey in 2016.Meanwhile, new species of geckos, frogs, spiders, and new records of insects and crabs were the highlights for Maharashtra in 2019, according to ZSI’s report. “Researchers from Maharashtra have been working hard and the state has been annually recording over 15 new species or records, which shows the abundant biodiversity in the state,” said Chandra.Wildlife researcher Tejas Thackeray, younger son of CM Uddhav Thackeray, said Maharashtra was emerging as a state where greener alternatives were being scouted for and implemented swiftly, such as shifting the Metro car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg, and most importantly declaring Aarey a protected area, forming a rich green patch even beyond the limits of SGNP.“As a naturalist, it gives me immense joy in seeing the state government take bold decisions, where conservation of wildlife and the environment is consistently prioritised without hampering the development that citizens need and deserve in a rapidly developing city and state,” said Thackeray, adding that for Aarey, it was simply about protecting a patch of land in the middle of a city like Mumbai, where a wide plethora of biodiversity already exists, known for prolifically producing new species annually. “With jerzego sunillimaye, a pretty tiny jumping spider being the latest addition, no other city will have such a long list of species in the world. Sampling and surveys across multi-taxas will surely reveal many more cryptic undescribed species. But for now, what makes me happy is that Luna, the stunning female leopard in Aarey, along with her cubs and all the tiny scorpions, spiders and geckos are safe,” said Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/discovery-of-new-species-from-mumbai-s-aarey-colony-pushes-need-to-protect-entire-green-lung-as-forest/story-gBQfy0Nd1KA9GiW4yAgejK.html

The incident took place around 10.30am when the victim, identified as Prashant Bhargava, completed several of his collections and was travelling on a motorcycle on railway road near Raj Nagar which has less movement of commuters, the police said, adding that an FIR was registered in the case at Kavi Nagar police station. Bhargava said that he had collected cash from several locations like Ghookhna, Sihani and Islam Nagar, among others, and went to the market at Sector 7 in Raj Nagar. “While coming from the market near the railway road in Raj Nagar, two men on a bike tried to snatch my bag after cornering me. The incident took place at a secluded spot and there were no commuters around. I resisted their attempt, but soon one of them snatched keys of my bike and the other pulled out a gun and pointed it towards me,” he said. “Once I saw the gun, I decided not to resist as they could have opened fire. In total, they took away ₹1.3 lakh in cash which was in the bag and also took away the keys of my bike,” Bhargava added. He said that he left his house at Golf Links high-rise around 9am and went to the market for cash collection and deposit. The police said that they have formed teams to track the suspects and also scanning CCTV cameras to get clues about the incident. “We have registered an FIR under IPC section 392 (robbery). Teams are investigating the case. The victim has given a complaint and mentioned that about ₹1.3 lakh was taken away,” said Nagendra Chaubey, SHO of Kavi Nagar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-armed-bikers-loot-1-3-lakh-from-collection-agent/story-ybPPWDKAQbUKd7TEWN1PhI.html

03-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Sion Hospital to start phase-3 trials of first indigenous Covid vaccine||The Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion Hospital, will soon start phase-3 clinical trials of India’s indigenous Covid-19 vaccine—COVAXINTM. As many as 1,000 volunteers between the age of 18 and 60 years will participate in the trial. Currently, King Edward Memorial (KEM) and BYL Nair hospitals are running clinical trials on the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine— Covishield.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) selected Sion Hospital for the trial of COVAXINTM, a proposal for which has been submitted to the ethics committee of the hospital for the final approval. Dr NT Awad, head of pulmonary medicine at the hospital, said, “We have been selected for the third phase of the national trial. We are really proud that our hospital has been selected for the first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine. The volunteers will be followed up for 12 months as per rules.”As per the official website of Bharat Biotech, the vaccine is developed in a BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high-containment facility. The vaccine received Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approval for phase I and II human clinical trials, which commenced across India in July.“After successful completion of the interim analysis from phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of COVAXINTM, Bharat Biotech received DCGI approval for phase-3 clinical trials in 26,000 participants in over 25 centres across India,” read the website.The trial will be conducted on 1,000 volunteers, of which 20% will have co-morbidities, while 5% will comprise health workers. “The remaining 75% will be healthy volunteers. All volunteers will have to undergo RT-PCR and antibody tests before being qualified for the trial,” said Dr Awad. The third phase will have two stages. After 28 days of the first vaccination, the volunteers will be given the second vial. “Every month, we will follow up on them. If any of them develop any symptoms of Covid-19, they will be immediately tested for the virus,” added Dr Awad. Nair Hospital gives vaccine to another 48 volunteers As HT reported earlier, Nair Hospital has sought ICMR approval to conduct trials of Covishield vaccine on additional volunteers. After the hospital was granted permission, another 48 volunteers have been given the vaccine till November 1. “So far, 148 people have participated in the trial. Earlier, it was 100 volunteers, but later, after getting approval of ICMR, we added 48 more individuals,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-sion-hospital-to-start-phase-3-trials-of-first-indigenous-covid-vaccine/story-Yp0wbyFcj8Kq4O25awK5AM.html

Raut said Mumbai’s power generation capacity can be expanded to around 3,000MW-3,500MW in the coming years as the city is expected to have a power demand close to 5,000MW.He added that the expansion plans need a go-ahead from the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC). Mumbai currently generates around 1,800MW power, while the rest is procured from outside the city. Mumbai’s peak-hour demand is close to 2,800MW. “Apart from looking at how to increase power generation capacity, we are also looking at how to reduce tariff and improve Mumbai’s islanding system,” he said.The minister also said that Mumbaiites can expect some relief on the inflated bills they received during lockdown. “We have sent a proposal to the state finance department. Mumbaiites will get good news during Diwali,” he said.Lakhs of consumers had complained about receiving inflated bills during lockdown, following which the state was planning a rebate scheme for the months of April, May and June.Raut is visiting various power units following the massive power outage that brought Mumbai to a standstill on October 12. The state has set up a committee to probe the incident. Raut said the report will be submitted to the chief minister soon.

03-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records 12°C variation in day-night temperatures; Doctors warn of rise in flu cases||The city recorded a gap of almost 12 degrees Celsius between day and night temperatures on Monday, with some areas in the suburbs recording a variation of as much as a 15 degrees.Doctors said this temperature variability could lead to health ailments such as seasonal flu, cause a spike in swine flu cases, and could create confusion among doctors and patients as the symptoms of seasonal flu are similar to those of Covid-19.On Monday, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded a maximum temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, which was almost 2 degrees above normal. The minimum temperature was 23.4 degrees Celsius, close to the normal mark. A similar trend (12-13 degree Celsius difference) has been observed in day and night temperatures over the past three days. The gap was much lesser (8.5 degrees Celsius) for the Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai, as the day temperature was 33.6 degrees Celsius and the night temperature was 25 degrees Celsius on Monday.Location-wise, at 19.3 degrees Celsius, Kandivli reported the lowest in Mumbai on Monday, which later rose to a maximum of 30 degrees Celsius. Borivli recorded 20 and 35 degrees Celsius as the minimum and maximum temperatures, respectively. “The wind pattern [northeasterly] is creating a drop in day temperatures, while higher temperatures are recorded in the evening due to warmer westerly to southwesterly winds. Such variability is common in October, and the rise or fall from the normal temperature has not been much,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, India Meteorological Department (IMD).However, doctors are concerned that such fluctuating temperatures provide a suitable environment for seasonal pathogens to thrive. “Thus, people start developing fever and cough. This kind of weather also leads to the rise of swine flu cases,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital. “This may create confusion among doctors and patients as seasonal flu symptoms are similar to those of Covid-19. People need to be extra cautious and consult doctors immediately.”Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital, said, “People might assume the Covid-19 infection is a general flu, which might delay the treatment and cause its spread to others. Also, people need to keep themselves adequately hydrated.”Meanwhile, the air quality index (AQI) improved on Monday to 132 (moderate) from Sunday’s 156 (moderate). Researchers said it was due to a marginal rise in wind speed.The weather bureau has issued a forecast for clear skies for Tuesday, with day and night temperatures expected to be 33 and 23 degrees Celsius, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-12-c-variation-in-day-night-temperatures-doctors-warn-of-rise-in-flu-cases/story-6sfBlnDDv2dkmh1QhIdteN.html

In Sukhna Choe waste was being discharged at the Kishangarh outlet, Shastri Nagar outlet, Daria village outlet, and the pump house being operated by the MC behind Central Poultry Development Organisation in Industrial Area, Phase-I.The N-Choe was being contaminated at the Garden of Springs and Sector 36, near the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL).MC commissioner KK Yadav, who also attended the meeting, said, “A joint team of MC and CPCC officials will assess the situation. Three of the leakages have already been rectified. The remaining will be remedied too.” The MC has repaired the damaged sewer line in Daria village.The CPCC had surveyed the N-Choe recently and discovered that discharge from untreated sewage from Mohali area mixes with the N-Choe at the Garden of Springs outlet and pollutes the drainWork delayed: Observes NGT“Observing that the work should have been completed by now, the NGT panel directed the UT engineering department to finish the work within a month and do it properly, meeting all the scientific requirements,” said Debendra Dalai, member-secretary, CPCC.In its August 2019 order, the NGT had directed the UT administration to undertake in-situ phytoremediation around the two rivulets and tributaries of the Ghaggar river.Phytoremediation is a bio-remediation process that uses a variety of plants to remove, transfer, stabilise, and destroy contaminants in soil and groundwater.The department has planted around 3,500 to 4,000 trees along the N-Choe and Sukhna Choe.The engineering department was also asked to speed up the process of installing real-time water quality monitoring stations on the two rivulets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/resurvey-sewage-discharge-points-along-seasonal-rivulets-in-3-days-ngt-tells-chandigarh-mc/story-vZWJgveLg4Zu2ycttkT0xH.html
03-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra seals Rs34,850-cr deals to bring in jobs||The Maharashtra government on Monday signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with 15 national and international firms, which are expected to bring investment of ₹34,850 crore to the state and create 23,182 job opportunities.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the state has set a target of bringing in investment of ₹1 lakh crore. “This is just a beginning. We have to bring investment of over ₹1 lakh crore in the near future. Of this, investment of ₹35,000 crore is happening today. Maharashtra will come out strong from the pandemic crisis,” said Thackeray at the event where MoUs were signed by representatives of firms and senior state officials. “Today’s signing of MoUs indicates unity in diversity. Firms related to chemicals, data centres, logistics and manufacturing sector are eager to invest here. Maharashtra is going to become an important destination for data centres as well,” he said. The firms that signed MoUs are Mitsubishi Electric India Pvt Limited, Mantra Data Centres, ESR India Investment Holdings. Adani Enterprises Ltd, Malpani Warehousing & Industrial Park, Netmagic Solutions IT Services Pvt Limited, Bright Sino Holdings Pvt Limited, STT Global Data Centres India Pvt Limited, Oriental Aromatic, Data Center Holdings India LLP, Evermint Logistics, Pareba Logistics Park, Ishvara Logistics Park, Princeton Digital Group, Nxtra Data Ltd.In June, the state government had signed MoUs worth around ₹17,000 with 12 firms while inaugurating Magnetic Maharashtra 2.0, a second instalment of the February 2018 global investors summit. Thackeray said 60% of the companies had completed the necessary steps and some plots have also been allotted. Others are expected to be allotted land soon. “Investors coming to Maharashtra even when pandemic was at peak shows that they trust the state government and vice versa,” said Thackeray.State industries minister Subhash Desai said, “Maharashtra has been at the forefront when it comes to investment. Even during the pandemic, firms from various countries chose to come to the state. We will again prove that Maharashtra is the most preferred destination for investment in the country.”MoUs with Chinese firms on holdThe state government on Monday clarified that MoUs worth over ₹5,000 crore, inked with three Chinese firms in June, are on hold as the Centre is yet to announced its policy on investment from China. The firms are Hengli (₹250 crore), Great Wall Motors (₹3,770 crore) and PMI Electro Mobility Solutions, a joint venture with Foton (₹ 1,000 crore). “The MoUs are still on hold and have not been scrapped. There has been no development on the issue as of now. The Central government had told us to wait for further instructions and we are waiting for Centre’s policy on the matter. Till then, we will not be taking any decision,” Desai told HT. The three Chinese firms are among the 12 with which the state signed MoUs in June. At around the same time, skirmishes between Indian and Chinese troops broke out in Ladakh. Following this, the state put the MoUs on hold and sought direction from the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-seals-rs34-850-cr-deals-to-bring-in-jobs/story-w5ABLnnl5tCdO77pJChZIN.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Feel-good Baba ka Dhaba tale takes unsavoury turn||What began as a feel-good story about the internet and its social media Samaritans coming out to support a small local business has turned into a criminal investigation -- with a dash of alleged financial irregularity, and ostensibly a pinch of social media rivalry.Delhi Police on Monday began its probe into a case of alleged misappropriation of funds filed against a YouTube “influencer” by an elderly man who runs a roadside eatery, Baba ka Dhaba. The restaurant, run by Kanta Prasad, shot to fame last month after the influencer, Gaurav Wasan, highlighted how Prasad may run out business because his customers are staying away due to the coronavirus disease.The 11-minute-long YouTube video blog, posted on October 7, detailed how Prasad and his wife, Badami Devi, both apparently in their eighties, were in dire straits outside their tiny eatery in Malviya Nagar. Wasan’s video on his YouTube page was widely circulated, leading to 3 million views and drawing thousands of Delhi residents, and some celebrities, to Prasad’s shop to buy food and take selfies.A month later, the crowds outside Baba Ka Dhaba have vanished, and Prasad says that while large sums of money were collected for him from the public by Wasan, he is yet to get a single penny. The charges were first made by a bunch of other users on YouTube, who made videos to allege that Wasan siphoned off the money and conned the elderly couple. These videos were widely circulated, raking up millions of views. One such YouTube blogger, who identified himself as Lakshay Chaudhary, said he had met fellow blogger Eluish Yadav and discussed the case. Both Yadav and Chaudhary made videos charging Wasan with misappropriation of funds. Chaudhary said there were many bloggers who were scamming citizens and not handing the funds to people in need. Delhi Police officers privy to the case bloggers who first made the charges against Wasan public seem to know each other and made the allegations against Wasan together. . Wasan did not respond to calls and text messages seeking his response but released what he claimed were his bank statements to claim innocence. Prasad filed a police complaint last week, accusing Wasan of cheating him. Delhi Police are yet to register a first Investigation report (FIR) in the case, but an officer privy to the details said they were likely to summon both Prasad and Wasan for questioning this week.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said they are looking into Prasad’s allegations and counterclaims by Wasan, who has denied any wrongdoing.In his complaint, Prasad alleged that Wasan shot a video of his stall Baba Ka Dhaba on October 7 after “inducing” him to promote his business as they were not making any money. Prasad said Wasan posted the video on his social media company account “Swad Official”, and convinced public through social media to donate money to the couple and help them in running the business.Prasad contended that he not received any money from the donations collected, and alleged that Wasan and his associates used their own bank accounts to collect the money, which they have now pocketed.When asked how much money was raised through donations, Prasad said he was not certain about the amount. Wasan did not respond to queries seeking a comment.Wasan released a video on October 28 in which he denied all allegations. Wasan said that contrary to reports on social media, he received only around ₹3 lakh in his account. Wasan said he had given the money to Prasad and also attached a clip, which showed him handing what appeared to be a cheque to Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/feel-good-baba-ka-dhaba-tale-takes-unsavoury-turn/story-znSyXjiZUgxFeThO56EeUK.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Teachers can’t suffer in tiff between govt, colleges: Delhi high court||The Delhi High Court on Monday observed that teachers cannot be allowed to suffer in the blame game between the Delhi government and Delhi University colleges. Hearing a plea filed by the Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) that has challenged the AAP government’s order asking 12 Delhi University colleges to pay outstanding salaries to staffers from the Students Society Fund (SSF), the court told the union’s counsel to make all 12 colleges parties in the case and to refused to pass any order in their absence.On October 16, the Delhi government had told the 12 colleges fully funded by it to pay the salaries of more than 1,500 staff—teaching and non-teaching—from the students fund and directed that the amount should be released within two weeks.The state government’s order was challenged by DUSU, following which the Delhi High Court stayed the order on October 23. Justice Navin Chawla, while issuing notice, transferred the matter to the court of Justice Jyoti Singh where similar cases were pending. On Monday, Justice Jyoti Singh asked the DUSU counsel to make all 12 colleges parties in the case. The court said Delhi University is the guardian of its colleges and it is its responsibility to put things in order and solve issues.“The colleges should be made a party. In this blame game, teachers cannot be allowed to suffer. Where should teachers go then?...I am wondering and amazed that colleges that should be made first party are not made a party at all,” the judge said, adding it would be unfair to pass any order in the absence of colleges.Appearing for the Delhi government, its counsel told the court that the stay granted on October 23 should be vacated as the colleges were not present in the hearing. He said since the court is seeking the presence of all the 12 colleges, the stay order cannot be sustained because the colleges have not been heard.The court, however, said even if there is force in the argument, it will not pass any order at this stage.Advocate Jivesh Tiwari, who represented DUSU, sought some time, following which the matter was listed for November 5.Advocate Aakanksha Kaul, appearing for Delhi University, said it is supporting the students’ petition and that the students’ fund cannot be used for paying salaries of teachers and it will amount to cheating the pupils.The high court asked the DU counsel to take instructions on the issue of funds and grants from the higher authorities and inform the court about it on the next date of hearing.The students’ union said that such arbitrary and illegal usage of the money raised by students for their academic welfare had forced the petitioner to move court.The plea said the directorate of higher education directed the 12 colleges, which are 100% funded by the Delhi government, to utilise the Students Society Fund (SSF) to pay salaries.The 12 colleges are Acharya Narendra Dev College, Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar College, Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences, Bhagini Nivedita College, DeenDayal Upadhyaya College, Aditi Mahavidyalaya Women’s College, Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education & Sports Sciences, Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Maharaja Agrasen College (DU), Maharshi Valmiki College of Education, Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-can-t-suffer-in-tiff-between-govt-colleges-delhi-high-court/story-5YpanFNjV9t0kQ2Mi3IEcJ.html
03-11-2020||Mumbai||Submit proposal to declare Panje a wetland: Bombay HC panel to Raigad collector||After numerous exchanges between environmentalists and the state government on whether or not Panje area in Uran is a wetland, the Raigad district administration will finally undertake a survey to demarcate the site as a wetland.The state wetland and mangrove grievance redressal committee appointed by the Bombay high court (HC), during a meeting on Monday, directed the Raigad collector to submit a proposal to the state environment department for the declaration of Panje as a wetland.“The decision pertains to Panje and all such areas along the Konkan coast which have wetland-like features or have already been identified in the National Wetland Atlas, Maharashtra. They need to be surveyed, protected and declared as wetlands, with proposals to be submitted before the state environment department. This is a standing instruction issued to all district collectors and civic bodies,” said Annasaheb Misal, Konkan commissioner and chairman of the HC panel, adding that the district administration had been further directed to ensure no construction was undertaken on site.Raigad collector Nidhi Choudhari confirmed that a proposal would be submitted to the state after site verifications for Panje as well as Bhendkhal and Belpada areas in Uran. “We will ensure no construction takes place in any of these areas,” she said.oApart from being a revenue source for the local fishing community, Panje is a destination for thousands of migratory birds and an ecologically sensitive area visited by countless ornithologists and bird enthusiasts. However, the City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (Cidco) and Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (NMSEZ) plan to build an integrated township at Panje and other areas in Dronagiri, Uran.Pramod Patil, nodal officer (environment) Cidco, said, “A committee headed by the Raigad collector, range forest officer (Uran), revenue officer (Uran), and myself will visit Panje, Bhendkhal and Belpada to check whether these three areas have wetland features. The site visit date is yet to be decided.”The latest move comes after repeated complaints of debris dumping, mangrove destruction and cutting off high-tide water to dry the area. Environmentalists from Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishthan and NatConnect Foundation had on Sunday filed a fresh complaint that Panje had turned dry. “The local police have been directed to ensure that the sluice gates providing high-tide water to Panje remain open at all times as per the Konkan commissioner’s direction,” said Neenu Somraj, member secretary of the HC panel.Police personnel told the HC panel on Monday that 46 cases of mangrove and wetland destruction across Thane, Navi Mumbai and Uran had been filed, of which investigations and first information reports (FIRs) had been filed in 44 cases, and pending in two. “The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, which was not present during Monday’s meeting, has been directed to file charge sheets in all cases as mandated under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, and present them before the Bombay HC,” said Somraj.Member of the committee, environmentalist Stalin D suggested that a special environment monitoring committee be constituted to check wetland and mangrove destruction cases in Uran. “We will examine the feasibility of a taluka-level committee as a district committee already exists,” said Misal.“The HC panel meeting on Monday was one of the most fruitful meetings that this committee has had and the commissioner’s proactive approach will help Konkan wetlands from needless destruction,” said Stalin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/submit-proposal-to-declare-panje-a-wetland-bombay-hc-panel-to-raigad-collector/story-0RfrBoqyPZ23scg5ACrQ0H.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Govt hospital work to scale up ICU beds in view of surge in Covid-19 cases||With the number of cases of Covid-19 cases in the city continuing to spike, several Delhi government hospitals are working on adding non-invasive ventilation mechanisms to existing beds in their wards, with plans in place to accommodate up to 1,000 hospital admissions a day, senior officials said on Monday. The plans will be implemented as the number of cases go up, the officials added.Currently, 68% of the over 3,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds — with and without ventilators — are occupied, according to the government’s ‘Delhi Corona’ app, with the number of admissions on the rise. On average, over 5,800 Covid-19 patients were admitted in Delhi hospitals during the last week. In comparison, the average hospitalisation the week that before had been 5,171, according to data shared by the Delhi government.The 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, the largest Covid-19 facility in Delhi, has added around 200 more ICU beds over the last 15 days. “With most mild to moderate Covid-19 patients preferring home isolation, those who do come to the hospitals are mostly in need of oxygen support and monitoring. So, we have increased the number of intensive care or high-dependence unit beds over the last 15 days,” a senior doctor from the hospital said.To do so, the ward beds in the hospital have been fitted specialised high-flow oxygen nasal cannula (a tube used to deliver oxygen at high speed to the patient) or Bipap machines (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure, which uses a mask to deliver oxygen). With a total of 430 “ICU beds” the hospital has reached its capacity.“This is our maximum capacity at the hospital, but the government is working on increasing the ICU beds in other government and private hospitals,” the doctor said.A committee headed by NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul had said Delhi should prepare for 15,000 new daily infections during the winters.Of the 500 beds at Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital in Tahirpur, 400 have already been converted into such make-shift ICU beds. Of the total 400 “ICU beds”, 200 have ventilators that can be used as a Bipap machine, 140 have Bipap machines, and the rest have high flow nasal oxygen support. “We are trying to convert 50 more beds into such ICU beds as that is what majority of the patients need,” said a senior official from the hospital administration.At Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, which currently has 168 ICU beds, the beds will be increased as per availability of staff. “To run ICU beds, we need more doctors and nurses. And, they have to be trained in handling such critical patients. Subject to availability of staff, the number of such beds will be increased,” said a doctor from the hospital.The government has also created a reserve stock of liquid oxygen. “There is enough liquid oxygen in store in case more ICU beds need to be created. In addition, all Delhi government hospitals were asked to remain prepared and purchase anything that needed during the previous surge, so any hospital can be converted into a Covid-19 hospital within a day,” said a senior official from the Delhi government.“The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Covid-19 centre in South Delhi also has a good ICU capacity,” the official added. The make-shift hospital in Chhattarpur set up and staffed by the army has 250 beds of which currently 10 are operational. “With most patients staying in home isolation, a majority of the facility remains vacant,” said an official from the centre.To increase ICU beds in the private sector, the government had in September ordered 33 major hospitals to reserve 80% of their total ICU capacity for Covid-19 patients. The order has been challenged in the Delhi high-court.“When the first surge had happened in Delhi in June, the committee had predicted a huge case load. The government had started working on putting in place 30,000 Covid-19 beds. Currently, there are about 15,000 beds in the city, of which over 9,000 remain vacant still. In case, the need arises the government already has a plan in place to scale up to 30,000 beds. This includes beds in banquet halls – which is a facility between hospitals and home isolation – where patients who are fairly stable but need oxygen support can be admitted freeing more critical care beds in the hospital,” said Dr Arun Gupta, president, Delhi Medical Council and one of the members of the committee. “We had added about 1,000 ICU beds one month ago. Today, there are 2,900 ICU beds available in Delhi, of which over 1,200 are empty. We had also directed some private hospitals to reserve 80% of their ICU beds for Covid-19. That matter is in court now,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said in a press briefing on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-hospital-work-to-scale-up-icu-beds-in-view-of-surge-in-covid-cases/story-M5jyP8ppsc1Z0Py46B3j2M.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Bus operations at Delhi’s ISBTs to begin today||Interstate bus services are set to resume in Delhi from Tuesday as the three interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) in the national Capital will be thrown open to the public after being shut more than seven months because of Covid-19 restrictions. The number of buses coming from different states, however, will be capped at 50% of pre-Covid times.Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Monday reviewed preparations made ahead of the resumption of interstate services and asked officials to ensure strict compliance of the standard operating procedure (SOP).The three ISBTs at Kashmere Gate, Sarai Kale Khan and Anand Vihar used to cater to 3,500 trips of interstate buses and 2,000 trips of local buses every day before the lockdown. This will be the first time interstate bus travel will be allowed in Delhi since the lockdown was imposed in the city on March 21 to arrest the spread of Covid-19.The states that run their buses to and from Delhi include Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Chandigarh.According to the SOP prepared by the Delhi government, the interstate buses will be sanitised by the respective depots of bus operators at the point of origin and before their departure from the respective ISBTs. Thermal checking of both passengers and the bus crew at boarding and at the point of entry to ISBTs will be must. It will be mandatory for passengers to wear face masks. Buses will run to their seating capacity and no standing passengers will be allowed. Social distancing will be ensured at the ground station, at the time of boarding of passengers and inside the bus, as per government guidelines. Social distancing will be done through markers on the ground and waiting areas, similar to the ones in all buses and the metro.“In addition to these, testing camps for rapid/ RT-PCR tests have been set up at all three ISBTs in case any asymptomatic passenger shows signs of illness after thermal screening. The safety of both passengers and staff and crew are of utmost priority to us,” the minister said. “We’ve been carefully monitoring patterns of travelling since we resumed bus services. Even though inter-state travel is a challenge, we are ensuring sanitisation at every point. Apart from this, regular announcements and sensitisation of passengers about Covid-19 precautions through audio-visual communication is also being made. There will be a strict ban on the use of gutka, tobacco products, etc., in the ISBT premises,” the minister said.The decision to reopen the ISBTs was taken on October 23 in a Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting chaired by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal. But before the onset of the pandemic, the three ISBTs saw a combined footfall of over 250,000 every day. At least 3,467 buses from various states would ply through these ISBTs every day.The state government has also allowed Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses to operate at full seating capacity, but no passenger will be allowed to stand and travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bus-operations-at-delhi-s-isbts-to-begin-tuesday/story-3peya2AtAOuUFodJGRAXFI.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||AAP attacks MCDs over non-payment of dues to municipal teachers||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday demanded that the three BJP-ruled civic bodies must immediately release the salaries of teachers in the MCD schools who are protesting against non-payment of their dues.Party’s incharge of MCD affairs Durgesh Pathak said despite the fact that the Delhi government had released money to the civic bodies to pay salaries, the municipal bodies have not paid the teachers. “The Delhi government has released all funds pertaining to the salary of teachers till the month of October. The government had given Rs 175 crore to the East DMC, Rs 344 crore to North DMC and Rs 227 crore to South DMC. In total, the Delhi government has released approximately Rs 746 crore to the three MCDs. When all payments have been duly made from our side, why have the salaries not been processed yet? Why are your employees struggling to meet their daily needs? Where did the money go? This points to only one thing that BJP has used this money to fill its own pockets,” said Pathak.Responding to the allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that for the last 4-5 months, the Delhi government and the AAP have been speaking about the MCDs with a “clear political bias”. “They are levelling baseless allegations nowadays only to remain in the limelight till the MCD elections take place in the year 2022. Half of the current financial year is gone, but municipal corporations do not have even one third of their annual budget from the Delhi government. On the one hand, the Delhi government is crippling municipal corporations by stalling municipal funds and on the other hand, AAP is trying to politically damage BJP’s image by levelling baseless allegations against MCDs and their leaders,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-attacks-mcds-over-non-payment-of-dues-to-municipal-teachers/story-RUnZJxfZTGszva4HTuwleM.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Neighbouring states living in denial over effecs of farm fires on Delhi pollution: Gopal Rai||A day after the contribution of stubble fires to the pollution load in Delhi’s air touched the season’s highest on Sunday at 40%, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai accused the governments in the neighbouring states of living in denial while urging the Centre to find a lasting solution to the problem.  “We have been repeatedly saying that stubble burning is a major reason behind severe levels of pollution in Delhi around Diwali, but BJP and the Congress say the share of farm fires in Delhi’s pollution was just 4 to 6%, whereas statistics show it has increased to 40%,” Rai said.He said the Delhi government has been doing everything possible to curb biomass burning, and vehicular and dust pollution, “but what should we do about stubble burning?” Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi’s pollution peaked to 44% on November 1.Rai urged the Centre to take immediate steps to deal with the alarming situation. “I request the Central government to take some action rather than just making a commission, because pollution combined with the current pandemic can cause catastrophic consequences for the people of Delhi,” he said.According to Punjab Pollution Control Board, the state has recorded 33,165 farm fire incidents this season so far, while Haryana has reported 6,034 farm fires during the period.Air quality in the national Capital slightly improved on Monday, mostly because of better wind speed, to settle in the ‘poor’ zone of the ambient air quality index after remaining in the ‘very poor’ category for four consecutive days. The average AQI of Delhi was recorded at 293 on Monday compared to 364. Thermal imaging by NASA’s satellite showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. According to the ministry of earth sciences air quality monitor, Safar, “Improved wind conditions, along with weak night time surface inversion have led to better ventilation during the night as well which was so far limited to the day. A marginal deterioration is forecast for November 3 and 4 towards the middle of the very poor category.” The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) early warning system for Delhi said the predominant surface wind is likely to be blowing from the northwest direction of Delhi with wind speeds going up to 10-18 km per hour. For Tuesday, the wind speeds may be around 5-12 kmph with mainly clear sky and mist in the morning, it said. Air blowing from northwest brings in pollution from the stubble fires in the neighbouring agrarian states. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the season so far.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.According to the IMD, the city’s ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 12,000 meter square per second on Monday – was favourable for dispersion of pollutants on Monday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.NGT on crackersThe National Green Tribunal on Monday issued notices to the Union environment ministry and the state governments of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan seeking their responses on whether use of fire crackers be banned from November 7-30 in the interest of public health and environment.A bench headed by NGT chairperson justice AK Goel sought response from MoEF, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Delhi Police commissioner, besides the four governments. The NGT also appointed senior advocate Raj Panjwani and advocate Shibhani Ghosh to assist it as amicus curiae in the matter.The tribunal was hearing a plea by Indian Social Responsibility Network, filed through Santosh Gupta, seeking action against pollution due to burning of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR. “Use of green crackers will not remedy the situation. The smoke will choke and may create gas chamber like situation.

At Kasturba and Hindu Rao hospitals, OPD services, and registration and admission of new patients were hit due to strike. The hospital administration, however, said emergency services remained unaffected. Demanding pending salaries at the earliest, the employees threatened to completely stop all emergency services.“Today (Monday), we had a meeting with the north corporation mayor. He said our salaries will be paid by Diwali. But these are false promises and our strike will continue until salaries are credited in our accounts,” BL Sharma, president of the Kasturba Hospital Nurses’ Union, said.There are nearly 200 nursing and paramedical employees at Kasturba and nearly 70 at Girdharilal Maternity Hospital. At Hindu Rao, the number of such staff is around 350 and 180 at Rajan Babu TB Hospital. Nurses of north MCD hospitals have not been paid the salaries of August, September and October while other paramedic employees have not got wages since June this year.Doctors at Kasturba and Hindu Rao hospitals said OPD services and the registration of new patients were affected. No new patient was admitted on Monday. “In the morning, patients had to go to other hospitals. Some new patients were referred to Lady Hardinge hospital. Emergency services were not stopped completely as we managed with the help of contractual workers. But if this continues, problems may increase,” a doctor at Kasturba Hospital said on condition of anonymity.North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said he was in touch with the employees. “I assured them that we are trying to get their at least two months’ salaries disbursed till Diwali. I requested them to call off the strike,” Prakash said.Primary teachers of north MCD schools also staged a protest near Bharatiya Janata Party Delhi chief Adesh Gupta’s residence in Patel Nagar to demand payment of salaries for the past four months. They plan a protest at Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Tuesday.“Our salaries for July, August, September and October are pending. It is now impossible to work without money. BJP is in power at the civic bodies and so we staged a protest at the Delhi BJP chief’s residence. He assured us of clearing two salaries in a fortnight,” Kuldeep Khatri, president Shikshak Nyay Manch Nagar Nigam, said.Delhi BJP chief, Gupta said, “Two out of four pending salaries of teachers will be disbursed before Diwali. The remaining will be paid after that,” Gupta said.Earlier in June, north corporation school teachers had staged a symbolic strike over pending salaries. They called off their stir after the civic body paid a month’s salary after the court’s intervention.Similarly, doctors of north MCD-run hospitals called off their strike last month after the civic body cleared their dues till September 2020. Salaries of paramedic and nursing staff were, however, paid till June 2020 and July 2020, respectively, which annoyed the workers and they went on strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nursing-staff-at-north-mcd-hospitals-go-on-strike-over-pending-salaries/story-ZqkrRn599FmhJXC3T4Nv3M.html

The police submission came after the court ordered the investigating agency to supply the hard copy of the charge sheet to all accused. Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat said once the charge sheet has been filed by the investigating agency, as voluminous as it is, then with some alacrity, a hard copy has to be provided to every accused. It said that the agency might require sanction of funds for the purpose, however, they were supposed to act promptly.“In these circumstances, the court directs that the investigating agency shall provide the physical copy of the charge sheet and the accompanying documents to every accused person by next date, without fail. On the next date of hearing, DCP, Special Cell, shall also be present in the court,” the judge said in its order dated October 21.The court had on October 9 directed police to file fresh copies of the charge sheet after it was informed that they “have inadvertently” put a document in it which contained the details of some of the protected witnesses and its copies were supplied to the accused persons.It had directed the police to file fresh copies of the charge sheet redacting the details of the protected witnesses and supplying it to the 15 persons charge-sheeted in the case and their respective counsels.On October 21, the investigating officer told the court that he has submitted 16 new pen drives containing the redacted version of the charge sheet and accompanying documents in terms of the earlier order.The court directed that the accused and their counsel to be provided hard and soft copies of the fresh charge sheet.To this, the officer submitted that the sanction for funds for taking out the hard copies for every accused was to be obtained from the Delhi government and sought 15 days’ time.The court said, in its order passed on October 21,that it was not “impressed” by his submissions while directing that the documents be supplied at the earliest.The matter would be now heard today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-to-seek-funds-to-distribute-hard-copy-of-17-000-page-riots-charge-sheet-to-15-accused/story-HByM0aDCtBPLDbf4liOgMI.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||RWAs raise concern about relaxation in Covid norms in Delhi, write to Baijal, Kejriwal||Concerned over the renewed surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the Capital, resident welfare associations and civil society members have urged the Delhi lieutenant-governor (L-G) and the chief minister (CM) to exercise caution while relaxing norms during the festive season.In a letter to Delhi L-G Anil Baijal on Monday, which has been marked to CM Arvind Kejriwal, Save Our City campaign -- an association of civil society members, RWAs and experts -- have requested for a review of the Covid-related decisions and stricter enforcement of norms.More than 5,000 cases are being reported daily in Delhi in the past few days. On Sunday, Delhi recorded 5,664 new cases with a positivity rate of 12.69% and 51 deaths, taking the toll to 6,562, the government’s daily health bulletin said. On Monday, 4,001 new cases were recorded with a positivity rate of 10.91%.“We suggest a graded approach. The free flow and opening of all economic activity with no checks and balances sends a wrong signal to the populace, making them believe that things are under control, thus becoming careless. The Western world is again going into a lockdown. India cannot afford another economic shutdown. Therefore, necessary restrictions are needed to contain Covid,” read the letter.Neither the L-G nor the CM office responded to requests for a comment.Most Covid-related restrictions have been eased in Delhi. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) recently allowed more than 50 guests at weddings and Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses to run at full capacity. Inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs) in Delhi will also open from Tuesday after more than seven months. Last week, photographs of crowded Delhi markets where people were jostling for space were widely circulated on social media.In the festive season, RWAs say there is a need to have a set of protocols to contain the spread of the disease. Rajiv Kakria, convenor of Save Our City campaign said, “Markets are crowded, there is no social distancing, people are not wearing masks and there are no proper checks. Cases are on a rise and we are relaxing norms. There is a need to have proper checks and balances in place. It must be mandatory for traders or people engaging in economic activities with public interface to get RT-PCR tests done and display the certificates. The validity for the test has to be decided by the government.”In GK-I, Kakria said, they have made arrangements for the upcoming festival season but have asked vendors to get Covid test done. “We are getting the test done, as we don’t want to expose our residents to the infection,” said Kakria, a member of the GK-I RWA.The relaxation in norms, RWA members say, is sending a wrong signal to the public. The decision to relax norms should be made by a panel of experts, they argue. Pankaj Aggarwal, general secretary of Delhi RWA Joint Front, said, “It makes people feel that everything is fine and this is why the government is relaxing the norms. This will only make people more negligent. The World over, countries are enforcing the lockdown again. Medical experts should decide what needs to be done. It can’t be an economy-driven decision, especially now when more than 5,000 cases are reported daily,” Aggarwal said.Some RWAs are asking for a night curfew and stringent measures during the winter season or till the vaccine is available. “So many people died due to Covid in the last one month. When experts say the number of cases will increase during winter, what’s the logic behind relaxing norms? The government should enforce night curfew and put restrictions to check overcrowding in markets and public places,” said BS Vohra, president of East Delhi Joint Front.But not all RWAs agree with the suggestion for imposing curfew or strict norms, saying the problem is with the enforcement of rules. “We can’t shut economic activities again. It is important. What we need right now is strict enforcement. The government should rope in RWAs and NGOs for this, as they don’t have enough manpower to ensure enforcement,” said Atul Goyal, president of United RWAs Joint Action (URJA), a collective of RWAs in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rwas-raise-concern-about-relaxation-in-covid-norms-in-delhi-write-to-baijal-kejriwal/story-jtRgiuJtke2m23PSB1liFM.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||Man murders wife’s 17-year-old niece, hides body in bed box in Delhi||A man and his wife have been arrested for allegedly murdering the woman’s 17-year-old niece at their home in northeast Delhi’s Tahirpur and stuffing her body in their bed box last month, police said on Monday. After killing the minor girl, the couple cleaned the blood from the crime scene (the room), and slept on the single bed for the night with the girl’s body inside its box, they said. According to the police, the man had an eye on the minor -- daughter of the woman’s sister -- who had been objecting to his advances. The man is a rickshaw-puller while his wife begs for a living.His wife knew about it and had asked her to return to her native village in Bihar but she wanted to stay back and pursue her studies, police said. She had completed her Class 12 and was planning to study further, police said.The girl’s refusal to leave their home led to frequent quarrels between the couple, said an investigator, who did not want to be named.“On October 23, during an altercation, the woman told her husband kill her niece. The man then killed the girl by hitting her head with an iron rod in her asleep as his wife guarded the main door,” said the investigator. Deputy commissioner of police (north-east) Ved Prakash Surya said the murder was discovered on October 25, when locals informed police about some foul smell emanating from the house that was locked from outside. The girl’s aunt was in the neighbourhood when the neighbours also informed her about the foul smell. The police broke open the door and found the body in the box. The woman identified the dead girl as her niece.The aunt was living at a neighbour’s house on the pretext that her house was locked and her husband was away.“A case of murder was registered at the Nand Nagri police station,” DCP Surya said.During the probe, the investigator said, the statements of the girl’s aunt and neighbours were recorded. The aunt told the police that on October 23, she had left home for begging around 5.30 am and when she returned around 12.30 pm, she found the door locked from outside. The woman told the police that when she did not find her niece at home, she asked her husband, who said he had left her in an orphanage in Ghaziabad.“Since the man was also missing, our team searched all orphanages in Ghaziabad but the girl was not taken to any of them on that day. Locals said the man used to make sexual advances on the minor girl. They said he had tried to force himself on her on September 28. The girl had told her aunt and a neighbour about it,” the investigator said.As the man became the prime suspect, they started looking for him and he was caught from a bus stand in his home town in Bihar’s Madhepura on October 28. He was brought to Delhi and the iron rod used in the crime was recovered. “His interrogation led to his wife’s arrest and both admitted to the crime,” the officer added.During interrogation, the man said he killed the girl in a fit of rage after his wife asked him to do so, DCP Surya said. “The duo had planned to dispose of the body and waited the entire day looking for an opportunity to remove it. When they failed, the woman asked her husband to go to their native village so that nobody suspected his involvement when the girl’s body was discovered. The woman thought that as she was handicapped (in one leg caused by polio), the neighbours and police would not suspect her,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-murders-wife-s-niece-hides-body-in-bed-box-in-delhi/story-NggOBCJZeqWGFQbioFPYaO.html
03-11-2020||Delhi||GB Pant Engg College will be a part of new Skill and Entrepreneurship University: Sisodia||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Monday said GB Pant Engineering College -- affiliated to the state-run Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (IP University) until now -- will not enrol students this year, and announced that it will soon be a part of the upcoming Skill and Entrepreneurship University with better courses and infrastructure.Sisodia’s comments came in the backdrop of protests by students, demanding a clarification after IP University removed the state-run college’s name from the list of its affiliated institutes and stopped admissions this year. “This confusion is being unnecessarily spread. Instead of it being a normal college under IP University, the government plans to bring it under the upcoming Skill and Entrepreneurship University and develop it as a better institute. We plan reforms in the courses it offers while maintaining the prestige of the institute, Sisodia said. “The government is investing Rs 526 crore in the construction of the new college building and if we are investing so much, we will expect more students to get benefited from it. Presently, the intake of the college is very low. I assure everyone that it won’t make any difference to the students studying there if the college remains under the IP University or the Skill and Entrepreneurship University,” Sisodia said.Delhi government had last year announced a Skill and Entrepreneurship University in the national capital. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had last month announced that the university is likely to start its first academic session from next year. Asked if GB Pant college located in Okhla phase 3 -- which offers three BTech courses (computer, mechanical and electronic) and caters around 600 students (excluding first-year students) -- will take admissions this year, Sisodia said, “This year the Skill and Entrepreneurship University will work on reforming and designing the new courses. This year, there will be no admission (in GB Pant as well). Meanwhile, we have increased 1,330 seats this year in IP University.” The government has last week announced an increase in the number of higher education seats at IP University, including B Tech courses.GB Pant principal OP Verma did not wish to comment. A senior official at the college said, “We do not know when the university will be established. The admission process in the college cannot be stalled till then.”IP University vice-chancellor Mahesh Verma said existing students will continue with the university and will get degrees from it. Earlier in the day, a group of around 100-150 students, led by members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), held a protest outside Sisodia’s residence in Mathura Road, seeking a clarification. A final-year BTech student, requesting anonymity, said, “The government cannot stop taking admission in a college abruptly. What are our chances of higher education now? We will not be able to take admissions in good colleges since everyone will acknowledge us as an alumnus of a college that has been shut down.” Siddhartha Yadav, state secretary, ABVP Delhi, said, “We will continue our protest and may even give a call for a hunger strike if the government does not take its decision back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gb-pant-engg-college-will-be-a-part-of-new-skill-and-entrepreneurship-university-sisodia/story-N6NGJC6h6PTkXH0sMqnqAN.html

PPCB chairman AS Marwaha said that rather than blaming Punjab for the poor air quality, Delhi should check its own sources of pollution. “It is scientifically not possible for stubble burning in Punjab to affect Delhi. There are two major particulate matters in Delhi’s pollution-- PM 10 and PM 2.5. The particle PM 10 is very heavy and can travel in air only up to 25 km. So it cannot be possibly reaching Delhi.” “PM 2.5 is a light particle and can travel up to 150 kms,” he said, adding that Delhi’s own activities are producing PM 10 and PM 2.5 particles. “However, there is another particle PM 1, which is very light and can travel up to 250kms. PM 1 particle maybe marginally contributing to Delhi’s air pollution but there is no study to establish it,” Marwaha said.The PPCB chairman further said that had farm fires in Punjab been the reason for Delhi’s deteriorating air quality, then the ambient air quality of Punjab would have also shown similar trends. “Punjab’s AQI is generally in the moderate range (100-200) while Delhi often crosses the “very poor” category,” he stated. The board’s member secretary, Krunesh Garg, said, “Punjab is always blamed for Delhi’s pollution, which is not right. The state probably contributes about 1-2 % to Delhi’s pollution. Stubble burning incidents within a 100 km radius of Delhi are more responsible for its air quality than Punjab, which is 250kms away from Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-should-check-its-own-sources-of-pollution-ppcb/story-S0N9zDJwvNBtKnGFcrbGHJ.html

The reason is simple, he says: “He has no economic plan. I don’t mean that I don’t like it. It doesn’t exist.”Click here for complete coverage of US election 2020Hubbard was chairman of President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers from 2001 to 2003 and advised the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012, and of Jeb Bush in 2016. He’s a professor at Columbia University and was dean of Columbia Business School from 2004 to 2019.Hubbard says he could “imagine opportunities” for a second Trump term, such as how to fix problems with the health-care system that have been “laid bare” by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Maybe talk about fiscal reform, or trade in a way that engaged our allies,” but he hasn’t done any of that, Hubbard says.“Anybody who says they know what Trump would do in a second term, I don’t know where they’re getting that from,” he says.Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate for president, doesn’t have much of a plan either, according to Hubbard. “His, too, is a little odd,” he says. “I’d have thought, if I was running for president, I would have focused on recovery and then a variety of renewal, recovery issues. There’s not really much there other than nods to the Democratic plan, which is kind of a Christmas tree.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-has-no-economic-plan-says-republican-economist-glenn-hubbard/story-VeVGlXOatPnEzCqvG8oDJP.html
03-11-2020||World||US Justice Barrett’s first major hearing to focus on gay rights||Can a Catholic adoption agency exclude gay and lesbian couples from fostering children in the name of its religious beliefs? The US Supreme Court will hear the case Wednesday, just one day after the country’s presidential election.It is first major hearing to come before Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a devout Catholic appointed by President Donald Trump and sworn in last week over the objection of Democrats.Her appointment eight days before the presidential vote solidified the court’s conservative majority, which now stands at six out of nine justices.The case, LGBT rights advocates say, has implications not just for same-sex couples, but an array of minorities including those practicing other faiths.In March 2018, the city of Philadelphia learned that one of its child welfare providers, Catholic Social Services (CSS), had refused to match foster children with same-sex couples.In the resulting case, CSS alleged that the move violated its First Amendment rights guaranteeing freedom of religion and expression under the US Constitution.“Philadelphia demands that a religious agency, an arm of a church, speak and act according to Philadelphia’s beliefs,” the group said in a court brief.Its case has received support from dozens of churches and lawmakers from Bible Belt states as well as the Trump administration, which says that the northeast US city is acting out of “hostility” towards religion.Philadelphia requires all foster partners to sign a nondiscrimination clause and argued in its own brief that “the Constitution does not grant CSS the right to dictate the terms on which it carries out the government’s work.”The city has received the backing of the liberal American Civil Liberties Union, which warned that the case “could allow private agencies that receive taxpayer-funding to provide government services... to deny services to people who are LGBTQ, Jewish, Muslim or Mormon.”The court will decide on the case in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-barrett-s-first-major-hearing-to-focus-on-gay-rights/story-cQPzwvLTdn6NugFWtAhrON.html

It added that students will be taught how the socialist system with Chinese characteristics helped curb the spread of coronavirus in the country.The focus of the new curriculum is clear from the education ministry’s statement – it will add to the narrative of how the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and the country “...have always put the safety and health of the people first”.The new curriculum on the pandemic will be added for students through first to the ninth grades and content related to it will be included in biology, physical education and health, history, and Chinese literature.“Knowledge of outbreak prevention and control, and content about ‘the spirit of fighting the pandemic’ will be among the points of emphasis,” the Sixthtone news website reported.“Students will learn about key figures who emerged during outbreak prevention and control efforts, as well as their deeds. They will learn to cultivate public service consciousness and dedication and be enriched with knowledge about the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,” the ministry statement said.The education ministry statement did not give a timeline within which the curriculum will be revised.China has effectively controlled the coronavirus pandemic, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, even as it rages globally, infecting and killing millions.Strict lockdowns combined with effective contact tracing have helped control the pandemic in China though sporadic cluster infections have broken out in Beijing, Qingdao and Urumqi since June.Until Monday, China reported around 86,000 cases with the death toll remaining at 4,634 for months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-change-school-curriculum-to-add-positive-covid-19-narrative/story-wcI9zlzLkQ3DEiFNUDJAAK.html

He said he would adopt the “approach taken in Mallya”.Modi’s lawyer Claire Montgomery, who also appeared for Mallya, raised objections on the admissibility of witness statements made under section 161 of the Indian Penal Code, among others. She also referred to remarks on the admissibility issue by legal expert Martin Lau, who was a witness presented by Modi’s team.Statements of several witnesses to Modi’s alleged fraud are part of India’s documentation in the case, including individuals who alleged that they were threatened at the behest of Modi.Modi, who is lodged in the Wandsworth jail, is the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the other by the Enforcement Directorate.Charges against Modi involve a Mumbai branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB) that extended his companies loans worth over Rs 11,300 crore. The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case, relating to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”).Further hearings are scheduled in early December and on January 7, 8 for final submissions.The magistrates court cleared Mallya’s extradition in December 2018. His appeals in the high court were also turned down, but the extradition currently awaits resolution of a legal process, widely believed to be an application for asylum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-s-evidence-on-nirav-modi-admissible-uk-court/story-lgUBChHht4toLFozSvjBVP.html
03-11-2020||World||US law enforcement gears up for possible unrest post Election Day||Federal law agencies in the US are preparing for possible unrest over the outcome of the presidential elections.According to The Hill, The National Security Integration Center (NSIC), a key national security and counterterrorism component within Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) warned in an internal email late last week about protests inside the Beltway.“From November 4 - 7, Civil Unrest is planned throughout Downtown Washington DC. LE Intelligence Agencies have monitored several messages on protesters’ social media sites stating, ‘If you want to throw down come to Washington DC on November 4th,’” reads one of the bullets in the email, as obtained by The Hill.It further reported that the authorities are preparing for the worst, a non-scalable fence has been put around the White House ahead of Election day to create “a buffer” in case protests turn violent. In the DC area and across the country, cities are boarding up their windows as a protection.The chances of violence are expected to rise, irrespective of the result. In New Jersey and New York, pro-Trump demonstrators held up traffic over the weekend, while another group of Trump supporters surrounded a Joe Biden campaign bus in Texas.Three people were shot in Topeka, Kansas, amid a confrontation over individuals allegedly stealing political signs supporting the US President and local Republicans, over the weekend.As many US Citizens in the country voted by mail this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a possibility that the winner of the election may not be declared on November 3, which political observers are scared that tensions could rise as days pass.“We are all looking forward to every vote being counted, no matter how long it takes,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a news conference as quoted by the Hill, adding that they are “preparing to ensure the city’s safety.”“There is no secret that this election is more contentious than in years’ past,” Terence Monahan, the chief of department at the New York Police, said at a press conference last month, according to reports, as per The Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-law-enforcement-gears-up-for-possible-unrest-post-election-day/story-4zZEzqrbajKsG69OvMQ7ZL.html

Some 239 million people are eligible to vote this year.The mail-in ballots could take days or weeks to be counted in some states - meaning a winner might not be declared in the hours after polls close on Tuesday.There is an estimated four million Indian-American population of which about 2.5 million are potential voters in the November 2020 presidential elections. Over 1.3 million Indian-Americans are voters in key battleground states, including Texas, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania.The timing of the start of the polling differs from State to State, mainly due to the different time zones. People mostly in the East coast started trickling down to the polling stations as many States opened up the polling stations at around 6 am (4.30 pm IST). These States include Virginia, New York, New Jersey, and Maine. Polling in California starts at 7 am (8.30 pm IST).Initial reports indicated an early large turnout. In the battle ground State of Pennsylvania, hundreds of people were seen outside polling booths even before the start of the polling.Also Read | US election 2020: Biden-Harris urge US citizens to cast their ballots as voting gets underwayTrump who returned from campaigning in the wee hours of Tuesday urged Americans to vote for him. “VOTE, VOTE, VOTE!” Trump said in a tweet with a short video of him dancing at election rallies.“Vote like your freedoms, your livelihood, and our future depends on it… Because they do!” said Trump, who is seeking to avoid becoming the first incumbent president to lose a re-election since George HW Bush in 1992.Biden also tweeted urging people to vote. “It’s Election Day. Go vote, America!” he tweeted.“In 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in me to help lead this country alongside Barack Obama. Today, I’m asking for your trust once again — this time, in Kamala and me. We can heal the soul of this nation — I promise we won’t let you down,” Biden tweeted.Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, urged voters to not to “allow anything to come between you and your vote. If you have any questions or concerns about voting, reach out to our voter hotline.” In another tweet, she said, “If you’ve already voted, thank you. But we still need your help. Take 20 minutes to help voters in critical battleground states find their polling location. This election is too important to leave anything to chance.” National polls continue to show Biden leading Trump, by a comfortable 8 percentage points.US elections, however, are not determined by the national popular vote, but rather in the 538-member Electoral College, with each candidate needing a majority of 270 to win the presidency.In all but two of the country’s 50 states, either Trump or Biden will win all the electors from each state by winning the popular vote there, with the most populous states holding the most electors.The coronavirus pandemic is a major topic during this election. The US has recorded more cases and more deaths than any other country worldwide, reporting more than 81,000 new infections on Sunday alone. Some 9.2 million people are also affected by the disease.The US economy saw record-breaking 33 per cent growth in the third financial quarter of this year, following a record 31 per cent contraction in the second.The November 3 presidential election has been billed as one of the most divisive in recent American history.Before the campaign closed, 74-year-old Trump toured the key voting battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania while his 77-year-old rival campaigned in Pennsylvania and Ohio, urging Americans to back them in the race for the White House.“To all of our supporters: thank you from the bottom of my heart. You have been there from the beginning, and I will never let you down. Your hopes are my hopes, your dreams are my dreams, and your future is what I am fighting for every single day!” Trump tweeted past midnight.“A vote for Sleepy Joe Biden is a vote to give control of government over to Globalists, Communists, Socialists, and Wealthy Liberal Hypocrites who want to silence, censor, cancel, and punish you. Get out and VOTE #MAGA tomorrow!,” the president wrote in another tweet, attacking Biden.Also Read | Progressive or moderate: How a Biden cabinet could impact US stocksThe Republican Party in a tweet said, “Let’s Make America Great Again and re-elect our fantastic president!” Biden, the former US vice president, said he was “running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president.” “I will work with Democrats and Republicans, and I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as for those who do.“Because that’s the job of a president,” he wrote.If elected as president, Biden said he will rebuild the infrastructure, combat climate change and create millions of good-paying and union jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-long-lines-seen-outside-polling-stations-as-americans-go-to-vote/story-JugCBI1vHC6ggJujAin95M.html

03-11-2020||World||China suspends Jack Ma’s Ant group Shanghai IPO after warning||China has suspended the Shanghai leg of Ant Group Co.’s $35 billion offering, potentially derailing the world’s biggest initial public offering.The Shanghai stock exchange will suspend the listing amid changes in the regulatory environment, it said in a statement Tuesday without providing further details. The debut was expected for Thursday, the same day as the Hong Kong portion.The shock move comes after China’s regulators warned that Jack Ma’s firm faces increased scrutiny and will be subject to the same restrictions on capital and leverage as banks. Ma, Ant’s billionaire co-founder, was summoned to a rare joint meeting on Monday with the country’s central bank and three other top financial regulators.Ant’s decision to list on the Star board, a market launched in Shanghai last year, was seen as a major win for mainland exchanges. The IPO had sparked a frenzy among individual investors, with about $2.8 trillion worth of subscriptions for the Shanghai leg alone. In the preliminary price consultation of its Shanghai IPO, institutional investors subscribed for over 76 billion shares, more than 284 times the initial offering tranche.Ant has faced scrutiny in Chinese state media in recent days after Ma criticized local and global regulators for stifling innovation and not paying sufficient heed to development and opportunities for the young. At a Shanghai conference late last month, he compared the Basel Accords, which set out capital requirements for banks, to a club for the elderly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-suspends-jack-ma-s-ant-group-shanghai-ipo-after-warning/story-4LXPivcOSO23409l69ZGhJ.html
03-11-2020||World||US polls: Election Day shadowed by threats of legal challenges||Even before Election Day, the 2020 race was the most litigated in memory. President Donald Trump is promising more to come.The candidates and parties have enlisted prominent lawyers with ties to Democratic and Republican administrations should that litigation take on a new urgency if a narrow margin in a battleground state becomes the difference between another four years for Trump or Biden.Since the 2000 presidential election, which was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, both parties have enlisted legal teams to prepare for the unlikely event that voting wouldn’t settle the contest. But this year, there is a near presumption that legal fights will ensue and that only a definitive outcome is likely to forestall them.A Pennsylvania case at the Supreme Court pits Donald Verrilli, who was President Barack Obama’s top Supreme Court lawyer, against John Gore, a onetime high-ranking Trump Justice Department official.Trump said this weekend he was headed to court to prevent Pennsylvania from counting mailed ballots that are received in the three days after the election. An extension was ordered by Pennsylvania’s top court. The Supreme Court left that order in place in response to a Republican effort to block it.Trump is unhappy over the decision, even though Pennsylvania will keep those ballots separate from the rest in case of renewed court interest. He spent much of his final days of campaigning railing against it, often employing inaccurate characterizations of the decision as allowing “rampant and unchecked cheating” as well as undermining the law and including street violence. No evidence supports that view.On Sunday, Trump said that as soon as the polls close, “We’re going in with our lawyers.”Aside from what Trump’s telegraphed, though, it’s not clear what other issues may emerge as voters cast their ballots Tuesday, especially since early voting numbers have already eclipsed 2016 figures.There’s already been roughly 300 lawsuits over the election filed in dozens of states across the country, many involving changes to normal procedures because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 230,000 people in the U.S. and sickened more than 9 million. Legal battles ensued over signature matches, drop boxes and secrecy envelopes.Like Pennsylvania, North Carolina also has seen a court fight between Democrats who support extending the deadline for absentee ballots and Republicans who oppose it. The six-day extension was approved by a state court.In Minnesota, late-arriving ballots also will be segregated from the rest of the vote because of ongoing legal proceedings, under a federal appeals court order.Republican lawsuits have also challenged local decisions that could take on national significance in a close election.In Texas, Republicans asked state and federal courts to order election officials in the Houston area not to count ballots dropped off at drive-in locations. The Texas Supreme Court on Sunday denied the GOP’s plea. On Monday, a federal judge also turned away the effort to invalidate the nearly 127,000 votes. Appeals were planned.In Nevada, a state court judge rejected a bid by the Trump campaign and state Republicans to stop the count of mail-in ballots in Las Vegas, the state’s most populous and Democratic-leaning county, though an appeal to the state Supreme Court is being considered.Most of the potential legal challenges are likely to stem from the huge increase in absentee balloting brought on by the pandemic. In Pennsylvania, elections officials won’t start processing those ballots until Election Day, and some counties have said they won’t begin counting those votes until the following day. Mailed ballots that don’t come inside a secrecy envelope have to be discarded, under a state Supreme Court ruling.“I still can’t figure how counting and verifying absentee ballots is going to go in some of the battleground states like Pennsylvania,” said Ohio State University law professor Edward Foley, an election law expert.Trump’s threat of legal action comes as he has been delivering a chaotic closing message during the waning days of the campaign as he lags behind Biden nationally and by narrow margins in key states. The president has made a flurry of last-minute campaign stops trying to hold onto states he won in 2016, including Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina.Over the weekend, he railed against absentee ballots, frustrated by a Supreme Court ruling that didn’t deliver a clear GOP win, continuing a monthslong push to sow unfounded doubt about potential voter fraud.But several conservative justices indicated they’d be open to taking the issue up after the election, especially if those late-arriving ballots could mean the difference in the state.The legal issue is whether the extension ordered by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, relying on voter protections in the Pennsylvania constitution, violated the U.S. Constitution. The argument advanced by Republicans is that the Constitution gives state legislatures — not state courts — the power to decide how electoral votes are awarded, inclu ding whether absentee ballots received after Election Day can be counted.Roughly 20 states allow for late-arriving ballots, but Pennsylvania’s Republican-controlled legislature did not authorize an extension, even with the huge increase in mailed ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic.The Supreme Court generally does not second guess state courts when they rely on their own constitutions. But Democrats were alarmed by Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s reference to the court’s 2000 Bush v. Gore decision that effectively decided the presidential election in favour of George W. Bush. Although it was not the majority opinion in the case, an opinion joined by three conservative justices in 2000 would have ruled for Bush because the Florida Supreme Court’s recount order usurped the legislature’s authority.The Supreme Court has never cited Bush v. Gore as the basis for a decision of the court. Kavanaugh is one of three justices who worked for Bush in the Florida case 20 years ago. Chief Justice John Roberts and new Justice Amy Coney Barrett are the others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-polls-election-day-shadowed-by-threats-of-legal-challenges/story-WYIidC0BSGSryAglZMZFGP.html
03-11-2020||World||Germany to implement antigen tests to keep elderly safe from coronavirus second wave||As Europe tries to break a surge in coronavirus infections, Germany is counting on a new type of test to avoid closing nursing homes to visitors, a move that caused considerable anguish among residents and relatives in the spring.So-called antigen tests, which look for a specific protein on the virus, were first launched months ago. They are cheap and fast, but experts said at the time they are also less accurate than the standard PCR test, which detects even the tiniest genetic trace of the virus.Still, Germany — which has managed to contain the spread of the outbreak better than many of its neighbours — announced recently that it is bulk-buying millions of antigen tests each month.“We have a new strategy,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters Monday. “We can now basically perform rapid tests on visitors to nursing and care homes.”Nursing homes will receive up to 20 free monthly tests per resident. These can be used to test patients, staff and — crucially — visiting relatives, who might be unwitting carriers of Covid-19, posing a potentially devastating threat.“Health insurers will cover the costs for a certain number of visitors each month,” Merkel said. “That’s huge progress in terms of protection.”Germany has one of the world’s oldest populations. More than 24 million people are 60 or older and about 900,000 people live in nursing homes. A further 2.5 million younger people have serious disabilities.That means almost 30% of Germany’s population of 83 million are particularly vulnerable to the virus, Merkel said.“Almost everyone knows somebody they don’t want to infect,” she said.Germany has reported about 550,000 coronavirus cases — less than half the number recorded in Britain, Spain and France. Germany’s confirmed virus death toll of 10,669 is also one-fourth of Britain’s.A Health Ministry spokeswoman told The Associated Press that manufacturers have agreed to supply Germany with 9 million antigen tests in November and 11.5 million tests in December.Experts caution that while antigen tests have become more accurate, they should not be seen as a replacement for the standard PCR method.Scientists in Switzerland recently scrutinized two widely available antigen tests, sold by Chicago-based Abbott Laboratories and Swiss pharma giant Roche. The researchers concluded that out of 100 people infected with the virus, only between 85 and 89 tested positive using the antigen method.“It does fulfill the criteria that are published by the (World Health Organization), which should be more than 80% sensitivity,” said Isabella Eckerle, who heads the Center for Emerging Viral Diseases at the University of Geneva, where the tests were validated.While the tests are less accurate, they provide quick results, she noted.“One big advantage of these tests would be that you, for example, can build up a decentralized testing center,” Eckerle told The AP. “So you build up a tent, let’s say, in front of a school or in a park, and then people can come. And then after 15 minutes, they will know if they are positive or not.”The tests still need to be carried out by a person qualified to take a nasal swab, however.“This test is not a home test,” she said. “It’s nothing that you can do in your home before you visit your grandmother.”Sandra Ciesek, who heads the Institute of Medical Virology at the University Hospital in Frankfurt, says the PCR test remains the “gold standard” for now.But Christian Drosten, one of Germany’s most prominent virologists who developed one the first PCR tests for Covid-19, has suggested that the antigen method has its uses if people take into account its limitations.One distinct feature of the new coronavirus is its ability to multiply rapidly in the throat of newly infected hosts, causing them to spread the virus days before they show symptoms. By the time most people are diagnosed, the amount of virus they are expelling when they speak or even breathe has dropped significantly.While only the PCR tests can determine with near-absolute certainty if someone is infected, argues Drosten, the antigen tests can indicate whether a person is infectious — and therefore a risk to others.Some experts say a negative result from an antigen test could therefore be sufficient to allow people without symptoms to leave quarantine or return to school or work, giving greater freedoms particularly to children and young adults who are less at risk from serious illness.Eckerle, of the University of Geneva, was hesitant.“I would not call them a game changer,” she said. “They are a very nice and very important addition that comes exactly at the right time. But because they are less sensitive than our standard tests, we know that we would probably still miss a small proportion of infectious cases.”That’s a risk some countries may be willing to take as the pandemic drags on and the availability of PCR tests reaches its limits.Antigen tests are already used at nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the United States. Spain warned of faulty tests early in the pandemic, but the World Health Organization has since touted them as an effective tool for low- and middle-income countries.Roche says it can provide over 40 million antigen tests per month worldwide and aims to more than double that by the end of the year. The company declined to disclose the price of its tests but said that “in pandemic situations like this, cost should not be a barrier to accessing diagnostics.”Abbott said it is providing “tens of millions” of its $5 antigen test per month and is working to ramp up capacity.As new restrictions came into force in Germany on Monday with no certainty that they will effectively flatten the curve of infections, Merkel said the country might be able to get as many as 20 million antigen tests in January, offering some prospect of freedom.“Then we can (...) start thinking about whether we can do this for visits to grandparents, not just care homes,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-implement-antigen-tests-to-keep-elderly-safe-from-coronavirus-second-wave/story-MMzmJLv1MeEL3TxK53YFKN.html
03-11-2020||World||Progressive or moderate: How a Biden cabinet could impact US stocks||Should Democratic candidate Joe Biden prevail, as polls suggest, some on Wall Street are looking ahead to his cabinet picks to gauge whether he will govern as a business-friendly moderate or promote progressive legislation that could weigh on sectors such as financials and oil but bolster clean energy. Among the cabinet posts that are most likely to have an effect on stock prices are secretary of the Treasury, which could oversee a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill backed by House Democrats, and Transportation, which will likely oversee a broad infrastructure package to hasten the development of electric vehicles as part of Biden’s $2 trillion climate change plan.Progressive lawmakers are pushing him to exclude any corporate executives or lobbyists from potential positions, people involved told Reuters. Biden has said he would consider Republicans for his cabinet as well, though that is unlikely for Treasury chief because it would set up a major fight with progressives who have their eye on that role in particular, according to people close to the campaign.Overall, the former vice president leads by 10 points in national polls, although his lead is narrower in the battleground states that will likely tip the election. “A cabinet that is not dominated by the progressive end of the Democratic spectrum would be more favorably viewed by the market” and dampen fears of increasing regulations under a Biden Administration, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. The Covid related recession and the so-called “K-shaped” recovery’s divergence of fortunes between the wealthy and everyone else, have boosted a fundamental progressive argument that American capitalism grossly favours the rich and needs to be reformed.Progressive policies tilt toward more government-run healthcare, providing subsidies for college tuition and increasing worker wages, while moderates support privately run healthcare plans and are less inclined to support government spending on large projects like the Green New Deal. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a progressive who is seen as one of Biden’s possible picks to lead the Treasury, has called for strengthening the walls between commercial and investment banks, boosting consumer protections and allowing the US Postal Service to partner with credit unions to provide basic consumer banking services. Fed Governor Lael Brainard and former Treasury deputy secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin are also seen among the most likely selections for the Treasury post. Another possible pick is Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo, according to the Washington Post. The Biden campaign and representatives for Warren, Raimondo and Brainard did not respond to requests for comment. “Brainard would be a strong and safe choice for a Biden administration,” said Kevin Gallagher, director of the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University. He cited her experience working at the Treasury under the Obama administration, a previous role at the White House under former President Bill Clinton and her current role as a member of the Federal Reserve Board. “The question is whether she is seen enough in tune with the more progressive wing of Biden’s coalition,” Gallagher said.While Warren and Brainard are qualified, “the foundation of Warren’s career has been attacking the banking industry,” Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in a September research note, and that would “likely rattle investor confidence.” Amy Wu Silverman, Equity Derivatives Strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said in a recent research note that the market appeared to be underpricing the possibility of cabinet picks like Warren who would be negative for the market. The S&P 500 financial sector is down 1% since the first Trump-Biden debate on Sept. 29, compared with a 2.8% decline in the S&P 500 index as a whole, according to Refinitiv data. A Warren selection would likely come only with a blue wave that gives Democrats at least a two or three seat advantage in the Senate so as not to allow Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican, to select Warren’s replacement, said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. Biden’s “margins in the Senate are going to be the really important thing to watch here”, he said. A lower-profile pick that may have wide market implications will be the secretary of Transportation, which Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both filled with a member of the opposing party in a show of bipartisanship. Shares of clean energy companies and electric vehicle stocks have jumped over the last month in anticipation of a Biden victory.“In an environment where you could see major infrastructure spending and additional regulation in terms of electric vehicles and fuel standards, this may be a relatively important economic position,” Chiavarone said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/progressive-or-moderate-how-a-biden-cabinet-could-impact-us-stocks/story-cwZMWvVVHXJHVOUdKIPmSM.html
03-11-2020||World||Donald Trump, Joe Biden cede stage to voters for Election Day verdict||After a campaign marked by rancor and fear, Americans on Tuesday decide between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, selecting a leader to steer a nation battered by a surging pandemic that has killed more than 231,000 people, cost millions their jobs and reshaped daily life.Nearly 100 million Americans voted early, and now it falls to Election Day voters to finish the job, ending a campaign that was upended by the coronavirus and defined by tensions over who could best address it. Each candidate declared the other fundamentally unfit to lead a nation grappling with Covid-19 and facing foundational questions about racial justice and economic fairness.Biden entered Election Day with multiple paths to victory while Trump, playing catch-up in a number of battleground states, had a narrower but still feasible road to clinch 270 Electoral College votes. Control of the Senate was at stake, too: Democrats needed to net three seats if Biden captured the White House to gain control of all of Washington for the first time in a decade. The House was expected to remain under Democratic control.Voters braved long lines and the threat of the virus to cast ballots as they chose between two starkly different visions of America for the next four years. The record-setting early vote — and legal skirmishing over how it will be counted — drew unsupported allegations of fraud from Trump, who refused to guarantee he would honor the election’s result.Fighting to the end for every vote, Biden was headed to Philadelphia and his native Scranton on Tuesday as part of a closing get-out-the-vote effort before awaiting election results in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, was visiting Detroit, a heavily Black city in battleground Michigan. Both of their spouses were headed out, too, as the Democrats reached for a clear victory.Trump, after a morning appearance on his favoured network, Fox News Channel, planned to visit his campaign headquarters in Virginia. He invited hundreds of supporters to an election night party in the East Room of the White House.The hard-fought campaign left voters on both sides eager to move on.“I just want it to be done,” said Starlet Holden, a 26-year-old medical biller from New York City, who planned to vote for Biden but spoke for many on both sides of the campaign.On their final full day on the campaign trail, Trump and Biden broke sharply over the mechanics of the vote itself while visiting the most fiercely contested battleground, Pennsylvania.The Republican president threatened legal action to block the counting of ballots received after Election Day. If Pennsylvania ballot counting takes several days, as is allowed, Trump claimed without evidence that “cheating can happen like you have never seen.”In fact, there are roughly 20 states that allow mail-in ballots received after Election Day to be counted — up to nine days and longer in some states. Litigation has centered on just a few where states have made changes in large part due to the coronavirus.Biden told voters in Pennsylvania that the very fabric of the nation was at stake and offered his own election as the firmest rebuke possible to a president who he said had spent “four years dividing us at every turn.”“Tomorrow’s the beginning of a new day. Tomorrow we can put an end to a president that’s left hardworking Americans out in the cold!” Biden said in Pittsburgh. “If you elect me as president, I’m gonna act to heal this country.”Trump argued, at a stop in Wisconsin, that Biden was “not what our country needs.” He added: “This isn’t about — yeah, it is about me, I guess, when you think about it.”For Trump, the election stood as a judgment on his four years in office, a term in which he bent Washington to his will, challenged faith in its institutions and changed how America was viewed across the globe. In a country divided along lines of race and class, he often acted as an insurgent against the very government he led, undercutting its scientists and bureaucracy and doing battle with the media.The nation braced for what was to come — and a result that might not be known for days.A new anti-scale fence was erected around the White House. And in downtowns ranging from New York to Denver to Minneapolis, workers boarded up businesses lest the vote lead to unrest of the sort that broke out earlier this year amid protests over racial inequality.Just a short walk from the White House, for block after block, stores had their windows and doors covered. Some kept just a front door open, hoping to attract a little business.Both candidates voted early, but first lady Melania Trump was set to cast her ballot Tuesday near Mar-a-Lago, the couple’s estate in Palm Beach, Florida.The candidates blitzed through the battleground states on Monday, with Biden also pushing into Ohio, a state once thought to be safe for Trump. The president, for his part, packed in five rallies, Air Force One streaking across the sky as he drew crowds in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and then back in Michigan again.His finale stretched past midnight in Grand Rapids, where he had also held his last rally in 2016. It marked the end of an era in American politics, one in part defined by the massive and exuberant gatherings that the president continued to hold despite warnings from his government’s own public health experts to avoid crowds during the pandemic.The next president will inherit an anxious nation, reeling from a once-in-a-century heath crisis that has closed schools and businesses and that is worsening as the weather turns cold.Trump in Grand Rapids insisted anew that the nation was “rounding the turn” on the virus. But Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, broke with the president and joined a chorus of Trump administration scientists sounding the alarm about the current spike in infections.“We are entering the most concerning and most deadly phase of this pandemic,” Birx wrote in a memo distributed to top administration officials. She added that the nation was not implementing “balanced” measures needed to slow the spread of the virus. One recipient confirmed the contents that were initially reported Monday by The Washington Post.The pandemic has shadowed the campaign, which has largely been a referendum of Trump’s handling of the virus.In Concord, New Hampshire, 70-year-old Linda Eastman said she was giving her vote to Trump, saying, “Maybe he wasn’t perfect with the coronavirus, but I think he did the best that he could with what he had.”In Virginia Beach, it was a vote for Biden from 54-year-old Gabriella Cochrane, who said she thought the former vice president would “surround himself with the brightest and the best” to fight the pandemic.The challenge of counting a record-setting early vote added a layer of uncertainty to an election marked by suspicions fueled by an incumbent who has consistently trailed in the polls.Trump, in Pennsylvania, zeroed in on the state’s process to count mail-in votes that arrive after Election Day, vowing that “we’re going in with our lawyers” as soon as the polls close. He tweeted — without evidence — that “violence in the street” could follow the Supreme Court’s decision to grant an extension to count the votes arriving after Tuesday.Trump offered himself to voters as the same outsider he first pitched to voters four years ago, insisting he’s still not a politician. Presenting himself as the last barrier protecting an American way of life under siege from radical forces, he repeatedly tried to portray Biden, who is considered a moderate Democrat, as a tool of extreme leftists.Biden, for his part, cast Trump as an incompetent leader in a time of crisis, trying to connect what he saw as the president’s failures in containing the virus and on other matters to the everyday lives of Americans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-cede-stage-to-voters-for-election-day-verdict/story-A2z8Eo9pvY72IulwEtyj9O.html
03-11-2020||World||‘Why are you killing us?’: Afghans mourn those killed in IS attack in Kabul University||Afghanistan declared a national day of mourning Tuesday to honor the 22 people killed in a horrific attack a day earlier on Kabul University, which was claimed by the Islamic State group. Most of those killed were students and another 27 people were injured, some of them critically.Monday’s brutal, hours-long assault was the second attack on an educational institution in the Afghan capital in as many weeks amid a soaring rise in violence and chaos across Afghanistan, even as Taliban insurgents and government negotiators hold peace talks in the Gulf state of Qatar.The Islamic State affiliate also claimed the earlier attack on Oct. 24 that killed 24 students at a tutoring center. The attack occurred in the mostly Shiite neighborhood of Dasht-e-Barchi.The IS affiliate has declared war on the country’s minority Shiites and has claimed a number of vicious attacks since emerging in eastern Afghanistan in 2014.Outside Kabul University Tuesday a small group of demonstrators gathered demanding a cease-fire and urging the government to withdraw from the peace talks until a permanent end to hostilities is declared. Some held signs reading “why are you killing us?”Mohammad Rahed, a policy and public administration student killed in the attack, posted a video to social media just days before the assault, where he urged people to live each moment and to “live with a smile.” The video was widely shared after the attack.His father told local media his son wanted to be president of Afghanistan and “honestly serve my people.”Meanwhile, President Ashraf Ghani warned that the perpetrators would be pursued.“We will not remain silent. We will take the revenge,” he said in a video message Tuesday. “Our brave forces are after you everywhere and they will eliminate you.”The brutal assault on the university was condemned by the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Human rights groups have expressed their outrage and Torek Farhadi, a political commentator in Kabul and former government advisor called for a “transparent investigation” into security in the Afghan capital to determine how heavily armed gunmen gained access to the country’s largest educational institution.The Islamic State is not part of peace talks and despite their claims of responsibility, the government has blamed Taliban for the attacks. Taliban, like the Afghan security forces, are fighting the Islamic State and under an agreement signed with the US, the Taliban have committed to fighting militancy, specifically the Islamic State.The government’s lead negotiator in peace talks, Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, called for an immediate cease-fire announcement from the Taliban.“If Taliban is committed to end brutal killing of people then should accept ceasefire,” Stanekzai tweeted Tuesday.The Taliban, which condemned the attack on the university and denied involvement within hours of its start, have refused to declare a cease-fire saying it would be part of the negotiations.But if not a cease-fire, then a significant reduction in violence has taken on increasing importance as Washington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on Monday made a surprise visit to Pakistan urging Islamabad to urge the insurgent movement to reduce violence.Pakistan has been critical in pushing Taliban into talks. Even as the Islamic insurgent group ousted by the U.S.-led coalition in 2001 maintains its political office in Doha, where talks are being held, its leadership councils are located in Pakistan.Khalilzad brokered a peace pact with the Taliban that was signed in February and seen at the time as the country’s best chance at peace in more than 40 years of war. The peace agreement which is to allow U.S. and NATO troops withdraw from Afghanistan after 19 years, it also paved the way for the peace talks currently underway.In a series of tweets Tuesday Khalilzad condemned the attack but also warned “this barbaric attack is NOT an opportunity for the government and the Taliban to score points against each other. There is a common enemy here.”Family members of the victims mourned their loved ones on local TV and called for the government to investigate security lapses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-are-you-killing-us-afghans-mourn-those-killed-in-is-attack-in-kabul-university/story-VY6kKLEDzQfF7XWSrTxzYL.html

The Interior Ministry will specify the details later in the day and an edict will be issued,” Attal told BFM TV.France reported a record 52,518 new Covid-19 cases on Monday and the number hospitalised rose by more than a 1,000 for the fourth time in eight days, as the pandemic shows no signs of abating despite the new lockdown.France’s Covid-19 death toll rose by 416 to 37,435, compared with an increase of 231 on Sunday and a months-high seven-day moving average of 345.Health Minister Olivier Veran told RTL radio that one Parisian was becoming infected with Covid-19 every 30 seconds, while a Parisian is admitted to hospital with the disease every 15 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-reinstate-paris-evening-curfew-as-covid-19-worsens/story-LRrH5ANCRGm2TDxFOI1KmM.html

She cannot ignore the fact that every 30 seconds, there is a Parisian who has been contaminated,” said Veran.“We want to save the Parisians and the French people and we do that with determination and consistency,” he added.France reported a record 52,518 new Covid-19 on Monday, while the country’s Covid-19 death toll rose by 416 to 37,435.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-parisian-infected-with-covid-19-every-30-seconds-says-official/story-PhwCRHQF7fIhA0kW9topyL.html
03-11-2020||World||Iran’s supreme leader mocks US election using Donald Trump’s words||Iran’s supreme leader mocked America’s presidential election Tuesday in a televised address, quoting President Donald Trump’s own baseless claims about voter fraud to criticize the vote as Tehran marked the 1979 US Embassy hostage crisis.Click here for complete coverage of US elections 2020Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated a long-standing Iranian position that it didn’t matter whether Trump or Joe Biden wins the vote, but the stakes couldn’t be higher for the Islamic Republic.Another four years could see Trump’s maximum-pressure campaigns further expand as it crushes the Iranian economy and stops Tehran from openly selling its crude oil abroad. Biden meanwhile has said he would consider re-entering Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, providing possible relief to the beleaguered Iranian rial.“If you look at their own situation, it’s interesting to watch. The incumbent president, who is supposed to hold the elections, says this is the most-rigged US election throughout history,” Khamenei said, not acknowledging that individual US states run the vote. “Who says this? The sitting president who is arranging the elections himself. His opponent says Trump intends to widely cheat. This is American democracy.”Khamenei added that the result of the vote “is none of our business, meaning it won’t influence our policy at all. Our policy is clear and well-calculated and people coming and going will have no impact on it.”Khamenei, 81, as supreme leader has final say on all matters of state in Iran. He approved the efforts at reaching the nuclear deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.But Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, complaining it didn’t address Iran’s ballistic missile program nor its regional policies. Iran later withdrew from all the deal’s limits, though Tehran still allows UN inspectors access to nuclear sites. Satellite photos show it is now starting new construction work at its Natanz nuclear site, which was targeted in a reported sabotage attack in July.Also Read | Iran accused of hacking US voter data before election dayKhamenei spoke as the coronavirus pandemic forced authorities to cancel a planned commemoration of the Nov 4, 1979 takeover of the US Embassy in Tehran. That started a 444-day hostage crisis that transfixed America and still affects relations between Washington and Iran today.Anti-Americanism remains a cornerstone of Iranian policy, over four decades after the takeover.“Such an empire will not last long. It’s obvious that when a regime reaches this point, it will not live for much longer and will be destroyed,” Khamenei said of America. “Of course, some of them if they take office will destroy America sooner, and some others if elected will cause America to be destroyed a bit later.”Khamenei’s speech was marking the birth of Prophet Muhammad based on the Iranian calendar and he began his remarks with comments deeply critical of French President Emmanuel Macron over his defense of caricatures of the prophet, which has sparked protests by Muslims across the world amid two attacks in France. The supreme leader accused France of harboring “terrorist” groups targeting the Islamic Republic after earlier supporting Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during his 1980s war against Iran.He also called for an end of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, calling it a “bitter incident.”“The lands that were occupied by Armenia should be returned to Azerbaijan and security of Armenians of their lands should be provided,” Khamenei said. “There should be no violation of international borders and terrorists should not come close to our borders. If they get close, there will be an encounter” with Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-supreme-leader-mocks-us-election-using-donald-trump-s-words/story-RMdk8vzjFtU9feWGzv5i0N.html

03-11-2020||World||China rejects report it had seized territory from Nepal as ‘unfounded, rumour’||China on Tuesday dismissed a media report which said it had seized territory from Nepal as “completely unfounded” and “pure rumour”.The foreign ministry’s spokesperson Wang Wenbin was reacting to a report in the Daily Telegraph published on Tuesday that quoted Nepalese politicians as saying that Beijing had surreptitiously annexed more than 150 hectares on the Nepal-Tibet border, on the Nepalese side.“I want to point out that the report is completely unfounded rumour,” Wang said when asked to comment on the news report.The report “is not based on fact. It is a pure rumour,” Wang repeated when he was pressed further for a response.In October, Chinese state media had denied similar reports that said China had encroached Nepalese land in the Humla district.“The buildings that some in Nepal have accused China of encroaching on its land in Humla district falls within Chinese territory and is actually a newly-built village in Burang county in Ali, southwest China’s Tibet Autonomous Region,” the nationalist tabloid Global Times had said in a report on October 16.The report had blamed India for “hyping” the incident and accused the Nepalese opposition of making the allegations at the behest of New Delhi.“The main opposition Nepalese Congress, which has been hyping the incident, is considered as a pro-India force,” the Global Times report said.It then went to refer to the issue of India-Nepal territorial dispute.“India actually has a long-running territorial dispute with Nepal. The Indian government included a disputed area with Nepal to its new territory map in 2019, triggering conflicts between the two countries. In response, Nepal published a new map, which included Kalapani and other areas into its territory,” the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rejects-report-it-had-seized-territory-from-nepal-as-unfounded-rumour/story-XTn6FLihehGW3qWtCWsPhK.html
03-11-2020||World||Study finds ‘7 forms of disease’ in mild Covid-19, may help in developing vaccine||Scientists have shown that there are seven “forms of disease” in mild Covid-19, and that the novel coronavirus infection leaves behind significant changes in the immune system even after 10 weeks, findings which may aid in the treatment of patients, and in the development of a potent vaccine.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The study, published in the journal Allergy, involving 109 recovered Covid-19 patients and 98 healthy individuals in the control group, showed that various symptoms related to Covid-19 occur in groups. In the research, scientists, including those from the Medical University of Vienna in Austria, identified seven groups of symptoms including “flu-like symptoms” with fever, chills, fatigue and cough, “common cold-like symptoms” with rhinitis, sneezing, dry throat and nasal congestion, and “joint and muscle pain”. They said patients may also experience “eye and mucosal inflammation” symptoms, “lung problems” with pneumonia and shortness of breath, “gastrointestinal problems” including diarrhoea, nausea and headache, and “loss of sense of smell and taste and other symptoms”. “In the latter group we found that loss of smell and taste predominantly affects individuals with a ‘young immune system,’ measured by the number of immune cells -- T lymphocytes -- that have recently emigrated from the thymus gland,” said Winfried F. Pickl, a co-author of the study from the Medical University of Vienna. “This means that we were able to clearly distinguish systemic (groups one and three) from organ-specific forms (groups six and seven) of primary Covid-19 disease,” Pickl said. From the analysis, the scientists established that Covid-19 leaves behind long detectable changes in the blood of recovered patients, very similar to a fingerprint. Citing an example, they said the number of granulocytes, which are otherwise responsible in the immune system for fighting bacterial pathogens, is significantly lower than normal in the Covid-19 group. “However, both the CD4 and CD8 T cell compartment developed memory cells and CD8 T cells remained strongly activated. This indicates that the immune system is still intensively engaged with the disease several weeks after initial infection,” Pickl explained. According to the researchers, increased levels of antibody-producing immune cells were detected in the blood of recovered patients. The higher the fever of the affected patient during the mild course of the disease, the higher were the antibody levels against the virus, they said. “Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the disease and help us in the development of potential vaccines, since we now have access to promising biomarkers and can perform even better monitoring,” the scientists said. “Above all, the study shows that the human immune system “doubles up” when defending against Covid-19 with the combined action of immune cells and antibodies,” they noted. According to the study, the immune cells are also able to memorise certain “moves” on the part of the virus and respond to them. “Now it is a matter of implementing these findings and using them for the development of highly-effective Covid-19 vaccines,” the researchers said.

The exercise was an “important opportunity to work in concert with like-minded nations to support a secure, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-backed-quad-alliance-starts-joint-naval-exercises-in-indian-waters/story-ypskD9Xk6d57vnO2sHOq2L.html
03-11-2020||World||China to halt key Australian imports in sweeping retaliation||China has ordered traders to stop purchasing at least seven categories of Australian commodities, ratcheting up tensions with a key trading partner in its most sweeping retaliation yet. Commodities traders in China won’t be able to import products including coal, barley, copper ore and concentrate, sugar, timber, wine and lobster, according to people familiar with the situation. The government has ordered the halt to begin on Friday, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is sensitive.The notice was verbally relayed to major traders in meetings in recent weeks, one of the people said. Iron ore, Australia’s biggest export to China, won’t be included in the halt, the people said. The order represents a dramatic deterioration in ties, which have been strained since Australia barred Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network in 2018 on national security grounds. Relations have been in free fall since Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government in April called for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus.“China seems determined to punish Australia and make it an example to other countries,” said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at Sydney-based think tank the Lowy Institute. “They want to show there’s a cost for political disagreements.”China has already barred meat imports from four Australian slaughterhouses, delayed lobster shipments from clearing customs, slapped tariffs of more than 80% on barley, and said it won’t allow timber from Queensland state because of pests. Wine is also under an anti-dumping investigation while Chinese power stations and steel mills have been told to stop using Australian coal. Cotton purchases have also been suspended.Read more | China shops for graphene clothes for PLA soldiers at Ladakh border, flaunts itChina’s relevant departments conducted inspection and general quarantine measures on certain Australian goods according to laws and regulations, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing Tuesday in Beijing. China hopes Australia will do more so that bilateral relations can get back to normal soon, he said. China’s customs authority and Ministry of Commerce didn’t respond to faxes seeking comment. At least one customs clearance company started halting shipments across the seven types of products on Tuesday, a person said. China will also ban shipments of Australian wheat from a yet-to-be-disclosed date, according to the South China Morning Post, which earlier reported the impending bans on other Australian commodities.Australia’s government is working with domestic industry and making enquiries with the Chinese authorities about the reports, according to an emailed statement from Trade Minister Simon Birmingham. “China has consistently denied any targeting of Australia and spoken about its commitment to trade rules,” the statement said. “In the spirit of their statements, we urge relevant Chinese authorities to address concerns of sectors like the seafood trade to ensure their goods can enter the Chinese market free of disruptions.”China is Australia’s most important trading partner, with agricultural shipments alone totaling about A$16 billion ($11.3 billion) in 2018-19. With Australia in the midst of its first recession in almost 30 years, the widespread trade measures from Beijing couldn’t come at a worse time for Morrison’s government.Read more | From BRICS to SCO: India, China leaders to have face time at 5 summits in NovemberAustralia is the world’s most China-dependent developed economy and finalized a comprehensive free-trade agreement with Beijing in 2015, a year after President Xi Jinping made a state visit.

Australia’s former treasurer Joe Hockey, who helped oversee the trade deal, on Tuesday accused Beijing of bullying and immature behavior.“The problem is China just doesn’t want to talk,” Hockey, who until January served as Australia’s ambassador to the U.S., said in a Bloomberg Television interview from Washington. “Instead they just want to react aggressively and try to bully us. And bullying never works with Australia.”McGregor, who said he doesn’t know the veracity or specific details of all the recent trade reprisals, called Morrison’s demand for a coronavirus probe a miscalculation.“Australia and China were always going to be edging toward separate paths,” he said. “But the call for the inquiry quickly turned the relationship into a very ugly divorce.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-halt-key-australian-imports-in-sweeping-retaliation/story-KS6VeSJvFVgG2ZAmICNVGK.html
03-11-2020||World||Vienna attacker was convicted for terrorism previously, says top Austrian official||Austria’s top security official says the attacker killed in Vienna was a 20-year-old dual citizen of Austria and North Macedonia who had a previous terrorism conviction.Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told Austria’s APA news agency that 15 house searches have taken place and several people have been arrested.Five people have died, including an assailant, and 17 others were wounded in a shooting in the heart of Vienna hours before a coronavirus lockdown started, Austrian authorities said Tuesday.Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said two men and two women have died from their injuries in the attack Monday evening. A suspected attacker, who was carrying an assault rifle and a fake suicide vest, was also shot and killed by police.Vienna’s hospital service said seven people were in life-threatening condition Tuesday after the attack, the Austrian news agency APA reported. In total, 17 people were being treated in hospitals, with gunshot wounds but also cuts.Nehammer said that initial investigations indicate the suspect who was killed had sympathized with the Islamic State group. Police searched his apartment and other premises as well, APA reported.“We experienced an attack last night by at least one Islamist terrorist,” Nehammer told reporters. He declined to elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation.Authorities were still trying to determine whether further attackers may be on the run, he said. People in Vienna were urged to stay at home if possible on Tuesday and children did not have to go to school. Some 1,000 police officers were on duty in Vienna on Tuesday morning.Among those wounded in the attack was a police officer, said Nehammer. The 28-year-old officer was in the hospital but was no longer in a life-threatening condition.The shooting began shortly after 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) Monday near Vienna’s main synagogue as many people were enjoying a last night of open restaurants and bars before a month-long coronavirus lockdown, which started at midnight.Vienna police chief Gerhard Puerstl said the attacker was killed at 8:09 p.m.Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said that “we are victims of a despicable terror attack in the federal capital.”Unverified footage posted on social media showed a gunman walking through the streets, apparently shooting at people at random, wounding several. It was unclear whether the person seen shooting was the same individual in each video.Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least one person shoot at people sitting outside at bars in the street below his window near the city’s main synagogue.“They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,” Hofmeister said. “All these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown.”Authorities said residents have uploaded 20,000 videos of the attack to police.The attack drew swift condemnation and assurances of support from leaders around Europe, including from French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country has experienced three Islamist attacks in recent weeks, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.“The Islamist terror is our common enemy,” Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted. “The battle against these murderers and their instigators is our common fight.”U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted Monday night as he prepared for his final rally ahead of Election Day: “Our prayers are with the people of Vienna after yet another vile act of terrorism in Europe.”“These evil attacks against innocent people must stop,” Trump added. “The U.S. stands with Austria, France, and all of Europe in the fight against terrorists, including radical Islamic terrorists.”Austria’s military has provided 75 soldiers to guard key sites in Vienna, freeing up police to continue the investigation. Germany and Hungary have also offered to send tactical police units to support their Austrian colleagues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vienna-attacker-was-convicted-for-terrorism-previously-says-top-austrian-official/story-ndsS2SU8yP3xjBru15nOdI.html
03-11-2020||World||Budapest airport’s access to Covid-19 funds blocked by Hungary||The Hungarian government blocked Budapest Airport from accessing emergency Covid-19 funding, according to two people familiar with the matter.Due to a dramatic drop in air traffic related to the coronavirus pandemic, the airport had applied for a 50 million-euro ($58 million) short-term loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development through its “Solidarity Package” program.The request for support came amid job cuts at the international hub as air traffic collapsed by more than 99% this spring. Last month, Bloomberg reported that Budapest Airport Zrt. was the subject of an unsolicited purchase offer by allies of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.The funding, requested to stabilize the airport’s financial situation, ensure business continuity and pay obligations such as salaries, was vetoed by the Hungarian government in May, when it instructed the decision-making body of the EBRD to remove the application from the agenda, one of the people said.The second person said it was “extraordinary” for a government to block investment into its own country and may have the affect of pushing down the valuation of a strategic asset. The EBRD has provided lending support to other airports in the region.When asked about the airport’s request for support being blocked by Hungary, the development bank said “no comment.” The Hungarian government didn’t respond to a request for comment.A consortium including partially state-owned oil refiner Mol Nyrt. mandated Daniel Jellinek, the head of a local real-estate development company Indotek that did business with Orban’s family this year, to approach the airport’s owners.Jellinek acknowledged the talks after Bloomberg published its report on the offer, without providing further details. No details about the amount offered nor Orban’s exact role in the process have been disclosed.Orban has made no secret of his interest in returning the international flight hub, which was first sold to private owners in 2005, to state control. But its high valuation has long kept it out of the government’s reach.The pandemic has changed that. The airport said in April that it had lost almost all of its air traffic that month compared to the previous year and a reduction in headcount was “inevitable.” In September it announced 236 job cuts.The airport’s three owners -- GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, a Canadian pension fund and AviAlliance, an airport management company that in turn is owned by another Canadian fund -- have no current plans to sell the airport, which was one of the world’s fastest-growing mid-size hubs before the pandemic.Jellinek’s Indotek, which this year bought the stake of Orban’s son-in-law, Istvan Tiborcz, in a listed real-estate company, has recently been expanding its portfolio. Last month the company bought a 24% stake in the road haulage firm Waberer’s International.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/budapest-airport-s-access-to-covid-19-funds-blocked-by-hungary/story-g6XrpQBSjSAbURB6d5e7LN.html
03-11-2020||World||China seized 150 hectares of Nepal, hint at rising anger along border: Report||China has annexed 150 hectares of Nepal, alleged the Himalayan nation’s politicians, adding that the annexations of Nepalese land are just the beginning of heightened Chinese aggression along the border. According to a report by the UK-based Telegraph, Chinese allegedly began seizing Nepali land in five frontier districts in May, sending members of its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) across undefended areas of the border.In Humla districts, PLA troops crossed the border into the Limi Valley and Hilsa, moving stone pillars which had previously demarcated the boundary further into Nepalese territory before constructing alleged military bases. The Daily Telegraph has seen images of the bases.PLA soldiers also allegedly moved border pillars further into Nepalese territory in the district of Gorkha.Further annexations occurred in the Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Sankuwasabha districts after Chinese engineers in the Tibet Autonomous Region diverted the flow of rivers acting as a natural boundary and claimed the previously submerged Nepalese territory.“Why should China come over into Nepal, when China is already sixty times the size of our small country?” Telegraph quoted Jivan Bahadur Shahi, a lawmaker in the Nepali Congress Party as saying.Nepali politicians have accused the government of staying silent for fear of angering their most important trading partner and regional ally.The Telegraph reported that China has pursued a more aggressive foreign policy under President Xi Jinping whose signature Belt and Road projects aim to construct trade and transport links from the country across Asia and into Europe.The land grab in Humla district appears to be motivated by the strategic view the district’s mountain peaks offer over the Himalayas, according to Nepalese politicians.In 2009, Chinese troops first crossed over into the undefended district and constructed a veterinary centre for livestock.Shahi objected to the construction but was told by the Nepali government the building would have a positive impact on the livelihoods of impoverished local residents who typically make a living by herding yak and goats.Shahi said around 30 hectares of Nepali territory have been seized in the Limi Valley. Chinese troops constructing an additional nine buildings, including military bases, according to Shahi.He said China annexed more land in the Humla district in June, in Hilsa, taking the total allegedly seized in these districts to 70 hectares.“The local people are very scared, particularly because they previously depended on Chinese traders to buy commodities like rice, bread and salt,” explained Shahi.“They are worried that if they raise their voices on the issue then it will disturb everything for them,” he added. In the first week of May, China had moved the pillars in the remote mountainous village of Rui awoke incorporating part of it into the Tibet Autonomous Region, according to Rakesh Kumar Mishra, a committee member of the opposition Janta Samajh Party.Mishra said around 60 hectares of land were annexed.Mishra and Shahi both accused the Nepalese government of inaction.The Nepalese Surveying and Mapping Department, which claimed China had purposefully altered the course of rivers acting as a natural border with Nepal to claim 33 hectares of land was quickly dismissed by Nepalese government sources.Nepal is currently ruled by the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), which sees the Communist Party of China (CCP), as an ideological brother, The Telegraph reported.China also contributes to the majority of vital foreign direct investment into Nepal, which is one of Asia’s poorest nations.“The people of Nepal need other countries to help them and protect its territory since it is such a small, landlocked country,” said Mishra.The Chinese side has built buildings at a distance of around two kilometres from border in the Lapcha Limi area of the Humla District. China in recent years has been carrying out construction works near the border with Nepal for several years.While the Government of Nepal has remained mum over the issue, the Chinese Mission in Nepal has issued a release claiming the building is built in their side and asked Nepali authorities to verify the border points.“The buildings mentioned in the media have been verified to be on the Chinese side of the China-Nepal border. The Nepali side may make verification again,” a Chinese Embassy spokesperson said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seized-150-hectares-of-nepal-hint-at-rising-anger-along-border-report/story-HbjI9ojCPwOV7c2CAKYXCP.html

Among other things, Feinerman said the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which makes federal agencies accountable to the public by outlining a detailed process for enacting regulations.The decision marked the latest turn in a complex legal battle over the rule that has been among President Donald Trump’s most aggressive steps in overhauling the nation’s immigration system. The Chicago lawsuit, filed by the Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Cook County, was among numerous legal challenges.Under the Trump administration policy, immigration officials could deny permanent residency to legal immigrants over their use of food stamps, Medicaid, housing vouchers or other public benefits. Green card applicants had to show they wouldn’t be burdens to the country or “public charges.”Federal law already required those seeking permanent residency or legal status to prove they wouldn’t be a “public charge.” But the Trump administration rule included a wider range of programs that could disqualify them.Immigrant rights advocates deemed it a “wealth test,” while public health experts said it would mean poorer health outcomes and rising costs as low-income migrants chose between needed services and their bid to stay in the country legally. Several cities said such a chilling effect was already evident.Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel for ICIRR, called the rule an “attack” on legal immigration and criticized the way the Trump administration has instituted policies.“We may or may not get a new administration,” he said. “If we do, we’d like to see a lot of this damage undone and hopefully some legislative changes that will actually benefit immigrants instead of scaring them away.”Officials in Cook County, which runs one of the nation’s largest public health systems, argued that when people lack health care coverage, they’re less likely to seek preventative care and rely on more expensive emergency care. That also would increase the risk of communicable diseases.“As we all continue to be impacted by Covid-19, it is vital that no one is fearful of accessing health care. The court’s decision to block enforcement of the Public Charge Rule re-opens doors for immigrants to access vital services like health care,” Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said in a statement.The US Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 vote in January that the rule could take effect, but enforcement was halted by a federal judge in New York because of the coronavirus pandemic. But by September, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed that hold and the rule took effect nationwide.The Trump administration has touted the rule as a way to ensure only those who are self-sufficient come to the US, one of many steps to try to move the country toward a system that focuses on immigrants’ skills instead of emphasizing the reunification of families.US Immigration and Citizenship Services ceased applying the rule to pending applications and petitions after the ruling in Chicago, agency spokesman Dan Hetlage said in a statement issued Monday evening.“USCIS will fully comply with the decision and issue additional forthcoming guidance while the agency reviews the decision,” he said.If there are further appeals, there could be another legal wrinkle in the case.In June, the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Feinerman’s decision blocking enforcement of the rule in Illinois while the merits of the case could be decided. It was a 2-1 decision, with then-Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett dissenting. Barrett was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice last month and would have to recuse herself if the case reached the nation’s highest court.___Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sophiatareen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-strikes-down-trump-immigration-rule-denying-green-card-to-immigrants/story-qJeAFnzQpsXpjGGfpOeTKL.html
03-11-2020||World||4 dead in Vienna shooting; attacker sympathized with IS||Austria’s top security official said that four people have died — including one assailant — and fifteen people were wounded in a shooting in the heart of Vienna late Monday.Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told reporters Tuesday that two men and a woman have died from their injuries. A suspected attacker, who was carrying an assault rifle and a fake suicide vest, was also shot and killed by police.Nehammer said that initial investigations indicate that the suspect who was killed had sympathized with the Islamic State group.“We experienced an attack last night by at least one Islamist terrorist,” Nehammer told reporters. He declined to elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation.Authorities were still trying to determine whether further attackers may be on the run, he said. People in Vienna have been urged to stay at home if possible Tuesday.Among the fifteen people injured in the attack was a police officer, said Nehammer.The shooting began shortly after 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) Monday near Vienna’s main synagogue as many people were enjoying a last night of open restaurants and bars before the start of a coronavirus lockdown.“We are victims of a despicable terror attack in the federal capital that is still ongoing,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said.The attack drew swift condemnation and assurances of support from leaders around Europe, including from French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country also experienced three Islamist attacks in recent weeks.US President Donald Trump tweeted Monday night as he prepared for his final rally ahead of Election Day: “Our prayers are with the people of Vienna after yet another vile act of terrorism in Europe.”“These evil attacks against innocent people must stop,” Trump added. “The US stands with Austria, France, and all of Europe in the fight against terrorists, including radical Islamic terrorists.”Austria’s military has provided soldiers to guard key sites in Vienna, freeing up police to continue the investigation. Germany and Hungary have offered to send tactical police units to support their Austrian colleagues.Authorities say members of the public have uploaded 20,000 videos of the attack to police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-dead-in-vienna-shooting-attacker-sympathized-with-is/story-eIKioteHlyRqDXJ4TS8NeN.html

If a person has been exposed to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, she or he will typically produce IgG antibodies as part of the immune response to the virus.“All passengers taking the charter flights or special flights from India to China arranged by the government of China or India, are required to take double nucleic acid tests and one IgM antibody test of Covid-19, in the labs authorised by the Indian Council of Medical Research (hereinafter referred to as ICMR) , with the samples of the first nucleic acid test collected within 72 hours (3 days) before boarding, and the samples of the second nucleic acid test and the IgM antibody test collected within 36 hours before boarding,” the Chinese embassy said in a statement published on its website on Monday.The statement added: “For passengers of the Indian charter flights or special flights, the certificates of negative results of the three said tests along with the personally signed Health Declaration Form shall be sent through the Ministry of External Affairs of the Republic of India to the Chinese Embassy in India for verification and stamping at least 24 hours before boarding.”As Covid-19 cases rebound globally, Beijing is scrambling to put in place more stringent testing for those planning to come to China.Several Chinese embassies including in the US, Russia and UK now require both Chinese and foreigners flying to China to take the IgG test in addition to the nucleic acid test.Meanwhile, the Wuhan municipal health commission said in its daily bulletin on Tuesday that all 23 Covid-19 positive persons on the VBM flight were sent to Jinyintan hospital for isolation, diagnosis, and treatment.“The 19 imported asymptomatic infections from abroad were all Indian nationals. After quarantine and sampling, the nucleic acid test report was positive, and all were transferred to the Jinyintan Hospital for isolation, diagnosis and treatment,” the commission said.The commission added that after “comprehensive epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, laboratory test and imaging examination results, etc (and) after consultation with experts, it is determined as an imported asymptomatic infection from abroad”.The commission added that after investigation, close contacts of the confirmed cases and the asymptomatic infected persons were found to be “254 people on the same flight. They were all isolated at designated isolation points for medical observation.”Air India, on its part, said all passengers who boarded the flight from New Delhi were carrying valid health certificates. “All our passengers to Wuhan had boarded the flight from Delhi with Covid-19 negative reports from certified labs. Air India strictly adheres to all safety protocols laid down by regulatory bodies and conforms to requirements at destination airports. There is no question of pax (passengers) boarding any of our flights without valid Covid-19 negative reports,” an Air India spokesperson said in New Delhi on Monday.It was not immediately clear what impact the cases in the Wuhan VBM flight will have on the ones planned ahead for China.Flights are scheduled for November 6, 13, 20, 27 and December 4.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Tuesday said the two sides are engaging in communication regarding follow-up arrangements for temporary flights.More than 1,500 Indians are waiting to return to China in upcoming VBM flights expected over the coming weeks.The Friday flight was the sixth VBM flight by Air India to China to help Indians stranded in both the countries to travel back to their destinations.More than 1,500 Indians are waiting to return to China in upcoming VBM flights expected over the coming weeks.There is still no word from China when nearly 23,000 Indian students studying here will be able to return.The Delhi-Wuhan-Delhi flight was announced after the cancellation of the October 23 flight to Guangzhou in south China.China’s civil aviation administration hasn’t permitted Air India’s VBM flights to land in Beijing as a precaution against what Beijing calls “imported cases” of Covid-19.The coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, the capital of central China’s Hubei province, in late December before spreading across the country and then globally, triggering the worst pandemic in decades.India had dispatched three flights to Wuhan to airlift Indians stranded in the city when the virus was at its peak in the city in February this year.China has brought the pandemic under control though local clusters have broken out in cities like Dalian, Qingdao, Urumqi and Kashgar in past weeks, triggering partial lockdowns and mass nucleic acid testing.It has also placed strict measures to control imported cases including cancelling flights on routes where Covid-19 cases were reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-adds-new-test-for-indians-after-23-test-covid-ve-on-flight-to-wuhan/story-ItY7rb10W2Z2f3naGLitrO.html
03-11-2020||World||US elections 2020: Veteran Republican operative leads Trump’s ‘army’ of poll watchers||A veteran Republican operative who got his start in politics by helping to persuade a judge to throw out hundreds of mail-in ballots is organizing an “army” of volunteers for President Donald Trump’s campaign to monitor voting in Democratic-leaning areas on Tuesday.Click here for full US elections 2020 coverageMike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day Operations, is a former White House aide from Pennsylvania who gathered claims in 1993 of voter fraud, resulting in a court ruling overturning election results and getting his candidate seated in the Pennsylvania State Senate.It’s a strategy that Trump has been advocating on Twitter and on the stump.For months the president has been trying to undercut the validity of mail-in ballots, a long-used method of voting that was up this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the last week, Trump has also suggested that any votes tabulated after Election Day are suspect, even as his campaign has opposed plans by elections officials to start counting mail-in ballots early.Roman, who previously ran the secretive in-house intelligence unit for the political network led by GOP mega-donors Charles and David Koch, has organized what the campaign claims is 50,000 poll watchers. Many many of them registered through an “Army For Trump” website that asks his supporters to “enlist” in his reelection fight. The campaign also has hired full-time staff in at least 11 battleground states to organize the effort, several of them young lawyers.“Our Elections Day Operations are designed to make sure that everyone that is legally entitled to vote has the opportunity to vote, once,” Erin Perrine, the Trump 2020 director of press communications, says in a video aimed at recruiting volunteers. “We all know that the Democrats will be up to their old dirty tricks on Election Day to make sure President Trump doesn’t win. We cannot let that happen.”The Trump campaign portrays its Election Day Operations effort as traditional poll-watching long carried out by both parties. But Democrats and some Republicans who have followed Roman’s political career are worried that Trump’s team is interested more in sowing doubt about the vote than safeguarding it.“Mike Roman has made many unsubstantiated allegations of fraud and rigging, he has a history and general reputation as someone who stirs things up, so his presence in any Election Day issues gives me pause,” said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies elections law.Trump 2020 spokeswoman Thea McDonald called such assertions “laughable.” She said the campaign’s “rule-abiding poll watchers” are simply trying to “ensure a fair election.”Both campaigns have zeroed in on Pennsylvania as the battleground state that might decide the election. Speaking about the Keystone State on Sunday, Trump said that when election night is over, “We’re going in with our lawyers.”“I don’t think it’s fair that we have to wait a long period of time,” Trump said. “They should have put their ballots in.”Roman, who declined to comment for this story, has experience doing what Trump describes.He got his political start running ballot security operations in Philadelphia for Republican Bruce Marks, who campaigned for the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1993 and lost narrowly to his Democratic opponent.As Roman and Marks tell it in a June blog post on Marks’ website, control of the Pennsylvania State Senate turned on the race, and “the Democratic machine’s operatives descended on the District to steal the election.” Their legal team later convinced a federal judge that there were so many ballots in Latino neighborhoods with irregularities that he threw out hundreds of ballots, overturning the result and sending Marks to a State Senate seat.Marks, who has made his legal career representing wealthy Ukrainian and Russian clients and briefly defended Trump’s 2016 campaign, said Roman’s working-class background gave him an innate understanding of ballot-box politics.“He is not some Ivy leaguer with a bow tie, he learned what it is like to be exposed to elections and face voter fraud on the street,” said Marks, adding that Roman grew up in a rowhouse. “If there are problems on Election Day and after, I am ready and willing to help. Mike is a great guy.”In the 2008 presidential election, Roman made a splash by promoting a video of two members of the New Black Panther Party standing outside a polling place in Philadelphia, one of them holding a billy club. Though no violence occurred, the video was hyped nationally by those on the right as evidence of Democratic voter intimidation, while those on the left criticized it as an attempt to stoke racial divisions during the election of the nation’s first black president, Barack Obama.The New Black Panther video raised Roman’s profile within the Republican Party, and he soon landed a job at the Koch network investigating Democrats, environmental activists and others on the left. A 2014 tax return for the Koch-supported Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce Inc. lists Roman’s title as vice president of research, and says he was paid more than $285,000 in annual salary and benefits.In 2016, the Kochs disbanded the intelligence unit and Roman went to work for the Trump campaign organizing poll-watching operations. After Trump won, Roman landed a job in the office of then-White House counsel Don McGahn as director of special projects and research, though it is not immediately clear what his duties entailed.Roman left the White House in 2018 and soon shifted back to Trump’s campaign. There he has led an aggressive effort that hasn’t waited for Election Day to begin challenging the voting process.In Pennsylvania last month, a Trump campaign lawyer submitted surveillance photos of three voters who appeared to be depositing more than one ballot in an elections drop box. Under state law, voters must return their own ballots unless they are disabled or otherwise unable to do so for themselves. However, elections officials said the Trump campaign produced insufficient evidence to prove the voters in the photos were violating the law.The Pennsylvania complaint appears to be part of a wider national strategy by Trump and his allies to raise accusations of voter fraud and challenge ballots in areas with high rates of registered Democrats.In Texas, Republicans sought to toss out almost 127,000 votes cast from drive-thru lanes in the Democratic stronghold of Harris County, which includes Houston. Both the GOP-dominated Texas Supreme Court and a federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush rejected claims that drive-thru voting is illegal.And some Democrats and election watchers also worry that Trump allies may seek to intimidate voters headed to the polls.In Minnesota last week, the head of the Minneapolis police union forwarded an email to members seeking 20 to 30 retired officers to help serve as “poll challengers” at precincts in “problem” areas of the city. The message was signed by William Willingham, whose email signature identified him as a senior legal adviser and state director of Election Day operations for the Trump campaign.“Poll Challengers do not ‘stop’ people, per se, but act as our eyes and ears in the field and call our hotline to document fraud,” said the email, a copy of which was obtained by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. “We don’t necessarily want our Poll Challengers to look intimidating, they cannot carry a weapon in the polls due to state law. … We just want people who won’t be afraid in rough neighborhoods or intimidating situations.”The Trump campaign later tried to distance itself from the request for retired cops, but the email reinforced fears among voting-rights advocates that the Trump campaign could revive old voter-suppression tactics.In 1981, the Democratic Party sued the Republican Party after a disputed state election in New Jersey where GOP officials hired off-duty police officers to patrol Black and Latino neighborhoods wearing armbands that read “National Ballot Security Task Force.” Without admitting any wrongdoing, the Republican Party agreed to a national consent decree the following year to forgo such tactics. However, at the behest of the GOP a federal judge allowed that agreement to expire in 2017.In August, Trump himself suggested his campaign might send law enforcement officials to voting sites.“We’re going to have sheriffs, and we’re going to have law enforcement, and we’re going to have, hopefully, U.S. attorneys, and we’re going to have everybody and attorney generals,” Trump said during an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News.Federal law prohibits intimidation at the polls and makes it illegal for any federal officer to order “troops or armed men” to polling places, unless needed to “repel armed enemies of the United States.” But such statements from the president have stoked concerns among voting-rights advocates that some Trump supporters may take it upon themselves to show up outside polling sites in military style-gear, brandishing semi-automatic weapons.Reed Galen, a veteran political consultant who worked for John McCain’s presidential bid before leaving the GOP after Trump’s nomination, said he was concerned about Roman’s involvement with Trump’s Elections Day Operations after hearing about his reputation as a local operative in Philadelphia.“Here you have the Army for Trump that might be official, enrolling people through the texting mechanism, but there might be tens of thousands of other people taking their own initiative” and may become violent, said Galen.“This is what this guy does and it is bad news,” he said.___Burke reported from San Francisco.

03-11-2020||World||French airstrikes kill over 50 Al Qaeda-linked jihadists in Mali||The French government said Monday its forces had killed more than 50 jihadists aligned to Al-Qaeda in air strikes in central Mali.The offensive took place on Friday in an area near the borders of Burkina Faso and Niger, where government troops are struggling to rout an Islamic insurgency, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said after meeting members of Mali’s transitional government.“On October 30 in Mali, the Barkhane force conducted an operation that neutralised more than 50 jihadists and confiscated arms and material,” Parly said, referring to the French-led anti-jihadist Operation Barkhane. She added that around 30 motorcycles were destroyed.Parly, who earlier met Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou and her Nigerien counterpart Issoufou Katambe before heading to Bamako, said the operation was launched after a drone detected a “very large” motorcycle caravan in the “three borders” area.When the jihadists moved under trees to try and escape surveillance, the French force sent in two Mirage jets and a drone to launch missiles, leading to the “neutralisation” of the insurgents, Parly said.Military spokesman Colonel Frederic Barbry said that “four terrorists have been captured”.Explosives and a suicide vest had been found, he told a reporters in a conference call, saying that the group had been “about to attack (an army) position in the region”.Barbry also said that another operation, this time targeting the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, was also underway, with a total of 3,000 soldiers.The results of the operation, launched about a month ago, would be announced in the coming days, he said. Significant blow Parly said the action marked a “significant blow” to the Ansarul Islam group which she said was linked to Al-Qaeda via the GSIM alliance led by Iyad Ag Ghaly.Ghaly has emerged as a top jihadist leader in the Sahel since the death of the Qaeda commander Abdelmalek Droukdel, who was killed by French forces in Mali in June. The United Nations has some 13,000 troops deployed in Mali as part of its peacekeeping mission, known as MINUSMA, while France has 5,100 deployed in the Sahel region.Mali has been struggling to contain a brutal jihadist insurgency which first emerged in the north of the country in 2012, overtaking a rebellion by mostly ethnic Tuareg separatists.Former colonial power France launched a military operation to drive back the Islamists in 2013, but fighting has spread to central Mali, and to neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger, leaving thousands dead and hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes. Vast swathes of Mali lie outside effective government control. Frustration over the seemingly endless conflict contributed to mass protests against president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita this year, culminating in his ousting in a military coup on August 18. Many analysts argue that engaging in dialogue with jihadists is one of the few escape routes from Mali’s cycle of violence, and government leaders in Bamako increasingly view the option favourably. Mali’s new interim government, which was appointed to rule for 18 months before staging elections, appears willing to engage in dialogue. Last month, it secured the release of four hostages held by Islamist groups -- including 75-year-old Sophie Petronin, the last remaining French hostage in the world -- in exchange for about 200 prisoners, some of whom are thought to have been jihadists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-airstrikes-kill-over-50-al-qaeda-linked-jihadists-in-mali/story-cVF27kPzlQC3hgzSy23R1J.html

India stands with Austria during this tragic time. My thoughts are with the victims and their families.Gunmen attacked six locations in Vienna on Monday, starting outside the city’s main synagogue, in what Austria’s government has called a “repulsive terror attack.” While Vienna Police shot dead one of the attackers, Austria’s interior minister Karl Nehammer said at least one perpetrator is still on the run.Speaking at a news conference Nehammer further said, “It’s the hardest day for Austria in many years. We’re dealing with a terror attack the severity of which, thank God, we’ve not experienced in Austria in many years.”As a precaution, the interior ministry has reinforced border checks and children are not required to attend school on Tuesday. Though people have been urged to stay at home, Vienna mayor Michael Ludwig said the city would “run normally” on Tuesday. However, there will be tougher police presence on the city’s streets.Monday’s attack took place on what was the last evening before a nationwide curfew was to come in effect due to the Covid-19 pandemic, across Austria.The attack also comes on the back of recent stabbing incidents in France-- in capital Paris and Nice. In a statement, French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been the subject of outrage of several Muslim-majority countries in recent days, said, “This is our Europe. Our enemies must know with whom they are dealing.

However, unfortunately it is not possible for the GA to go ahead as planned”. He added: “Despite the postponement of the GA, the daily work of supporting our 194-member countries combat all forms of transnational crime and terrorism remains unaffected.”The new dates for GA have not been announced yet. India is slated to host the 91st GA of Interpol in 2022. It is yet to be ascertained, if the postponement will affect the future annual meets. The postponement implies that besides the budget, which exceptionally can be approved by the executive committee, all other statutory items would remain pending until the next session of the GA, Interpol said. This includes elections for the executive committee and the Commission for the Control (CCC) of Interpol’s files.

The US recorded nearly 100,000 new cases Friday, the most at any point in the pandemic.Fauci also offered praise for the campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden, saying it was taking the coronavirus “seriously from a public health perspective.” Then came the “fire Fauci” chants from the crowd at a Sunday evening rally for the president in Florida, mirroring the “lock her up” rally chants targeting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.“Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice, I appreciate it,” Trump replied to the crowd. “No, he’s been wrong on a lot. He’s a nice man, though. He’s been wrong on a lot.”Fauci, a member of the Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since being named in 1984 under then-President Ronald Reagan. Trump routinely muses about things in his rallies, and it isn’t clear whether he is considering firing Fauci. The president, though, has all but frozen out Fauci, who has lost influence to Scott Atlas, an adviser who downplays the risk of the virus.It’s not the first time the issue of firing Fauci has surfaced. Speaking to reporters on Oct. 19, Trump said he didn’t want to fire Fauci. “I don’t want to, I don’t want to hurt him.” Trump said. “He’s been there for about 350 years.”Biden, meanwhile, had a different message at a rally in Ohio. “Elect me and I’m going to hire Dr. Fauci,” Biden said.Fauci is a Title 42 senior-level federal employee, covered under the performance management system for members of the Senior Executive Service. The White House declined comment Monday on whether it believes it has the authority to fire him.But Diane Seltzer Torre of the Bethesda, Maryland-based Seltzer Law Firm, which concentrates on employment law, said that under Fauci’s current status, Trump can’t fire him directly.Fauci can only be fired by Francis Collins, his supervisor as the head of the National Institutes of Health, or Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services Secretary, for cause such as poor performance or misconduct, Seltzer Torre said.“Even if that was proposed, it would have to be in writing and give specifics, and then Dr. Fauci would have an opportunity to respond orally and in writing,” according to Seltzer Torre. If a decision is made to go through with the firing, Fauci would have appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and ultimately to federal court, she added.Collins, in a CNN interview in July, said, “I could not imagine doing something of that sort, no” when asked if he would fire Fauci if ordered by the president.Calling Fauci “a national treasure,” Collins said in the interview that there is “nobody I know on this planet who is more knowledgeable about infectious disease, and has more experience over 50 years of his career.”Being praised on CNN by your boss could be seen as evidence Fauci is doing a good job, if there was a move to fire him by Azar without Collins’s involvement. Collins didn’t directly answer whether he would resign rather than fire Fauci himself.“Francis would never fire Tony,” said Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, referring to Collins and Fauci. “The only way the president could fire Tony would be to fire the NIH director and appoint a yes man in his place.”If Trump is re-elected, though, “all bets are off,” Gostin said.Executive OrderThe question of whether Fauci’s status could be changed under a executive order affecting the status of civil-service workers -- and thus be fired more quickly -- likely will be resolved no later than Jan. 19, when a preliminary review from federal agencies of eligible policy making positions is due.Based on the text of the executive order and initial guidance from the Office of Personnel Management, it’s unclear that Fauci’s status can be changed, said Deborah Hopkins, president of the Federal Employment Law Training Group, which provides employment law training to federal managers.“It remains to be seen” whether the application of the executive order “will be narrow or broad,” Hopkins said. The guidance, she added, “indicates a lot of flexibility.”Tim Stretton, a policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, said the order could well make it easier to fire Fauci. Under the order, Stretton said, agencies would identify employees who work on policy, including directly making it or influencing it in some way.Those workers would not receive the same protections as civil servants do today. Given Fauci’s role in the coronavirus response, it’s “not hard” to see how he could be deemed as a person with a hand in shaping policy, Stretton said.Taking the HammerTo Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, this situation embodies the purpose of protecting career government employees: So the U.S. can hire workers and they can speak freely without fear of political retribution.”President Trump is taking the hammer to career civil servants and the purpose of it,” Stier said of the recent executive order.Fauci has been a frequent Trump foil since early in the pandemic when he urged caution about ending social-distancing measures in testimony before Congress in early May. Additionally, he would sometimes push back against claims made by Trump about drugs or science.‘Real Risk’When Trump began pushing for reopening the country, Fauci warned a Senate panel in early May that doing so too soon could lead to new outbreaks. “There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you might not be able to control,” Fauci testified on May 12.Last week, 14 states spanning the Rocky Mountain West to Pennsylvania recorded all-time highs in cases, the most of the pandemic.Even if Fauci’s status isn’t changed, scientists who work for him easily could be, said Diane Seltzer Torre of the Seltzer Law Firm in Bethesda, Md. “Why are we targeting these people?” she asked.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-easy-to-fire-anthony-fauci-despite-donald-trump-s-indication/story-sCkhNqBuoL2aEQKM0SNfnI.html
03-11-2020||World||Flood and landslide warning as Hurricane Eta approaches Central America||Hurricane Eta erupted quickly into a potentially catastrophic major hurricane Monday as it headed for Central America, where forecasters warned of massive flooding and landslides across a vulnerable region.Eta had maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 kph) and was centered about 70 miles (110 kilometers) east-southest of the Nicaragua-Honduras border in early evening, the US National Hurricane Center said. It was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph).It said the Category 4 hurricane was likely to strengthen further before running ashore by early Tuesday in Nicaragua, where it could bring rains measured in feet rather than inches.Forecasters said central and northern Nicaragua into much of Honduras could get 15 to 25 inches (380 to 635 millimeters) of rain, with 35 inches (890 millimeters) in isolated areas. Heavy rains also were likely in eastern Guatemala, southern Belize and Jamaica.Storm surge up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) above normal tides was possible for the coast of Nicaragua.Nicaragua’s navy carried families in open boats, mostly women and children with the possessions they could carry from outer islands to the mainland under a low grey sky. It prohibited the launching any boats along the stretch of coastline expected to receive Eta.Offshore residents were taken to shelters in Bilwi, also known as Puerto Cabezas, the primary city of the Northern Caribbean Autonomous Region that is home to some 66,000 people, according to Guillermo González, director of the Nicaragua’s national emergency management agency.By evening, much of Bilwi was already without power. Approximately 3,000 families from surrounding areas had been moved into shelters.Northeastern Nicaragua is sparsely populated, home to small coastal villages and a large nature reserve.González said that 88 tons of rice, oil, corn and other food basics had been to the area. The flood-prone Rio Coco, which makes up part of the border with Honduras, is home to many Indigenous communities.Traffic filled the streets of Bilwi on Monday morning as residents scrambled to stock up before Eta’s arrival. Long lines snaked away from cash machines.“We’re in a race against time,” said Limborth Bucardo, who waited in line at a hardware store. “We need to reinforce our houses to dampen the impact of the winds a little.” Heavy black plastic, garbage bags, nails and rope were in high demand.The outer bounds of forecast potential rainfall from Eta were close to the prodigious amounts of water dumped by 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history.A National Hurricane Center archive report says more than 9,000 people died as Mitch’s rains caused widespread flooding during a weeklong slog across the region. At one point its winds reached nearly 180 mph (285 kph), though it weakened while meandering off the Honduran coast before making landfall on Oct 29, 1998.In Honduras, much of the country was placed on red alert for Eta’s eventual passage through the country. It had been raining since Sunday in some areas.Julissa Mercado, spokeswoman for the national emergency management agency, said firefighters had started evacuating areas most at risk and mandatory evacuations would be ordered soon.Eta would have arrived in Honduras just as the country prepared to go on vacation in an effort to bolster the tourism sector and pump some money into the pandemic-battered economy. The extra-long weekend was to begin Wednesday, but late Monday the government cancelled it because of the risk posed by Eta.In the city of Tela, on Honduras’ Caribbean coast, heavy rains had already sent two rivers spilling over their banks. Rescuers moved people from riverside communities to six shelters in the city, said Capt. David Velásquez of the city’s fire department. Some 20 people whose homes flooded were moved to a sports complex in the city. Each evacuee was subjected to a rapid coronavirus test.The Guaymón river between Tela and El Progreso also threatened to top its banks as people living nearby filled sandbags hoping to protect their communities. The Honduran air force began flying supplies to areas expected to be hardest hit by the storm.Eta tripled in strength in about 24 hours, rapidly intensifying from a 40 mph (65 kph) storm Sunday morning to a 120 mph (190 kph) hurricane around midday Monday, and forecasters said it could grow further, into a Category 4 storm before hitting land.Eta is the eighth Atlantic storm this season to hit the meteorologists’ definition for rapid intensification — a gain of 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in just 24 hours. It’s also the fifth to reach major hurricane status.Over the past couple decades, meteorologists have been increasingly worried about storms that just blow up in strength, like Eta.Earlier this year, Hannah, Laura, Sally, Teddy, Gamma, Delta and Zeta all rapidly intensified. An eighth storm, Marco, just missed the mark. Laura and Delta tied or set records for rapid intensification.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate and hurricane scientist Jim Kossin studied the effect and found storms now are more likely to rapidly intensify than they did in the 1980s and “a lot of that has to do with human-caused climate change.”Eta is the 28th named Atlantic storm this season, tying the 2005 record for named storms. It’s the first time the Greek letter Eta has been used as a storm name because after the 2005 season ended, meteorologists went back and determined a storm that should have been named wasn’t.Hurricane season still has a month to go, ending Nov. 30. And in 2005, Zeta formed toward the end of December.___Associated Press writer Marlon González in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and AP Science Writer Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flood-and-landslide-warning-as-hurricane-eta-approaches-central-america/story-gU0LjPXNizlNo0b5Zlb75K.html
03-11-2020||World||First step to beating coronavirus is defeating Donald Trump: Joe Biden||The first step to beating the coronavirus that has had a devastating impact on the US is to ensure President Donald Trump’s electoral defeat, his Democratic challenger Joe Biden said on Monday.Making a passionate plea, Biden, in his closing argument from the city of Pittsburgh, urged his countrymen to defeat Trump as he has failed to deliver in the last four years.“The first step to beating the virus is defeating Donald Trump,” Biden said in his second address of the day. With almost over 10 crore Americans having already voted and millions more to exercise their franchise on Tuesday, the former vice president urged people to get out and vote in large numbers.“My message is simple. The power to change this country is in your hands. And I do not care how hard Donald Trump tries, there is nothing he can do to stop the people of this nation from voting, no matter how he tries,” he said.“There was a press article last week and it read as follows -- never before in modern presidential history has a candidate been so reliant on widescale efforts to repress the vote as Trump,” Biden said.“Trump does not want you all voting. He does not want Americans voting. He thinks only wealthy folks should vote. And when America votes though, America will be heard.“When America is heard, the message is going to be out loud and clear. It is time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. Go home,” he said.“Look, we are done with the chaos. We are done with the racism. We are done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the irresponsibility. But we have got a lot of work to do, folks. If I am elected president, we are going to act. On day one, we are going to act to get Covid under control,” Biden said.He alleged that Trump has done more to harm black America than any president in modern history. “This is the same man who started the birther movement against my buddy, Barack Obama. This is the man who when -- the first black woman running for vice president -- he looks at her and he calls her monster,” the former vice president said.Biden closed out the day with a drive-in rally in Pittsburgh, the city where he launched his campaign 18 months ago. In his closing message, he said this election is a battle for “the soul of our nation” and that he is the leader the “country needs to recover from the pandemic and build back better than before”.In a tweet later in the night, Biden described this as an election of a lifetime. “In less than 12 hours, voters will head to the polls for the most important election in our lifetimes. It all comes down to this,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-step-to-beating-coronavirus-is-defeating-donald-trump-joe-biden/story-UnSnnajPLE0jcaN0rmpBSI.html

As the world waits with bated breath for a Covid-19 vaccine, amid a wave of fresh cases in Europe, German biotech firm CureVac has claimed its vaccine candidate triggered an immune response in humans.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHere are the latest updates in the worldwide search for a Covid-19 vaccine:1. German biotech firm CureVac on Monday claimed its vaccine candidate triggered an immune response in humans, a development described by its CEO Franz-Werner Haas as “encouraging.” For its potential vaccine, CureVac is using the messenger RNA (mRNA) approach, the same as Moderna, as well as BioNtech and its partner Pfizer. The German firm has named its vaccine candidate ‘CVnCoV’ and plans to launch the final stage of testing, which will involve 30,000 participants, before the end of the year.2. South African pharmaceutical firm Aspen Pharmacare has struck a deal with US firm Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine if it is approved in the African country, as well as globally. In a statement, Aspen said the vaccine would be produced at its manufacturing facility in Port Elizabeth in South Africa’s Eastern Cape province. The company also said its manufacturing facility can develop more than 300 million vaccine doses every year. J&J’s vaccine candidate -- Ad26.COV3-S -- is among four different vaccines currently undergoing trials in South Africa.3. A survey in Russia shows an increasing number of Russians are unwilling to be inoculated against Covid-19 once a vaccine becomes available. The poll, conducted by the country’s only major independent pollster, the Levada Centre, said as of October 20, 59% Russians would decline a vaccine, up from 54% two months ago. Russia has claimed to have developed the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine, called Sputnik V, despite the fact the vaccine is still undergoing a late stage of trials.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-from-curevac-candidate-s-immune-response-in-humans-to-unwilling-russians/story-iLXt2pStA0dq74ve4IrMzH.html
03-11-2020||World||US presidential elections headed for a tight finish: Polls||The US presidential race is headed for a tight finish with the margin between US President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden shrinking, particularly in key battle ground states, latest opinion polls indicated on Monday on the eve of the elections.Biden, 77, was leading Trump, 74, in the key battle ground States by 2.9 percentage points, which comes within margin of error, according to Real Clear Politics which maintains an average of major opinion polls.Also Read: US Presidential Election 2020: America votes amid spectre of unrestBiden’s lead has shrunk over the last few days, as Trump and his family have virtually carpet bombed the key battle ground states, including as many as 15 rallies by the president. The first family along with Vice President Mike Pence have collectively held more than 40 rallies in the last three days of the election.Biden, his running mate Senator Kamala Harris, along with the former president Barack Obama too have ramped up their public appearances in the last few days, but its no where matching to that of the Trump campaign. On the eve of the election, Biden was in Ohio, while Obama was campaigning in Florida. Harris was in Pennsylvania.Trump was holding five rallies in five key battleground States – North Carolina, Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.Nationally, Trump as per Real Clear Politics on an average was trailing by 6.5 percentage points against Biden. Till a few days ago, Biden’s lead was around eight percentage points. On Monday both the Trump and Biden Campaigns exuded confidence of winning the race on Tuesday night.Also Read: US Presidential Election 2020: Who will it be, America?A majority of the mainstream media, however, said Monday that Trump has an uphill task to win the elections, given that he continues to trail in polls in key States like Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin. A few outlets are saying that Texas, which has traditionally remained a GOP bastion is also in play this year.Trump supporters argue that poll do not reflect the ground realities and like the 2016, the president would win the election with much stronger mandate.Nate Silver from the important FiveThirtyEight.Com on Monday said that Trump has about 10 percent chance of winning the elections. Notably, he had gone wrong in 2016.“As in 2016, Trump could potentially benefit from the Electoral College. Projected margins in the tipping-point states are considerably tighter than the margins in the national popular vote. More specifically, Joe Biden’s lead in Pennsylvania — the most likely tipping-point state, according to our forecast — is solid but not spectacular: about 5 points in our polling average,” Silver wrote.Nate Silver said that if Biden wins the popular vote by 2 to 3 percentage points, the Electoral College is roughly a toss-up. But if Biden wins the popular vote by less than 2 points, Trump is a fairly heavy favourite to win the election, he wrote.“Even popular vote margins of up to 6 points are not entirely safe for Biden if his votes are distributed in exactly the wrong way. So you can see why an 8- or 9-point lead in the popular vote shouldn’t make Biden feel that secure; despite being a landslide margin, it’s also only a few points removed from the inflection point where the Electoral College starts to become competitive,” he argued.According to The New York Times, if the polls are right, Joe Biden could post the most decisive victory in a presidential election in three and a half decades, surpassing Bill Clinton’s win in 1996. “That’s a big “if.”,” it said.“The indelible memory of 2016’s polling misfire, when Donald J. Trump trailed in virtually every pre-election poll and yet swept the battleground states and won the Electoral College, has hovered over the 2020 campaign. Mr. Biden’s unusually persistent lead has done little to dispel questions about whether the polls could be off again,” said the daily.“President Trump needs a very large polling error to have a hope of winning the White House. Joe Biden would win even if polls were off by as much as they were in 2016,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-headed-for-a-tight-finish-polls/story-Q186UaeD5mcm3e5tAqphOO.html

UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement: “The Secretary-General is following with utmost concern the still-evolving situation in Vienna’s city centre where violent attacks in several places have been reported today.”The Secretary-General has strongly condemned the attacks and reaffirmed the solidarity of the United Nations with the people and the Government of Austria, the spokesperson said. Austria’s Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said that several people were killed in the attack and one of the gunmen remained at large. Scores of countries and world leaders have come in support of Austria as it continues to battle the ongoing ‘terrorist attack’ at multiple locations in the country.At least two died, including one suspect, while several were injured in a string of shootings across Vienna on Monday (local time).Also Read: Six crime scenes in Vienna attack; 2 killed in shooting, suspect shot down“CONFIRMED at the moment: *08:00 pm: several shots fired, beginning at Seitenstettengasse *several suspects armed with rifles *six different shooting locations * one deceased person, several injured (1 officer included) *1 suspect shot and killed by police officers,” the Vienna Police (LPD Wien) informed via its Twitter handle.The police also advised people to stay indoors and if out on the streets then to refrain from using public transportation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-condemns-vienna-terrorist-attack-following-situation-closely/story-47fTsxyNuPsJiFZOauAnCP.html
03-11-2020||World||UK boosts testing as PM Johnson sees ‘no alternative’ to Covid-19 lockdown||Boris Johnson said there is “no alternative” to imposing a coronavirus lockdown across England to stop the health service being overwhelmed as he revealed plans for whole cities to be tested to root-out asymptomatic carriers of the disease.The UK prime minister rejected criticism he was too slow to act, telling lawmakers he had done his “level best” to avoid national restrictions due to come into force Thursday.Pubs, restaurants, non-essential shops and gyms will be closed for four weeks and socializing will be severely restricted in a bid to curb the spread of the virus, although schools and nurseries will remain open, Johnson said.Also Read: UK PM calls in army to roll out tests as lockdown loomsSpeaking in the House of Commons on Monday, Johnson said the number of deaths could be twice as high as the first wave in the spring without urgent action.“Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level,” he said. If the health service is allowed to be overwhelmed “doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die,” he told lawmakers.‘Coercive State’But he faced anger from some of his own Conservative colleagues over the plan, which will be subject to a vote on Wednesday. Veteran MP Charles Walker warned the UK is drifting “further into an authoritarian coercive state” under the measures. “The people of this country will never, ever forgive the political class for criminalizing parents seeing children and children seeing parents,” he told Johnson.Ministers have been working to defuse tensions among Tory lawmakers ahead of the vote, and Johnson spoke with his party’s MPs over the weekend. The premier sought to address some of their concerns Monday, saying the measures will be strictly time-limited to Dec. 2, when Parliament will get a vote on the way forward.Johnson underlined the government’s new focus on mass testing, pointing to “cheap, reliable, rapid turnaround tests” that could be used in schools and elsewhere to allow the economy to keep moving before the much-anticipated roll-out of a vaccine next year.Liverpool TrialHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said testing capacity had met Johnson’s target of half a million a day by the end of October and mass checks will be trialled in the city of Liverpool, northwest England, as ministers step-up efforts to identify carriers of the disease.“These tests will help identify the many thousands of people in the city who don’t have symptoms but can still infect others without knowing,” Johnson said in a statement. “Dependent on their success in Liverpool, we will aim to distribute millions of these new rapid tests between now and Christmas and empower local communities to use them to drive down transmission.”Also Read: The deepening of economic bond between India, UK | OpinionThe new lockdown is likely to be approved in the House of Commons after Labour and other opposition parties said they will vote for the plan. But Labour leader Keir Starmer said “the human cost will be higher” because Johnson ignored the advice of his own scientists to impose a short lockdown in September.Senior Tory MP Graham Brady called for a “full impact assessment” of the cost of the lockdown, including the toll on people’s mental health, before the vote. Former minister Mike Penning confirmed in a telephone interview he will vote against the government.Johnson and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak unveiled additional financial support for businesses and workers to add to the month-long extension of the government’s flagship furlough program that was announced Saturday.During November, the state will double support for self-employed workers to 80% of their usual trading profits, in line with furlough payments. The Treasury also extended the deadline for businesses to apply for state-backed loans until the end of January, and said those that have them already will be able to top them up.The extra support came too late for many people laid-off by companies last week, ahead of the furlough program’s scheduled end. Sunak defended his decision to stick with his original time-frame, telling the BBC it was only the changing health data and subsequent lockdown that forced a rethink.Bloomberg Economics said the second lockdown will mean the economy contracts in the fourth quarter and that the Bank of England will increase its asset purchase target this week by possibly more than the 100 billion pounds ($129 billion) previously forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-boosts-testing-as-pm-johnson-sees-no-alternative-to-covid-19-lockdown/story-sHclgHjo94J4wZejAAtsSI.html

I am therefore not limiting it to an area of Vienna because these are mobile perpetrators,” Nehammer told broadcaster ORF, urging the public to stay indoors until the all-clear is given.At least one person was killed and several wounded in central Vienna in exchanges of gunfire late on Monday, in what the Austrian interior minister said was believed to be a terrorist attack near the central synagogue.Vienna police said on Twitter there were multiple suspects and six different locations involved.A large area of central Vienna was cordoned off and police said a significant deployment was under way.Also read | Six crime scenes in Vienna attack; 1 suspect killed, several injured including a copInterior Minister Karl Nehammer told Austrian broadcaster ORF that the attack was believed to have been carried out by several people and that all six locations were in the immediate vicinity of the street housing the central synagogue.“At the moment I can confirm we believe this is an apparent terror attack,” he said.“We believe there are several perpetrators. Unfortunately there are also several injured, probably also dead.”A spokesman for the ambulance service said at least one person had been killed and several injured. One of the suspects and a bystander had been shot dead and a police officer was among those injured, local news agency APA said.“Shots fired in the Inner City district - there are persons injured - KEEP AWAY from all public places or public transport,” the police said on Twitter.Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch said on Twitter that it was not clear whether the Vienna synagogue and adjoining offices had been the target of the attack, and said they were closed at the time.Videos circulated on social media of a gunman running down a cobblestone street shooting and shouting. Reuters could not immediately verify the videos.Also read | ‘Sounded like firecrackers’: Eyewitness recounts ‘terror’ attack in central ViennaVienna police urged people not to share videos and photos via social media. “This jeopardizes police forces as well as the civilian population,” they said on Twitter.In 1981, two people were killed and 18 injured during an attack by two Palestinians at the same synagogue. In 1985, a Palestinian extremist group attacked Vienna airport with hand grenades and attack rifles, killing three civilians.In recent years, Austria has been spared the sort of large-scale attacks seen in Paris, Berlin and London.In August, authorities arrested a 31-year-old Syrian refugee suspected of trying to attack a Jewish community leader in the country’s second city Graz.

03-11-2020||World||‘Sounded like firecrackers’: Eyewitness recounts ‘terror’ attack in central Vienna||Two people including one attacker were killed in central Vienna on Monday evening in what Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz described as a “repulsive terror attack”.Police said there was “one deceased person” and several injured, including one police officer.Meanwhile, one suspect was “shot and killed by police officers,” Vienna police said on their Twitter account.The attack had been carried out by “several suspects armed with rifles”, and police added that there had been “six different shooting locations”. Gunshots were fired at around 8:00 pm local time (1900 GMT), beginning at the Seitenstettengasse in the city’s centrally-located first district.Also read | Six crime scenes in Vienna attack; 1 suspect killed, several injured including a copThe shooting began just hours before Austria was to re-impose a coronavirus lockdown to try to slow the spread of Covid-19, and bars and restaurants were packed as people enjoyed a final night of relative freedom.Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told public broadcaster ORF that the incident “appeared to be a terrorist attack” and urged Viennese to remain in their homes.Nehammer repeated police appeals to residents to keep away from all public places or public transport, and frequent sirens and helicopters could be heard in the city centre as emergency services responded to the incident.An AFP photographer said that large numbers of police were guarding an area near the city’s world-famous opera house.The location of the incident is close to a major synagogue.The president of Vienna’s Jewish community Oskar Deutsch said that shots had been fired “in the immediate vicinity” of the Stadttempel synagogue, but added that it was currently unknown whether the synagogue itself had been the target of an attack.He said that the synagogue and office buildings at the same address had been closed at the time of the attack.- ‘Cowardly act’ -“It sounded like firecrackers, then we realised it was shots,” said one eyewitness quoted by public broadcaster ORF.A shooter had “shot wildly with an automatic weapon” before the police arrived and opened fire, the witness added.Austria had until now been spared the sort of major attacks that have hit other European countries.French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that “we French share the shock and sorrow of the Austrian people”.“After France, it’s a friendly nation that has been attacked,” he added, referring to the killing on Thursday of three people by a knife-armed attacker in southern city Nice and the beheading of a schoolteacher by a suspected Islamist outside Paris several days before.EU Council chief Charles Michel tweeted that the bloc “strongly condemns this cowardly act”.And Germany’s foreign ministry tweeted that the reports from Austria were “horrifying and disturbing”.“We can’t give in to hatred that is aimed at dividing our societies,” the ministry added.Czech police said they had started random checks on the border with Austria. “Police are carrying out random checks of vehicles and passengers on border crossings with Austria as a preventive measure in relation to the terror attack in Vienna,” Czech police tweeted.Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek said in a tweet Czech police were in touch with Austrian colleagues following the “dreadful news from Vienna”.Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also “strongly condemned” the shootings. “There is no room for hatred and violence in our common European home,” he said on Twitter in Italian and German.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sounded-like-firecrackers-eyewitness-recounts-terror-attack-in-central-vienna/story-2X8rGsz0qG43Qz3nYF9wyO.html

An official later clarified that two people were dead, a civilian and a suspected attacker. “We have brought several special forces units together that are now searching for the presumed terrorists. I am therefore not limiting it to an area of Vienna, because these are mobile perpetrators,” Nehammer earlier told broadcaster ORF.Kurz said the army would protect sites in the capital so the police could focus on anti-terror operations. Speaking to ORF, he said the attackers “were very well equipped with automatic weapons” and had “prepared professionally”.Police said on Twitter that at least one person had been killed and that the injured included a police officer. Vienna mayor Michael Ludwig told ORF that 15 people were being treated in Vienna hospitals, and that seven were in a serious condition.Police also said they had shot dead one of the attackers.Nehammer said all six locations in the attack were near the street housing the central synagogue.Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch said on Twitter it was not clear whether the Vienna synagogue and adjoining offices had been the target and said they were closed at the time.Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister told London’s LBC radio he was living in the compound of the synagogue. “Upon hearing shots, we looked down (from) the windows and saw the gunmen shooting at the guests of the various bars and pubs,” he said.

Reuters could not immediately verify the videos.ATTACKERS’ IDENTITY UNKNOWNThe attack happened hours before a partial lockdown was due to go into place due to the rising spread of the coronavirus, with restaurants, cafes and hotels shuttered and restrictions on movement at night.Authorities gave no indication of the identity of the assailants or reason for the attack.“We really can’t say anything about the background yet,” Kurz told ORF. “Of course an anti-Semitic background cannot be ruled out.”President Emmanuel Macron of France, which has seen two deadly knife attacks in Paris and Nice in recent weeks, issued a statement expressing shock and sorrow.“This is our Europe,” he said. “Our enemies must know with whom they are dealing. We will not retreat.”French officials have ramped up security since the attacks in Paris and Nice, which had suspected Islamist motives. Macron has deployed thousands of soldiers to protect sites such as places of worship and schools, and ministers have warned that other Islamist militant attacks could take place.In 1981, two people were killed and 18 injured during an attack by two Palestinians at the same Vienna synagogue. In 1985, a Palestinian extremist group killed three civilians in an attack at the airport.In recent years, Austria has been spared the sort of large-scale attacks seen in Paris, Berlin and London. In August, authorities arrested a 31-year-old Syrian refugee suspected of trying to attack a Jewish community leader in the country’s second city Graz. The leader was unhurt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/six-crime-scenes-in-vienna-attack-several-hurt-including-police-officer/story-6poLHrmQaKVMNQJB22cjMM.html

That sparked his supporters to begin chanting “Fire Fauci.”“Don’t tell anybody but let me wait until a little bit after the election,” Trump replied to thousands of supporters early Monday, adding he appreciated their “advice.”Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden tweeted later Monday in response: “We need a president who actually listens to experts like Dr. Fauci.”Biden has sought to keep the campaign focused on what he says is a disastrous federal response to the pandemic. Trump is countering by using the race’s final hours to accuse Biden of wanting to force the country back into a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus.Still, Trump’s comments on Fauci less than 48 hours before polls close likely ensure the pandemic will remain front and center heading into Election Day.It’s the most direct Trump has been in suggesting he was serious about trying to remove Fauci from his position. He has previously expressed that he was concerned about the political blowback of removing the popular and respected doctor before the election.Trump cannot directly fire Fauci, who is not a presidential appointee. Theoretically, Trump could pressure Fauci’s boss, Dr. Francis Collins, or Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to do so. Even discounting Fauci’s scientific legacy, taking that step would be politically extraordinary considering a Republican president, George W. Bush, awarded Fauci the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Fauci also has considerable bipartisan support in Congress.Former President Barack Obama defended Fauci while campaigning in Atlanta for Biden. Obama praised Fauci’s public service and remarked that Trump’s “second-term plan is to fire that guy, the one person who could actually help them contain the pandemic.”The latest flare-up follows Fauci making his sharpest criticism yet of the White House’s response to the coronavirus and Trump’s public assertion that the nation is “rounding the turn.”Fauci has grown outspoken that Trump has ignored his advice for containing the virus, saying he hasn’t spoken with Trump in more than a month. He has raised alarm that the nation was heading for a challenging winter if more isn’t done soon to slow the spread of the disease.In an interview with The Washington Post this weekend, Fauci cautioned that the U.S. will have to deal with “a whole lot of hurt” in the weeks ahead due to surging coronavirus cases.Fauci said the U.S. “could not possibly be positioned more poorly” to stem rising cases as more people gather indoors during the colder fall and winter months. He says the U.S. will need to make an “abrupt change” in public health precautions.Fauci added that he believed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden “is taking it seriously from a public health perspective,” while Trump is “looking at it from a different perspective.” Fauci, who’s on the White House coronavirus task force, said that perspective emphasizes “the economy and reopening the country.”In response, White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump always puts people’s well-being first charged that Fauci had decided “to play politics” right before Tuesday’s election. Deere said Fauci “has a duty to express concerns or push for a change in strategy” but instead is “choosing to criticize the president in the media and make his political leanings known.”Trump had already stepped up his attacks on Biden in recent days for pledging to heed the advice of scientists in responding to the pandemic. As Trump charges that Biden’s measures to slow the pandemic could keep Americans home and hurt the economy, the former vice president has countered that the only way out of the health crisis is to heed the warnings of Fauci and other medical professionals. Biden has also been careful not to endorse another national lockdown.Trump has recently relied on the advice of Stanford doctor Scott Atlas, who has no prior background in infectious diseases or public health, as his lead science adviser on the pandemic. Atlas has been a public skeptic about mask wearing and other measures widely accepted by the scientific community to slow the spread of the virus.Other members of the White House coronavirus task force have grown increasingly vocal about what they see as a dangerous fall spike in the virus.Trump’s aggressive approach to Fauci carries some risks.A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in September showed 68% of Americans have a great deal or a fair amount of trust in Fauci to provide reliable information on the coronavirus. That compares with 52% of Americans who trusted Biden to do that and just 40% for Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-threatens-to-fire-fauci-in-rift-with-disease-expert-amid-covid-19-outbreak-in-us/story-6j307x87mkw9cNVLyegwnI.html

It earlier cited Nehammer’s office saying that one attacker was killed and another could be on the run.Vienna police urged people to avoid all open spaces and public transport in the city. Police said trams and buses weren’t stopping and urged social media users not to post videos of the ongoing police operation, so as not to endanger officers.“There are several injured persons,” police tweeted. “We are on site with all available forces. Please avoid all public squares in the city.”Oskar Deutsch, the head of the Jewish community in Vienna, said the shooting took place in the street where the city’s main synagogue is located but that it wasn’t clear whether the house of worship had been targeted.The synagogue was already closed at the time of the shooting around 8 p.m. (1900 GMT), Deutsch tweeted.Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister told The Associated Press that he saw at least one person fire shots at people sitting outside bars in the street below his window.“They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,” Hofmeister said.“All these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown,” he added. “As of midnight, all bars and restaurants will be closed in Austria for the next month and a lot of people probably wanted to use that evening to be able to go out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vienna-shooting-believed-to-be-apparent-terror-attack-minister/story-IW7dExOAfYVnMRzbG3e4uL.html
03-11-2020||World||Two dead, including one suspect, 15 injured in ‘terror’ attack Vienna||Gunmen opened fire on people enjoying a last night out at Vienna’s cafes and restaurants before a coronavirus lockdown Monday in what authorities said was a terrorist attack that left at least two dead — including one of the assailants — and 15 wounded.“We are victims of a despicable terror attack in the federal capital that is still ongoing,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said hours after the gunfire erupted.“One of the perpetrators was neutralized, but several perpetrators appear to still be on the loose,” he said. “They seem to also, as far as we know, be very well equipped, with automatic weapons. So they were very well prepared.”Police said that several shots were fired shortly after 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) on a lively street in the city center and that there were six shooting locations. Unverified footage posted on social media showed gunmen walking through the streets, apparently shooting at people at random, wounding several.The motive was under investigation, but Kurz said the possibility that it was an anti-Semitic attack cannot be ruled out, given that the shooting began outside Vienna’s main synagogue. The synagogue was closed at the time.Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told public broadcaster ORF that the army had been asked to guard key locations in the city to allow police to pursue the gunmen.Kurz praised police for killing one of the attackers and vowed: “We will not never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism and will fight these attacks with all means.”Vienna Mayor Michael Ludwig said 15 people were hospitalized, seven with serious injuries.Oskar Deutsch, the head of the Jewish community in Vienna, said it was not clear whether the main synagogue had been targeted.Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least one person shoot at people sitting outside at bars in the street below his window.“They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,” Hofmeister said.“All these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown,” he added. “As of midnight, all bars and restaurants will be closed in Austria for the next month, and a lot of people probably wanted to use that evening to be able to go out.”French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that the French “share the shock and grief of the Austrian people hit by an attack tonight.”“After France, this is a friendly country that has been attacked. This is our Europe. ... We will not give in,” he wrote.France has endured three attacks blamed on Muslim extremists in recent weeks: the wounding of two people outside satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo’s old headquarters; the beheading of a schoolteacher who showed students caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad; and a deadly knife attack Thursday in a church in the Mediterranean city of Nice.All of the attacks were strongly condemned at the time by Austria’s chancellor.Authorities in Vienna urged people to avoid all open spaces and public transportation. Police said trams and buses weren’t stopping and urged social media users not to post videos of the police operation so as not to endanger officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-injured-in-vienna-gunfire-synagogue-attacked/story-a7RTP6nR5wt0fwlEzol2zN.html
03-11-2020||World||Biden, Trump make last-mile dash of swing states before Election Day||President Donald Trump undertook a whirlwind tour of five battleground states on Sunday amid speculation that he planned to declare victory prematurely on Tuesday night even before all the votes had been counted, especially the millions of mail-in ballots that will typically take time.Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, focused on just one battleground state on his penultimate day of campaigning: Pennsylvania, where he, his wife Jill Biden and vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her husband Dug Emhoff will be carpet-covering on Monday.“My message to you is simple: Pennsylvania is critical in this election,” Biden said at a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. “Last time, Donald Trump won by just 44,000 votes. Every single vote will matter. The power to change this country is in your hands. I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries. There is nothing — NOTHING — that is going to stop the people of this nation from voting.”President Trump and Republicans have through rhetoric, local administrative choices and lawsuits tried to curtail voting, challenging and obstructing widely accepted electoral practices.President Trump sought to push back on an Axios news article that he planned to declare victory on Tuesday night if he was “ahead”, even though the outcome would depend on the counting of large numbers of mail-in ballots, nearly 60 million already returned, with 31 million more expected.“That was a false report,” he told reporters between rallies. “We’ll look at what happened. I think it’s a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election. I think it’s a terrible thing when people or states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over because it can only lead to one thing, and that’s very bad.”Jason Miller, a senior Trump campaign aide, expressed similar reservations about counting continuing well past election night saying in an interview to ABC News that Trump will be “ahead” in electoral college votes on Tuesday night and then, he suggested wrongly, the Democrats will “try to steal it back after the election”.The Trump campaign is pushing a misleading narrative that the outcome of the elections must be known and declared on election night. That has happened in past elections, but it’s a practice driven completely by the situation on the ground, not by law. His 2016 election was declared past 3 am the next day and the winner of the 2000 election was declared more than a month after.Tuesday night is expected to be messy, by all accounts, with the possibility of violence forecast.Tensions and tempers are already rising. A group of Trump supporters in cars — called the “Trump Train” group — surrounded a Biden campaign bus and forced it slow down in the middle of a highway in Texas, a solidly Republican state that Democrats hoping to flip this election. FBI is investigating the incident.Trump supporters in cars blocked traffic on two major highways in the New York-New Jersey area on Sunday. Business establishments in Washington DC and other have begun boarding up their windows in anticipation of violence on election night and after with memories still fresh of looting and violence past summer.With two days left for close of polling, Trump and Biden, along with their surrogates are making their closing arguments in battleground states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina, Minnesota, Florida, Arizona and Nevada; democrats are also taking a shot at Texas and Georgia.Trump’s final arguments are chiefly a defence of his handling of the Covid-19 epidemic and a reminder of the booming economy before the virus hit the country and the promise of more of that if elected. At a rally on Sunday night, he attacked Anthony Fauci, the epidemiologist who has contested Trump’s claims, and suggested he might fire him after election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-trump-make-last-mile-dash-of-swing-states-before-election-day/story-1MWJqBbixKSSsculGYyckN.html

03-11-2020||India||In foreign secretary’s London speech, a message on Indo-Pacific and ‘rise of China’||The rise of China and the need for global rebalancing have contributed to the current focus on the Indo-Pacific, a region through which 90 percent of India’s international trade travels, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Tuesday.Speaking at the think tank Policy Exchange in London on the theme “India’s vision of the Indo-Pacific”, Shringla outlined New Delhi’s plans to work with other countries across the region to ensure a rules-based order, maritime security and stability.“The Indo-Pacific ocean system carries an estimated 65 percent of world trade and contributes 60 percent of global GDP. Ninety percent of India’s international trade travels on its waters, he said, noting that the shift in the economic trajectory from the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific has been “hugely consequential”.He added, “The rise of China and the imperative for a global rebalancing have added to the mix. A rules-based international order is achievable only with a rules-based Indo-Pacific.”India, he said, will work for an “Indo-Pacific guided by norms and governed by rules, with freedom of navigation, open connectivity, and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states”.Also read: Military talks with China to resolve border row likely on November 6Shringla, who is in the UK as part of a three-nation tour that also took him to France and Germany, focused on the growing cooperation between India and its neighbours as well as countries such as the US, Australia and Japan across the Indo-Pacific, both to protect freedom of navigation and to boost trade.“We have sought to strengthen security and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific by becoming a net security provider – for instance in peacekeeping efforts or anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden,” he said. In the past six years, India has provided coastal surveillance radar systems to Mauritius, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Myanmar and Bangladesh, and all these countries, as well as Mozambique and Tanzania, use Indian-made patrol boats, he said.Mobile defence training teams have been deputed to 11 countries, from Vietnam to South Africa and Myanmar, and the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre for the Indian Ocean Region has enhanced maritime domain awareness among partners.India has also developed capacities for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), and notable missions in the Indo-Pacific included “Operation Rahat” in Yemen in 2015, when India evacuated 6,710 people, including 1,947 citizens of more than 40 countries.Amid the pandemic, India sent rapid response medical teams to countries as far apart as Kuwait and the Maldives and maintained food supply lines for Gulf nations and smaller island states such as Seychelles and Comoros.In a tacit reference to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Shringla said India has promoted infrastructure, connectivity, economic projects and supply chains while “prioritising the needs of the host community and the ethic of equity, environmental sustainability and social viability”. Like Germany, India too believes in fair competition, avoiding over-indebtedness on the part of recipient countries and ensuring transparency and sustainability while developing connectivity, he added.For India, the Indo-Pacific stretches from the western coast of North America to the eastern shores of Africa, and the country’s strategy for the region was spelt out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a speech in Singapore in 2018 as the “SAGAR” or “security and growth for all in the region” doctrine, Shringla said. This includes securing supply chains, “no disproportionate dependence on a single country” and ensuring prosperity for all stakeholder nations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-foreign-secretary-s-london-speech-a-message-on-indo-pacific-rise-of-china/story-9uxldjI0VFr2fibN2EXJeL.html

Among the many who are indulging in these festivities for the first time and are trying to keep their spirits high shares their take on the celebrations during the ongoing pandemic.For youngster Prachi Singh this is the first time she will be celebrating all the festivals with her new family, “Living life in pandemic itself is a challenge. And celebrating festivals is a tricky affair for all of us. This will be my first Karwa Chauth and I had never thought to celebrate it in such circumstances. Still, I would do my best to carry out the traditions of the family and celebrate in best possible. While fasting I would be praying for my husband as well as the entire family. As it’s a tough time for all of us and we all need to be safe and happy.”Prakhar and Aishwarya Chauhan got married during the unlock phase in June and for them celebrations are important yet they following all Covid-19 guidelines is their priority. “I got my mehndi done yesterday night at home from a professional with precautions in place. Since I’m a doctor, I’m well aware how do take best safety measures from the virus while fasting as it’s important to keep myself hydrated. To keep the day special for me as no many guests will be visiting us due the pandemic, my husband and in-laws are planning a festival full of gifts along with my favourite Chinese dinner,” shared Aishwarya.This year many would be avoiding celebrating the festival in group, where all the married women of the locality get together and offer prayers for their husband’s longevity and complete all the rituals together. Homemaker Ratika Verma feels that the best way to celebrate is to stay home and have a private ceremony. “This is my third Karwa Chauth and unlike last year it’s going to be a different situation for me as well as the other women folks in my locality. I can’t imagine celebrating alone in my apartment, last year we all had so much fun in the society compound during the festivities. Also this year we are joined by two new brides in our society building but sadly with no group celebrations they too have to celebrate the day in their respective homes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/first-timers-in-lucknow-keep-it-safe-this-karwa-chauth/story-sD2PMWHIJZDP1qdxzpCKTO.html

It is generally observed that elderly people, children, persons with comorbidities and others develop respiratory problems during winter, he said.This apart, the air pollution, higher concentration of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in the air aggravates the respiratory problems.“It is a well-known fact that burning of the fire crackers releases copious amounts of harmful chemicals like nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, which have severe impact on the respiratory health of vulnerable groups,” he said. Such pollutants can further aggravate health conditions of Covid-19 positive persons besides persons staying in home isolation, he said.The chief secretary also issued an instruction to the local administrations and police to take measures for the implementation of the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bans-sale-use-of-firecrackers-amid-covid-19/story-J09bboO5jJjY0qj3bl4tIP.html

03-11-2020||India||Military talks with China to resolve border row likely on November 6||Talks with China to reduce friction in the sensitive eastern Ladakh theatre may resume soon, with the eighth round of military dialogue between the Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) expected to take place this week, officials familiar with the ongoing border row said on Tuesday. There are indications that the dialogue could take place along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Chushul sector on November 6, the officials said. Indian and Chinese military commanders met for the seventh time on October 12, with the Indian side demanding comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the talks. The two sides agreed to continue with the dialogue process to arrive at a mutually-acceptable solution for early disengagement in the eastern Ladakh theatre. The eighth round of talks will be led for the first time by the new commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, Lieutenant General PGK Menon. Both armies are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and are likely to hold forward positions along the LAC through the harsh winter months. India has made vigorous attempts to provide logistics support to its forward deployed soldiers, including the supply of specialised winter clothing sourced from the United States, the officials said. India has imported more than 15,000 sets of extended cold weather clothing system (ECWCS) from the US, with the emergency supply made by activating the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Association (LEMOA), the officials said. India signed the LEMOA, the first of the three foundational agreements proposed by Washington to deepen bilateral military cooperation, with the US in August 2016. Defence minister Rajnath Singh had on October 28 said that talks with China for peaceful resolution of the border crisis would continue even as Indian troops are “standing firm” in forward areas. Addressing the army’s top leadership during the army commanders’ conference last month, Singh said that soldiers would be equipped with best weapons and gear to carry out their duties. The border row is in its sixth month and efforts to disengage and de-escalate have yielded no results.The latest round of military talks comes at a time when China is closely tracking the Malabar exercise, kicked off by the navies of India, United States, Japan and Australia in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday amid Chinese sabre-rattling in the Indo-Pacific region. The 24th edition of the Malabar exercise is being held in two phases - the first phase in the Bay of Bengal from November 3 to 6 and the second phase to be held off India’s west coast in mid-November. China has been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-talks-with-china-to-resolve-border-row-likely-on-november-6/story-soLF49XVH1Q9yNewW2jShJ.html

03-11-2020||India||Army chief off to Nepal, visit expected to ease ties after border row||Indian Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane will head for Kathmandu on Wednesday on a three-day visit that is expected to smoothen bilateral ties with Nepal after a bitter border row, especially by building on the traditionally strong military relationship between the two countries, officials familiar with developments said on Tuesday. Naravane will be in Nepal during November 4-6, when he will meet his Nepalese counterpart General Purna Chandra Thapa and top civilian leaders. Nepal’s President Vidya Devi Bhandari will confer the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army to Naravane at an investiture ceremony on November 6, the officials said. Bilateral ties were hit in May after defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a key border road to Lipulekh region, which is claimed by Nepal. Kathmandu responded by issuing a new map that showed Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, all controlled by India, as part of Nepalese territory, exacerbating the row. Naravane’s visit is expected to lay the groundwork for much-anticipated talks between the two sides on the border issue, the officials said. “I am delighted to be visiting Nepal and to meet my counterpart General Purna Chandra Thapa. I am sure that this visit will go a long way in strengthening the bonds and friendships that the two armies cherish,” Naravane said on the eve of his Nepal visit. Also read: Gilgit-Baltistan - Pak plays the role of supplicant to Chinese expansionHe said he would be calling on the Nepali PM and it was a great honour for him to be conferred the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army by President Bhandari. Naravane’s visit comes days after Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief Samant Kumar Goel made a low-key visit to Kathmandu during which he met Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The spokesperson of the Indian embassy in Kathmandu, Naveen Kumar, on Tuesday said that the army chief’s visit would deepen the long-standing and customary bonds of friendship between the two armies. “His visit will provide an opportunity for both sides to discuss the bilateral defence partnership and explore avenues to further strengthen it for mutual benefit,” the Indian embassy in Kathmandu tweeted. The officials said the army chief is expected to interact with Indian Army pensioners in Nepal during the visit - there are 136,000 pensioners in that country and form part of the strong links between the two sides. This will be Naravane’s second visit with a diplomatic purpose after his recent tour of Myanmar where he accompanied foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and was part of talks on security cooperation and developmental issues. India’s assistance to Myanmar currently stands at $1.4 billion, and New Delhi will provide debt service relief under the G20 debt service suspension initiative to Myanmar from May to December to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-off-to-nepal-visit-expected-to-ease-ties-after-border-row/story-PRuPUg7OXJpPqlaQWcRNWI.html

Singh had sought an appointment with the President on Wednesday to seek assent to the bills recently passed by the state assembly in a bid to negate the Centre’s new farm laws. But Rashtrapati Bhavan has declined his request for appointment, the state government said on Tuesday. The CM on Tuesday said the protest in Delhi will highlight the situation in the state because of the suspension of goods trains by the Centre. The Railways has stopped running trains to Punjab, saying the farmers protesting against the farm laws are still blocking some tracks. But the state government maintains that they have eased the blockade and are allowing goods trains to run. Thermal power plants are shutting down in the state because of lack of coal, the Punjab government said.

03-11-2020||India||Odisha’s anti-cannabis ops to go high-tech with satellite imagery and AI||Even as cannabis seizure in Odisha touches a record high with police alone seizing more than 1,100 quintal this year, the state government is now planning to use high-resolution satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to auto detect the massive cannabis plantation for destruction. On Saturday, Odisha police seized a record 13 quintals of ganja worth Rs 2 crore from two different places in Koraput district. The seizure made from an under-construction house at Hanumal village under the Machakund police station and a mini truck at Debata Chhak under the Padua police station of Koraput was the highest ever single-day catch. Other agencies like the Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), state excise as well as Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) have also tasted success this year. Cannabis means the flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant (excluding the seeds and leaves when not accompanied by the tops) as well as charas, whether crude or purified, obtained from the cannabis plant and also includes concentrated preparation and resin known as hashish oil or liquid hashish. On average, 1,500 hemp plants can be grown in an acre. Upon harvesting, each hemp plant produces at least 500 gm of ganja. Locally, the ganja is sold at about 2,000 per kg. Odisha is one of the leading cannabis producing states in India. Now flush with success of rising seizures, Odisha is planning to use remote-sensing technology, machine-learning algorithm and artificial intelligence to destroy large swathes of cannabis plantations in Malkangiri, Sambalpur, Deogarh, Kandhamal, Boudh, Rayagada, Gajapati, Angul and Nayagarh districts. Though more than four crore hemp plants, whose value is estimated at approximately Rs 34,000 crore, have been destroyed in the past five years, the plantation is still widespread in those districts. “In the initial phase, the excise and police department officials will create a master record for all the cannabis plantation sites in Odisha by geo-tagging and geo-fencing. Based on those parameters, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify cannabis plantations from high-resolution satellite imagery. Satellite images will be processed for radiometric, atmospheric, and geometric rectification, and will be used for the classification of cannabis,” said excise commissioner Anjan Kumar Manik. As cannabis plantation activities start from October onwards, officials said high spatial and temporal resolution satellite images and advanced algorithms for image processing and spatial modelling would be able to produce reliable geographic information for law enforcement agencies. Officials said use of high-resolution satellite imageries at regular intervals and machine learning algorithms would auto detect the cannabis plantation and help raise alerts for the authorities through a mobile application. The satellite data would help the authorities view the map of the whole state and administrative boundaries, marked with illegal plantation sites. Apart from using satellite imagery, the government is also planning to start a citizen reporting module in which people can take the images and videos of any illegal plantation and report through the app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-s-anti-cannabis-ops-to-go-high-tech-with-satellite-imagery-and-ai/story-rjuaOKjV7w40Z8nA1p0jPK.html

Equities were rallying ahead of the US election, while the dollar lost almost 0.5%, adding to positive sentiment in crude.On Monday, Energy Minister Alexander Novak met with Russian producers to discuss delaying an easing of production cuts by three months. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have been dropping hints for weeks that its plan to add almost 2 million barrels a day of supply from January is being reconsidered as demand falters.The rest of the week promises to be as turbulent as the start with Americans heading to the polls on Tuesday for an election that could reshape US policy on everything from fiscal stimulus to Iran and fracking. China, meanwhile, remains the bright spot for global demand, with authorities raising the quota for use of overseas oil by non-state entities next year by more than 20%.“All eyes will be on the US election today and tomorrow,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB AB. “It would definitely be a relief for the market if it did not have to worry about an additional 1.9 million barrels a day of supply coming into the market at the start of January,” Schieldrop said of OPEC+’s plans to delay its output hike.The rise in the Chinese import quota, which is equivalent to about 823,000 barrels a day, is largely due to refining capacity expansions by Zhejiang Petrochemical and Shenghong Petrochemical Group. Chinese oil buying has picked up in recent weeks with traders hoarding cargoes of everything from Russian to Angolan crude in preparation for the new quota.Even as OPEC and its allies look likely to delay adding more output, some members -- including Iraq and Nigeria -- are seemingly undermining the group’s efforts to shore up oil markets. Production from OPEC jumped by 470,000 barrels a day in October to 24.74 million a day, according to a Bloomberg survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oil-gains-on-weaker-dollar-after-opec-edges-toward-taper-delay/story-cZzamy7oF9PSDDhxqxzgYI.html

Mohammed Arif Mohiuddin, a native of Chanchalguda in the old city of Hyderabad, who was running a grocery shop, was stabbed by unknown attackers when he opened the door of his house. His family in Hyderabad was informed of the murder on Monday. Mohiuddin is survived by his wife Mehnaaz Fatima and a 10-month old baby. He had been in Georgia for the last 10 years and had last visited Hyderabad in January to see his new-born.According to his family members, CCTV footage showed that Mohiuddin was assaulted by four miscreants.“Initially, we suspected the hand of his business partners with whom Mohiuddin had some differences. Later, we came to know that the killers had nothing to do with him. They might have killed him for money,” said a close relative of Fatima.She said the family had received information on Monday night that the police had arrested three men while the fourth suspect was still absconding. “We are yet to get further details about the accused and their motive,” the relative said. Fatima said her husband had spoken to her around 9 am on Sunday (Saturday night in the US) and said he would call back after half an hour on reaching home. But I did not get the call even after two hours,” she said. Later, Fatima called up his sister-in-law and other friends in Georgia, who in turn enquired with the locals and found out that Mohiuddin was murdered. “They told me that the police had shifted his body to a nearby hospital,” she said. Fatima wrote to Union external affairs minister Dr Subrahmanyam Jaishankar requesting him to arrange an emergency visa for her and her father-in-law Khaja Moizuddin to fly to the US to attend the last rites of her husband. She also urged her to ask the Indian embassy in Washington and the Indian consulate in Atlanta to inquire into his murder. Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT) party spokesperson Amjadullah Khan said he had also requested the external affairs ministry for help to the bereaved family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabadi-businessman-stabbed-to-death-in-georgia-in-us-three-arrested/story-7BflaCDNEBFcSywwj3PtPK.html

The railway authorities have been asked to come up with a detailed calendar on running of local trains. A final decision would be taken in a meeting between state government officials and railway officials on November 5. “We have to follow Covid-19 protocol. But we also need to consider and accommodate the public interest. We would plan and come up with a detailed calendar on how, when and on which routes trains may run on galloping mode,” said Alapan Bandyopadhyay, chief secretary of West Bengal A galloping local train does not stop at all stations on the route and the strategy could be used to ensure that the number of passengers can be controlled in line with Covid SOPs.Under Covid protocol only 600 passengers would be allowed in one local train which has a seating capacity of 1,200 passengers. Local trains are the lifelines connecting the cities of Kolkata and Howrah with towns and villages of adjoining districts. More than two million passengers use the two stations – Howrah and Sealdah - every day that receive both express trains and local trains. There have been protests at various railway stations on the outskirts of Kolkata and in other districts to allow passengers to board special trains that are being operated only for railway staff. While people blocked railway tracks on a level crossing near the Grand Trunk Road at Baidyabati in Hooghly on Monday, protests also raged in other stations as well. On Saturday the security forces had allegedly lathi charged passengers who tried to forcefully enter the Howrah station to board special trains for railway staff. “We may start with 10%–15% and then take it up 25% soon,” said a senior railway official present at Monday’s meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-keen-to-run-galloping-local-trains-at-half-capacity-under-covid-sops/story-5cDga47eg0jxACiojYXgnO.html

He was said to be mentally unstable and was then working in a hotel in Ranchi. However, the family did not file any missing persons report with local police and did not pursue the matter.“No one knows for sure how he reached Pakistan. But he seems to have somehow reached Amritsar and from there wandered off the border. He was caught by Pakistan authorities and treated as a prisoner of war. The family did not have any inkling of him till he was handed over to Indian authorities at the border on October 26 as per the usual practice of handing over of such prisoners who are not involved in any criminal activities,” said Sundargarh’s superintendent of police Sagarika Nath.Nath said she received a call last week from the ministry of external affairs about Kulu’s release from a jail in Lahore and was asked to get his family address checked as he had given his Sundargarh address to Pakistani authorities. The Sundargarh police then enquired about Kulu and informed the family that he had “inadvertently” crossed into Pakistan and spent 20 years in Lahore jail on suspicion of being a spy.Officials said his family had given up all hope of seeing him again. “His parents have died in the meanwhile. Only his sister and uncles are alive. His elder sister was very happy when the district administration officials informed her about Birju’s whereabouts,” said Biswajit Mohapatra, additional district magistrate of Sundargarh. Kulu’s sister spoke with her brother over a video call.

In the decade that went by, we built roads, now we are building airports and giving a facelift to the existing ones,” he added.Modi also asserted that trends of the first phase of the Bihar assembly elections and the second that was underway suggested that voters of the state had rejected “double yuvraaj”, an expression he has coined for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s (RJD’s) Tejashwi Yadav. “In Bihar, rangbaazi (rowdyism) and rangdaari (extortion) are losing and vikas (development) and kanoon kaa raaj (rule of law) is winning, parivarvad (dynasty rule) is being defeated by jantantra (democracy),” he asserted.Training his guns at the Congress, Modi accused the opposition party of having always made false promises of poverty eradication, farm loan waiver and one rank-one pension for retired servicemen. “This is the reason why the party is now left with less than 100 MPs in both Houses of Parliament combined. In states like UP and Bihar they have been relegated to the third, fourth or fifth position and are piggybacking other parties for survival,” he added.The Prime Minister also praised people for the impressive voter turnout in the first phase of elections and the second phase so far despite the coronavirus pandemic. “It is an occasion for the world, all the think tanks across the world, to take note and understand the deep roots of democracy in India”. He also praised the Election Commission and poll officials for conducting the mammoth exercise amid the crisis.Millions of people are voting in the second phase of Bihar Assembly Election 2020 which is underway in 94 constituencies. In phase 1, held on October 28, 71 constituencies went to vote. The third and final phase of voting will be held November 7 and votes will be counted on November 10.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-s-time-for-a-modern-bihar-says-pm-modi-at-saharsa/story-ffTAGzKYMGqmrggIg6EjvI.html

The episode had social activist Bezwada Wilson and actor Anup Soni in the hot seat opposite Bachchan, who asked the folliwng question, worth Rs 6.40 lakh: On 25th December 1927, Dr B R Ambedkar and his followers burned copies of which scripture?

They were booked by Bandra Police in September after Rhea Chakraborty lodged a complaint against Rajput’s sisters. Also read | Rhea Chakraborty’s accusations against Sushant’s sisters ‘speculative’, says CBIBandra Police’s senior inspector Nikhil Kapse in the affidavit refuted the allegations that the police were damaging the reputation of the petitioners or any deceased person. The affidavit said that the police were not trying to “influence or derail” the probe being carried out by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) by registering the FIR against Rajput’s sisters. “The FIR (against Priyanka and Meetu) was registered based on the information provided by the first informant (Chakraborty) disclosing commission of offence,” the affidavit said, according to PTI.

Therefore, the Mumbai Police were duty-bound to register the FIR,” the affidavit said. It added that the police, in keeping with the order passed by the Supreme Court, referred all relevant documents pertaining to the FIR to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing Rajput’s death case, after its registration. The police opposed the stand taken by CBI that they should not have registered the FIR in the same case that the central agency was already probing.“The case being probed by the CBI is one registered by the deceased’s father in Bihar. On the other hand, the FIR lodged by the Mumbai police is by Rhea Chakraborty seeking investigation for forgery, cheating and criminal conspiracy against Sushant Singh Rajput’s sisters Priyanka and Meetu and doctor Tarun Kumar,” the affidavit said. It is now for the CBI to investigate both the FIRs and to file appropriate reports, it added. A bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik will take up the plea for hearing on Wednesday.

I have sent a letter to EOW for a probe into irregularities in the utilization of funds,” said Singh in a tweet later.Singh said the society was linked to Nehru-Gandhi family and senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid was one of its members. When contacted, Khurshid said he was not aware of the accusations made by Aditi Singh.“As far as I remember, I am a member of one such society. They are very good people and doing some very good work. Office bearers of the society take care of the day-to-day work and they will respond to whatever accusations have been made. Everyone is not obviously involved in day-to-day functioning,” said Khurshid on the phone. Other members of the society could not be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamla-nehru-education-society-is-fake-says-rebel-congress-mla-in-up/story-qPXTZhe1Sgg6PS6qClyrnO.html

03-11-2020||India||Second Covid-19 peak in Mumbai to be less severe comparatively, says TIFR||Hospitalisations due to Covid-19 will be much higher if Mumbai opens up in the first week of November as opposed to the first week of January 2021, suggests a report of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.Their report further highlights that the next peak in Covid cases in Mumbai will be substantially reduced in effect as compared to the peak in the pandemic cases the city witnessed in mid-May and June 2020. Researchers also suggested that by mid-January 2021, the percentage of population infected in the city slums will be around 80% whereas in non-slum areas will stand at around 55%. This further indicates that the city will have almost reached the “herd immunity” stage by then. “By this we mean that new infections and related medical indicators in the city will be substantially reduced compared to their peak values recorded previously,” said Dr Sandeep Juneja, dean, TIFR’s School of Technology and Computer Science. “It is almost like we are living in two different cities within the same city. While the slums were first to get infected and witness widespread infections between April and June, thereafter the infections are primarily in non-slum areas,” he said.“The curve of medical indicators for Mumbai such as hospitalisations, critical patients, reported cases and fatalities had begun to stabilize during June and July and reduced further in August. However, there was an increase in medical indicators towards the end of August, presumably due to increased intermingling due to Ganpati festival. We now predict that during Diwali, despite increased intermingling, the corresponding infections will be less in comparison.” The predictions are based largely Indian Institute of Science (IISc)-TIFR agent based simulator method which had previously predicted the dip in the Covid-graph in June as well as an increase in cases in August-end. The simulation method uses medical indicators as well as other details to develop long-term projections for Mumbai under realistic scenarios related to Mumbai’s opening of workplaces and the public transportation through local trains and buses.Based on their report, the researchers have further recommended gradual reopening of offices and other workplaces in order to control infections and that schools and colleges reopen only in the first week of January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-covid-19-peak-in-mumbai-to-be-less-severe-comparatively-says-tifr/story-iFOCWBfVkRSl5hDnuxRisN.html

The fate of as many as 355 candidates, including 22 women, is in the hands of more than 6.35 million voters casting their ballot at 9,361 polling centres in the 28 constituencies. Out of the 28 seats, 16 of fall under the Gwalior-Chambal region.The BJP has 107 MLAs in 230-member state assembly against the Congress’ 87, the Bahujan Samaj Party’s 2, lone Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA and four Independent MLAs. One of the seats is vacant. The BJP will need eight MLAs to reach the majority mark of 115 and Congress needs to win all the 28 seats to get to the majority mark if both the parties don’t need any support from the BSP, SP or independent MLAs.The elections are a crucial test for senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia who made a Twitter appeal to voters on Monday. “I request you all to vote in favour of the BJP candidates and thus strengthen Shivraj Singh Chouhan government. Every vote cast in favour of BJP will contribute to making of a prosperous Madhya Pradesh and strong India,” Scindia had tweeted.Kamal Nath, the president of the Congress’ Madhya Pradesh unit also tweeted ahead of the by-polls. “The by-polls will be known as a different chapter in MP’s history.

03-11-2020||India||Mercury dips further in Delhi, reaches 10°C||Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 10 degree Celsius (C) on Tuesday morning, which was 5 degrees C below normal. This temperature was updated by India Meteorological Department (IMD) at 8.30am. “There are cold wave conditions already over Delhi, but will be declared on day 2 if same criteria is fulfilled,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.On Monday, the minimum temperature recorded was 10.8 degrees C.The minimum temperatures are likely to be below normal over all of north-west India, except some parts of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), Uttarakhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP), where it is likely to be nearly normal to above normal, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre, Delhi.Experts said the fall in minimum temperature in Delhi-national capital region (NCR) is due to a combination of factors, including incursion of cold air from the Himalayas and subsidence of cold air over the region.“Climatologically, we are moving towards winter. Temperature will gradually fall. However, there is subsidence of air over the Delhi-NCR, which is bringing down minimum temperature. There are cold northerly winds, but they are not as strong,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, on Monday. Subsidence, Mohapatra explained, is the downward movement of cold and dry air closer to the surface.Rainfall activity is also likely to increase because of the influence of strengthening of north-easterly winds. Widespread rainfall accompanied with isolated thunderstorms and lightning is likely to occur over Tamil Nadu (TN) and Kerala from Wednesday (November 4).Heavy rainfall is likely to occur over TN from between Wednesday and Friday (November 4 and 6); over Kerala till Thursday (November 5); and over south interior Karnataka on Wednesday and Thursday (November 4 and 5).Dry weather is likely to prevail over the rest of the country during the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mercury-dips-further-in-delhi-reaches-10-2-c/story-QguDzfZCgrELs0N6UV51oM.html

03-11-2020||India||Rajasthan assembly passes 3 farm bills||The Rajasthan assembly on Monday passed three bills by a voice vote after an eight-hour debate to counter new farms laws cleared by Parliament, following in the footsteps of the Congress-ruled Punjab and Chhattisgarh.The bills fail to assure the minimum support price (MSP) for major crops sold at agriculture produce mandis or bought by private players, contrary to Punjab’s bills. The MSP assurance was provided for contract farming. That too for just seven crops. However, like Punjab, Rajasthan provides for three to seven years of imprisonment for harassing farmers.Harassment will be treated as committed when the trader does not accept the delivery of the farm produce agreed upon or, having accepted the delivery, does not make the payment to the farmer in accordance with the terms of the agreement or within three days from the date of receipt of delivery of goods, whichever is earlier. Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Kumar Dhariwal introduced The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020. Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) members walked out as the bills were passed.However, the bills become law only after the Governor’s assent, who may withhold and decide to refer them to the President. Political commentator Avadhesh Akodia said that Article 254(2) of the Constitution allows a state to make changes to central legislation on a subject on the concurrent list only if it gets Presidential assent. Several BJP leaders also said that the state government did not have a right to make amendment to central laws. Parliament recently enacted farm laws deregulating the sale of agriculture produce, a move the central government said was needed to usher in reforms in the farm sector. Several farmer unions and the opposition Congress claimed that the move will lead to the dismantling of the MSP system.During the debate on the bills, leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said the central laws were enacted after taking into account recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, which talked about one nation, one market; contract farming; and abolition of indirect mandi taxes.“Farmers were free to sell their produce anywhere in the country and you are saying that you have freed them. You have worked to handover agriculture mandis directly into the hands of corporate houses,” Dhariwal said. Kisan mahapanchayat president Rampal Jat said the state government should make MSP mandatory for every sale and purchase of crops in the mandis too||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-assembly-passes-3-farm-bills/story-QVgws93Qgf9bJvziENkNHI.html
03-11-2020||India||Rajya Sabha panels’ performance improves||The Rajya Sabha might have suffered frequent disruptions in the past several sessions, but the eight standing committees under the Upper House have improved their performance. A review of the functioning of the panels over the past three years shows that they spent more times discussing issues and that, for the first time, the average sitting exceeded two hours (this was in 2019-20) before the pandemic drastically reduced attendance this year. Indian Parliament has 24 department-related standing committees that review the functioning of the union government. All central ministries and departments come under the purview of these panels; 16 panels are headed by Lok Sabha MPs and the remaining are under the Rajya Sabha’s jurisdiction and headed by its MPs. Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu asked for performance reviews of the functioning of the panels on parameters such as attendance, quorum and the preparation of reports to ensure transparency and accountability. The latest review showed that these panels met for an average duration of 2 hours 10 minutes in 2019-20, an improvement over the average of 1 hour 51 minutes in 2017-18 and 1 hour 25 minutes in 2018-19. House panels are multi-party bodies that examine bills and submit report to Parliament. Their suggestions are not binding upon the government but they provide important policy roadmaps and talking points for MPs. If the government decides not to accept a panel’s suggestions, it has to reply to Parliament, justifying its decisions. The functioning of these panels also assume importance as the members usually go beyond partisan lines to draft reports. The review also showed that FY19-20 saw the best attendance rate of 49% in the past three years. While average attendance crossed the halfway mark with 50.7% for the first time during the first half of 2019-20, it tumbled to 41% in the last few months of FY19-20. The review showed that nearly two in five meetings saw more than 50% attendance—a stark departure from corresponding proportions of 14% and 30% during the previous two years. The number of meetings held without quorum, or the minimum required attendance, declined to 10% in 2019-20. The eight committees spent more than 254 hours in FY19-20 and clocked a total of 571 hours in 300 meetings over the three years. While home affairs panel held the longest meeting (more than 47 hours) in 2017-20, the HRD panel spent the maximum time in sittings -- 100 hrs. The industry panel spent the least time—just 36 hours 11 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-panels-performance-improves/story-qUb7ZrrLI2VPG3xmU0yv9J.html

Malabar’s 24th edition is being conducted as a “non-contact, at sea only” affair in the view of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, an official familiar with the developments said. “The first phase will witness the participation of Indian Navy units with USN Ship USS John S McCain (a guided-missile destroyer), RAN Ship HMAS Ballarat (long-range frigate) with integral MH-60 helicopter, and JMSDF Ship JS Onami (destroyer) with an integral SH-60 helicopter,” he added.3. “INS Ranvijay, multi-role frigate INS Shivalik, off-shore patrol vessel INS Sukanya, fleet tanker INS Shakti and submarine INS Sindhuraj will be deployed by the Indian side which is being led by Rear Admiral Sanjay Vatsayan (Flag Officer Commanding, Eastern Fleet) during this phase,” the official said.4. The Malabar, which originally started in 1992 as a bilateral exercise between India and the United States, welcomed Japan as a permanent member in 2015. On October 20 this year, it was announced that Australia too will again participate in the exercise. Australia last participated in the Malabar exercise in 2007.5. According to Australian defence minister Linda Reynolds, Malabar 2020 marked a milestone opportunity for the Australian Defence Force (ADF). “High-end military exercises like MALABAR are key to enhancing Australia’s maritime capabilities, building interoperability with our close partners, and demonstrating our collective resolve to support an open and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” Reynolds was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malabar-naval-exercise-2020-first-phase-of-the-malabar-exercise-starts-today/story-iQV6I06yUUMyy3az9IntPL.html

Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah informing him about the abduction and death of Intazul Laskar. He also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh for the family of the victim. Following the development, Sonowal directed newly appointed chief secretary Jishnu Barua and director general of police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta to rush to the border area and take stock of the situation there. Expressing concern about the boundary row, the CM asked the police to remain alert and thwart all attempts to vitiate peace along the boundary between the two states. According to reports, Intazul, a resident of Lailapur in Cachar district of Assam which lies along the border with Mizoram, was allegedly abducted by miscreants on Sunday morning. “It is now confirmed that Intazul, who was abducted from the Assam side, died in custody of police in Kolasib district of Mizoram. The exact details of how he died will be known after thorough investigation,” BL Meena, superintendent of police, Cachar, said. “We are trying to get the deceased’s body back and are in talks with Kolasib district officials. A case under section 365 of IPC for abduction has been registered at Dholai police station and investigation is underway,” he added. Kolasib’s superintendent of police Vanlalfaka Ralte told PTI that Intazul Laskar (45), a well- known drug peddler, was apprehended on Sunday evening when he crossed the inter-state border to deliver a consignment and later died at a health facility.The Mizoram government has termed the death of Intazul as unfortunate and asked the Assam government to ensure safety and security of Mizos residing in Assam following the incident. The Mizoram home department wrote to Assam asking to “prevent any retaliatory attacks by vested parties and anti-social elements within Assam especially on the inter-state border on the issue of the unfortunate death of a resident of Lailapur at Vairengte this (Monday) morning”. The situation along the border between two states have remained tense for the past week after residents of Assam blocked the NH 306 to Mizoram demanding withdrawal of personnel of the Mizoram police and India Reserve Battalion from the disputed areas along the boundary. While Assam maintains that security personnel from Mizoram have encroached parts of its territory and have started construction, the Mizoram side claims the areas belong to them and have refused to call back its personnel till normalcy returns. Last month, several people on both sides of the border were injured in clashes after some miscreants from Mizoram allegedly burnt down some huts at Lailapur. Locals on the Assam side had blocked the highway in protest against the incident. On October 21, senior officials of both states had a meeting in Assam’s Silchar where they had agreed to restore normalcy in the border areas. Mizoram had assured it would call back its troops which had entered Assam side. Following this, trucks had started plying between both states. Assam and Mizoram share a 164.6 km boundary. There have been skirmishes on both sides earlier as well as both sides claiming portions of land along the boundary as theirs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-resident-dies-in-mizoram-police-custody-cm-sonowal-writes-to-amit-shah/story-EKgIZmqu9tyf6i1vYJ4ZxK.html

On Sunday TMC MLA from Barrackpore launched a veiled attack against Kishor’s team , before announcing that he would not contest the upcoming assembly elections in West Bengal.“An outsider agency is teaching me how to do politics. I entered politics when I was in class 6 and today, I am 62 years old. But unfortunately, I get to hear from an employee of that agency that I don’t need to worry about votes because the agency has been roped in to fight the elections for us. They are asking me about my caste as they want to introduce caste-based politics. I told them that this is not Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh or Delhi,” said Silbhadra Dutta, TMCs lawmaker from Barrackpore assembly constituency. Kishor, who earlier helped the Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and the YSR Congress Party win elections, was roped in by Banerjee after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. The TMC’s tally came down from 34 seats to 22. The BJP poses a challenge to Banerjee in the run-up to the assembly polls. While Dutta was more subtle with his comments and didn’t name I-PAC, another TMC MLA had directly hit out at I-PAC earlier in October warning that it is not good for a political party if an agency gives directions on how the party should be run. “If I-PAC, a contract agency, gives directions on how to run the party then it is not good for the party. If any political party wants a contract agency to run the party then there is 100% chance that the party would suffer. The workers should handle the work of the organization,” said Mihir Goswami, TMC MLA from Cooch Behar south. A senior TMC leader on conditions of anonymity said that state transport minister’s Suvendu Adhikary’s perceived dislike of I-PAC’s interventions in organisational affairs was one of the many reasons that led to the widely speculated rift between the minister and the party. “In 1995, I was councillor of an undivided Congress. I did not drop in using a parachute. Nor did I take an elevator. I took the stairs, step by step. No one can stop us,” Adhikary said while addressing a function in east Midnapore on Saturday that did not have TMC banners. With eye set on the crucial 2021 Bengal assembly polls the TMC chief Mamata Banerjee recently carried out a major reshuffle in the party to bring in some new faces and axing some old guards. Insiders said that much of the inputs behind this reshuffle had come from Kishor and his team’s year-long assessment of the ground realities. While IPAC refused to comment on this, TMC spokesperson Tapas Roy said: “They are our party veterans. But one has to abide by the party’s guidelines and accept whatever the party is thinking or doing. An individual is not above the party.” The TMC is making attempts to extend an olive branch to the veterans who are apparently unhappy with the recent developments. North Bengal development minister Rabindranath Ghosh and tribal development minister Binoy Krishna Burman recently met Goswami. The TMC leaders, however, failed to meet Goswami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-kishor-s-i-pac-feels-the-heat-of-tmc-veterans/story-mz0Sy3MGzIBaziWt8KYZKI.html

Gurung had been absconding since 2017 after he was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with a grenade attack at Kalimpong Police station and an explosion in Darjeeling’s Chowk Bazaar area, during the 104-day shutdown demanding separate statehood for Gorkhas - Gorkhaland.Is GJM important in West Bengal?The GJM was formed in 2007 and has played a crucial role in West Bengal politics as it has a powerful role in the Darjeeling hills. In 2016, the GJM again won three assembly seats from Darjeeling and once again intensified its demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland. But after the Gorkhaland demand agitation in 2017, GJM broke into two factions — one headed by Binoy Tamang that supported the TMC, and the other led by Bimal Gurung which supported the BJP. Now, by resurfacing Bimal Gurung has also supported the TMC.Read more: CPI(M) open to Bengal alliance with CongressDoes the TMC need GJM’s support?With the TMC winning the support of the GJM, it could jeopardise the BJP’s 2021 electoral plans in north Bengal. For the BJP, the region has been very crucial as in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 18 seats in West Bengal which included 7 of the 8 constituencies in north Bengal. On the other hand, the TMC did not win a single seat in north Bengal. This is why Mamata Banerjee has welcomed Bimal Gurung which has irked the Tamang-led faction of the GJM as it has always supported the TMC. Subsequently, supporters of Tamang took out rallies in the Hills opposing Gurung’s return. The Binay Tamang faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, currently enjoying political control over Darjeeling and has vowed not to allow Gurung to enter the Hills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gjm-s-binoy-tamang-anit-thapa-to-meet-mamata-banerjee-what-could-it-mean-for-tmc-bjp-and-west-bengal-polls/story-WEyEZAptSyYMYPjIZ9JQpL.html
03-11-2020||India||Four booked over offering namaz at Mathura temple||The Uttar Pradesh Police has registered a first information report (FIR) in Mathura against two Muslim members of Khudai Khidmatgar, a non-violent resistance organisation which traces its roots back to India’s freedom struggle, for allegedly offering “namaz” on the premises of the Nand Baba temple in the holy city. Two other Hindu members from the organisation have been named co-accused in a case registered on Sunday evening by Kanha Goswami, a priest of the temple, and two other priests, Mukesh Goswami and SD Shiv Hari. According to the FIR, the four accused -- Faizal Khan, Chand Mohammad, Alok Ratan and Neelesh Gupta -- reached the temple at about 12.30pm on October 29 and performed the “84 kos parikrama” that is common in Hindu prayers in the Mathura’s Braj area.“[Later] photographs of the two Muslims offering ‘namaz’ in the temple premises were uploaded on social media by Faizal Khan. This has hurt Hindu sentiments,” alleged Goswami. “No permission was sought from the priests or administration for offering ‘namaz’. Also, the photos of the ‘namaz’ were made viral on social media,” Goswami said in the FIR, adding that these images could be misused to fan communal tensions.Khudai Khidmatgar, which means or “servants of God”, is a resistance movement once led by Abdul Gaffar Khan, and resisted the British Raj. Abdul Gaffar Khan, a Pashtun activist who fought for India’s Independence, was popularly known as “Frontier Gandhi”. The Delhi-based organisation is now run by Faizal Khan.Locals in Barsana said that the four came for the ‘84 kos parikrama’ -- which is religious circumambulation done to please Lord Krishna. Faizal Khan, these people said, was well versed in Hindu mythology and narrated couplets from the Ramcharitmanas, an epic poem by Tuslsidas based on the Ramayana. Mathura police have taken Faizal into custody from Jamina Nagar in Delhi, from where he runs the Khudai Khidmatgar organisationHT’s attempts to contact someone from Khudai Khidmatgar failed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-booked-over-offering-namaz-at-mathura-temple/story-koLMEJPpJuPE7gouNPm8KN.html
03-11-2020||India||AG denies nod to contempt case against Andhra CM||Attorney General KK Venugopal has refused to grant consent for initiating contempt proceedings against Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy over his letter to Chief Justice of India (CJI) making wild allegations against the second most senior judge of the Supreme Court, Justice NV Ramana -- although he agreed that the duos conduct was “contumacious” and that the timing was “suspect”. The demand to initiate contempt came from BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay who wanted action against Reddy and his Principal Advisor Ajeya Kallam. Upadhyay in his letter to Venugopal, referred to the contents of a letter written by Reddy to CJI SA Bobde on October 6, in which he accused Justice Ramana of working against his government. Upadhyay mentioned that the Andhra Pradesh CM is an accused in at least 31 cases concerning offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and Prevention of Money Laundering Act pending before the special court in Telangana. The contents of the letter were released to the media by Kallam in a press conference on October 10.The government’s chief law officer’s decision was driven by the fact that the matter is already before the Chief Justice of India. Venugopal said: “Prima facie, the conduct of the said persons is contumacious. However, what has to be noted is, that the entire case of contempt arises out of the letter dated October 6 written by the CM directly to the CJI and the subsequent press conference held by Sh Kallam. The CJI is therefore seized of the matter... it would not be appropriate for me to deal with the matter.”Upadhyay in his letter addressed to AG had said, “the timing of the letter, the contents of the same, the rush to spill it to the public while the matter was pending with the Chief Justice and the separate Statement read out by Sh Kallam make it manifestly clear that this was done to interfere with the course of justice and lower the authority of the Court.” He referred to a PIL filed by him pending with the bench headed by Justice Ramana where orders were recently passed to fast-track criminal trials against all sitting and former legislators (MPs and MLAs). “I am of the opinion that the timing itself of the letter, as well as it being placed in the public domain through a press conference could certainly be said to be suspect...,” Venugopal agreed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ag-denies-nod-to-contempt-case-against-andhra-cm/story-o2LD1PbjivjxB6ZTmXvIiP.html
03-11-2020||India||Germany to send warship to patrol Indian Ocean||Germany’s defence minister announced one of the country’s warships will patrol the Indian Ocean as part of plans to manage China’s influence in the region even as foreign secretary Harsh Shringla held talks in Berlin on Monday to boost cooperation in areas ranging from post-pandemic recovery to the Indo-Pacific. Shringla, who held back-to-back meetings in Berlin with his German counterpart Miguel Berger, other senior officials and representatives of think tanks, highlighted the scope of working together for trade and investment, creation of diversified supply changes and counter-terrorism. Ahead of Shringla’s arrival in Berlin as part of a three-nation tour, German defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told The Sydney Morning Herald that a German frigate is set to patrol the Indian Ocean next year and the country’s naval presence in the Indo-Pacific will help safeguard the rules-based order. “We hope to be able to deploy next year,” she said. “We will be spending more on defence in 2021 than in 2020 despite the fact that [the Covid-19 pandemic] has hit our budgets. Now the key is to translate this into real muscle.” Kramp-Karrenbauer said Germany is working within NATO to expand relations with like-minded states such as Australia. “I am convinced territorial disputes, violations of international law and China’s ambitions for global supremacy can only be approached multilaterally,” she said. These moves come close on the heels of Germany unveiling its Indo-Pacific policy in September, when foreign minister Heiko Maas said latent conflicts in the region “would have global repercussions were they to erupt”. Shringla told his German government interlocutors that India has faced multiple challenges in recent months because of the pandemic, “tensions on our northern border and the ever-present menace of terrorism on our western border”. India has noted that Germany’s Indo-Pacific guidelines recognise the need to diversify supply chains, and both countries have a “clear convergence of interest in this area”, he said. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said Germany’s focus on the Indo-Pacific is a natural extension of its commercial and strategic interests, and the activities of its partners such as France in the region. “Germany is one of the most powerful military players in the European Union after the exit of the UK and key European players are realising the importance of the Indo-Pacific,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/germany-to-send-warship-to-patrol-indian-ocean/story-Qq1oPwrtchQMII6iBMyK2K.html
03-11-2020||India||Malabar exercise kicks off today in Bay of Bengal||The navies of India, United States, Japan and Australia will kick off the first phase of the Malabar exercise in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday at a time of Chinese sabre-rattling in the Indo-Pacific region and military tensions with India in the eastern Ladakh theatre, officials said on Monday, The 24th edition of the Malabar exercise is scheduled in two phases with the first phase set to kick-start off Visakhapatnam in Bay of Bengal from November 3-6, the Indian Navy said in a statement on Monday. “Phase-1 of Malabar 20 will witness participation of Indian Navy units with United States Ship (USS) John S McCain (guided-missile destroyer), Her Majesty’s Australian Ship (HMAS) Ballarat (long-range frigate) with integral MH-60 helicopter, and Japan Maritime Self Defence Ship (JMSDF) Onami (destroyer) with integral SH-60 helicopter,” it said. Indian and US aircraft carriers will not feature in the first phase and are likely to be deployed in the second phase of the exercise in the Arabian Sea in mid-November. The Malabar exercises began in 1992 at a time when Chinese and American economic and even security association was close, said security affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd).In the last 15 years, the security matrix has changed for several nations vis-a vis-China, and this includes most ASEAN countries and the four Quad countries, he said. “So, it does look like Malabar’s rejuvenation with four participants after 2007 will have a significance that is different from decades ago. It is an important step to build operational compatibilities that contribute towards deterrence against an expansionist China. At the same time, bilateral ties between armed forces of all four members would also continue to be important,” Shrikhande said. Led by Rear Admiral Sanjay Vatsayan, Flag Officer Commanding, Eastern Fleet, the Indian participation in the first phase of the drills will include destroyer INS Ranvijay, frigate INS Shivalik, off-shore patrol vessel INS Sukanya, fleet support ship INS Shakti and submarine INS Sindhuraj, the Indian Navy said. “In addition, advanced jet trainer Hawk, long-range maritime patrol aircraft P-8I, Dornier maritime patrol aircraft, and helicopters will also be participating in the exercise,” the statement added. China has been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue, or Quad, that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year. The first phase would witness complex and advanced naval exercises, including surface, anti-submarine and anti-air warfare operations, cross-deck flying and weapon firing exercises, officials said. The exercise comes after the Quad Foreign Ministers meeting in Tokyo on October 6 and follows the India-US 2+2 dialogue on October 26-27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malabar-exercise-kicks-off-today-in-bay-of-bengal/story-2BvmMgvDGlugM5S92KtsNP.html
03-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The US heads into elections on Tuesday having become the first country to cross 100,000 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in a day just recently, and with the seven-day average of daily new cases at an all-time high of around 82,000.The US has seen in excess of 9.2 million cases, and around 231,000 deaths – both are the highest for any country – and it is evident that every aspect of the country’s response to the pandemic has been mismanaged. President Donald Trump’s response to the pandemic – he himself was infected by the virus – has veered from denial to bluff-and-bluster to outrage over China, where the virus first emerged.VOTING IN THE TIME OF PANDEMICIt isn’t clear if Covid-19 will affect the outcome of the US election, but what is clear is that the pandemic has already affected the electoral process, with a record number of mail-in ballots It isn’t clear whether Covid-19, and the US’s response to it, will affect the outcome of this election; what is clear is that the pandemic has already affected the electoral process in the country, with a record number of mail-in ballots, the counting of which could mean a delay in results, prompting lawsuits – Trump has already said his team will challenge the process and his campaign has claimed (wrongly) that votes counted after November 3 are illegitimate or invalid. Trump and his supporters have also attacked the US’s top expert on infectious diseases Dr Anthony S Fauci, and over the weekend the President hinted that he may “fire Fauci” as a crowd at the rally he was addressing in Florida suggested he do. Whichever way you look at it, this is an election whose story, when it is told, will be inextricably linked to the story of the virus itself, its impact on lives and the economy, and the country’s response to it.Interestingly, on Monday, even as the World Health Organization’s (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was going into self-quarantine after coming in touch with a person who tested positive for Covid-19, details emerged that the organisation may have mismanaged the process of tracing the provenance of the virus, which first emerged in China’s Wuhan. WHO’s initial response to the pandemic has already come under criticism for several reasons – including accepting Beijing’s narrative of there being no human transmission of the virus, delaying the process of declaring the coronavirus disease a pandemic, and dragging its feet on admitting that the virus could be transmitted by air – but it is likely the new revelations, in an article in the New York Times will prove even more damning. WHO’S HANDLING UNDER FIRE The WHO may have mismanaged the process of tracing the provenance of the virus, according to an article in the New York Times, which is likely to prove even more damning for the UN bodyThese concern the contours of the investigation WHO will conduct into the origin of the virus, and the terms it has negotiated with Beijing, which has been its usual opaque self when it comes to sharing information on what really happened in Wuhan, and also initially opposed attempts for an international investigation. NYT reports details of the terms negotiated by WHO with China for its investigation in its Monday article, citing “documents, which have never been made public” that “show that WHO experts will review and ‘augment, rather than duplicate’, studies undertaken by China”. The article goes on to add that a key phase of the investigation, which will look for and interview early patients and infected people (going back to those affected in December), and also trace the “supply chain” of “wildlife sold at the Wuhan market”, will be “led by Chinese scientists, with outsiders reviewing their work remotely”.The revelations are likely to increase criticism of WHO and Dr Tedros. The US has already exited WHO but continues to rail against the organisation; many other countries have asked for reforms in WHO, whose deal with China – which has recorded a total of 86,021 cases, a number the US is recording every day now -- may well mean that the world never finds out how it all began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-uzOccTRNV9E9EL9mR5umqO.html
03-11-2020||India||Covid-19: Centre, Delhi huddle as third wave gets steeper||Delhi broke its record for the highest number of Covid-19 cases to be added on a weekend, data released on Monday showed, as alarm grows over the scale of the outbreak in the Capital, forcing top officials from the Union and the Delhi governments to meet on Monday and discuss a recalibration of testing, treating and surveillance strategies.In a meeting of top bureaucrats from the Union home ministry, Union health ministry, Niti Aayog, the Delhi government, and Delhi Police, to review the situation, the central officials stressed on the need to make testing more pinpointed, and called new awareness campaigns targeted at people in the 20-40 age bracket at a time when people have started moving about more freely and “pandemic fatigue” has started to set in. Several indicators now reinforce the fact that Delhi is in the grip of its third and worst wave of infections yet. In the past week, there were 5,269 cases on average every day, the highest this number has been since the first case was recorded on March 2. Peak seven-day average was at 4,174 at the height of the second wave on September 17 and 3,446 at the height of the first, which was on June 26.Similarly, the proportion of tests that turned positive was at 10.91%, according to Monday’s data. Taken as an average over the week, the test positivity rate is 10.3% – a jump of 5 percentage points in less than a month (it was 5.3% on October 8) as the proportion of more accurate molecular RT-PCR tests has increased.The trend is well reflected in Sunday numbers – from 1,947 new cases in the 24 hours ending October 4, this number grew to more than double for the corresponding period on November 1 to 4,001. Sundays follow a distinct pattern from other days of the week since there are fewer tests done, and though the total case load is suppressed, offer a good yardstick of the growth of the disease.Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev, who was a part of Monday’s meeting headed by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, said a revised strategy was now being devised to handle the spread of the deadly pathogen. “The recent surge in the number of active cases was attributed to the festival season, which has witnessed greater movement of people, accompanied by laxity in adhering to the basic principles of safe Covid behaviour,” the Union home ministry said in a statement following the meeting on Monday.“Testing, tracing, surveillance, hospital management and IEC-cum-enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour will be the crux of the revised strategy. Inputs of the expert panel headed by Dr (VK) Paul will also be included,” said Dev said, adding that the Delhi administration will now work on the new road map with the Union home and health ministries. People familiar with the matter said the Delhi administration was advised to launch targeted RT-PCR testing to cover sensitive, high-risk locations such as railway stations, interstate bus terminuses, marketplaces, restaurants and salons.“Targeted testing is already being carried out, but a revised strategy will be prepared by the MoHFW (ministry of health and family welfare), Delhi government, National Centre for Disease Control and Indian Council of Medical Research soon with suggestions from the expert panel. Delhi government officials informed in the meeting that targeted testing is being carried out at some level by setting camps at ISBTs, railway stations, markets and containment zones,” a Delhi government official said, asking not to be named.Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on the matter.The surge in cases is not unexpected. In early October, a report by the expert committee on Covid-19 headed by Niti Aayog’s VK Paul cautioned that the Capital could face as many as 15,000 Covid-19 cases per day due to festival crowding and winter conditions. That perfect storm of factors now appears to be here: More people are crowding markets for festival shopping, winter conditions have set in and the air has become more polluted. The Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 is known to survive better in the cold, and pollution is a known risk factor, often also causing symptoms similar to a coronavirus infection, making people less likely to pay attention on time.This comes at a time when imposing another lockdown is being seen as highly unlikely given the economic damage done by the summer shutdown, although experts say there may be little else that authorities can do at this point.“A lockdown now might be effective in bringing down cases, but it will not be well accepted by people. The only way now to protect against infection is to ensure 100% mask wearing in public. We haven’t been able to do it so far and that is because people are just told they should wear mask. I believe they will be more willing to follow through if they are explained why it is necessary to wear mask and how it would protect them and their families,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of clinical virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.A second expert said the authorities must consider the option of bringing back some curbs like it has been done in other countries. “A study recently published in the Lancet that looks at such interventions found that shutting down schools and offices can effectively control infection. So, we need to keep schools and colleges closed. We should also close non-essential services such as cinema hall, restaurants and pubs. I would say even the metro because people are not following preventive measures in there too,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (Aiims).According to an official who asked not to be named, home secretary Bhalla and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Monday stressed on the need for the Delhi government to “substantially augment” bed and hospital facilities. “Different hospitals earlier showed variation in death rates. We told them to identify hospitals with higher death rates and take appropriate steps. It would be more helpful,” said the official. They also pointed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s IEC (inform-educate-communicate) campaign, asking Delhi officials to target people in the 20-40 age bracket since they seemed to be the ones stepping out most often.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-centre-delhi-huddle-as-third-wave-gets-steeper/story-y3J5CM0rcXnGfDu0kUfHEN.html
03-11-2020||India||State of economy: Why it’s best to reserve conclusion||Most institutional and private forecasts expect the Indian economy to contract at a double-digit rate in the current fiscal year. This, despite the fact that the economy has been showing a sequential (month on month) improvement compared to the situation when it was locked down. However, some high frequency economic indicators suggest that not only is the economy showing sequential improvement, it might actually have surpassed last year’s levels, albeit in some areas. Does this mean that India’s economic performance will end up being better than projected?Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman hinted as much when she said last week that India’s economic growth could be negative or near-zero this year. A holistic reading of the statistics and expert opinion seem to suggest that one should wait for the ongoing festive season to end before reaching any conclusions on the economy’s growth prospects for the full year.1. October surprises pleasantlyAt least three economic indicators for the month of October suggest that economic activity received a big boost last month. Goods and Services Tax collections crossed the psychological ?1 lakh crore mark for the first time since the imposition of a nationwide lockdown in the month of March. Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing reached its highest ever value of 58.9 in October. This is the third consecutive month when PMI manufacturing has shown a sequential improvement and stayed above 50. A PMI greater than 50 signifies coming expansion in economic activity. PMI services for October will be released over the next few days. It reached a value of 49.8 in September. October could be the first month after the lockdown when both PMI manufacturing and services are in the expansion zone. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (Nibri) increased to 84.4 for the week ending November 1, the highest value since the imposition of the lockdown; 100 indicates pre-pandemic levels of activity !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();2. Does a high PMI necessarily translate into high manufacturing growth?To be sure, PMI numbers do not capture economic activity in the entire economy and are based on responses of a few economic units. Whether or not there is a revival in manufacturing will be known only after the Gross Value Added (GVA) in manufacturing numbers are released. The September quarter numbers will be released by the end of November. How useful is PMI manufacturing in predicting movements in GVA manufacturing? An HT analysis of data since the quarter ending September 2013 (the earliest period for which data is available at the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy database) shows that PMI being in the expansion zone does not guarantee a high growth rate in GVA manufacturing. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); If one were to exclude the June 2020 quarter, GVA manufacturing contracted in four quarters during this period: June 2017 and three consecutive quarters from September 2019 to March 2020. In each of these quarters, the average value of PMI manufacturing was greater than 50. On the other hand, even though PMI manufacturing was less than 50 in the quarter ending September 2013, manufacturing grew at 3.65%. This fact underlines the need for caution in taking a manufacturing revival for granted because of a buoyancy in PMI numbers3. Is the government generating economic headwinds instead of tailwinds?That the central government’s fiscal response to the pandemic’s economic shock has been inadequate in terms of direct fiscal stimuli is accepted by most observers. To be sure, the fiscal year is still not over, and the finance minister in an interview to HT said that she is open to the possibility of a second stimulus to the economy. Central government accounts until September, the latest period for which data is available with the finance ministry, suggest that the government is cutting back on fiscal support rather than enhancing it. Total spending by the central government in the months of August and September was lower than it was in the corresponding period last year. The shortfall in capital expenditure, which is more critical in generating long-term growth, is bigger. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Experts are sceptical about a second fiscal stimulus. A research note issued on November 2, by Samiran Chakraborty, chief economist at Citigroup Global Marekts India Pvt Ltd, said: “There is some market expectation that as the economy has opened up more now, the government would be in a position to announce another round of stimulus. We have been mostly of the view that the government has a conservative fiscal stance and was not building in large fiscal stimulus in our forecasts. With the February 2021 budget making process starting in November, the focus of any further fiscal action could be deferred to the February budget. We are now biased towards any fiscal action to favour infra spending rather than of the populist/redistributive variety. In our view, the govt needs to first spend the budgeted amount.”4. What about demand?The only long-term driver of sustained economic growth is demand. It is on this front that uncertainty remains. October and November could see a one-time boost in spending because of the festive demand. A good kharif harvest, which is already underway in most parts of the country, could signal a sustained rural boost to demand in the economy. But there is also the question of the employment generation ability of the ongoing sequential recovery.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();For example, the press release issued by IHS Markit, the agency which conducts the PMI survey, says that even though the PMI value has been increasing, October was the seventh consecutive month of fall in employment numbers. A fall in employment also means falling incomes and therefore demand, which could jeopardise future growth. The December round of RBI’s Consumer Confidence Survey, which includes indicators on both essential and non-essential consumer spending, will offer a crucial insight on what is happening to consumer demand in the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-of-economy-why-it-s-best-to-reserve-conclusion/story-0ozYTDXR1g2sXQMXo6cFEN.html
03-11-2020||India||Illicit liquor weakens prohibition impact in Bihar||In December 2012, the woman of Konar, a nondescript village 12 kms from Sasaram, found that young children were drinking liquor out of pouches strewn everywhere. The Bihar government had recently permitted liquor stores in every panchayat, angering local women who said they were regularly molested by drunken men, especially after dark.Earlier that month, a medical student was brutally gang raped and attacked in Delhi; as news of the violent crime reached Konar, it galvanised the woman who mostly came from marginalised communities. They organised themselves into groups and started demonstrating for a ban on the sale of liquor. “Liquor was one of the reasons for the gang rape episode in Delhi. So, after receiving numerous complaints from rural women, who were silently suffering the daily taunts, we decided to begin an agitation,” said Sunita Devi, the founder of Pragatisheel Mahila Manch (PMM), a social platform floated by women against alcoholism. The movement started in Konar spread like wildfire across the state with thousands of women and activists holding demonstrations across the state, demanding prohibition. Women came out on the streets and thronged political meetings, with slogans against liquor. “We opposed the policy of the state government to issue liberally permission for liquor shops in every panchayat. This ruined the youth and children,” added Devi. In the 2015 assembly election, prohibition was one of the key election issues and a central plank of chief minister Nitish Kumar. The buzz around the demand helped push up women voter turnout to 59.92%. In at least 30 assembly constituencies, the turnout of women voters crossed 70%. After Nitish Kumar -- who was with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) at the time -- came back to power, he quickly instituted a slew of measures such as 35% reservation for women in state government jobs and panchayat bodies, and free bicycles and school dress to girls. And then, in April 2016, Bihar banned the sale and storage of liquor, becoming the second state after Gujarat to completely impose prohibition. Four years later as another assembly election comes around, the women of Konar are ambivalent about the impact of their movement because they feel a thriving illicit liquor mafia has undercut its achievements. “We cannot forget the days when most of our family income was spent on liquor. That changed after prohibition. However, things are back to square one now, albeit illegally. The ban has remained only on paper and liquor smuggling is rampant,” said Phudena Devi who actively organised the anti-liquor protests in 2012 and 2013. .Shanti Devi, of neighbouring Sitabigha village, agreed. She said the village lost 100 men to illicit liquor in the last six-seven years. “The purpose of our agitation has been lost. People are now indulging in illegal trade of liquor. Some poor children are also involved in it,” she alleged.In four years, Bihar confiscated 41.06 lakh litres of IMFL and country made liquor, often hiring road rollers to smash bottles of liquor. But experts warned that only a small fraction of the smuggled liquor was being seized; even then, in many cases, bottles disappeared from police godowns -- in 2018,police in Kaimur district claimed that rats drank 11,000 litres of smuggled alcohol. For Santi Devi, the liquor ban yielded mixed results. “Alcohol is easily available for anyone who wants to drink,” she said. “Still there are instances of domestic violence. But it is not as brazen as it used to be and it has helped families,” she added. The support base of women voters, which boosted Kumar in 2015, is also sore about the economic crash and migrant crisis during the nationwide lockdown earlier this year. “Nitish only got support from the rural women. Women belonging to middle and upper class were not with him when he announced prohibition. The rural women who backed him, have become vocal critics due to loss of jobs of their male family members during the lockdown,” said DM Diwakar, former director of AN Sinha Institute for Social Studies. Shefali Roy, professor of political science at Patna University, said the enthusiasm of women voters -- visible in 2015 -- was missing this time. “The silent force behind Nitish Kumar’s victory was the women during the last elections. In gratification to the move of banning alcohol, women outnumbered men in the voting process. However, this was quite a transitory period. Very soon women realised their mistake, when illegal consumption and sale of alcohol made headlines,” she said. Janata Dal (United ) spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan said women voters continued to stand with Kumar. “Women voters began associating with Nitish Kumar ever since he began empowering them. The improvement of law and order has had its effect on them in rural areas as well. Prohibition further strengthened their faith in Nitish Kumar. We are sure, they (the women) will stand by us,” he said. “The purpose of prohibition has not been served. Women are also disillusioned by this falsehood. They are also fed up with rampant illegal sale of liquor. So, we don’t see any gain to Nitish Kumar from this law,” said Premchandra Mishra, Congress MLC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illicit-liquor-weakens-prohibition-impact-in-bihar/story-lcupFWM3bTZXf4NuWPqRPI.html
03-11-2020||India||Centre, Delhi huddle as third wave gets steeper||: Delhi broke its record for the highest number of Covid-19 cases to be added on a weekend, data released on Monday showed, as alarm grows over the scale of the outbreak in the Capital, forcing top officials from the Union and the Delhi governments to meet on Monday and discuss a recalibration of testing, treating and surveillance strategies.In a meeting of top bureaucrats from the Union home ministry, Union health ministry, Niti Aayog, the Delhi government, and Delhi Police, to review the situation, the central officials stressed on the need to make testing more pinpointed, and called new awareness campaigns targeted at people in the 20-40 age bracket at a time when people have started moving about more freely and “pandemic fatigue” has started to set in. Several indicators now reinforce the fact that Delhi is in the grip of its third and worst wave of infections yet. In the past week, there were 5,269 cases on average every day, the highest this number has been since the first case was recorded on March 2. Peak seven-day average was at 4,174 at the height of the second wave on September 17 and 3,446 at the height of the first, which was on June 26.Similarly, the proportion of tests that turned positive was at 10.91%, according to Monday’s data. Taken as an average over the week, the test positivity rate is 10.3% – a jump of 5 percentage points in less than a month (it was 5.3% on October 8) as the proportion of more accurate molecular RT-PCR tests has increased.The trend is well reflected in Sunday numbers – from 1,947 new cases in the 24 hours ending October 4, this number grew to more than double for the corresponding period on November 1 to 4,001. Sundays follow a distinct pattern from other days of the week since there are fewer tests done, and though the total case load is suppressed, offer a good yardstick of the growth of the disease.Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev, who was a part of Monday’s meeting headed by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, said a revised strategy was now being devised to handle the spread of the deadly pathogen.“The recent surge in the number of active cases was attributed to the festival season, which has witnessed greater movement of people, accompanied by laxity in adhering to the basic principles of safe Covid behaviour,” the Union home ministry said in a statement following the meeting on Monday.“Testing, tracing, surveillance, hospital management and IEC-cum-enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour will be the crux of the revised strategy. Inputs of the expert panel headed by Dr (VK) Paul will also be included,” said Dev said, adding that the Delhi administration will now work on the new road map with the Union home and health ministries. People familiar with the matter said the Delhi administration was advised to launch targeted RT-PCR testing to cover sensitive, high-risk locations such as railway stations, interstate bus terminuses, marketplaces, restaurants and salons.“Targeted testing is already being carried out, but a revised strategy will be prepared by the MoHFW (ministry of health and family welfare), Delhi government, National Centre for Disease Control and Indian Council of Medical Research soon with suggestions from the expert panel. Delhi government officials informed in the meeting that targeted testing is being carried out at some level by setting camps at ISBTs, railway stations, markets and containment zones,” a Delhi government official said, asking not to be named.Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on the matter.The surge in cases is not unexpected. In early October, a report by the expert committee on Covid-19 headed by Niti Aayog’s VK Paul cautioned that the Capital could face as many as 15,000 Covid-19 cases per day due to festival crowding and winter conditions.That perfect storm of factors now appears to be here: More people are crowding markets for festival shopping, winter conditions have set in and the air has become more polluted. The Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 is known to survive better in the cold, and pollution is a known risk factor, often also causing symptoms similar to a coronavirus infection, making people less likely to pay attention on time.This comes at a time when imposing another lockdown is being seen as highly unlikely given the economic damage done by the summer shutdown, although experts say there may be little else that authorities can do at this point.“A lockdown now might be effective in bringing down cases, but it will not be well accepted by people. The only way now to protect against infection is to ensure 100% mask wearing in public. We haven’t been able to do it so far and that is because people are just told they should wear mask. I believe they will be more willing to follow through if they are explained why it is necessary to wear mask and how it would protect them and their families,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of clinical virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.A second expert said the authorities must consider the option of bringing back some curbs like it has been done in other countries. “A study recently published in the Lancet that looks at such interventions found that shutting down schools and offices can effectively control infection. So, we need to keep schools and colleges closed. We should also close non-essential services such as cinema hall, restaurants and pubs. I would say even the metro because people are not following preventive measures in there too,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (Aiims).According to an official who asked not to be named, home secretary Bhalla and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Monday stressed on the need for the Delhi government to “substantially augment” bed and hospital facilities. “Different hospitals earlier showed variation in death rates. We told them to identify hospitals with higher death rates and take appropriate steps. It would be more helpful,” said the official. They also pointed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s IEC (inform-educate-communicate) campaign, asking Delhi officials to target people in the 20-40 age bracket since they seemed to be the ones stepping out most often.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-delhi-huddle-as-third-wave-gets-steeper/story-eBlSO8pKi6Mqb5tv94FeIL.html
03-11-2020||India||Delhi, Jaipur among 26 cities facing grave water risk: Study||Delhi, Ludhiana, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Amritsar and 26 other Indian cities could face a very high water risk in the next few decades according to the Worldwide Fund for Nature’s Water Risk Filter released on Monday. WWF’s new water risk scenarios estimate that hundreds of millions of people in cities across the globe could face dramatically increased water risks – unless urgent action is taken to mitigate and adapt to climate change.The filter is a tool to various risks including physical scarcity of water due to say aridity; water depletion; pollution etc, fragmentation of river ecosystems; projections for flooding, regulatory and policy risks, climate change etc. Overall, the entire India is at high risk due to various factors as per the assessment’s mapping. By 2050, many parts of India including north, west and peninsular India are likely to experience extreme water risk.WWF Water Risk Filter’s country profile for India states that major environmental problems like deforestation; soil erosion; overgrazing; desertification; air pollution from industrial effluents and vehicle emissions; water pollution from raw sewage and runoff of agricultural pesticides impact water quality in India.Sejal Worah, Programme Director, WWF India, said “The future of India’s environment lies in its cities. As India rapidly urbanises, cities will be at the forefront both for India’s growth and for sustainability. For cities to break away from the current vicious loop of flooding and water scarcity, nature-based solutions like restoration of urban watersheds and wetlands could offer solutions. This is our chance to re-evolve and re-imagine what the future of the cities could be.”“Although in their upper reaches most rivers are of good quality, the importance of water use for cities, agriculture and industries, and the lack of wastewater treatment plants in the middle and lower reaches of most rivers, cause a major degradation of surface water quality,” the country profile states.According to the scenarios in the WWF Water Risk Filter, 100 cities that are expected to suffer the greatest rise in water risk by 2050 are home to at least 350 million people as well as nationally and globally important economies. Populations in areas of high-water risk could rise from 17% in 2020 to 51% by 2050. China accounts for almost half of the cities at high water risk. Beijing, Jakarta, Johannesburg, Istanbul, Hong Kong, Mecca and Rio de Janeiro are also in the list.“Indian cities are at very high water risk because in the landscape planning high rises and industries but there is no holistic planning. Ecological factors are not properly considered during city planning. So the water catchments and flow lines change due to urbanisation. There is a very fragile equilibrium which has to be maintained. This is particularly true for new cities that are coming up with little planning,” said Shashank Shekhar, assistant professor, department of geology, Delhi University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-jaipur-among-26-cities-facing-grave-water-risk-study/story-FoCu6mN03DyqbCOCnV019M.html
03-11-2020||India||Hathras case: Allahabad HC orders CBI to file status report by November 25||The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on Monday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to file a status report on the investigation into the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras by November 25, when the case will be taken up hearing.The high court order came on a day when the Uttar Pradesh government filed an affidavit in the court regarding the standard operating procedure (SOP) to be adopted when dealing with incidents such as the one in Hathras, including cremation and burial of the dead. Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar and the former superintendent of police Vikram Vir, who was suspended from service on October 2 till further orders, also appeared before the court and submitted their affidavits. A two-judge bench of justices Pankaj Mithal and Rajan Roy heard CBI counsel SP Raju, who is also the additional solicitor general of the central government, and Uttar Pradesh additional advocate general Vinod Kumar Shahi.“The government has submitted an affidavit regarding SOPs to be adopted to deal with Hathras-like incidents, which includes cremation and burial of the dead,” said Shahi, adding that this was subject to the court’s approval. He did not give details of what the SOPs are. The state government also informed the HC that Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel have been deployed at the victim’s home in Hathras as per the directions of the Supreme Court, and a compensation of ₹25 lakh had also been transferred to the bank account of the victim’s father.Advocate Seema Kushwaha, who appeared on behalf of the victim’s family, requested the court for a permanent residence for the family members of the victim in Delhi and a job for one family member.While additional director general of police (law and order) Praveen Kumar and secretary (home) Tarun Gaba appeared before the court on behalf of the state government, senior advocate Jaideep Narain Mathur appeared as amicus curiae (friend of the court). On September 14, the 19-year-old Dalit victim was raped by four members of the Thakur caste in Hathras district when she had gone to the fields to collect cattle fodder. She was partially paralysed in the attack. As her condition deteriorated, she was moved to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on September 28 and died in the early hours of September 29.At 2.30am the next day, the police forcibly cremated the body without the family’s consent in a field near the village. Local police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out “as per the wishes of the family”. On October 12, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court criticised the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to forcibly cremate the Dalit rape victim.So far, UP Police has arrested four upper-caste men -- Sandeep Singh, Ravi, Ramu and Luvkush Sikarwar – for their alleged role in the incident. The accused are lodged in Delhi’s Alipur jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-hc-orders-cbi-to-file-status-report-by-nov-25/story-OMkOl1HbaoGc25yOmK7wEN.html
03-11-2020||India||Madras HC questions SC order on special courts to expedite pending trials||The Madras high court has termed as unconstitutional the Supreme Court order which directed the setting up of special courts to expedite criminal trials against elected representatives. The statement has come in response to an October 6 order of the three-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Justice NV Ramana, that asked all High Courts to submit the number of existing special courts for trial in criminal cases against sitting and former elected MPs and MLAs.In its response to the order, the three-judge Criminal Rules Committee of the Madras HC filed its report to the amicus curiae and senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, who is assisting the Court in the matter, on October 13. The HC held that special courts can only be “offence specific” and not “offender specific”, that is special courts can be constituted only under special statutes such as Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and such other Central and state enactments.“Courts can be constituted only by statute and cannot be constituted by judicial or executive fiats…Special Court (MP/ MLA) created by virtue of a Government Order cannot oust the jurisdiction of the Special Court constituted under the enactment,” the report said. Currently, there are 4,859 cases pending against MPs/MLAs. In 2,556 cases of these, sitting legislators are involved.In response to the report, Hansaria justified the November 1, 2017 order of the Supreme Court to set up special courts, and said, “Directions passed by this Court in the present case for designation of Special Court for trial of criminal cases pending against legislators, who form a class in themselves, are valid as there is a reasonable nexus of decriminalization of Indian polity in fast tracking disposal of these cases.”He argued that a large number of cases, including heinous offences, had been pending in the courts for decades. “In such circumstances a special mechanism for speedy trial of these cases (issued in exercise of the power under Article 142 of the Constitution) cannot be flawed,” he said.It was pursuant to the direction of the apex court, the Central government sanctioned 12 Special Courts for trial of cases against MPs/ MLAs on December 14, 2017. Subsequently, Special Courts were constituted in all the states/Union territories for such cases. The idea of constituting such special courts had its genesis in an order passed by Supreme Court in PIL filed by Public Interest Foundation vs. UOI in 2015 where the apex court observed, “We, accordingly, direct that in relation to sitting MPs and MLAs who have charges framed against them for the offences which are specified in Sections 8(1), 8(2) and 8(3) of the RP Act, the trial shall be concluded as speedily and expeditiously as may be possible and in no case later than one year from the date of the framing of charge(s).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-questions-sc-order-on-special-courts-to-expedite-pending-trials/story-TVj5k01HgmFYXTAiRZvvTJ.html
03-11-2020||India||No manufacturing units in new industrial areas: Arvind Kejriwal||No manufacturing unit will be allowed in any new industrial area in Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday, announcing what he called a “historic and significant” step aimed at reducing pollution levels in the national capital in the long run. Only high-tech and services industries will be permitted in these areas and they will be offered space at cheaper rates, he said at an online press briefing, hoping that the move will also boost Delhi’s economy by attracting firms that would have otherwise preferred the satellites towns of Noida and Gurugram. He also said the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs has approved the proposal by changing the definition of “industries” in the Delhi Master Plan 2021, which lays down the development vision for the city, and issued a notification on October 29 allowing information technology (IT) firms, media companies, knowledge parks, research and development (R&D) centres, vocational training centres and even educational institutes in new industrial areas. Previously, only manufacturing units were allowed at such sites. “Delhi will be able to get rid of polluting industries within its industrial areas. We shared the proposal with the Centre three-four years ago. I want to personally thank Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri, who took this historic step for Delhi. This will be an important step in creating a pollution-free and neat, clean and green Delhi,” Kejriwal said.  He added that the manufacturing units in Delhi’s existing 29 industrial areas will continue to operate, but they will have the option to shift to hi-tech or service sector activities. The new rule will be effective only for the new industrial areas, which, as of now, include a proposed multi-level industrial hub at Ranikhera, a knowledge park at Baprola and a 920-acre integrated industrial township in northwest Delhi’s Kanjhawala, a senior government official said. In all, these three proposed industrial areas will be able to house at least 7,000 units. The official, who did not want to be named, said new licenses for manufacturing units in the already operational industrial areas such as Narela and Bawana will continue to be issued. Apart from the 29 existing industrial areas, there are four full-flatted factory complexes, from where a number of industries, including manufacturing units, operate. Besides, there are also 24 industrial clusters, which have been notified for redevelopment under the Master Plan. In total, there are around 75,000 industrial units operating in Delhi, according to the official cited above. “The units operating from these areas deal in iron, steel, plastic and so on, which are major sources of pollution in the national capital. The existing rules of setting up a factory will continue to apply in all these old areas. But factories here will now have an additional option to shift to hi-tech or service industry. “It is only in the three planned upcoming industrial areas that only hi-tech and service industries will be allowed. These upcoming areas have also got relaxation in building heights. Compared to the existing rule of six-storey (buildings), we will be able to build even eight-storey (buildings) or more depending on clearance…,” said the official. At his online briefing, Kejriwal reiterated that the “landmark” move will help control the problem of pollution in the city, which faces a public health emergency triggered by toxic air every year during the festival season and the winter months. “In the coming days, we hope that all these manufacturing industries will be shut down and more and more service industries will be opened in Delhi. The main economy of Delhi is service-based. All the service-based industries were earlier in the office category in Delhi and could only be opened in commercial areas. The rates in commercial areas were very high…These offices earlier preferred Gurugram and Noida, and not Delhi,” Kejriwal said. He added that now office-owners will not have to shift to others cities and that they will be able to avail cheap and spacious locations in Delhi’s industrial areas. Chartered accountants, lawyers, media companies, hardware and software firms, industries integrating and manipulating the interfaces of computer and telecom facilities, customer interaction services, finance and accounting, ad and marketing agencies, placement services and equity research services are some of the businesses that are allowed to set up shop in the new industrial areas. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said the decision can help reduce local air pollution in the long run. “But as seen earlier, moving polluting units out-shifts pollution across the border, but it stays in the air-shed of the region. Delhi will also have to address small-scale and informal industrial units and recyclers in other areas that do not have access to clean fuels and pollution control technologies,” she said. Roychowdhury added that Delhi will have to implement its policy on approved clean fuels with zero tolerance in the informal sector. “Also, open burning of industrial hazardous waste, as noted in Mundka and Bawana areas, are of serious concern. This initiative should be taken forward to ensure access to affordable clean fuels and compliance across the industry sector in the entire NCR (National Capital Region),” she said. R K Gupta, the general secretary of the Mayapuri Industrial Welfare Association, said it has come as a setback for the manufacturing industry.”The priority of the government is GST collections and since Delhi is a large market area, there is no problem on that front. The dispensation is not very industry-friendly,” he claimed.Ashok Gupta from the traders’ association in Karawal Nagar said the issue of air pollution has to be dealt with a heavy hand.“Everyone is reeling under the effects of extreme pollution. There is no doubt about it. The manufacturing industries can come up outside Delhi. There is no problem in that,” he said.Brijesh Goyal, the Delhi convenor of AAP’s trade and industry wing, said there are around 3.5 lakh small and big manufacturing units in the national capital.He said the government’s move will generate employment and increase the government’s tax collection. “This is a good step that the service sector will be recognised as an industry. No action will be taken against the existing manufacturing units,” Goyal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-manufacturing-units-in-new-industrial-areas-kejriwal/story-u3ix0w9GvSniciXknDPDBP.html

Extensive arrangements have been made due to the Covid-19 pandemic including personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for election staff, more polling booths, thermal screening, sanitisers, masks and gloves for voters and markings to ensure social distancing, officials said. Voting will be held from 7 AM to 6 PM, except in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Nagaland where the timings are different, and the number of people allowed in a polling booth has been restricted. Voters who are Covid-19 positive will be allowed to vote separately in the last hour, officials said. Counting of votes will be held on November 10. All eyes are riveted on Madhya Pradesh where the BJP which has 107 MLAs in the assembly, with an effective strength of 229, needs at least eight more MLAs for a simple majority.The stakes are high for the Congress too as it had sitting MLAs in 27 seats out of 28 in the state. Twenty-five of them had resigned early this year and joined the BJP after a rebellion by Jyotiraditya Scindia, leading to the collapse of the Kamal Nath Government. They are now in the fray as BJP candidates, while in three other seats the by-election was necessitated due to the demise of the sitting legislators. Overall, the Congress had sitting MLAs in 38 seats out of the 54, while the BJP had eight. The saffron party is fielding 31 candidates in MP, Gujarat and Karnataka who had won from the Congress ticket but switched sides and resigned, necessitating the byelections in those seats. In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP, which has a comfortable majority in the Assembly, is locked in a battle of prestige on the seven seats – six of which it had won in the last election while one was with the Samajwadi Party. In Gujarat, the bypolls are being held in eight seats after the Congress MLAs resigned ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls in June this year. Five of them later joined the ruling BJP and are contesting again. Assembly bypolls will also be held in Chhattisgarh (1 seat), Haryana (1), Jharkhand (2), Karnataka (2), Nagaland (2), Odisha (2) and Telangana (1).Also Read | 11 states to go to by-polls on Tuesday; keen contest in MP, UP, Gujarat, Karnataka A total of 355 candidates, including 12 state ministers, are contesting in Madhya Pradesh, where bypolls are being held for so many seats in one go for the first time.

The death of Sira MLA B Satyanarayana, who was from the JD(S), and the resignation of RR Nagar Congress MLA Munirathna from the assembly, last year, led to the bye-elections. In RR Nagar, the BJP has fielded former Congress MLA Munirathna whereas the Congress has given ticket to H Kusuma, wife of former IAS officer late D K Ravi in the seat traditionally held by the party. The JD(S) has fielded V Krishnamurthy. The RR Nagar has become a prestigious issue for both the Congress and the BJP. The BJP had earlier held this constituency, which Munirathna had wrested as the Congress MLA. The constituency is part of the Bengaluru Rural Lok Sabha constituency which is represented by D K Suresh, who is the brother of Congress state chief D K Shivakumar. In Sira, the BJP, Congress and JD(S) have fielded radiologist Dr Rakesh Gowda, former minister T B Jayachandra and former (JD-S) MLA B Satyanarayana’s wife Ammajamma respectively. The BJP has never won the election from there, but this time, the party is trying to turn the tables on the Congress and the JD(S).

The bypoll for the Scheduled Tribes (ST)-reserved constituency was necessitated following the death of sitting JCC (J) legislator and former chief minister Ajit Jogi on May 29. The seat will this time see a fight between the Congress and the BJP after the nomination papers of Amit Jogi, the son of Ajit Jogi, and his wife Richa were rejected by the returning officer, who said their caste certificates were invalid. A total of 1.80 lakh eligible voters will decide the fate of 14 candidates, including wrestler and BJP candidate Yogeshwar Dutt, in the Baroda assembly bypolls in Haryana. The Baroda seat fell vacant in April after the demise of Congress MLA Shri Krishan Hooda, who had won the seat in 2009, 2014 and 2019 assembly polls.” In Telangana’s Dubbak Assembly, though over 20 candidates are in the fray, the main contest is among the candidates of the TRS, BJP and the Congress. The byelection is necessitated by the death of sitting TRS MLA Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy due to health problems in August this year and the TRS has fielded his widow Solipeta Sujatha as its candidate.

03-11-2020||Today's||Managing flood of foodgrains is the nation’s problem today||The nation is sitting on a mountain of foodgrains. Huge sums have been spent on procurement and the carrying cost is humongous, too. Punjabi farmers were applauded when food scarcity in the country was banished under then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri’s slogan- Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan. Not famine, but a flood of foodgrains, is the nation’s problem today.The farmers are apprehensive that the government may abdicate its responsibility of buying grains at the minimum support price (MSP). This apprehension stems from the fact that the Shanta Kumar Committee recommended in 2015 that the Food Corporation of India hand over the food procurement operations to the states, knowing fully well that the states did not have the funds to procure the grains.It is suggested that stocks be pared down to the buffer stock norms in three ways: (a) releases under the open market sale scheme at a discount if needed; (b) exports – the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had exported almost 8 million tonnes of foodgrains (out of which Punjab Markfed, where I was managing director then, had a share of 2.6 million tonnes), and (c) giving it away as food aid to conflict-ravaged countries such as Yemen, Burkina Faso, South Sudan, Nigeria and Congo (to earn international goodwill). PROMOTE CULTIVATION OF FRUIT, VEGGIES Sale and export can generate Rs 150,000 crore, besides saving of around Rs 20,000 crore on the annual carrying cost. The funds so raised should be used as “seed money” for setting up a price stabilisation fund, for other commodities, which carry an MSP. Prices of pulses, maize, oilseeds and cotton should be assured as per the MSP. Many farmers may then shift away from foodgrains and the recurring problem of overflowing buffer stocks will be solved. Second, we need to promote the cultivation of fruits and vegetables by promoting the establishment of cold chains linked to supermarkets, which should be allowed to sell them. Third, our current imports of onions from Afghanistan shows that Punjab can be the hub for the sale of milk, eggs, chicken, buffalo meat, fruits and vegetables to the Middle Eastern Arab nations through Pakistan and Afghanistan by creating a land route through diplomacy. This will generate a business lobby in our neighbourhood, which can be a counterweight to the hawks in the region. ADOPT US MODEL OF HANDLING AGRI PRODUCE The price stabilisation fund should be used for oilseeds, pulse, maize and cotton, besides wheat and paddy and cash crops such as basmati and Durum wheat. These crops need not be procured physically. We can emulate the policy of the United States for handling agri produce - namely the non-recourse loan scheme. In the US, the federal government announces support prices but the farmers are encouraged to store their foodgrains in silos at harvest. They are provided non-recourse loans by the commodity credit corporation. The amount of loan is equal to the quantity stored and multiplied by the support price. The farmer is given three years to liquidate the stock. If the market price is higher than the support price, the farmer sells the grain and repays the loan with a nominal interest, keeping the profit. To prevent speculation, the loan can be recalled if the prices hit a trigger – 175% for grains and 140 % for corn. If the prices do not touch the support price, the farmer can default on the loan and surrender the grain. There is no other penalty. That is why it is called a non-recourse loan. The policy has worked well since 1933, when it was initiated for cotton and corn. The policy can be implemented in India by using the electronic negotiable warehousing receipt system, which late Ram Vilas Paswan had inaugurated in 2017. All farmers (including small and marginal ones) can store their crops at harvest and get a tradable receipt. On storage Nabard/ RBI should provide the farmer a loan.MAKE PROCUREMENT PROCESS MECHANISED To make the scheme transparent, the procurement operation must be mechanised. Every mandi yard should have silos, automatic cleaning and weighing machine (which issues an electronic receipt) and an elevator to store the grain in the silo. The scheme can include state procurement agencies and even private players. Across the country, 980 warehouses have been registered with the Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority, while there are 64,000 warehouses storing 20,000 tonnes of commodities. Four registered warehouses operate in Punjab. In a regulated warehousing system, the regulatory authority could be government, as is the case in the US and Tanzania, or private as in South Africa. Implementing the system would be a painstaking and slow task and an overlapping five-year term should be given for it. During this period, the MSP regime must continue and the same should be written into law. If the farmers manage to secure an MSP on all 23 crops for which it is announced by the Centre and if the farmers or groups of farmers can use the electronically generated warehouse receipt to catch the off season high prices, the goal of doubling farm incomes by 2022 would be achieved. The only issue that remains to be addressed is the loss of mandi fee and rural development cess. The Union government should compensate the state for five years or so, after which the taxes on food processing and buoyant agriculture subsidiary activities would help balance the budgets. dhanbirbains@gmail.com The author, a retired Punjab-cadre IAS officer, earned a Master’s degree from Harvard University, specialising in agri-business||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/managing-flood-of-foodgrains-is-the-nation-s-problem-today/story-kYLEMkb6hMsTfskvpHSI9H.html
03-11-2020||Editorials||India’s best friend in Nepal | HT Editorial||With Army Chief General MM Naravane visiting Nepal on Wednesday, the importance of one element of the special relationship between the two countries merits emphasis. The ties between the two armies are a fundamental pillar which is based on history, contemporary partnership, symbolic respect and organic ties. The Indian and Nepali army chiefs are honorary generals of each other’s armies; there is deep camaraderie between retired and senior officers of both armies, many of whom have trained together in their younger days; the presence of Nepali citizens in the Indian Army — some from the country have given their lives for the security of India — is a remarkable testament to the trust between the two countries; and India, even as it respects Nepali sovereignty, sees the Nepal army as a friend which will respect its security sensitivities, while for the Nepal army, the Indian Army has been the first port of call during crises. This relationship has assumed importance in the last two decades — both during the civil war in Nepal and during the peace process. It was on the then Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran’s advice that the then Royal Nepalese Army chief, Pyar Jung Thapa, went to the autocratic monarch, Gyanendra Shah, in 2006, and told him that the military could not suppress popular aspirations anymore. This led to the restoration of democracy. And it was when the Nepal army was concerned about attempts by Maoists to “politicise” its structure and alter the chain of command that India stepped in and encouraged the ouster of the Maoist-led government in 2008. It was because of this depth of ties that General Naravane’s public suggestion — it was unwarranted, coming from him — that Kathmandu was raising the border dispute at Chinese prodding had an impact on the relationship. So, it is only fitting that the Army chief is going to Nepal as a gesture of India’s commitment to maintaining institutional ties with key elements of the Nepali State. The Nepal army has been clear that the relationship with India is important and, even while engaging with China, has resisted its govern-ment’s attempts to drag it into geopolitical games. General Naravane is likely to emphasis this bond and convey to the Nepali authorities India’s security sensitivities. Irrespective of the ebbs and flows of the political relationship between the two countries, the fact that the military channel is strong can only aid better understanding and serve mutual interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/india-s-best-friend-in-nepal/story-dCBopaNb8FJ1qy7wCySHnL.html
