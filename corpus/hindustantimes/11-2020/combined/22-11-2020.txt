This should not be surprising as the driver of RCEP during the eight years of negotiations has been the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), whose membership includes some of the world’s most open economies. In 2019, the trade to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio of the grouping was nearly 88%. The idea of RCEP emerged during the 19th Asean Summit in 2011, where its members resolved “to establish an Asean-led process by setting out principles under which Asean will engage interested Asean FTA partners in establishing a regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement…”. The idea of an FTA in the East Asian region was mooted by Japan in 2006 when it proposed the Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia between the then members of the East Asian Summit (EAS), which also included India. But while the Japanese initiative received a tepid endorsement from EAS leaders in 2009, Asean seized the moment to initiate the process of establishing RCEP, immediately after the grouping’s FTAs with New Zealand and India became effective from 2010. Now, as the focus of RCEP members shifts to their capitals for its ratification, one question uppermost in most minds will be the role that China could play in the group’s dynamics. Will this FTA of East Asia, in which Asean has been looking to play a central role, hinge on China?This seems to be a real possibility, especially since China has opened its market significantly to RCEP members, providing opportunities for enhanced economic engagement. To do so, China has offered to reduce its average tariff from 9.4% in 2014 (considered as the base year for effecting tariff cuts) to 1.2% in the 10th year of implementation of the agreement, for its imports from all the Asean members and Australia. Its market opening to Republic of Korea goes even further; average tariff on Korean imports will be below 1% by the 10th year. In addition to tariff cuts, China has offered to maintain tariffs at 5% or less on almost 90% of its imports. Several RCEP members, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, have reciprocated China’s offers by agreeing to deep cuts in their tariffs.A policy announcement made by Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month suggests that opening of its market to RCEP members is part of its larger strategy. Xi reportedly said, “We will remain open and cooperative, and build the Chinese market into the world’s market, a shared market and everyone’s market”. He proposed several measures to meet these objectives, three of which are significant. First, open the market to a new level; second, promote innovative development of foreign trade through government support to cross-border e-commerce; and, finally, making additional efforts to forge FTAs with more countries and regions. RCEP, which includes a chapter on e-commerce, fits Xi’s strategy well.Xi has thus produced this counter-narrative to the “decoupling from China” thesis, receiving a powerful endorsement through the establishment of RCEP. In addition, despite the political differences that several RCEP members have had with China, their economic engagement with the world’s largest trading nation is set to go up by several notches with the implementation of the East Asian FTA. This is a development that all major economies must take serious note of.Where does India stand vis-à-vis RCEP? Since the decision was taken to disengage from RCEP a year ago, several members of the grouping have made overtures towards India. The most recent was the Ministers’ Declaration on India’s Participation in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership adopted four days prior to the endorsement of the agreement. The Declaration extended an invitation to India to “commence negotiations … at any time after the signing of the RCEP Agreement once India submits a request in writing of its intention to accede to the RCEP Agreement …” However, a critical comment from external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, after the formation of RCEP, signals that the government has foreclosed its options of joining the grouping, largely owing to China’s presence.Not only has the government shut its doors on RCEP, but it has also adopted an economic strategy that militates against the logic of globalisation supported by FTAs. While FTAs have foisted the production networks cutting across national boundaries, the Indian government has been focusing on building domestic value chains in a number of critical sectors through the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. This policy direction promoting self-reliance was reinforced by Jaishankar’s observation that the India’s past trade agreements have been detrimental to the country’s interests, causing de-industrialisation in some sectors. The minister’s prognosis on FTAs, coupled with the newly-minted economic strategy, could be a signal of the government’s rethink on globalisation. Given the government’s critical response to RCEP and the possibility that China will play a key role in the East Asian region through this FTA, will there also be a rethink on the three-decade-old Look East/Act East policy, one of the more enduring pillars of India’s global economic integration policy?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/rcep-reinforces-china-s-edge-in-asia/story-QmJ41o2aPEm9UJGwyqYGON.html
22-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai man arrested for sexually assaulting two minors||Dharavi police on Saturday arrested a 35-year-old man for allegedly sexually assaulting two minor girls, both aged below 10 years, in his neighbourhood. The accused took four girls to his residence by luring them with eatables and then sexually assaulted two of them. After one of the girls informed her mother, the matter was brought to the notice of police. While the accused managed to escape initially, he was later nabbed on Saturday. The accused lives in 90-feet road area and works as a driver at a private firm. According to Dharavi police, he is a relative of one of the four girls. “On Friday night, the accused, with an intention to sexually assault, took the four girls —two aged five, one aged seven and the other girl aged eight years — to his place after luring them with eatables. He latched the door from inside and allegedly sexually assaulted two of them and later asked all of them to go home and not to tell anyone about it. However, one of the girls told her mother about it, following which the parents went to the accused’s house. But by then the accused had managed to escape,” a police officer said. After the matter was reported to Dharavi police, they launched a manhunt for the accused and arrested him from Sion (West). “The accused has been booked under sections 376, 354 and 342 of Indian Penal Code and 4,8 and 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (Pocso) Act for sexually assaulting the two minor girls,” said Ramesh Nangre, senior inspector, Dharavi police station. Medical examinations of the girls were done and the reports are awaited. Meanwhile, their clothes as well as that of the accused have been seized as evidence. In cases under Pocso Act, prosecution heavily rely on statements of the minors as they are recorded before the magistrate under section 164 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). In this case, the court will take the call on whether to record the statement of the girls or not as they are too young, said an officer. “On Sunday, the accused was produced before a special court and has been remanded in police custody till November 27,” Nangre said. The police will also check if the accused similarly exploited other girls in past, another officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-arrested-for-sexually-assaulting-two-minors/story-1VDr8ZPJhTkVujqcuXEBdJ.html
22-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra records more than 5,000 Covid-19 cases for fifth consecutive day||The state registered 5,753 Covid-19 cases, more than 5,000 for the fifth consecutive day, taking the tally to 1,780,208 on Sunday, as deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar hinted at a potential lockdown in the near future. With 50 deaths clocked in the past 24 hours, the toll touched 46,623. Mumbai, too, saw a rise in daily caseload as the number crossed 1,100 after 22 days. A total of 1,135 new infections took the tally to 275,714. In the wake of the rise in cases and anticipated spike over the next few weeks, Pawar said a decision over imposition of lockdown could be taken after a review after eight to 10 days. He said the number of cases is expected to rise because of the drop in the temperature and crowding during Diwali.“In many other states, a surge in Covid-19 cases is being witnessed. There is a need to be cautious for the next few weeks. Like during Ganesh festival, people stepped out of their houses during Diwali in huge numbers. We have been in discussion with the departments concerned to take a call on lockdown,” he said. Pawar said the crowding during Diwali was uncalled for. “We did not take action for violation of the Covid protocol as it was a festive season, but strict action needs to be taken now. I do not want to create panic by saying anything related to the lockdown at this stage,” he said. As part of the preparedness to fight the potential surge in the Covid-19 cases, the state authorities have increased testing. Super spreaders are being aggressively tapped through tracing drive to contain the spread of virus.The daily average of the tests in the past three days (November 20-22) has increased to 82,636 from 42,978 daily a week before. A total of 92,556 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours, with the positivity rate of 6.21%. The overall positivity rate stands at 17.43%. Followed by Mumbai, Pune clocked 770 cases (241 in rural parts, 323 in city and 206 in Pimpri-Chinchwad), Nagpur reported 483 cases, Ahmednagar logged 293 cases and Nashik reported 211 cases. Of the 50 deaths reported on Sunday, 30 are from the past two days, 6 reported over past one week, while remaining 14 are from the period before, according to the state health department. Of them, 19 are from Mumbai, 11 from Pune, 12 from Nagpur. The state’s case fatality rate stands at 2.62%. State authorities have stated that the rise in the number of cases is owing to the increase in testing post Diwali. “It is true that in the past five days, the number of cases has risen, but the comparison is with the caseload registered during Diwali, when people tend to not report the illness to doctors. We have also started tapping super-spreaders like vegetable vendors and shopkeepers to contain the spread. Our positivity rate is still in control at 7.5%, which means the situation is under control. There is a possibility of a major spike in cases by the end of December, but we are trying to keep it restricted by launching a massive outreach programme,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. Dr Awate said the state authorities will roll out the third phase of ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ initiative in December to identify the suspected patients. With 4,060 patients reported to have recovered in the past 24 hours, the number of active patients dropped to 81,512, with the recovery rate reaching 92.75%. The state has 515,976 patients under home quarantine and 5,615 are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-more-than-5-000-covid-19-cases-for-fifth-consecutive-day/story-byQz2Zhz6cClow3XCGMPML.html
22-11-2020||Mumbai||BJP, MNS announce protests over inflated power bills in Maharashtra||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) have announced agitations against the inflated power bills and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s failure to give the people any relief from them. The BJP has announced a protest to burn the copies of inflated electricity bills across the state on Monday, while the MNS has announced protest marches in all districts on November 26. After the state government announced its inability to give any relief from the excessive electricity bills consumers received during the Covid-19 lockdown, the opposition has decided to take to streets on the issue. The BJP has termed the government’s announcement on its inability to provide any relief as cheating as the government had earlier promised to give waiver in electricity bills. The MNS put up banners with the message ‘My Bills, My Responsibility’ across the city mocking the state government’s ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ tagline for the Covid-19 outreach programme. The party had warned the government with aggressive agitation on the issue if the relief was not given to the consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-mns-announce-protests-over-inflated-power-bills-in-maharashtra/story-TwN1qc2afhgUoWUKmasO3L.html
22-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mira Road college accused of forcing students to withdraw complaints to FRA; authorities deny allegations||Management studies students of NL Dalmia Institute of Management Studies and Research in Mira Road have alleged that they are being forced by the institute authority to withdraw their complaint to the Fee Regulatory Authority (FRA) over illegal collection of fee by the college, to be eligible to appear for placements.“The institute has told us that only those students, who have paid their full fees, will be allowed to sit for placements that are likely to start soon. Meanwhile, those of us who had filed complaints with FRA have been asked to sign an undertaking withdrawing our complaint or we will not be allowed to appear for campus placements,” said a second-year student pursuing Masters of Management Studies at the institute.Seema Saini, chief executive officer and administrative head of NL Dalmia Institute of Management Studies and Research, said, “The allegation made by the students is completely false. We haven’t contacted the students who filed complaints with FRA.” She, however, refused to comment on the fees structure. FRA had approved an annual fee of ₹1.87 lakh for the academic year 2019-20. Several students from the 2019-20 batch had earlier written to FRA complaining that the institute was charging almost ₹2.3 lakh over and above what was approved by the regulatory body. Based on the complaint, FRA, which regulates fees for all professional courses offered by colleges in Maharashtra, had sought a response from the college.To this, the college responded to FRA by seeking a review of the approved fees retrospectively. In a relief to the students, FRA last week held that colleges cannot review their fees with retrospective effect.With the Covid-19 pandemic affecting the incomes of families of students, while the matter is being heard by FRA, some students haven’t paid their full fees. They alleged that the college was pressuring them into paying full fees and withdrawing their complaints. “We are being intimated that there will be consequences if we do not take our complaints back,” said another student.“Saini laid emphasis on the excellent infrastructure, best placement record and many other welfare measures undertaken by the institute. In our view, the point raised is not germane to the issue on hand… the institute, shall within a week, make a written submission in the matter of complaint lodged by the students,” FRA noted according to the minutes of a meeting held on November 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-mira-road-college-accused-of-forcing-students-to-withdraw-complaints-to-fra-authorities-deny-allegations/story-fCLHXn3AGpp9dqKU9NJ2PJ.html

22-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai parents of preschoolers explore home-bound, activity-based learning during Covid-19 lockdown||A few months after schools in the state closed in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown, Navi Mumbai-based journalist Amit Srivastava’s daughter Saani was just a few days away from going to Senior KG. While the Srivastavas continued online learning prescribed by the preschool where their daughter was enrolled, they soon met with several challenges. “The school asked us to download a mobile app where they would upload videos and activities. My daughter, who is only four-and-a-half years old, could not navigate the application. A young child that she is, when we would give her the phone, she would start playing games. We realised that this was not working. At the same time, the school continued to charge the entire fees and we were not benefitting in any way. Thus, we decided to stop her school lessons for a few months and teach her ourselves at least until physical schools begin,” said Srivastava. As schools remain closed, parents of pre-schoolers (children aged between two and five years) are now exploring alternatives to playgroups and preschools. Teaching children at home for the interim, using activity-based material available on the internet, supplementing everyday activities at home with learning kits offered by schools and private players are some of the ways that parents are finding solution in the absence of physical classes. Anamika Saha, a parent from Dadar, had planned to send her three-year-old daughter Anaya to a preschool this year. However, due to the current situation, she has decided against it and has stalled her plans for at least a year. “Most preschools in the city are charging anywhere between ₹50,000 to ₹1 lakh for half-a-year which is a lot to pay, especially at a time when children are not physically attending school. Right now, schools are only taking 30-minute live classes in which most kids are not attentive as they are too young and have not mingled with their teachers or peers yet. Hence, we decided to teach our daughter at home with the help of various learning kits available on the internet,” she added. Saha was initially worried about how she could manage her job as an accountant at a private firm and teaching. “But it turned out pretty okay. We have set a schedule of our own and this way, both my daughter and I can do things at our own pace,” she added. Hemali Gada, a Malad-based entrepreneur who designs flash cards and activity kits for young children, said the demand for such material has grown during the lockdown. “Parents have realised that children of this age group need developmental simulation, something which online classes will not be able to provide. While children are usually conditioned to learn from teachers, during the pandemic, as everyone is cooped up in their homes, parents realised that teaching their young children is not such a difficult thing to do,” said Gada. Arunprasad Durairaj, CEO of Flinto Learning Solutions which promises to deliver a preschool programme at home, said that every month, the demand for self-learning kits created by his company has seen a steady growth over the past six months. “In May, we came up with the idea of Flintoclass where parents get one kit every month consisting 12 days of activity and eight days of bonus activities, and it was an instant hit. Every day parents can just take out an hour or so and do these activities with their children which help explain some fundamental concepts that they need to learn at that age with ease,” he added. The programme is designed for children aged between 1.5 and 6 years. While many parents are trying to substitute preschool learning with learning at home, Amrutha Langs, an educator and a home schooling parent, said one must be cautious before calling the model home schooling. “The basic idea behind home schooling is to teach the child as per liking and at his/her pace. Merely teaching concepts taught in school at home cannot be called home schooling. Also, home schooling is usually a long-term, committed effort and not just an adjustment for a few days or months. Having said that, we are definitely seeing a surge in the number of parents who want to explore home schooling as the pandemic has taught them that it is not undoable,” she added. Durairaj said that even after schools are allowed to reopen, the teaching-at-home model would still continue for preschoolers. “In addition to safety concerns, another key challenge would be to find a preschool in the neighbourhood. With many preschools having shut shop over the past few months, parents are likely to have fewer options to choose from and are thus likely to prefer the at home model.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-parents-of-preschoolers-explore-home-bound-activity-based-learning-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-j663QGjR8AdRBZ0GTij1pM.html
22-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai doctors, activists seek plan to help with post-Covid-19 health expenses||The Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 is causing long-term impacts on the health of patients after recovery. This is not only affecting their lifestyle but also burning large holes in their pockets. Patients and social workers have now raised the need for an affordable post-Covid-19 rehabilitation program. Jyotsna Maru, a resident of Mahalaxmi, was diagnosed with Covid-19 in August and received treatment at a private hospital. In a rare incident, she developed Covid-19-triggered paralysis named as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) – an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system that is supposed to protect the person, starts destroying them. It mistakenly starts attacking the nerves of the hands and legs, leading to sudden paralysis.The 38-year-old dancer spent around ₹7 lakh on treatment at the hospital but her expenditure has not stopped there. Even after getting cured of the virus, in the last two months, she has spent ₹1 lakh more on post-Covid-19 related expenditures. “When I was discharged from the hospital, I had to hire a caretaker to look after me around the clock as I couldn’t stand due to the numbness in my legs. Though I have improved a lot, I am still on medication and physiotherapy for my GBS. This costs me around ₹30,000 per month, excluding other expenses,” said Maru. Just like Maru, thousands of patients across the state are forced to bear the burden of additional expenses, most of which are not covered under medical insurance. According to city doctors, many recovered patients are developing Covid-19 instigated illnesses like lung fibrosis, neurological disorders, chronic fatigue, muscle weakness and blood clot formation.Poor patients are the most affected as they cannot afford months-long post-recovery treatment at private hospitals. The same has been echoed in the study — Planning for the Post-COVID Syndrome: How Payers Can Mitigate Long-Term Complications of the Pandemic published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. “These [post-recovery] complications are likely to place additional medical, psychological, and economic burdens on all patients, with lower-income individuals, the uninsured and underinsured, and individuals experiencing homelessness being most vulnerable,” the study mentioned.For instance, 45-year-old Gopi Shelar, a slum dweller from Dharavi who suffered from a Covid-19 instigated stroke, is struggling to arrange money for his weekly physiotherapy at a private clinic. “I used to work as a daily wager at construction sites but lost my job due to the lockdown. After four months, finally, my wife has started working as a domestic help. But her income isn’t enough to afford my father’s treatment. The stroke has left my father paralysed on the right side of his body. To pay for his physiotherapy, I need ₹12,000 per month,” said Ramesh, Shelar’s son. Shelar was diagnosed with Covid-19 in October and underwent treatment at Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital (Sion hospital). Though the state health department does not have any cumulative data about post-recovery complications, as per city doctors, such cases are increasing. “Post-recovery health complications are more among older people with comorbid health issues. However, we have also received patients with health issues who were mildly symptomatic,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant general physician at Bombay Hospital.Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel, said that they receive some of the most seriously-ill patients. “We are getting Covid-19 recovered patients with complaints of numbness in their legs or breathlessness. Some have been diagnosed with lung fibrosis, and many have developed neurological issues. We refer them to specialists in the hospital as per their symptoms,” he said.Covid-19 is not only leading to physical complications but also adding to the mental health issues, which leads to further medical expenditures. Many city psychiatrists are currently treating recovered Covid-19 patients for depression and anxiety. “Spending days in isolation wards among medical staffers wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) is leaving people with a history of mental illness, traumatised. I am getting many of my recovered patients who have redeveloped anxiety or depression,” said Harish Shetty, a psychiatrist from Khar. Taking note of these issues, doctors have raised the need to focus on post-recovery health infrastructure, especially pulmonary rehabilitation which focuses on monitored exercise to increase the functions of the lungs, along with physiotherapy. “Even though there are hundreds of hospitals providing treatment for Covid-19, there are hardly any hospitals that focus on overall rehabilitation. They should include chest rehab programmes, breathing exercises, lung ventilation, among others,” said Dr Sundeep Salvi, director of Chest Research Foundation. “Many people who can’t afford it in private setups may report delayed recovery, which can have long-term implications,” he said. Health activists want the state government to put a cap on prices for the treatment of ailments related to Covid-19 infections, to make them affordable. “Considering the need of the hour, the health department should create some regulations to make the treatment of post-Covid-19 infections affordable for all,” said Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor of the NGO Jan Arogya Abhiyaan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-doctors-activists-seek-plan-to-help-with-post-covid-19-health-expenses/story-T2MhdgZ1Gdy09BFwDeDZDI.html
22-11-2020||Gurugram||Desert finch sighted for the first time in India||Birdwatchers on Sunday photographed a desert finch in Sirsa district, marking what is possibly the first sighting of this avian species in the country. As a passerine bird, native to southern Eurasia, the finch typically resides at higher altitudes in south-west Pakistan, particularly Balochistan. However, it has not been previously reported from India.The incident created ripples among the birding community in Haryana and Delhi-NCR. The sighting comes on the heels of another significant recording in Faridabad’s Mangar Bani, where a Himalayan bluetail was photographed on November 21. This marks the perhaps the first recorded appearance of the bluetail in Delhi-NCR, although it can otherwise be seen in the hilly states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. The desert finch, which has been identified as a female specimen from its wing pattern and black bill, was spotted by birders Sanjeev and Shafina Goyal in the Nathusari Chopta, about 20 kilometres from Sirsa. “At about 8:30am on Sunday, I noticed a group of doves in an open, marshy area. One of the birds stood out and when I peered through my binoculars, I saw there was a marked difference. I was able to follow it for a few minutes and take pictures before it flew off,” said Goyal, who did not immediately recognise the species.“The bird was finally identified by others in the community through my pictures. I also did a reverse image search on my photos and the results threw up a lot of finches. We were eventually able to identify it as a desert finch. I was extremely surprised since it has never been seen in India before,” said Goyal, who first took up birdwatching about seven years ago. “The finch was a purely lucky find,” he added.The bluetail, meanwhile, was photographed by Pritpal Panjeta, a Gurugram-based birder who frequents Mangar Bani for walks and birding excursions. “On November 21, I noticed a bird which has a slight tinge of blue in its plumage. I initially thought it was a juvenile Tickell’s blue flycatcher, but after examining my photographs, I confirmed that it was a female Himalayan bluetail. This bird is usually seen at an altitude of 3,000-4,000 meters in summer. During winter months, it makes an altitudinal migration to about 1,500 meters, but it’s very rare to see one in the plains,” Panjeta said.Birders speculated that cold weather conditions in the north may have driven these birds, both finch and bluetail, to the plains. Rakesh Ahlawat, a birder from Dighal village in Jhajjar who helped identify the finch, said, “Places like Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh have received fresh snowfall in the last few days. When it gets cold in the hills, it’s not uncommon for birds to travel to lower altitudes where it is warmer.” Ahlawat also said that the Himalayan bluetail has been previously seen in Haryana’s Kalesar National Park, though he was unable to recall the year of the sighting. Others partially agreed with Ahlawat’s view. “I’m not entirely sure what brought the desert finch to Haryana. It’s a freak sighting. With the bluetail that was spotted in Mangar, it is likely that colder conditions in the hills drove it into the plains, but with the finch, we really don’t know,” said Pankaj Gupta of the Delhi Bird Foundation.Asad Rahmani, a former director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and a veteran ornithologist, was also reluctant to speculate on what caused these sightings to happen within a day of each other. “It is certainly possible that colder weather has something to do with it, but we can’t be entirely sure. Birds move around for a lot of reasons. Nevertheless, the finch is a significant find. It is always exciting to add a new species to India’s checklist.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/desert-finch-sighted-for-the-first-time-in-india/story-n4oLS2GEIuxGgQoYB4D57N.html
22-11-2020||Gurugram||City air remains ‘poor’; likely to deteriorate further||Air quality in the city remained “poor” on Sunday, recording 242 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin, down from 256 the previous day in the same category. Experts attributed the slight improvement to strong surface winds blowing from the northwest direction that helped in the dispersion of pollutants. The level of ultrafine particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5), which has a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, the city’s primary pollutant, was 166.0 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Sunday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. This was down from 188.55µg/m³ on Saturday. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to deteriorate and remain in “very poor” category on Monday and Tuesday. The air quality is expected to deteriorate further and enter the upper end of “very poor”on Wednesday and Thursday on account of unfavourable meteorological conditions for dispersion of pollutants. The city’s minimum temperature was recorded four degrees below the normal at 9.5 degrees Celsius on Sunday, same as the previous day. The maximum temperature settled at 23 degrees Celsius — a marginal improvement from Saturday’s 22.8 degrees Celsius. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that temperature may increase marginally on Monday on account of a western disturbance. As per IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature will hover around 24 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature is expected to stay at eight degrees. As per the weekly forecast, fog and mist will prevail in the morning hours on Monday followed by clear skies during the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-air-remains-poor-likely-to-deteriorate-further/story-XyXyGUuLZtlnsOjd9abp9K.html
22-11-2020||Gurugram||DTCP stops development of a realty project in Farrukhnagar for violating rules||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has put a hold on the approval of the building plan and the issuance no-objection certificate and other permissions to a real estate project in Farrukhnagar for allegedly selling more residential units than permitted. Officials said as per DTCP rules, developers must sell 15% of the plots after receiving the completion certificate. This ensures availability of proper infrastructure. However, Sabyasachi Developers, the company in question, has already sold all plots, which is in contravention of rules, stated a notice issued by DTCP on Friday. The notice issued by the department states that, as per the terms and conditions of the licence agreement, it was clearly mentioned that 15% of the saleable area in the layout plan was to be issued along with the licence and revenue details. This is to be freezed due to mortgage deed having been registered in the revenue record against bank guarantee given by the developer. The area to be freezed shall be allowed to be sold only after de-mortgage of the land as shown in the land schedule. RS Bhath, district town planner, said that after receiving complaints in the matter, the project site was inspected and it was found that all the plots, which were freezed/mortgaged, have been sold in the form of agreements and receipt of payments. “An executive of the developer also informed them on query that only one plot in the colony was available and that too in resale,” said Bhath. Taking cognisance of the violations, the DTCP officials decided to put a hold on all development in the project. “We have put on hold all development in the project. Permission for building plan sanctions, NOC for transfer and sale, and other such things have been stopped till the developer explains the situation within the next seven days,” said Bhath. DTCP officials said that reason developers of plotted colonies under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) have been asked to reserve 15% plots till the project is completed is to ensure that all infrastructure and services are laid out as per the plan. “We don’t want a situation where the developer sells all plots and leave without developing the necessary infrastructure and services,” said Bhath. Manoj Dubey, an official of the developer, said that they have followed all the licence norms and sold only those number of plots which are legally allowed. “We have not committed any violation. Only the permitted number of plots have been sold,” he said. In a related development, the enforcement wing officials said that they would be again visiting DLF Phase-2 area to conduct an inspection of the areas where the encroachments were removed last week. Officials said that there were complaints that despite the removal of dhabas and other commercial establishments from residential plots, the violators were again trying to resume operations. “An inspection would be carried out within the next two days and criminal action would be initiated against violators if they repeat the offence,” said Bhath. The department also said that they have decided to hold sudden inspections in areas where unauthorised colonies were coming up to ensure construction activities don’t resume.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-stops-development-of-a-realty-project-in-farrukhnagar-for-violating-rules/story-XI26TzONGxSr9gxViVRf1J.html

The draft policy has been put up on the website of the DTCP and the department has sought suggestions and objections from various stakeholders regarding the policy, said officials. Under the policy, girls up to the age of 18 years and boys, up to 10 years, would be allowed to stay in these hostels with their mothers. Senior DTCP officials said that the step has been taken due to increasing number of working women in the state, particularly in the NCR districts.The draft document states that this policy aims to cater to the housing needs of working women, who have come from other states and districts, and need accommodation in cities such as Gurugram, Faridabad, Panipat, Panchkula and others.Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, Gurugram, said that the draft policy has been proposed by department keeping in view the high requirement of such accommodation for working women. “The department has sought suggestions from the public and stakeholders and the policy will be finalised thereafter. It will create more hostels for working women, who will be able to get good quality housing in urban areas,” he said. The draft policy states that these hostels must have a mess or a common dining space, a laundry, a common room with indoor facility. A day-care facility for young children shall also be required. The projects under this policy shall be allowed only in residential zones of development plans, the policy states. The minimum and maximum areas allowed for such projects are 0.5 acre and two acres respectively. The maximum floor area ratio allowed is 225 and the ground coverage allowed for these projects is 50%. All projects under this policy will be monitored by a district committee headed by the deputy commissioner and will include senior DTCP officials. This committee shall have the power to monitor these projects, conduct inspections to assess the quality of services being given, the document said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-drafts-new-policy-to-set-up-women-hostels/story-vMEfbOncmoJ57vRdsOfv5K.html
22-11-2020||Gurugram||Dumper driver booked for attacking policemen during a raid against illegal mining||A dumper driver was booked for attacking policemen, who flagged him and asked him to stop the vehicle loaded with allegedly illegally mined stones from a crushing zone near Panchgaon village in Manesar on Saturday night. The police said the suspect pelted stones at the police personnel and even tried to run the dumper truck over one of them. Later, however, he managed to flee from the spot after a two-hour-long chase. The police said three official vehicles and one private car were damaged while the special investigation team was chasing the dumper. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said, the incident took place around 12.20am, when the mining team of South Haryana received information that some people were working in a stone-crushing zone in Panchgaon and that a dumper loaded with illegally mined stones will cross Bilaspur Road. “The crushing zones are selling illegal stones and are under scanner. Although illegal mining operations have been taking place in the Aravallis for over two decades, it was in November 2019 that senior IPS officer Amitabh Singh Dhillon, who was also the director-general of mines and geology department of Haryana, put together an enforcement team to crack down on illegal mining operations in this region,” he said. Sangwan said teams were deployed at the stretch connecting Bilaspur with Dharuhera near Sidhrawali on National Highway-8. The police teams spotted a speeding dumper coming towards them and, within minutes, the driver rammed in the dumper into their parked vehicles. Two teams started chasing the dumper, but the co-driver started pelting stones at them. When police vehicles tried to intercept the vehicle, the driver again rammed it into the vehicles.Sangwan said more than three times the driver tried to run a dumper truck over the police officers. “The suspect escaped towards Tauru near Panchgaon. After a chase that lasted for more than two hours, the suspect informed villagers, who surrounded the police vehicles. Women and children obstructed the road and a few of them lay down on it. The suspect took advantage of this and fled from the spot,” said Azad Kataria, sub-inspector of SIT mining, South Haryana. The police said a commuter, who was driving a Wagon-R and was a witness to the chase, refused to complain against the dumper driver. The car was severely damaged, said the police. A case was registered against the suspects under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 379 (theft), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions),of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) at Bilaspur police station in the wee hours on Sunday, said the police. According to the police, the jurisdiction of the state to check illegal mining is divided into two parts and two police officials have been given charge of two regions. While assistant commissioner of police(ACP) Rajesh Phogat has been given the charge of the Sonepat region, ACP Preet Pal Sangwan has been given the task of curbing illegal mining in Gurugram and Nuh. According to the police, illegal mining is most active in Nuh and Gurugram. The areas that are particularly notorious for illegal mining include villages of Pipaka, Panchgaon, Raina, Tapkan, and Dhulawat villages — all of which fall under the Tauru belt. The police added that during the course of the anti-mining operations, several police officers have been attacked by truck drivers carrying illegal material. Over four dozen cases of attempted murder have been registered against such drivers over the last six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dumper-driver-booked-for-attacking-policemen-during-a-raid-against-illegal-mining/story-Dsho5fn5pjfhhlNvsE67KJ.html
22-11-2020||Gurugram||Delhi residents flock to Gurugram for weddings||Wedding venues in the city have seen an uptick in enquiries from Delhi residents after the Delhi government reduced the cap on weddings guests to a maximum of 50 amid the spike in Covid-19 cases. Owners of banquet hall owners said that there had seen a significant increase in booking requests from Delhi residents, whose wedding plans had gone awry due to the recent diktat. As per the unlock order shared by the district administration on October 1, the ceiling on the number of guests has been placed at 200. The city has 72 banquet halls. Owners of these venues, however, said that due to pre-booking of dates, they were able to accommodate only limited requests from Delhi. Anil Rao, president of Haryana Party Lawns Association, with which all banquet halls in Gurugram are registered, said that the demand for wedding venues in the city has shot up due to the Delhi government’s move. Rao said that harried Delhi residents were looking out for alternative wedding venues with the reduction in guest capacity in Delhi banquet halls. “We have been receiving many customers from Delhi ever since the Delhi government reduced the ceiling on guests from 200 to 50. We are providing customers with the options of banquet halls or tents, depending on the availability. The demand is very high, but options are limited since facilities have been booked in advance,” said Rao. He said that the Delhi government’s sudden decision has families scrambling for last-minute replacements, while the business of banquet hall owners has taken another hit. “Delhi imposed a sudden drastic cut from 200 to 50 due to which people were caught off guard. Banquet hall owners have already suffered a lot during the past eight months since the lockdown was imposed in March,” said Rao. He said that while the demand for venues in Gurugram had soared, hall owners had not been able to benefit much since bookings had already been made. “There is complete chaos in the market due to the sudden decision of the government. We get so many enquiries but are unable to accommodate them due to the paucity of facilities,” said Rao. Owners of such facilities also emphasised that the decision of the Delhi government has come at a time when the wedding season is due to begin, this week, and accommodating last-minute requests is a challenging experience. “We have been getting many requests for bookings from Delhi but the wedding dates are limited, due to which the scope of accommodating requests is low. The wedding season will last for 15 days, from November 25 till December 12. On a daily basis, we are getting three to four enquiries from Delhi,” said Vinod Saini, director of Notting Hills, a banquet hall located on the Old Delhi Road. Sanjeev Kumar, the managing director of Bliss Premiere, a banquet hall in Sector 17, said that while the enquiries had definitely increased, not all requests were translating to bookings. “On average, we are getting five to 10 booking requests daily from Delhi in the past five days. However, from the point of view of our business, we are not getting any benefit despite the increase in enquiries,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/delhi-residents-flock-to-gurugram-for-weddings/story-NlVFZ3iv2QsALhAN3LgTOP.html
22-11-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19 cases surge but positivity rate decreases||Over the past week, the district reported 4,273 new cases of Covid-19, which was up from the 3,948 new cases reported a week prior. However, despite the increase, officials in the health department painted a positive picture of dealing with the spread of the virus, particularly as testing numbers have been augmented.The district tested its highest weekly sample aggregate between November 16 and November 22, totalling 37,073 tests. This marks a significant jump from the 21,466 samples tested a week prior.As a result, Gurugram’s weekly test-positivity rate (TPR) dipped from 18% between November 8 and November 14 to 11% last week. “This is a good sign. If increased testing is met with rising positivity rate, it indicates a faster spread among the population. Fortunately, we have increased tests and found the positivity rate to reduce, which means we are still keeping up with the spread to a degree,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, surveillance officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Gurugram.Despite the dip in positivity rate, experts and officials called for continued adherence to social distancing norms. “Even if the positivity rate is low, in absolute numbers, the cases are still going up. This may eventually start putting added strain on hospitals. It is important at this point to have stronger public messaging, and to rigorously test, trace and isolate,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh.In a recorded address to the public on Sunday, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said, “We have all become a bit careless, a bit lazy and are not taking the disease as seriously as we should. Therefore, in the current situation, I would like to remind you that we need to be cautious as we celebrate the various upcoming festivals. We need to follow social distancing and hygiene protocols.”Gurugram’s total tally of Covid-19 infections now stands at 44,206, up from 39,387 cases a week ago. The number of active cases has reduced slightly, from 5,990 active patients on November 15 to 5,693 active cases on Sunday. Of these, 422 patients are currently hospitalised, which is up from 405 a week ago, while 5,264 patients are under home isolation, which is down from 5,575 a week ago. Another seven patients, down from 10 a week ago, are under observation at district Covid care centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-cases-surge-but-positivity-rate-decreases/story-PyP7l6V44GP2GYUQ6Jq1qO.html
22-11-2020||Gurugram||Students downbeat by Covid-hit campus life||These are tense times, says 18-year-old Kajal Raghav, a first-year BCom student at the Government College for Girls in Sector 52, who started going to the college last week. She says that the importance given to social distancing and mask hygiene in college has changed the classroom experience.“Attending a class in Covid times is a different experience. Even while everyone is under the same roof, a sense of connection is missing. Everyone is all masked up, due to which breaking the ice seems a little difficult,” said Raghav.However, despite the challenges, she is happy that college has resumed and is looking forward to the experience, even if it continues to be different from the “normal”.With the beginning of the new academic session last week, thousands of first-year undergraduate students such as Raghav started their college life on a different note, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Routinely, the academic session begins in July or August. This year, due to the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown, the new session started on November 16, after a delay of nearly four months.While some colleges have adopted a blended model, comprising online and offline classes, others will be conducting classes in multiple shifts while adopting an odd-even formula. From classes in shifts to limited interaction opportunities, the pandemic has curtailed the overall college experience, say students.“Masks and sanitisers have a lingering presence now. While I am becoming more familiar with the faces behind the masks with each passing day, making new friends will take time. Right now, we attend classes with minimal interaction and head back home. Hanging out with friends is difficult due to the spike in cases,” said Raghav.Adapting to college life under the shadow of the pandemic has been particularly challenging for outstation students, who had to move bases. This has also caused uncertainty among others who were planning on moving to the city.Mohit, of Rohtak, who is pursuing BCom (honours) at Dronacharya Government College, said that he was yet to meet or interact with anyone from his class or make friends in the new city. “We got the chance to meet some teachers this week but there has been no interaction or connection with classmates. Once we are allocated sections or added to WhatsApp groups, we might get the chance to know our classmates. In the absence of any interaction, the experience of starting college feels incomplete for now,” said Mohit, who goes by his first name.While some colleges have made schedules for students to visit the campus two days per week, others are concentrating on online classes for now.Eighteen-year-old Komal who was looking forward to discovering a new city after moving from Rewari now has to contend with online classes due to the pandemic. She said that while college life wouldn’t be the same with the usual activities taking a back seat, outstation students, especially girls, might be discouraged from moving cities during the pandemic.“Starting college is akin to starting a new chapter as an adult. Beyond lessons, one looks forward to discovering new places, interests and meeting people. The pandemic upturned all our plans. I’m not even sure if my parents will allow me to move to Gurugram now,” said Komal, who is enrolled for a BSc course at Girls College in Sector 14.She will be starting online classes next week. “I have been added to a WhatsApp group with some of my classmates. Technically, we are connected remotely, but at the end of the day, these are just unknown faces,” said Komal, who goes by her first name.Pooja, another first-year student of BSc(non-medical) at Dronacharya Government College, said, “My school friends and I used to be very excited about college life but all our plans went awry due to the virus. Classes are not taking place in a full-fledged manner. We don’t know if our batch will have an orientation or fresher’s party like before. Due to coronavirus, campus life is very limited.”Principals said that classroom experiences and campus life were bound to be affected due to the pandemic. Besides classrooms, canteens and student hostels will also undergo changes in view of social distancing concerns. Most colleges are yet to start canteens or hostel facilities.“We are trying our best to prioritise the safety of students in the new session. Due to restrictions and distancing needs, it can’t be business as usual,” said Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9.“Until last year, we used to hold introductory sessions where teachers would be introduced to students. Students used to be familiarised with the teachers in charge of various extracurricular and sports clubs. Teachers would introduce them to sports, NCC group and other activities so that students could transition well and take up different hobbies. This year, there has been zero development on this front,” said Yadav.He said that due to curtailment of extracurricular activities, identifying and honing the potential of students would be difficult. “Students are clueless about the various activities that used to take place in normal circumstances. Due to the restrictions and online-offline nature of classes, we have not had the chance to introduce them to new activities. Teachers are also not familiar with the interests of students. A personal connection between students and teachers is missing,” said Yadav.Despite the circumstance, the excitement of starting a new phase of life has not dulled for many. “There are limitations but there is excitement too. The sense of association that comes with being classmates will develop with time, even if it’s through online platforms or limited physical meetings,” said Deepak Bartwal, a BSc (non-medical) student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/students-downbeat-by-covid-hit-campus-life/story-FbQEhdz43UDueagIOq1b1N.html

22-11-2020||Chandigarh||Post-matric scholarship: PU’s ₹21 crore still pending with Punjab government||Panjab University, which is already facing a revenue gap this year, has yet to receive around Rs 21 crore under the post-matric scholarship (PMS) scheme from the Punjab government.The matter was discussed in the last meeting of PU’s budget estimate committee. Due to the pandemic this year, the university did not receive revenue from many sources and the varsity is expecting to face a revenue gap of Rs 31 crore under the income heads of examination fee and income from hostel during the financial year 2020-21.In its last meeting, the budget estimate committee had observed that the university should request the Punjab government to release the pending grant under PMS to cover the projected revenue gap this year. The pending amount has risen over the years as the number of students opting for the scheme has increased.Under the PMS, financial assistance is provided to the Scheduled Caste students studying at post-matriculation or post-secondary stage to enable them to complete their education.A member of the panel on the condition of anonymity said, “We have recommended that the university should make efforts and ask the Punjab government for the pending money. The pending funds can be utilised to cover the deficit in budget and that can also be utilised for other projects.”Earlier this year, the varsity had written to the Punjab government seeking the release of pending dues of Rs 15.23 crore at that time.Already, the annual fee hike was put on hold this year and a concession of 5% in semester fee for all students meant losses to the tune of Rs 2 crore to the university. Not expecting to earn any revenue from the usual sources, including hostels, the university has also asked its departments to cut spending and suspend the leave travel concession to teachers.Officials at the university’s finance and development office said that PU had also written to the Punjab government and secretary to the governor of Punjab requesting the immediate reimbursement of the pending funds under the PMS. “Despite our efforts, we did not get an appropriate response,” said an official at the finance department of PU.The budget estimate committee in its last meeting had recommended that the university should reflect the projected revenue gap in the budget and request both the central government and the Punjab government to release supplementary grant and pending grant under PMS, as the case may be, to cover the gap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/post-matric-scholarship-pu-s-21-crore-still-pending-with-punjab-government/story-O47prw1MCFRWONbTA4MpWI.html
22-11-2020||Chandigarh||10 workers have narrow escape after fire breaks out in Ludhiana godown||Ten workers had a narrow escape after a fire broke out at a rag godown in Salem Tabri on Sunday. The incident took place at around 12pm.The owner of the godown, Ashok Kumar, said newspapers, cardboard boxes and plastic materials kept in the godown caught fire, resulting in the blaze.Atish Rai, sub-fire officer (SFO), said no casualty has been reported. He said 10 workers were putting waste material in a compressing machine when it suddenly caught fire due to a short circuit. The workers raised the alarm and took cover. Soon, the fire department was informed.Rai said that 22 firefighters were pressed into service and 32 fire tenders were used to douse the flames.“We had managed to control the fire completely By 3pm ,” he added. The SFO said no fire safety arrangements were in place at the godown.Later, municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal and Zone-D commissioner Kulpreet Singh visited the spot where they were gheraoed by residents.The residents demanded the shifting of the godown from the vicinity. They said fires had broken out in the godown twice earlier, due to which their houses had also caught fire, resulting in economic losses.The officials assured them that they will look into the matter and necessary action will be taken.No lesson learntIt has been over three years since the then local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had announced a fire safety audit of properties in Ludhiana after a plastic factory blaze in 2017 claimed 16 lives, including nine firefighters. The audit is yet to be completed. Thousands of factories and commercial units in Ludhiana are still functioning without no-objection certificates (NOCs). Though the process was initiated in March 2018, it was suspended after a month.At that time, the fire brigade and Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) officials had claimed that all buildings, both commercial and industrial, will be inspected under the survey and corrective steps will be taken. The audit team was also supposed to check how many units were illegally storing highly inflammable material. but However, the survey is still in doldrums.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/10-workers-have-narrow-escape-after-fire-breaks-out-in-godown/story-6eZgx4BiGNGQZaLV3pahuM.html
22-11-2020||Chandigarh||Projects sought by Chandigarh councillors caught up in MC-UT admn mire||While the municipal corporation (MC) has failed to act on the development projects sought by its councillors, ruing paucity of funds, the UT administration, too, has left them high and dry.There are more than 70 major works and projects, most of them requested by the councillors for their wards, that are awaiting either the approval of the UT administration or implementation.As per a list prepared by MC, the incomplete works range from construction of community centres, booth markets and underground escalators to road works, underground parking, transfer of properties, bus stops, cleaning of seasonal rivulets, creation of primary health centres, etc. Many of these works are pending for several years now, in some cases for the entire elapsed period of the current MC House.The list was collated by collecting information from the councillors. “The list has been prepared so that MC officials can follow up on the pending approvals or implementation with UT’s departments concerned,” said a senior MC official.‘Not able to face electorate’s ire’With the MC elections less than a year away, the councillors are worried their electorate will put them under the scanner for non-delivery of promised works. “There is nobody listening to us, neither the administration nor the MC,” said Satish Kumar Kainth, Congress councillor.For the pending works in his ward, Kainth blames the administration’s non-responsiveness. “Even after approvals in place, the renovation of the primary health centre in Palsora village hasn’t started. A 300-ft approach road is pending completion in the village for more than three years now. The Chandigarh Housing Board has not yet started work on the green park in Sector 56 even though approval is in.”Hira Negi, a councillor from BJP, said, “There is a provision of a sampark centre at the Sector 50 community centre, but the administration has yet to set it up. The construction of the community centre and booth market in Sector 63 is also pending.”In BJP councillor Sunita Dhawan’s ward, 15 works are awaiting execution. Even for the pruning of trees in Sectors 23, 24 and 36, Dhawan said no action had been taken by the UT engineering department. “The construction of the skating rink in Government Senior Secondary School, Sector 23, even though approved, is pending implementation. We keep contacting the officials but only get assurances,” she said.Even in the ward of mayor Raj Bala Malik, the cleaning of vegetation from the bed of Patiala Ki Rao, a seasonal rivulet, is pending with the UT engineering department, despite Malik writing to the UT chief engineer on the issue.Works approved as per priority: AdviserUT adviser Manoj Parida said, “There is a priority list of works, which will be approved and implemented in order.” Arun Sood, former mayor and BJP state president, said, “Lack of coordination between the administration and MC is the main reason for the pendency of works. The meetings of MC and the administration coordination committee should be restarted on priority for resolving such issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/projects-sought-by-chandigarh-councillors-caught-up-in-mc-ut-admn-mire/story-4VnLQR7yvNsXthHhhVZlHL.html

22-11-2020||Chandigarh||Drive against begging in Ludhiana mostly successful||The drive initiated by the police against begging has brought expected results at most of the crossroads of the city, but outside religious places, the beggars have learnt to trick the police: they either run away or spend the day at other places only to return in the morning and night to throng outside shrines for alms and food.The police had nabbed 25 women who along with their children were begging on the crossroads a week ago, but released them with a warning.Three women and their children who beg at Bhai Bala Chowk said they lived nearby and came there to clean windshields of cars in return for money. On being asked if the police didn’t deter them, the children said they would run in the streets on seeing the cops.‘Have been begging for generations’Women beggars said that begging had become difficult lately as the police personnel were on a lookout for them. Luxmi from Jalore in Rajasthan said that they were nomads and did not have permanent jobs or work for earning a livelihood, and were therefore dependent on alms. Mother to an infant, Luxmi said they had been begging for generations.According to her, people often give more money and eatables to women with children, and that she makes somewhere between ₹250 to ₹300 a day. Earlier, there were more than 20 beggars in her area, apart from eunuchs, seeking money from commuters.The police had initiated the drive in February this year and identified 1,170 beggars at 19 busy locations of the city. In one month, the number of beggars had dropped to 435. But the Covid-induced lockdown threw the drive off-track.Shri Durga Mata Mandir near Jagraon bridge is a favorite haunt among beggars, as good Samaritans often distribute food and woollens among them. An elderly beggar Kedarnath said the police had been asking him to leave the place for the past few days, but he had nowhere to go at his age. He and other beggars spend the day hiding and return to the temple for food in the morning and evening, he added.An eatery outside the temple is also contributing towards feeding the beggars. The eatery owner gives a discount on paranthas if they buy them for beggars.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said they were working towards rehabilitation of beggars and making arrangements to send some of them to their native places.He said they had chalked out a special plan to deter the problem: Beggars with disabilities will be shifted to shelter homes, children will be sent to child shelters; others who are fit will be asked to earn their living by working somewhere.The commissioner added that the police had released a WhatsApp number (9115601159) and appealed to the people to share pictures of beggars along with their locations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/drive-against-begging-in-ludhiana-mostly-successful/story-Fr8Qgu7KEu5wN1u7DcFcDM.html

A senior intelligence official said that the four terrorists were in constant touch with their handlers in Pakistan via digital mobile radio.The handlers, in the Shakargarh area of Punjab’s Narowal district in Pakistan, had asked the terrorists about their whereabouts and if they have reached safely. The recovered digital mobile radio has been manufactured by a Pakistani company Micro Electronics and QMobile smartphone.In addition, a wireless set and a GPS device have also been recovered.It may be recalled here that the four Jaish terrorists, believed to be Pakistan nationals, had sneaked into India from the Samba sector on Thursday night along with a huge consignment of arms and ammunition, including six AK-56 rifles, five AK-47 rifles, three pistols, 16 AK magazines, a packet of RDX, 20 Chinese hand grenades, six UBGL grenades and 20 kgs of explosive.Acting on intelligence inputs, security forces intercepted the truck carrying the terrorists at around 4.50 am at Ban toll plaza near Nagrota in Jammu district. The terrorists were shot dead in the gun battle that followed. Two security officials suffered injuries in the operation. They are said to be stable. “A few days ago, (Jaish founder Masood Azhar’s brother) Abdul Rauf Asghar aka Rauf Lala was seen across the International Border in Shakargarh area of Narowal district. The area has launch pads (to push terrorists into India),” said official requesting anonymity. Intelligence agencies had warned of a possible infiltration bid and a major terror attack on November 26 (coinciding with the 2008 Mumbai attacks and just before the beginning of the local body elections), the official said. He added that the Special Operations Group of the Jammu and Kashmir Police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were prepared. The truck that was carrying the terrorists had a fake number plate, according to the officials who have identified the vehicle.

In the week before Diwali (November 6 to November 12), the city conducted 15,555 Covid-19 tests in which 1,468 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported and the positivity rate fell down to 9.4 per cent, whereas in the week after Diwali (November 13 to November 19), the city conducted 13,260 Covid-19 tests of which 1,722 fresh Covid-19 positive cases were reported, which led to a rise in the positivity rate to about 13%.Positivity rate defines the spread of the infection and is measured as per the number of cases reported for every 100 detection tests conducted. The civic body is now increasing the number of tests conducted in 24 hours. Priori to Diwali, the civic body conducted around 1,000 tests which has now gone up to over 4,500 as of Sunday.PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal, said, “We were informed about some technical issues at the NIV which affected the number of samples being tested on a daily basis from earlier 100-1,200 to only 600. This might have brought down the number of tests being collected temporarily. During Diwali too, we had kept all our testing centres open, but unfortunately no one came forward. However, we have increased the testing numbers to more than 4,500 now since the past three days and we will increase them even more in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-s-positivity-rate-goes-up-as-cases-increase-as-compared-to-tests/story-Lic1V4k58EJNAspQoqhXtI.html

22-11-2020||City||Former ministers, legislators in fray for DDC polls||Three former ministers and four former legislators are contesting the district development council (DDC) polls as candidates of the Congress, BJP and Apni Party.Two-time former minister and senior Congress leader, Taj Mohiuddin is going to contest DDC polls on a Congress ticket from north Kashmir’s Uri. He is the first former minister to try his luck in the DDC polls which are being held in eight phases.Taj Mohiuddin had earlier represented north Kashmir’s Uri assembly segment twice and both the times he served as cabinet minister first in the PDP Congress coalition government and then in Congress NC coalition government. He, however, lost the elections in 2014 from Uri.Mohiuddin is one of the few Congress leaders who have been winning elections from Kashmir.He confirmed that he will be filing his nomination for the DDC polls on Monday. “It’s not about the protocol or the status of the seat, it’s about the development of my area which has been completely ignored from the past many years. My participation is only to get the development of my constituency back on the track.”Mohiuddin, however, said that from Kashmir, he could be the only former minister in the fray. “From Jammu, I think some former legislators and ministers are contesting polls,” he said.Uri is the border constituency and in the last elections, NC from the constituency after the veteran political leader, Mohammad Shafi won from the constituency. In the parliament elections, independent candidate engineer Shiekh Rashid garnered the highest votes from the constituency. The Uri assembly segment has been divided into two DDC seats, Boniyar and Parenpella. Taj Mohiuddin will be contesting from Parinpella which is the ST seat.Mohiuddin is not the only former legislator who is contesting DDC polls from neighbouring Sangrama, former legislator Shoaib Lone is also contesting as the candidate of Apni Party from Sangrama in Baramulla. Lone who was district president of the Congress joined the Apni party earlier this year.Lone said that he is contesting the election because his area has been ignored in developmental projects by successive governments.Another former minister, Shabir Khan, and former legislator Choudhary Akram is also contesting from Poonch. Both are Congress candidates.J&K Pradesh Congress state president, Ghulam Ahmad Mir said that three former legislators are contesting the DDC polls. The workers and people compelled them to contest these polls to resolve the problems of their areas.Shakti Raj Parihar, former minister and Bharat Bhushan are contesting DDC polls on the BJP tickets from Doda and Jammu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-ministers-legislators-in-fray-for-ddc-polls/story-mz8DGg1XOfxXm3lRHakPxK.html
22-11-2020||Chandigarh||Parents of girl killed in Kangra school bus accident get ₹5-lakh relief||The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) has awarded a compensation of over Rs 5 lakh to a Kangra-based couple, who lost their seven-year-old daughter in an accident in April 2018.Seema Devi, 30, and Parveen Kumar, 40, of Ther Fangota village, Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh, had filed a complaint against the principal of Wazir Ram Singh Pathania Memorial Public School, Gurchal village, Kangra, and National Insurance Company Limited, Sector 17-C, Chandigarh.In their petition, they stated that on April 9, 2018, their daughter, Ritika Devi, was returning home in her school bus. “The vehicle was being driven at a fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner by driver Madan Lal. There were about 30 passengers in the bus. Lal lost control of the vehicle as he reached near Cheli Khuther village and it fell into a 250-metre-deep gorge,” the parents mentioned in the petition.Their daughter died in the accident that also claimed the life of the driver.A case in this regard was registered under Sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code at the Nurpur police station in Kangra district.The school authorities responded that no such accident took place as alleged, so the claim petition was not maintainable and the amount claimed (Rs 75 lakh) was highly exaggerated. The insurer stated that neither this court had the jurisdiction to try the petition nor had the cause of action accrued within the territorial jurisdiction of this court. Also, the driver didn’t have a valid licence.After hearing the arguments, the tribunal directed both respondents to pay a compensation of Rs 5.05 lakh, along with 7.5% interest per annum from the date of filing of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parents-of-girl-killed-in-kangra-school-bus-accident-get-5-lakh-relief/story-uxj0G1VrH4dVTG6f1jcVvN.html

IMA scam refers to I Monetary Advisors, an investment company purportedly run in compliance with Islamic banking rules. IMA collapsed in May last year when it was unable to repay either the deposits or dividends on the deposits it had illegally accepted.IMA co-founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan at the time of his arrest had alleged that Baig had cheated him of Rs 400 crore and forced him to gift expensive cars and jewellery. Baig, at that time, had vehemently denied the charges and claimed that except for some donations to Haj facilitation centers, he had not accepted any money. More than 51,500 depositors are said to have lost Rs 2,500 crore collected by IMA and its numerous subsidiaries in the ponzi scheme.Also Read: Karnataka govt permits CBI to prosecute two senior IPS officers in IMA scamWhile initially a police probe was ordered with a Special Investigation Team being setup, in September 2019, the state government handed over the case to CBI.

22-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘poor’, likely to deteriorate further||Delhi’s air quality remained “poor” on Sunday and government agencies said it is likely to deteriorate further due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.The city’s 24-hour average AQI was 274 on Sunday It was 251 on Saturday, 296 on Friday, 283 on Thursday and 211 on Wednesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi-NCR’s air quality is likely to deteriorate to the “very poor” category on Monday due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.The predominant surface wind direction was northwesterly and the maximum wind speed 12 kmph on Sunday, it said, adding that the wind speed is likely to drop to eight kmph on Monday.The central agency said the AQI is likely to deteriorate to the upper end of the “very poor” category between Tuesday and Friday.As many as 649 farm fire counts were observed over Punjab, Haryana and adjoining regions on Saturday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR.Stubble burning accounted for 12 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on Sunday. It was 13 per cent on Saturday, 15 per cent on Friday, 20 per cent on Thursday and eight per cent on Wednesday.The minimum temperature settled at 6.9 degrees Celsius on Sunday,  the lowest in the month of November in 17 years, according to IMD.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  Delhi’s ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 6,500 m2/s on Sunday and is likely to drop to 1,500 m2/s on Monday and Tuesday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.Earlier in the day, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the Public Works Department has installed 23 anti-smog guns and deployed 150 tankers for water sprinkling at key intersections and construction sites to reduce dust pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-poor-likely-to-deteriorate-further/story-SsULit6XKmRTgVgi4RVmYJ.html

22-11-2020||Ranchi||Covid-19 impact: Boarding schools turn milk vendors in Jharkhand||Jharkhand’s some of the big boarding schools have turned into milk vendors due to peculiar challenges posed by covid-19 outbreak. These institutions, which have been shut down due to the pandemic are facing acute fund crunch due to their fixed monthly expenses, such as the cost of raising cows and horses, kept for milk supply and horse ride lessons to students.Ranchi’s oldest boarding school, Vikas Vidyalaya, lost seven of its 120 cows due to unavailability of good quality fodder during the initial days of the lockdown. Inaugurated by the first President of India, Rajendra Prasad, in 1952, the school is spread over a sprawling campus of 175 acres and houses 300 students and close to 130 school staff including teachers.The institution has been rearing cows since its beginning about seven decades ago.“Sudden lockdown brought serious problems for us. We have 120 cows which yield over 350 litres of milk daily for consumption by students and school staff. After the lockdown, we faced a serious problem of consuming the milk. Also, the cost of keeping such a large number of cows is enormous,” said school principal PS Kalra.He added, “For initial three months, we used to make vedic bilona Ghee from these milk assuming that we could serve ghee to our students after reopening. It takes nearly 45-50 litres of milk to prepare one kg of ghee through this method. We sell it at the cost price of Rs 1700 per kg.”“But, in July, some of the school alumni persuaded us to start supplying milk in Ranchi as they themselves were ready to purchase it. It all started from July 10 and now we are supplying milk in bottles to about 70 households in Ranchi. “The milk being supplied to almost 70 customers shall continue even after school reopens as it is surplus of our requirements.With this, we are able to curtail our losses to some extent,” Kalra said. According to the school principal, the cost of producing one litre of milk comes to around Rs 50. During the lockdown, the school faced another problem of procuring fodder for the cows. The prices of fodder had shot up by three times during the lockdown, further aggravating the challenge.Another boarding school, Taurian World School, too, is facing similar problems as it keeps 65 cows and 15 horses.“Boarding schools have a different set of problems than day schools. The number of staff in the former is three-four times higher than the latter. We have to keep the entire facility intact even when the school is closed. We can’t remove teaching and non-teaching staff. The fixed expenses are about 80-85%. The only reduction in our expenses came in the form of fuel cost and direct food cost during the lockdown,” said school owner Amit Bajla.He added, “We have 65 cows. The dairy cost is much higher. We are presently selling milk in the local market. Our horses are lying idle.”Bajla said that the school has incurred a whopping loss to the tune of Rs 15 crore in the last eight months.Vidya Vikas Samiti, which runs a chain of schools, Saraswati Sishu Vidya Mandir, across Jharkhand and Bihar, has not faced much problem as they have less number of cows.Samiti’s secretary Mahavir Singh said, “We have few boarding schools in Madhupur, Basukinath and Gumla. We have 22 cows in Madhupur and nearly 7-8 cows at the other two centres. We didn’t face a shortage of fodder during lockdown as the schools are situated near semi-urban areas in close proximity to villages. We are selling milk to local sweet shops. We incurred losses during the three months lockdown period. But, now it’s no loss, no profit.”An association of 1,426 unaided private schools in Jharkhand has moved the Jharkhand high court challenging the government’s June 25 order which stated that private schools in the state were only allowed to collect tuition fee from students and instructed them not to charge other allied fees during the covid-19 pandemic as long as schools are closed.Citing their woes, association’s president Abhay Mishra said, “Under the garb of government’s order, about 60-70% parents had not been paying monthly tuition fee since the outbreak of the pandemic. After running the schools for about nine months since then with the previous revenue earnings, we have virtually exhausted all our funds.”The high court has sought the state government’s reply and fixed the next date of hearing in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/covid-19-impact-boarding-schools-turn-milk-vendors-in-jharkhand/story-8z7Ckurp0F01WJj1MhyHZK.html

The cats are usually found in rugged terrain at altitudes between 9,800 feet and 17,000 feet.The ambitious project was initiated in January 2018 and expected to be completed by December 2020. However, things slowed down after the Covid-19 outbreak since March.Field work completed“ As of March 2020, we have completed field work and gathering of primary data from 10 sites across the state for population estimation of snow leopard using camera traps and double observer surveys for assessing the population of wild prey” says principal chief conservator wildlife Archana Sharma.After the survey was halted due risk of spread of Covid-19, “our team is geared to resume work as planned in the project proposal once the situation improves,” she addes.The wildlife wing had trained 73 frontline staff for the survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/regular-sightings-indicate-rise-in-number-of-snow-leopards-in-hp/story-2AbeK9qSUghmK0fs5UeCUP.html

22-11-2020||Lucknow||PM launches Rs 5,555 cr piped water for 41 lakh residents in UP’s Vindhya region||Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Rs 5,555 crore ‘Har Ghar Nal Yojana’ or water tap for every house scheme for Sonbhadra and Mirzapur districts in the Vindhya region of Uttar Pradesh through video conference on Sunday.The scheme aims at providing piped water supply to over 41 lakh people in the two districts. The prime minister said piped water supply to about 3,000 villages will bring positive changes in the lives of locals.The PM also praised chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his team. He said that UP has set an example by marching forward on the development journey despite the challenges posed by the global coronavirus pandemic.“Earlier, people used to have a perception about UP. But the way UP has launched one developmental project after another is completely changing the image of Uttar Pradesh, the state government and its employees,” Modi said.While tackling the Covid-19 challenge, the state government took care of people who returned from the cities and made arrangements for their employment, he said, adding further that the UP government did not let the Covid-19 situation slow down the pace of development in the state.The prime minister also praised the state government for successfully handling Japanese Encephalitis cases in eastern Uttar Pradesh.“The way in which the number of cases of Japanese Encephalitis decreased in Uttar Pradesh, due to the efforts by the state government led by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, is being discussed far and wide. Even experts talk about it,” he said and added that every resident of Uttar Pradesh would have been “blessing” the CM and his team for saving the lives of innocent children”. Also Read: Quota for Covid-19 warriors’ children: Minister thanks PMThe prime minister alleged that villages, tribal areas and their residents were previously not given as much priority as his government was giving to develop city-like facilities, including LPG connections, there.“Despite having many natural resources and enjoying blessings of rivers like Son, Belan, Karmanash, Van Ganga, Kshipra, the Vindhya region faced neglect for decades since independence... The region was identified by drought. Be it Vindhya region or Bundelkhand, the whole region became one of dearth and scarcity. As a result, several people had to migrate from here,” PM said.“But during the last few years, continuous efforts were made by the government to ensure clean tap water to every house and to develop irrigation facilities in the region. As a result, last year, a big water project was started in Bundelkhand region and today, the scheme worth Rs 5,555 crore has been launched in the Vindhya region to ensure supply of clean water through pipes to every house,” he added.

22-11-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Pune residents vow to keep places of worship Covid-free||Places of worship have opened in the city much to the relief of the faithful, however, posing a whole set of new challenges in terms of coping with government Covid guidelines. Pune readers share their experience so far.Namaz in a public space only after vaccine My father used to offer namaz at our local mosque along with my brother on a regular basis before the lockdown. Once the lockdown was announced, that stopped and he started giving azaan from our balcony and praying in the house. My husband also offers namaz at home. We are not yet sure if it is a good idea to offer namaz in a public space. Maybe when the vaccine is available, we might go back to the previous ways but not before that. Sultana Khan Not visiting temple anytime soon I’m a resident of Satara and I used to travel to Ekmukhi Datta Mandir Narayanpur on almost every single Thursday. I used to do this since my children were born over two decades ago, in 1992. If the weather was good, I’d take a two-wheeler or else I would go in a bus. But I did pay my respects at least a couple of times every month. Since the lockdown, however, it has stopped completely and even now, I do not see myself going back anytime soon mainly because my family is opposed to it. When regular buses begin, I will consider going because winter has started and I need to change buses to reach the temple.Ashok BagalPrefer online pooja, dakshina Once the restrictions were lifted, my husband and I went to our local Shiva temple in Chinchwad. We were glad to observe that the guidelines of social distancing were being followed. The pandits and other devotees too were wearing masks. A sanitizer was provided. We plan to visit the temple regularly in the future, with the necessary precautions. However, a new facility is being provided now which is virtual pooja. We sponsor the necessary funds to the temple’s account - and the pandit performs the pooja while we attend it on a video call. The Dakshina is also accepted online. Devayani KulkarniGoing to temple not worth the risk The temple close to my house is now open; it has only been a few days. I was a daily visitor before the lockdown, but I do not think going to the temple is worth the risk as I have elderly parents in the house. I am sure they are taking necessary precautions to keep temple visitors safe, but I will still wait for things to settle down. Rajesh Kirad Ensured fewer church-goers through Whatsapp group For our last Sunday mass, we planned the number of visitors by coordinating on our WhatsApp group. We restricted the number to only 35. Everyone from the church was satisfied by the arrangement and we plan to go ahead with this for the next few months. The turnout was not as it used to be before. Joel Gavali Devotees are self-aware to take precaution In Jain temples, everybody is required to compulsorily wear a mask. The devotees are not allowed to get any kind of fruits, flowers or rice. A limited number of devotees are allowed inside and once their prayers are over then the next batch is sent in. The best part is that people are self-aware and everybody is taking their own protection and ensuring the compliance of others. So if somebody forgets a mask, people point out to them and ensure that they wear a mask or do not enter the premises without a mask.

22-11-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand CM orders probe into govt press release promoting inter-caste, interfaith marriages||After a controversy erupted over a press release by district social welfare officer of Tehri Garhwal, promoting a government scheme for incentive for inter-caste and interfaith marriages, Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat ordered an inquiry into the matter. Rawat ordered the state chief secretary on Saturday evening to conduct the inquiry to find out the circumstances necessitating the press release by the social welfare officer. Confirming the development, Rawat’s media coordinator Darshan Singh Rawat said, “The CM has taken a serious note of the incident and ordered an inquiry by the CS.” “He has asked him to probe the conditions under which the district social welfare officer issued the press release on a government scheme when the government is strictly against any interfaith marriage with religious conversion,” said Darshan. He informed that the scheme has been in place since the formation of Uttarakhand in 2000 as it was adopted like other schemes from Uttar Pradesh which is the parent state. “The government will soon work on discontinuing the scheme as it cannot tolerate disturbance in peace and harmony in the state with marriages done after religious conversion,” said Rawat. Earlier on Saturday, the Uttarakhand government had come under severe criticism on social media after a copy of the press release made rounds on it. Many Twitter users including some right-wing leaning ones had accused the Uttarakhand government of promoting interfaith marriages when other states are making laws against ‘love jihad.’Also Read: 57 trainee IAS officers test Covid-19 positive in 2 days at IAS Training Academy in Mussoorie  The press release by the social welfare officer stated, “To promote communal harmony and social unity, interfaith and inter-caste marriages are very important as it will help remove differences among different communities.” “To promote such marriages, the social welfare department gives an incentive of R50,000. The inter-caste or interfaith couples can avail this by applying for the same free of cost at the office of social welfare within one year of the marriage,” it stated. It also mentioned conditions that in inter-caste marriage, one partner has to be from the Scheduled Caste community and in case of interfaith marriages, the marriage should have been held in a government approved place of worship like a temple, church or a mosque. Following the controversy, the economic advisor to chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Alok Bhatt, on Saturday said: “The press release… is concerned with one scheme in force under one such scheme of the Uttar Pradesh government since 1976 as made applicable to Uttarakhand. The actual incentive under the scheme was Rs 10,000, which the then Congress government in 2014 increased to Rs 50,000.” Clearing the BJP government’s stand on the move, he tweeted: “No one from the government has spoken in support of promoting interfaith marriages. No-one in the BJP government in their wildest dreams will support anything that is made out here.” The Opposition Congress however attacked the BJP led state government saying, “If the government says that it was our government which had increased the incentive amount then why didn’t they discontinue it?” “This scheme has been in the state since its formation. BJP has had at least four CMs in the state, why none of them discontinued this? It is raking up such issues because it has done nothing for the development of the state. It can discontinue the scheme but can’t stop two individuals from different faiths or caste to marry which is allowed in the constitution,” said Dhasmana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-cm-orders-probe-into-govt-press-release-promoting-inter-caste-interfaith-marriages/story-lxdzIAQZ4rcb96BnmW468O.html

These households would have nearly 70,000 people who will be surveyed again. In the two phases implemented under the initiative in last two months, BMC has so far surveyed 3.5 million households and covered over 14 million population.A list of the homes that were found locked has been prepared and they will be revisited, screened and tested for Covid if needed. Civic officials said that this will ensure proper screening of the population that has migrated back to the city.“Nearly 12, 000 of these households are in slum pockets and many of them could belong to the migrated population,” says Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health). BMC will also set up medical camps at these locations if needed. “The revisits will follow up with screenings of people for Covid. In case if there is a significant number of people that need to be screened, medical camps will be set up at identified areas,” he added.A post-Diwali surge was being feared which could lead to a second wave of Covid cases in Mumbai. While the city saw a Covid peak in September, when daily cases were recorded above 2000, there has been a drastic plunge in November where cases have gone as low as 409 in a day. The city has reported over 1, 000 daily Covid cases in the last two days. Active cases have also hit the lowest as of now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-visit-again-houses-found-locked-in-anti-covid-drive/story-FtJa4r8V5vkyIjAOR68EHI.html
22-11-2020||Delhi||3.7 lakh surveyed, first time RT-PCR tests more than antigen tests in Delhi||For the first time, the number of RT-PCR tests in Delhi has exceeded the number of rapid antigen tests, while over 3.7 lakh people have been surveyed as part of the efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus in the national capital, the Union Home Ministry said on Sunday. Amid the spurt in coronavirus cases in Delhi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah took the lead in ramping up medical infrastructure and formulating a new strategy to combat the Covid-19 surge in the national capital. “For the first time, the number of RT-PCR tests in Delhi have exceeded the rapid antigen tests,” a spokesperson of the Home Ministry said. According to sources, the number of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in the city surpassed the number of rapid antigen tests on Friday. A total of 250 ventilators have been delivered to the DRDO hospital and are being installed. The house-to-house survey, as directed by Shah, has started in Delhi and till Friday, 3,70,729 people have been surveyed. AIIMS has also started the process for recruitment of additional 207 Junior Resident doctors, the spokesperson said. The actions come in the wake of 12 decisions taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Shah on November 15 after Delhi saw fresh spike in Covid-19 cases. The spurt in coronavirus cases in Delhi has been witnessed since October 28 when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and it crossed the 8,000-mark on November 11. Delhi recorded 5,879 fresh Covid-19 cases on Saturday and a positivity rate of 12.90 per cent, while 111 more fatalities pushed the death toll to 8,270. The rising coronavirus cases in Delhi were attributed to the festive season, non-compliance of the Covid-19 safety behaviour and rising pollution in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/3-7-lakh-surveyed-first-time-rt-pcr-tests-more-than-antigen-tests-in-delhi/story-cRWCn4L76vLc6aaxpMesbN.html
22-11-2020||Mumbai||Sena’s Sanjay Raut launches fresh attack on BJP||Sanjay Raut, the chief spokesperson of the Shiv Sena and a member of the Rajya Sabha (RS), slammed the ally-turned-rival Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) leaders from Maharashtra over allegedly politicising reopening of places of worship after denial to celebrate Chhath puja in the state amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Raut said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should ask his party members to desist from indulging in politics over Covid-19. He maintained that the BJP must follow a uniform nationwide policy for Chhath puja celebrations. Though the BJP had sought permission to celebrate Chhath puja, which is largely performed by people from eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, and Jharkhand, the state government did not give permission citing it as a precautionary measure to contain the spread of the contagion. Earlier on November 16, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, comprising the Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Congress, had reopened the places of worship. In his weekly column, Rokh Thok, published in the party mouthpiece Saamana every Sunday, Raut said the BJP was on mission mode to wrest West Bengal from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) after retaining power in Bihar. However, the Sena leader had a poser for his political rival: when will the BJP be able to overcome genuine challenges such as the battle against Covid-19 and revive a shrinking economy? He also criticised Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s “misplaced confidence” and claimed that the spike in the viral infection in the national capital occurred due to the easing of all restrictions.Raut pointed out that Covid-19 has struck Delhi, where the President and PM live. “People are dying in front of their eyes. It would be a big national service if the PM could tell his own party members not to play politics over the Covid-19 pandemic in one of his addresses to the nation,” he said.He also turned his gaze on the BJP leaders from Maharashtra and alleged “… those who are associating the fight against Covid-19 with Hindutva are the enemies of the people”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sena-s-sanjay-raut-launches-fresh-attack-on-bjp/story-xh8Kz9spEuslEox0keqJWO.html
22-11-2020||Patna||Tejashwi Yadav faces corruption charges, must not become leader of opposition: JD(U)||The ruling JD(U) in Bihar on Saturday demanded that RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav refrain from becoming the leader of the opposition since his name was involved in a number of corruption and criminal cases. The JD(U)’s demand came two days after party leader Mewa Lal Chaudhary resigned as the state’s education minister over a corruption taint. At a joint press conference here, JD(U)’s state president Vashishtha Narayan Singh, working president Ashok Choudhary and spokesmen Sanjay Singh, Neeraj Kumar and Ajay Alok slammed Yadav for having targeted Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over appointment of Mewa Lal Chaudhary as the education minister. Shortly after Mewa Lal Chaudhary resigned, Yadav had attacked the chief minister for inducting into his cabinet a “corrupt” person. Chaudhary has been named in an FIR lodged three years ago in connection with irregularities in recruitments at an agriculture university in Bhagalpur district while he was its Vice Chancellor during 2010-15. The JD(U) leaders asserted that the resignation of Chaudhary, barely two days after he was allocated the portfolio, was in line with the chief minister’s “zero tolerance for crime, corruption and communalism”.They said that unlike the clean record of the chief minister who is also the JD(U), Yadav carried the taint of a number of cases “lodged under various sections of the IPC and even SC/ST Act”. They pointed out that the state government has asked the superintendent of police of the district concerned to go ahead with the prosecution, which proved that Chaudhary, an MLA of the ruling party, was not being shielded. The governor’s nod is awaited in the matter.The JD(U) leaders alleged that while filing his nomination papers from Raghopur assembly seat, Yadav had not disclosed full details of cases in which he was named and urged the Election Commission to take note of the “deliberate omission”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/tejashwi-yadav-faces-corruption-charges-must-not-become-leader-of-opposition-jd-u/story-gj2Y0iS6K1XKlUmZSL4kpJ.html
22-11-2020||Delhi||At 6.9°C, Delhi feels the chill as November cold breaks records||Delhi on Sunday recorded a minimum temperature of 6.9 degrees Celsius, breaking the previous November record of 7.3 degrees Celsius witnessed in 2006, India Meteorological Department (IMD) recordings showed. On Sunday, the Safdarjung observatory, which is the official marker for the city, recorded a minimum temperature of 6.9 degrees Celsius, 4 degrees below normal. At Lodhi Road, the minimum temperature went down further --- to record 6.4 degrees Celsius --- while the minimum temperature at the Aaya Nagar observatory was 6.8 degrees Celsius. IMD data shows that Delhi recorded 7.3 degrees Celsius on November 28, 2006. It was the previous record for the lowest minimum temperature since IMD began maintaining data from 1990. The lowest ever minimum temperature was recorded on November 28, 1938, when the minimum temperature dipped to as low as 3.9 degrees Celsius.IMD scientists have warned that this time the Capital is likely to have a colder winter than usual this year, because of a Pacific Ocean weather phenomenon known as La Nina, which leads to a cascading impact on global weather in winter months.During La Nina, temperatures in central Pacific Ocean drops below normal levels, triggering wind patterns that can influence weather in faraway regions. This has been linked to colder than usual winters in northwest India.“Both maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to remain around 2-2.5°C below normal this entire season. Also, since winter is setting in early with temperatures already low, the minimum is likely to fall to 5-6°C as early as December 10. This usually happens after December 20,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC).He added that day temperatures, or the maximum temperature, will begin falling in early December.Local factors, too, have contributed to making days colder. Delhi has had a cloudless streak, with only one western disturbance so far bringing in moisture. “When there are no clouds, the ground cools faster and the minimum temperatures stay low,” Srivastava explained.On Friday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 7.5°C, five notches below normal and the lowest November temperature in 14 years. On Saturday, it rose slightly to settle at 8.5°C, while the maximum was at 24.6°C.Experts said a western disturbance on November 23 will briefly cause a slight increase in temperatures. Once that passes, days and nights will become colder again.“When global conditions like La Nina are prevailing, there is a tendency for regions under northwest India to get colder,” said VK Soni of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre.Soni added that at present, the dip in mercury is accompanied by strong winds that helps in blowing away pollutants but after November 23, wind speed is likely to reduce and trigger a deterioration in air quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-6-9-c-delhi-feels-the-chill-as-november-cold-breaks-records/story-NpL3FZ12ZDWsCbnVfjWgwK.html

Pawan Sehrawat, a Delhi-based businessman who is now exploring wedding venue options in Gurugram, says, “My sister is to get married in a week, and we had already distributed the cards. So we cannot call up people and reduce the guest list from 100 to 50; it will be so embarrassing! We are now in the process of looking for some place in Gurugram where we can shift the wedding function.”Hotel rates in Noida see an upward swing Raghubir Singh, from BMP weddings, says hotels in NCR are also banking on this shift and increasing rates. “People are shifting and moving towards Gurugram. Delhi mein jaise 50 log ho gaye hain, toh woh apni wedding yahan se cancel karwake Gurugram ki taraf jaa rahe hai. Sarkar ne badi strictness kar di hai iss baat pe, aur chalan bhi kaat rahe hai jaise news mein aa raha hai. Aur Noida mein bhi shift ho rahi hai. Noida walon ne apne rate thode up kar diye hai.

Look at Gurugram venues, February onwardsUncertain policies seem to be the reason behind this shift, says wedding planner Rudhir Sharma, from Wedding & Event Design by Rudhir. “People who have weddings till February are going forward with their 50 people wedding in Delhi only. They don’t have an option since they have already made certain advance payments. However, February onwards people are looking at venues in Gurugram because Delhi seems very uncertain with its policies right now,” he adds. Booked in Delhi earlier, shifting venue nowAkash Kumar Dubey, director, Darshweddings Pvt Ltd, says, “Whenever we talk about a social gathering, it’s never that if we invite 200 guests then 200 will appear. The highest number it reaches is 60% of the total gathering invited... Since Delhi has restricted the guest list to 50, people are not only coming to attend functions in Gurugram, but those who had their functions booked in Delhi are also in the process of shifting venue from Delhi to Gurugram. Weddings in our society are something are directly related to sentiments, emotions and status, and no one wants to compromise on these. Our government should also understand that when people are allowed to gather in a political rally, and markets are seeing lakhs of visitor turnout, then why is it that only the wedding industry should suffer, wherein all safety measures are being taken care of.”Limited venues in NCRThe revival of cap on weddings in Delhi has led to a paucity of venues in NCR, too. “People are really preferring to go to Gurugram for their functions. But venues are not available there anymore since they are already booked. So those who couldn’t find an alternative at the last minute, have had to either postpone or cancel their events,” says Salil Chaudhry, from Dew Events at Khan Market. However, Jivika Mehra, another city-based wedding planner, is of the opinion that “People are already starting to limit their guest list as a safety precaution, considering the rise of Covid-19 cases over all.” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/wedding-guests-in-delhi-50-only-denizens-shift-venues-to-noida-gurugram/story-PMYreUq8MjvmcZ4mvUMTWN.html

An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered to be in the “poor” category. Delhi’s AQI on Sunday morning was marginally higher than Saturday’s overall AQI of 251, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The AQI is set to improve on Sunday due to higher wind speed, which helps pollutants to disperse, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). IMD scientists said the average wind speed is tipped to be up to 16 kilometres per hour (kmph) during the day. “The AQI will improve during the weekend. It is unlikely to further worsen till Monday (November 23),” said an IMD scientist. Weather scientists had predicted a cold wave-like condition over Delhi and other parts of north-west India on Sunday. On Saturday, the minimum temperature recorded in Delhi was 8.5 degrees Celsius (C) --- four degrees below the season’s normal.

22-11-2020||Kolkata||TMC govt enforces ban on Chhath puja at two major lakes in Kolkata; crusaders relieved||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) government deployed huge police contingents around Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarobar, the two major water bodies in Kolkata, on Friday and Saturday to stop devotees from performing Chhath puja rituals in violation of court orders. Artificially created by the British government in the 1920s, Rabindra Sarobar was declared a national lake by the Centre in 2002. It is protected under the National Lake Conservation Plan. The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that Chhath puja cannot be allowed at the Rabindra Sarobar which is considered one of the lungs of the city because of its green cover and is home to more than 200 varieties of resident and migratory birds. In a simultaneous development, a division bench of the Calcutta high court banned the puja at Subhas Sarobar, a waterbody of equal importance and located in the north-eastern part of Kolkata. Environment activists, who had moved the court to protect the water bodies and greenery, were relived as devotees could not enter these sites till Saturday afternoon when the festival came to an end. On Friday, some people tried to forcibly cross the makeshift barriers erected around Rabindra Sarobar but were chased away by the police. Also read: 4 Jaish terrorists were commando trained, walked 30 km in moonless night“We are happy that the police carried out the court orders. But this is not enough. The same should be done in the coming years as well,” said Sumita Banerjee, the green activist who had moved the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2018, seeking ban on the rituals at Rabindra Sarobar and bathing by devotees. Although the NGT ordered a ban, it was rampantly violated in 2018 and 2019. The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the NGT’s order, setting aside an appeal by the state government to allow the rituals amid certain restrictions. “Around a dozen painted storks have arrived at Rabindra Sarobar after four years. They have set up nests on an island. As many as 122 varieties of birds have been recorded so far this year. These include black-headed cuckooshrike, long-legged buzzard, changeable hawk-eagle, Swinhoe’s minivet, pied harrier and brown-headed gull. In 2018 and 2019, a lot of birds simply vanished after firecrackers were used by the devotees inside the protected site,” said Sudip Ghosh, who organised ardent birders into a group that have recorded the sightings over the years. Amid allegations by opposition parties that chief minister Mamata Banerjee is concerned about Hindi-speaking voters because of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) victory in Bihar assembly polls, the Kolkata Municipal Development Authority (KMDA), the custodian of the two water bodies, appealed to the Supreme Court and Kolkata high court to allow the puja this year.On Thursday afternoon, Banerjee requested Hindi-speaking people to observe Chhath puja at home or in their respective neighbourhoods, using the 1,500 water tanks the government had created over the past few days. While addressing a Chhath puja gathering, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh targeted Banerjee. “The chief minister is worried about people from Bihar because elections will be held here in a few months. Had she been seriously concerned, the government would have made alternative arrangements long ago. These people will vote for us,” he said. Banerjee addressed two Chhath puja gatherings in Kolkata. “In Bihar, the government has sanctioned only one holiday for Durga puja (a four-day festival) but in Bengal, we have listed two holidays for Chhath puja,” she said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-govt-enforces-ban-on-chhath-puja-at-two-major-lakes-in-kolkata-crusaders-relieved/story-XOV2y9hOrVcNctBqlI8iWJ.html

The Hoshangabad police was not willing to take chances as tone claimant is a journalist and another is a political activist.Hoshangabad Dehat police station, in-charge, Hemant Shrivastava said that about three months ago Shadab Khan, a journalist, lodged a complaint that his three-year-old dog Coco was missing.“On November 18, he claimed to have found his dog in the house of an Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) leader Kratik Shivhare. Shadab called the police and took the dog with him. Later, on November 19, Shivhare reached the police station and claimed that the dog belonged to him. He said the dog’s name Tiger and he purchased the dog from Itarsi a few weeks ago,” Shrivastava said.Shrivastava said that the dog is responding to both the names, Coco and Tiger, and friendly with both claimants. “As neither of them were willing to budge for two days, we decided to perform the DNA test. Shadab Khan said the parent of the dog was in Panchmarhi while Shivhare said the parent of his dog was in Itarsi,” said the police officer.On Saturday, Srivastava dispatched a police team each to Panchmarhi and Itarsi to collect blood samples of the dog’s parents. The dog’s blood samples were collected on Friday night by district veterinary doctor and the police decided to allow Shivhare to keep the dog. Both Khan and Shivhare insisted that the test will reveal the truth. Khan said, “I have submitted all the documents including a vaccination card to the police to prove my ownership and I insisted on a DNA test.” Shivhare said, “Shadab took the dog from my house without my permission and the test will prove the truth.” Meanwhile, animal activist group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) blamed the police for being insensitive. The PETA co-ordinator in the state, Swati Gaurav Bhadoriya said, “The dog fell ill because the police didn’t take care of him. He is suffering from high fever. We want an FIR to be registered against the police and the person who made the false ownership claim under the sections of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.” Hoshangabad superintendent of police Santosh Singh Gaur denied the claim. “We are dealing the case sensitively to ensure the dog gets its rightful owner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-police-to-conduct-dog-s-dna-test-to-settle-ownership-dispute/story-7ojhxZEL0w50kUsdELHDuI.html

But, it’s important to prevent the spread of the disease. Until there is a reliable vaccine, it is important to follow Covid appropriate behaviour,” Sisodia said while participating in a mask distribution drive at his assembly constituency, Patparganj.All ministers, MLAs, councillors and local leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday joined free distribution of masks in various parts of the city.“While distributing masks, we told people about how important masks are in the fight against Covid-19.

22-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi adds 5,879 cases, third-highest one-day deaths||The city reported 5,879 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday, even as fewer tests were conducted on the day than usual, owing to Chhath Puja festivities. However, the number of fatalities remained high, with state authorities reporting 111 deaths of the infection on Saturday, the third-most reported in a single day in the Capital. November 18 saw the highest single-day toll — 131.Saturday’s deaths took the Capital’s Covid-19 toll to 8,270.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMeanwhile, just over 45,500 tests were conducted as per Saturday’s health bulletin, as against an average of over 62,000 over the last three days. However, a high proportion of Saturday’s tests — almost 48% — were conducted using the more accurate RT-PCR method, while the rest used the cheaper and faster, but less sensitive rapid antigen method.In Delhi, the ratio of RT-PCR and rapid antigen test had been skewed since it was deployed in mid-June. In a review meeting with union home minister Amit Shah last week, Delhi was asked to double the number of tests conducted in a day, while increasing the number of RT-PCR tests, which are considered the gold standard for Covid-19 diagnosis. With nearly half the tests being conducted using RT-PCR, the positivity rate — proportion of samples that test positive among those tested – also went up to 12.9% on Saturday’s. This had dropped to 10.59% the day before. “There were fewer cases — 3,000 or so — on Diwali and Sunday [the next day] as well. So we cannot go by one day’s trend. The numbers have to remain low for at least a week before we can say the third wave of infections is over,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Even though fewer cases were reported on Saturday, the number of hospitalisations was the highest so far in the city. As per the bulletin, 9,522 people were admitted to various city hospitals. At present, 55% hospital beds earmarked for Covid-19 patients are occupied, as per the state government’s Delhi Corona App. Further, 86.8% of all intensive care unit (ICU) beds were occupied as on Saturday.Over the past week, the Delhi government added 663 ICU beds in its hospitals, while 500 ICU beds were operationalised in a DRDO facility in Dhaula Kuan, and 42 private hospitals — in addition to 33 that had been ordered previously — were asked to reserve 80% of their ICU beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-adds-5-879-cases-third-highest-one-day-deaths/story-uBNpcbVPt363InJnjP5jJO.html

22-11-2020||City||Punjab’s vaccination drive against foot-and-mouth disease hit as owners oppose ear tagging of cattle||Amid cattle owners’ apprehensions against ear tagging of animals, the Punjab animal husbandry department is set to miss its target for the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccination.The department was to vaccinate around 60 lakh animals by November-end, but so far, it has only been able to cover around 10 lakh animals.As per the Centre’s vaccination programme, all animals have to be ear tagged after vaccination, and linked to the Aadhar card of the owner. Farmers fear that this will lead to more taxes for them under the new Electricity Act-2020. “Farmers are ready for FMD vaccination but we have learnt that ear tagging will lead to higher charges for power under the Electricity Act. The animal husbandry department should perform vaccination but we do not consent to ear tagging of our cattle,” said Gobinder Singh, Sangrur block chief of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan).“This is a misconception among farmers. The tagging has nothing to do with taxes or power charges. Tagging is necessary so that the government can show proper records for the vaccination, at the international-level,” said Dr Naresh Kochhar, state coordinator FMD vaccine. He added that as per the central government’s guidelines, there can be no vaccination without tagging. “I appeal to farmers to not be scared and let the department officials vaccinate the cattle as the project has to be completed within the set time for it to work effectively,” said Dr Kochhar. The vaccination drive had started on October 15 and is to be completed within 45 days. Kochhar further said that in the absence of vaccination, there is a high risk of an outbreak, which will eventually lead to losses for the cattle owners. He revealed their target is to eradicate the disease within five years. Staff shortageMeanwhile, veterinary officers, on the condition of anonymity, said the animal husbandry department is also facing a shortage of staff for vaccination which is also a cause for “low performance”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-vaccination-drive-against-foot-and-mouth-disease-hit-as-owners-oppose-ear-tagging-of-cattle/story-OyYZdxBbIYvhWf303eYgzN.html
22-11-2020||Chandigarh||Capitol Complex: Contentious multilevel parking on list of upcoming projects shared with Unesco||The Chandigarh administration has apprised the Unesco about new constructions, including the contentious multi-level basement parking, to come up at the Capitol Complex, a world heritage site.In its annual “state of conservation” report submitted recently, the administration also listed plans for the construction of the Punjab and Haryana high court extension and a chiller plant to come up near the Punjab secretariat, confirmed a senior UT official.The report was prepared by the UT department of culture in collaboration with the Chandigarh College of Architecture. The yearly report is submitted by the administration to Unesco through the ministry of culture. As per operational guidelines for implementation of the World Heritage Convention, the administration has to describe any potential major restorations, alterations or new constructions intended within the property, buffer zones or corridors or other areas, where such developments may affect the outstanding universal value of the property, including authenticity and integrity.The administration has submitted the report after a gap of two years, and this time around, unlike previous years, the report was submitted within the due date of November 13.About the multilevel parkingThe proposed multilevel underground parking site falls in the buffer zone of Capitol Complex and many experts have warned that the new construction may put its heritage status in jeopardy.“Unesco can raise a red flag over these new constructions if it considers these to be detrimental to the preservation and conservation of the world heritage site. In that case, it would communicate the same to the culture ministry, which will have to intervene in the matter. Unesco can also put the status of heritage site under the category of ‘endangered’ if it considers the new changes as potentially harmful to the site,” said another UT official, requesting anonymity.The proposed site also falls within the Sukhna eco-sensitive zone (SESZ) around the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary that was notified in 2017. The UT environment department had recently communicated to the UT engineering department that construction is allowed there as per the SESZ norms as it is in “regulated zone”.The proposed site also “slightly” falls within the Sukhna catchment area, where all construction activity is prohibited. Notably, the court has ordered no construction in the catchment area.On December 20, 2019, the HC had even directed the UT administration to submit the layout plan for the proposed multi-level underground parking lot opposite the high court museum within four weeks.The HC direction had come after the administration official submitted that the site falls within the SESZ and buffer zone of Capitol Complex. However, the bench was of the view that if parking can’t be constructed, how can a Tourist Information Centre came up on the same site. It further observed that amendments can be made in the Master Plan and also questioned as to how a green belt could come under heritage status.As per the layout plan submitted with the HC in January this year, a multi-level basement parking with three underground floors has been proposed. In the first phase the parking lot will have space for over 2,800 cars. In the second phase, installation of stacks has been proposed to accommodate 5,000 cars. The ground level of the parking lot will be green area. Ramps for exit and entry of vehicles to the basement parking spaces will be the only construction on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capitol-complex-contentious-multilevel-parking-on-list-of-upcoming-projects-shared-with-unesco/story-RXPk2gnUGPMqbbS8cQLlXI.html
22-11-2020||Chandigarh||Manesar land scam:ED questions Haryana government silence on 268 acres||Questioning the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation’s (HSIIDC’s) ‘conspicuous silence’ on 268 acres of Manesar land, the enforcement directorate (ED), which is probing the land scam, has sought details of the land deals.The Haryana government had not announced deemed award for 268 acres, which were part of the 688 acres land under probe. Setting aside the Congress regime’s August 24, 2007 decision to drop acquisition proceedings for 688 acres of land in Manesar and adjoining villages, the Supreme Court had in 2018 said an award is deemed to have been passed on August 26, 2007 with respect to lands that were covered by declaration under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, and which were transferred by landholders between August 27, 2004 and January 29, 2010. In its November 20 reply filed before the SC, the ED said the HSIIDC’s affidavit focused only on 420 acres despite the SC’s ruling. ‘Need to examine transactions’ The agency said that under the garb of ‘change of beneficial ownership’, transferees had accrued undue benefits. “All such transactions are required to be examined as they led to generation of proceeds of crime,” the ED said. In its plea before the apex court, the ED said that HSIIDC should be directed to not grant any refund to different entities without obtaining a no objection certificate from them. ‘In principle land release, not actual’ “The HSIIDC in its affidavit said land of RP Estates and Subros Ltd formed part of the Section 6 notification and land of Subros was released in principle by state government based on the decision of the Ministers’ Committee,” the ED said. “In the case of Subros Ltd, the release was granted in principle and was not an actual approval. Thus, it appears the said portions of land are part of the 268 acres, details of which are being requested. It is submitted that detailed investigation with regard to current ownership, change in ownership of land and any other entity owning the land, which is under Section 6, is essential to determine the undue benefits derived,’’ the ED said. ‘Unjust enrichment is proceed of crime’ The ED also sought directions for HSIIDC to confirm the exact area of land released after the Section 6 notification since the corporation mentions 70.49 acres of released land in its affidavit: “Mere land release after Section 6 did not entitle the entities to enjoy benefits as the apex court had directed that an award is deemed to have been passed in 2007 in respect of lands covered by Section 6 declaration. It is to be examined and investigated what all benefits stand to be derived by way of defying the schedule offence and generation of proceeds of crime gained by middlemen and ultimate gainers under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,” said the ED.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/manesar-land-scam-ed-questions-haryana-government-silence-on-268-acres/story-w1l3Ba6cObJoT54Rvhtx5H.html

The decision comes following a recent directive issued by the Ministry of Defence. There are a total of 33 Sainik Schools across the country, which help young cadets prepare themselves to be part of the National Defence Academy, Kadakwasla. But none of the schools had been admitting girl students until now. In line with the Union government’s objective of enabling greater participation of women in the Armed Forces, and strengthening the motto of ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’, all the Sainik Schools will be enrolling girl students from the next academic session. Col Prashant Saxena, principal of the Kapurthala Sainik School, said the school’s curriculum enables cadets to explore their potential and realise it to the fullest. “Along with studies, military training will be given to girls in the same manner as it is being conducted for boys, and enable them to join as officers in the armed forces,” he said.He further said that arrangements are being made to make the stay of the girl students safe and comfortable in the school. The school will be conducting the entrance exam at five centres across the state i.e. Kapurthala, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Patiala, Faridkot.The application process for All India Sainik School Entrance Examination started on October 20, and the last date for submission is December 20.

22-11-2020||Mumbai||Battle for Mumbai civic body: BJP gets into poll position versus Sena||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is aiming to win the polls for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is controlled by the Shiv Sena for more than three decades. The elections for one of Asia’s richest civic bodies, with an annual budget of ₹33,441 for the 2020-21 fiscal, is slated to take place in the next 15 months. The BJP has also geared up to win sizable seats in 14 other civic bodies — five of which will go to polls soon, and the remaining nine will hold elections in 2022. The party held its first meeting of the executive committee for Mumbai civic body polls three days ago. It has appointed its Kandivli legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar as election in-charge for Mumbai, while Bandra legislator Ashish Shelar, Member of Legislative Council (MLC) Prasad Lad and Airoli legislator Ganesh Naik have been assigned responsibilities for Thane, Vasai-Virar and Navi Mumbai, respectively. The campaigns will be spearheaded by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who squarely targeted the Shiv Sena during the party’s first executive meeting on Wednesday. “Shiv Sena’s life is stuck in BMC and we should hit where it hurts them the most. Each ward will have a key leader as in-charge and the youth and women wings of the party will engage in person-to-person and home-to-home outreach,” Fadnavis said. BJP’s state unit chief Chandrakant Patil said the party’s Mumbai unit will have a parliamentary board which will take decisions related to BMC elections with approval from the state parliamentary board. According to a BJP office-bearer, the party is looking to hurt the political prospects of the Sena, which is seen as its prime political rival after the two snapped ties last year. “The relations between the BJP and Sena have strained beyond repair. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has sternly opposed any ties with the Sena in future. In the 2017 elections, we fought separately and attacked each other very strongly, but we still continued to be alliance partners in the state. This time, it will be an even bitter tussle,” he said, adding that the party has started making in-roads in Sena citadels and the results will be better than the elections in 2017. Meanwhile, the Sena has sharply reacted to BJP’s attack. “The BJP wants to control Mumbai, its businesses, financial turnover and land. They want to diminish its importance. [But] Mumbai voters will decide which saffron flag they want to see hoisted at the BMC headquarters,” Sena’s parliamentarian Sanjay Raut said a couple of days ago.Political analyst Hemant Desai said the BJP has an edge over other parties as far as the preparations are concerned. “While the three ruling parties have not held even a single coordination meeting, the BJP has started preparations for BMC elections. The BJP has strategically started raking up issues of Hindutva, Chhath Puja, reopening of temples and excessive power bills, which impact different set of voters in Mumbai. The Sena’s connect with the common people, which was its strength, appears to be lost,” said Desai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/battle-for-mumbai-civic-body-bjp-gets-into-poll-position-versus-sena/story-7I5u02bglNIE8sdR7lAzfJ.html
22-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana farmers on edge as bajra procurement hits snag||sunil.kumar3@htlive.com Farmer unions and Opposition leaders have accused the Haryana government of ‘running away from the procurement process’, after government agencies stopped purchasing bajra (pearl millet) from mandis.Procurement of bajra had started on October 1 at ₹2,150 per quintal but was inexplicably stopped six days ago. A farmer, Sunil Kumar of Bhiwani’s Garwa village, said he had received a message asking him to bring his bajra crop to Behal mandi on November 17. However, once he got there, officials refused to purchase his produce citing lack of verification: “The officials told me procurement will be done after verifying my status as a farmer. I have visited the mandi many times since but officials are yet to procure my crop,” he said.Haryana Kisan Sabha secretary Dayanand Punia, a resident of Bhiwani, says thousands of farmers in the district and still more across the state are waiting for government agencies to procure their bajra, moong and groundnut. However, no crops have been purchased since Diwali.“Farmers have to start sowing wheat but their produce is still lying in mandis. Do we wait for procurement to start or prepare our fields for sowing? Farmers should be given more time to sell their produce. The government should ensure that the purchase is not merely made on paper,” Punia said.Farmers await payment: ChautalaEllenabad Indian National Lok Dal MLA Abhay Singh Chautala said, “The government’s real face has been exposed as it has failed to procure bajra, paddy, moong and groundnut from farmers. Thousands of farmers are still waiting for their turn to sell their crops. Bajra farmers have been waiting for payment for the last two weeks. The government has been creating hurdles for farmers. First, they barred entry of farmers from neighbouring states. Now, they are stopping farmers from Punjab from purchasing urea from Haryana.”Bhiwani deputy commissioner Jaibir Singh Arya said he had formed teams to verify farmers whose bajra was yet to be procured: “Officials concerned will submit the list by November 21, after which we will start bajra procurement. Bajra will be procured till November 27,” the DC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-on-edge-as-bajra-procurement-hits-snag/story-iQavOfRwmiue3xi4Xy1NXN.html

According to MTDC and district administration, a number of projects like ropeways, and laser, sound and light shows are put on hold as the Rs350 crore plan is facing fund shortage of Rs 237 crore. The joint venture drafted by MTDC and the district administration and aimed at boosting the tourism potential of the district was submitted to the the government for approval. However, the project got stuck due to administrative laxity and many projects that could create employment could not start. The Maharashtra government had issued a government resolution (GR) in 2014 seeking tourism development plan from districts. Pune district officials have been regularly following up the progress of the plan that it had submitted. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “Our plan to develop sites that could generate tourism revenue have been put on hold due to fund shortage,” he said. MTDC officials stated that the government had conveyed that it would assess the tourism potential of the suggested places on studying the reports submitted, but no acknowledgement has been done till date.

Surge can also happen like the way it happened after Ganesh festival so care needs to be taken promptly by all.”Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ashish Shelar has criticised Maha Vikas Aghadi government for leaving the decision of reopening of schools on local bodies.“The government has simply shrugged off its responsibility and asked local bodies to take a call. This has created confusion on reopening of schools everywhere,” said Shelar.As of Friday, PCMC reported 165 new cases taking the total count to 86,942 and 33 deaths taking the death toll to 1,241.Parents were happy with the decision as they were in two minds about sending children to school or not. “My son Jay is in Class 10 at New English School, Bijlinagar, Chinchwad.

Deshmukh also added that ED is probing only the money laundering part of the scam.“Mumbai Police are investigating the TRP scam properly. The money laundering part will now be investigated by ED. We are ready to extend full cooperation to the central agency,” Deshmukh said on Saturday.Both the state and the Centre were at loggerhead over the investigation of the case, in which the Mumbai Police has named Republic TV, two Marathi channels and few other individuals.The state government on October 21 had withdrawn general consent accorded to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases in the state. Following the withdrawal of the consent, CBI will require the state’s permission to enter Maharashtra for carrying out any investigation. The decision came a day after the probe of the TRP scam was handed over to CBI following recommendations made by the Uttar Pradesh government. Deshmukh had also said the state government suspected the possibility of TRP case’s transfer to the central agency for political reasons.The alleged TRP scam came to light last month when ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ready-to-extend-full-cooperation-to-ed-in-trp-scam-probe-maharashtra-home-minister/story-hrdiV9RCNQKd3FfEbDi6kI.html

22-11-2020||Pune||Police manual overhaul close to completion, awaiting govt nod: DGP||The reworked police manual, a three-volume document, which promises to be much more exhaustive than its previous editions, is awaiting a nod from the state government, according to Subodh Jaiswal, director-general of police (DGP), Maharashtra.Maharashtra Police Manual deals with three broad categories of police work. The first volume deals with the administration of police force, the second maps out finance, supplies and office procedure, and the third define powers and duties of the police.The new police manual will have detailed protocols for dealing with victims and survivors of crimes against women. This is something that has not found a place in the official state police manual till date.With the changing nature of crime and community, the changed manual - if the officers involved are to be believed - will potentially bring about a change in the relationship with the police and the people they are sworn to protect.The manual was first published in 1959 under the title Bombay Police Manual.He said that a team led by Maharashtra Police Academy (MPA) director Aswati Dorje and former additional director general (ADG) training Sanjay Saxena was created to undertake the task. “The team wrote to the government which in-turn created a team of deputy secretaries - law, home, general administration department (GAD) - to gauge the potential of the proposal the police officers had made,” according to Jaiswal.“It was a year-long effort by various teams. The intensive work went on for about six months. We worked through holidays and weekends to make it happen as various documents were needed to be referred to,” said Dorje.“The manual requires to be based on the laws, rules, procedures, orders, circulars, guidelines from the government, manuals of other organisations and states, all of which required massive referencing and compilation of material. We made smaller teams to work on each of the three volumes and consulted with government functionaries, senior officers handling the particular specialised branches, lawyers and experts in each of the topics,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-manual-overhaul-close-to-completion-awaiting-govt-nod-dgp/story-Co6vJ4IBO0uZ7uJxaForDM.html

The said forest area is located behind the NIBM institute is a vast expanse of rich and rare biodiversity protected under Reserve Forest Act. According to the citizens, urban forests play an important role in ecology of human habitats in many ways. The citizens of the area maintained that the constant inundation of their residential buildings downstream due to water flowing down from NIBM forest hill was causing several issues to the citizens like flooding of parking during monsoon.Daljeet Goraya, Member, NIBM citizens watch group said “ We have petitioned the ministry seeking conversion of the reserve forest into an urban forest for the citizens. This is one of the largest reserve forest in the country and it can be developed into state of the art urban forest cum garden for the citizens of the area and entire Pune. There is a growing understanding of the importance of urban forests in the citizens and NIBM forest has rich flora and fauna. We demand immediate construction of fencing wall around the forest and ensure that the forest is protected for the next generation. We have also requested the government to beautify and develop the forest with people’s participation ,” he said.Recently transferred additional principal chief conservator of forests (Pune division ) Vivek Khandekar who has overseen removal of encroachment in the NIBM forest area said “There were issues related to funds and we had received plan from the urban forest park development scheme on lines of Warje Urban Forest and we had readied plan to effect. We had also removed some encroachments in the forest area and I have now been transferred .” he said. It was during his tenure that the urban forest development plan was readied.Green activist Praveen Kumar Anand said “ Anand Van Mitra Mandal has taken a pledge to convert the 200 NIBM forest stretch into urban forest.

22-11-2020||Chandigarh||Privatisation of electricity department in Chandigarh: RWA apex body to join powermen for protest on November 24||To protest against the privatisation of the UT electricity department, the Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) will be joining the UT Powermen Union (UTPU) for a protest at the Transport Chowk in Sector 26 on Monday. FOSWAC chairman Baljinder Singh Bittu said, “Why privatise a department that is already in profit. A private company will further increase the power bills. This government has done nothing but charge taxes in one form or the other from the residents and has given us no improvement in the services that they provide.”General secretary of UTPU Gopal Dutt Joshi said the powermen were not sure if they will retain their jobs once the department is privatised: “We have over 20 years of work experience. The private companies are most likely to replace us with underpaid newcomers who will not provide the same services that we do.” ‘Will approach high court’Bittu added that after Monday, FOSWAC will hold another protest march most likely in Sector 17 along with other associations against the UT administration if their demands were not considered. He also said that FOSWAC will approach the Punjab and Haryana high court to take legal action against the government for privatising an essential commodity.The Union power ministry had asked the UT administration to privatise power distribution in the city. Nine firms including Adani and Tata have expressed interest in the bidding process.With privatisation, the department will become an autonomous body that will be divided into the State Transmission Utility (STU) and the State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC). The STU will be responsible for smooth transmission of power and the SLDC will be the main body to ensure integrated operation of the power system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/privatisation-of-electricity-department-in-chandigarh-rwa-apex-body-to-join-powermen-for-protest-on-november-24/story-fWb0qubapcXter5hxSa4nK.html

22-11-2020||Pune||Pune police go soft on mask violations||Even as people are coming out on city roads and public places in large number without following guidelines, the Pune police have reported fewer actions against those not wearing masks.As per data provided by Pune police crime branch, the number of mask violators has reduced in the city even as the rush of people has increased on roads due to Diwali in November as compared to September.The number of people not wearing masks was 65,038 in October as Pune police collected fines of Rs 3,99,91,150 from them while in November till 20, 26,676 were found not wearing a mask for which amount collected was Rs 1,32,54,200. In September, 81,777 were fined with Rs 3,99,91,150 recovered in fines form them.“The intention of collecting fine from people was to make people aware of the importance of wearing a mask. If you see the statistics, the number of fines has gone down as more people are now wearing a mask,” said Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, crime branch, Pune.Pune police and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) are collecting Rs 500 from the people who are not wearing masks at public places.“During Diwali, the city roads were crowded and we have taken action accordingly. Now, there is more awareness among masses,” said Singh.On Friday, Pune city reported 335 new cases taking the total count to 176,708 and 16 deaths taking the death toll to 4,149.“Pune Police will continue taking action in the same manner in coming days as well,” added Singh.However, the shopkeepers at Laxmi road, have a different view. “During Diwali time not many police personnel were on the field for checking as compared to normal time. It was peak season time and checking was less,” said the owner of a saree shop.Same was observed by Omkar Paranjape, a regular at Fergusson College road. “Huge crowd of people and hardly police officials were seen and many street shop hawkers were not wearing a mask during the evening time,” he said.A shopkeeper on Kumthekar road on condition of anonymity said, “People wear masks and while talking remove it and hang it around their neck. We had to tell them to wear it properly,” he said.Vijay Kumbhar, right to information (RTI) activist, said, “When we talk about Pune city to some extent people are aware of wearing masks but in rural places near Pune, still people are not wearing masks and no one takes actions against them which need to be taken care off.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-cops-go-soft-on-mask-violations/story-GPangr6RyxSQ8lim6vCCtM.html
22-11-2020||City||Covid positive boy undergoes rare paediatric living donor small intestinal transplant||PUNE A private hospital in the city successfully operated one of the state’s first paediatric intestinal gangrene case caused due to Covid-19. The surgery was carried out on a nine-year-old boy from Maharashtra. According to doctors, the transplant, with the patient’s father being the donor, also highlighted the impact of the coronavirus on intestine which is a rare case. Doctors at Jupiter hospital carried the challenging surgery on the boy who had complained of severe abdominal pain in August 2020. After diagnosis, it was found that due to thrombosis and massive gangrene in his small intestine, a condition in which the blood supply to the intestine is lost, the intestine is dead. Immediate surgery was conducted to remove his intestines to avoid further spread. Post removal of the intestine, an antibodies test and bowel RT-PCR showed Covid-19 infection in the removed organ. Later, the family informed the hospital that the boy and his father had tested positive for Covid-19 with mild symptoms a month ago. Dr Gaurav Chaubal, chief multi-organ transplant surgeon, said, “The child was listed for a cadaveric small intestinal transplant and was on the waiting list for three months. During this time, the child was longing to eat and also started developing complications related to parental nutrition.” With no cadaveric organ offer insight, the prospects of a living donor small intestinal transplant were discussed with the family. On November 5, a team of surgeons performed the surgery, wherein 200 cm of intestine was carefully harvested and transplanted from the father to the child. The surgery lasted for eight hours. The donor has recovered completely. The child is recovering well and has started oral intake from day eight of the surgery. Dr Rajiv Soman, infectious disease specialist from the hospital, said, “Thrombosis and bowel perforation is well known in severe Covid-19. However, massive bowel gangrene is rare. Only one such case has been reported in Italy so far, with fatal outcome. In this case, apart from intestinal gangrene, there were many secondary infections in the abdominal area, making it a complicated one.” On losing his entire small bowel, before the transplant, the child was unable to eat and was put on artificial nutrition, also called parenteral nutrition. His condition was labile as there were high fluid losses and electrolyte disturbances. Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC), said, “This is surely the first such surgery wherein a paediatric donor has received a small bowel transplant. Earlier, Pune had performed the small bowel transplant in adults but this is the first in the state in kids.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-positive-boy-undergoes-rare-paediatric-living-donor-small-intestinal-transplant/story-eXcRakLEk7xZD4i3yLqcMK.html

The warrants have been issued for March 1.It was on September 10 that the high court had issued Singh a notice on a contempt plea that alleged that in 2019 the high court had directed the varsity to award one mark to Gusain for his work experience in recruitment for the post of clerk. However, the PU registrar had passed an order refusing to grant the same.In December 2019, the high court had disposed of Gusain’s plea observing that he was entitled to be given one mark for the work experience and had asked PU to comply with the order within four months. The recruitment had taken place in 2013 and Gusain got to know subsequently that he had not been given the said mark.

22-11-2020||City||Positivity rate remains below 10% despite rise in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai||In anticipation of a spike in recorded cases, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has increased testing to pre-Diwali levels. On Friday, an all-time high number of daily tests — 17,260 — were conducted for Covid-19 in Mumbai. Although more than 1,000 cases were recorded in a day for the fourth time this month, BMC said November’s positivity rate is below 10%, which indicates controlled spread. According to BMC, the number of tests conducted in the first 15 days of November, ahead of Diwali, had fallen drastically. BMC’s data shows that there was a 21% drop in the number of tests conducted between October 1-10 (1.41 lakh) and November 1-10 (1.11 lakh). However, the positivity rate in November is 6.54% compared to 13.91% in October and 14.30% in September.BMC said testing has been ramped up as the civic body anticipated a rise in cases following Diwali. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We are increasing testing by undertaking drives to test bus drivers, shop owners and other citizens who came in contact with multiple people. We are also testing at over 200 free testing centres and due to this, the testing will go up.”Starting November 17, over 10,000 tests have been conducted daily in Mumbai, compared to 3,000 to 9,000 tests daily in the first 15 days of November. Dr Kedar Toraskar of Wockhardt Hospital, who is also a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, had earlier told HT that the task force has recommended either increasing or maintaining the number of tests conducted in Mumbai.City-based general physician, Dr Siddarth Paliwal said, “If we consider our surge was maximum in September and first half of October, now, post-Diwali, we should have [an] equal [number of] tests as we were having in September and first half of October.” He also said a balance must be maintained between tests using antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. “If suddenly our reliance on antigen kits goes up, there is a possibility that positivity rate might go down,” he warned. BMC currently maintains a ratio of 60-40 or 70-30 in favour of the RT-PCR method. Overall, 17.39 lakh tests have been conducted in Mumbai. The overall positivity rate is 15.66%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/positivity-rate-remains-below-10-despite-rise-in-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai/story-p9cQkwlDSuZLUqBylmHecK.html
22-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh health teams told to trace at least 10 contacts of Covid patients||The Chandigarh health department has directed its ground staff to trace at least 10 contacts of Covid-19 patients to stop the chain of infection amid a steady rise in numbers in the city. The directions have been given on the basis of feedback received from rapid response teams constituted for contact tracing. Even a team of experts sent by the Centre in early September has found delay in contacting patients and subsequent contact tracing.Dr Amandeep Kang, director of health services and family welfare, Chandigarh, said: “Health officials will call Covid patients thrice within a week to give them enough time to think about where all they had been before testing positive. Contacts in those places will be considered, where the person spent considerable time and did not follow social distancing norms or ignored wearing a mask.” She said the exercise will be carried out as a counselling session, and not an inquiry.Officials said with curbs being lifted and more placed being opened, most people are unable to recall all the places they had visited, thus making the exercise more cumbersome. “There is also fatigue that has set in among both residents and officials. But to minimise the infection spread, tracing and testing of contacts is necessary,” said a senior official involved in the exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-health-teams-told-to-trace-at-least-10-contacts-of-covid-patients/story-kl6WEJjOb8r6D3x3h5bCPM.html
22-11-2020||Pune||Schools to remain shut in Pune till December 13||Following sharp reactions from parents and teachers, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has now rolled back its earlier decision to restart schools from November 23 and has now decided to defer it till December 13. The civic administration will review the situation and decide whether to open the campuses or not. The decision to hold reopening of the civic-run and private schools till December 13 was taken during a meeting on Saturday, the outcome of which was convened by mayor Murlidhar Mohol. PMC had earlier issued guidelines to start schools but has now revised the order for the same. “The civic body has now decided to revise its earlier decisions. PMC has issued fresh order on Saturday stating that civic-run, as well as private schools, will not open till December 13 when the administration will review the situation and decide whether to open the campuses or not. Pune is seeing a rise in cases and so it seems only logical to postpone the opening of schools,” said Mohol. He added that the decision was taken keeping in mind the health of the children. Earlier the civic body in its circular has stated that prior to the opening of schools, the teachers must be tested for Covid-19 and parents should give written consent for their respective kids to attend school. He said, “We got a very poor response from the parents and not even five per cent of the parents submitted the written response. Therefore we have decided to postpone the reopening of schools.” The decision was welcomed by many parents and other stakeholders. Manoj Deshpande, a city resident, said during the survey he conducted on parents readiness, 52 per cent said they were not sure about the decision. “We conducted a survey on parents readiness and 52% responded ‘not sure’ and 41% as ‘no’. The sample was 9th and 10th grades (123 size),” tweeted Deshpande. Meanwhile, schools from rural parts of Pune district will reopen on Monday as decided earlier. Ayush Prasad, Pune Zilla Parishad CEO, said the spread of the virus is very limited in rural parts. “We have conducted a test of teachers in which only two were found positive. Since the cases in rural parts are very limited, schools will reopen from November 23, as scheduled earlier,” said Prasad. Earlier on Monday, many had criticised civic administration’s haste to reopen schools from Monday. “Medical experts say that despite the corona, a large number of people do not have symptoms. In such a situation, how to constantly check the children or teachers? The big question can arise if the teacher is tested corona positive. If 50 per cent of the children are present, how will the parents plan transportation? How can we ensure that children keep a safe distance during 50 per cent attendance? Does the consent of the parents end the responsibility of the schools? The government has not given satisfactory answers to all these issues,” Mukund Kirdat, coordinator, Pune Parents United had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/schools-to-remain-shut-in-pune-till-december-13/story-6H7SDiHlCLWJujf6bV4RTL.html

Raj Bhavan refused to comment on the issue. However, officials, on condition of anonymity, said there is no mosque inside Raj Bhavan, but one of the staff quarters has been kept open for prayers for the Muslim staff. Many outsiders, too, had started visiting the place to offer prayers on Friday, which led to crowding, so the staff did not allow outsiders to pray at the place this Friday, the officials said.After the lockdown was imposed on March 23, the place was closed. It was opened on November 20, the first Friday after all the religious places were allowed to open in the state. In its letter to the Governor, M Saeed Noori, secretary-general of Raza Academy, said, “Even though the entire country has opened up its religious places, Raj Bhavan employees refused to allow Muslims to offer the jumuah namaz (Friday prayer) in the mosque, with just five to seven people praying inside. We request you to immediately issue orders to the staff to allow the people of the locality to offer jumuah namaz as they used to do before the Covid-19 pandemic.” All the religious places in the state were allowed to reopen for devotees from November 16 after eight months. They were closed due to the lockdown imposed to control the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/allow-citizens-to-pray-at-mosque-in-raj-bhavan-raza-academy-to-maharashtra-governor/story-jYb8OypTGF1z3tLP02Y41M.html

Symptomatic patients are the ones who need hospital beds, oxygen beds, or intensive care unit (ICU) beds, based on the severity of infection. Currently, Mumbai has 11,822 active cases, of which 26% are symptomatic, 66% are asymptomatic, and 8% are critical. Of the 17,100 Covid-19 beds in BMC hospitals, 4,944 (28%) are occupied. Moreover, Covid Care Centres, which are manned by doctors and nurses 24X7, are also used to treat mild symptomatic patients. There are 181 such facilities in the city with 23,806 beds. Of these, 23 centres with a bed capacity of 3,200 are active. The others are dormant and can be activated if need arises. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, who is in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “We will be able to handle up to 17,000 active symptomatic cases at a time if a there is a peak in Mumbai’s cases. Over the past few months, we realised that there is a greater need for oxygen beds in comparison to ICUs and even ventilators. So, 50% of BMC’s hospital beds are oxygen beds.” There are 1,978 ICU beds in BMC-run hospitals, of which 830 are available, while in the case of oxygen beds, 5,866 of the total 8,423 are vacant. Currently, the city has 1,184 ventilator beds, of which 393 are available. “Once a patient is admitted to the hospital, the treatment protocol is decided and gets activated,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-health-infrastructure-can-handle-upto-17-000-symptomatic-cases-during-covid-19-peak-civic-body/story-DSWbEWsD7Gn6oYHJyjFHdL.html

The work was carried out with the help of 60 skilled labours and supervisors and 40 engineers and designers. The remaining work for 35m will be carried out on Sunday.”In the next mega block scheduled on November 28 and 29, the work of positioning of the girder will be completed, he said.Read more: Politics, for us, is only during the elections: Aaditya ThackerayThe entire launching work was captured through a drone camera at the site. In order to ensure the safety at the launching site and the smooth movement of traffic, a total of 300 police personnel from the Railway Protection Force, local police and traffic police were deployed at the spot and different parts of the city.For launching of the girder, the Central Railway (CR) has announced mega block from 10.15am to 2.15pm on Saturday. Followed by the work, the railway service on the route was resumed with an Ambernath local departing Kalyan station to CSMT at 2.15 pm.Throughout the mega block, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Transport (KDMT) provided 25 additional buses and the state road transport provided 29 buses for the commuters. This helped commuters to connect within and out the city with ease.As per the KDMT, around 10,000 passengers took the buses on Saturday morning. KDMT members were deployed at the depots to guide the passengers to avoid violation of social distancing norms.“The civic bus service helped many to commute during the mega block. There was no crowding at the depot or inside the bus, which is appreciable,” said Sudesh Mahadik, 28, who took a civic bus from Kalyan ST depot to connect to Dombivli for work.The MSRDC, which started the work for the two-lane new bridge since December 2018, has claimed that it will try and finish the work at the earliest.“After the launching of the girder, the remaining work like building the concrete slab, pillar and other amenities will be undertaken. We have planned to finish the work with priority by December end,” added Sontakke.Auto drivers overcharge commuters Even after directions from the traffic police and auto rickshaw union to co-operate during the mega block period by not refusing a ride and overcharging, several auto drivers in the city had their way.For a trip from Kalyan to Bhiwandi, auto drivers charged ₹100 per seat as against the normal fare of ₹40. While they charged ₹100 for Kalyan to Dombivli, it was ₹200 for Kalyan to Thane and ₹400 for Kalyan to Ambernath for three on seat-sharing basis.“I wanted to go to Dombivli from Kalyan and I approached an auto rickshaw at the Kalyan station. The driver asked me to pay ₹100 initially before settling for ₹80. I refused to take the auto as the fare was still high,” said Saurabh Joshi, 40, a commuter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-phase-of-patripool-rob-girder-launched-in-kalyan/story-yZUv68DJC8h4gjqEbLh6tO.html

22-11-2020||Mumbai||Politics, for us, is only during the elections: Aaditya Thackeray||The Maharashtra Minister of Tourism and Environment, Aaditya Thackeray, took a dig at BJP, remarking that his Shiv Sena government indulges in politics only during the elections but after that, the focus is solely on development, unlike the opposition party.Thackeray was speaking at the launch of the Patripool girder in Kalyan on Saturday morning. Thackeray added that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has taken up several such developmental works like the Patripool RoB across the state.Thackeray said, “Patripool has been a major issue. However, now the work has been initiated after the mega blocks were permitted by the railway. Similarly, several such developmental works are undertaken across the state by the MVA,” said Thackeray.He added, “Politics is a part of everything. Politics, for us, is only during the elections, after which we focus on work. Other parties continue doing politics throughout.”While Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde has been taking all the credit for the work of the Patripool bridge through his social media handles, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have been slamming the state government and Shinde for delaying the project.The 104-year-old Patripool bridge was dismantled on November 18, 2018, following which there has been a demand to build the new bridge as it affected the traffic movement in Kalyan-Dombivli.BJP’s Mahila Aghadi Zilla president Rekha Chaudhary, who was at the launch, said, “The work of the bridge is carried out very slowly. People have been protesting against the delay. The entire credit for the push to the project goes to the central government. There are several other infrastructure projects like the Mankoli, Durgadi, Kopar bridge. The state government should emphasise on these projects.”Shinde, on the other hand, claimed that this is an important event for the city. He said, “The planning and procedure for the new bridge was initiated after the bridge was dismantled two years ago. This took time as we had to plan from the beginning and also redesign the plan due to a few hurdles. We had to get permissions from the railways and the local body. After that, the lockdown affected the work as workers were not available. However, we managed to speed up the work and now it is in its final stage,” added Shinde.Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) MLA Raju Patil, who reached the spot, was not allowed by the police.“I reached the spot to have a look at the girder launch. Police thought I arrived for a protest at the site. If I was protesting, I intimate about it in advance. Only by building the Patripool bridge, the traffic woes in the city won’t end. There are several other projects that need to be prioritised. The government and civic body has failed to do it. The 90-feet road connecting the Patripool bridge is still not constructed completely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/politics-for-us-is-only-during-the-elections-aaditya-thackeray/story-sYvSLzoMRimYAU0qseWTJN.html
22-11-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: A tenancy authority for Chandigarh||Given the large number of residential units rented out in Chandigarh, the administration appears to be on the right track by drawing up the draft Tenancy Act 2020, which has now been sent to the Centre for approval. The Act proposes to establish a framework for the regulation of tenancy matters (residential and commercial) and to balance the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants, including fast adjudication process for resolution of disputes. The key provision of the proposed Act is setting up of a rent authority which will have exclusive jurisdiction over tenancy issues. All rent agreements will have to be submitted to this authority instead of the sub-registrar’s office as is done now. The landowner and the tenant will have to separately file the particulars within a month of signing the agreement. The authority will adjudicate all disputes between a landlord and tenant instead of the civil courts. This is significant as the pendency rate is currently very high. The good thing is that appeals against authority’s orders will be made in the rent court, headed by a senior judicial officer, with cases to be disposed of within 60 days. Against a rent court order, an appeal can be filed with the rent tribunal. Lawyers’ bodies, it is learnt, have objected to the creation of the rent authority having exclusive adjudication powers over tenancy disputes and issues. They suggested that the tenancy issues be kept under the purview of civil courts only, sources have said. In response, the administration has said that the rent authority’s adjudication powers are necessitated as it would speed up the resolution of tenancy related disputes, and it is central to the creation of the new Tenancy Act. The Commercial Tenants’ Association in its objections to the draft Act had stated that the creation of a rent authority and rent court to be presided over by an executive officer was in contravention of the already existing procedure and adjudication of litigation. The proposed Act stipulates: “Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in the areas to which this Act extends, only the rent court and no civil court shall have jurisdiction, to hear and decide the applications relating to disputes between landowner and tenant.” The proposals are prospective in nature and will cover tenancy agreements that have taken place after its implementation.

22-11-2020||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Love beneath the gentle shade of the chameli||Turning the 225 pages of the mint-fresh anthology of Great Indian Love Poems, I wonder where I should begin. The enticing flowery jacket of this collection described as a ‘ratnakosha’ has many delights to offer from ancient times to the present. Flipping the pages back and forth, my eyes suddenly stop at a poem, titled The Saviours, and heart and memory fill with soft fragrance. Exquisitely translated from Urdu into English by Pritish Nandy, it is the eternal romantic poem by the people’s poet Makhdoom Mohiuddin (1908-1969), a Marxist activist rebelling against the nizam of the erstwhile state of Hyderabad. Yes, the same poet whom late Irfaan Khan played with elan, I recall, while reading this translation by Nandy a long time ago probably in The Illustrated Weekly of India. But right now the original lyrics fill the senses: Ik chameli ke mandve tale. Maikade se zara door uss modh par, Do badan pyar ki aag mein jal gaye, Ik chameli ke mandve tale (Under the gentle shade of the chameli, at the crossing just beyond the tavern, the two of them, they were consumed by the fire of love).And so in the trance of the four-letter word one moves from one verse to the other put together with care by Abhay K (40). He has already brought out eight volumes of verse, a memoir and had earlier edited an anthology of Great Indian Poems, gleaned from different languages, once again by Bloomsbury. Talking about the recent labour of love, he says: “What makes Indian love poems different and unique from love poems written in other countries and civilisations? Blurring of boundaries of devotional and sensual love is one of the key dimensions of Indian love poetry where divine love transcends sensual love”. Elaborating on this thought, he quotes a verse by Akka Mahadevi, the 12th century poet of Kannada, who expresses love thus: “I am on fire with heartfelt desires, Lord cut through the greed in my heart, show your way out, Lord, white as jasmine”.Indian love poetry is indeed scented with chameli, motia, gulab and many other flowers, seasons, plants and pigments, mountains and rivers, the moon and the stars, winds and rain, thus making it a very part of nature and creation from where it stems. Interestingly, the poems written in Sanskrit outnumber the poems written in all the other languages of the subcontinent. And erotica and love are at their best is to be found in the Sanskrit poems. Kalidasa of the Meghdoot fame is one of the greatest apostles of love that ranges from the physical to the spiritual and Abhay translates his few delicious lines, thus: Craving sweet nectar, you kissed a freshly bloomed mango bud once, could you forget her bee, burying yourself in a lotus?The range of this anthology covers many centuries, many languages, many poets: all strung together in the beads of love. Many cherished poems spring out like flowers from the pages as sweet remembrance or a tug at the heart, be it Punjabi poet Amrita Pritam’s final love poem to her lover Imroz: I will meet you yet again. One of Kamla Das’s creations too finds its place in the anthology, in which she describes love as a losing battle: How can my love hold him when the other, Flaunts a gaudy lust and its lioness, To his beast? Men are worthless, to trap them, Use the cheapest bait of all but never Love, which in a woman must mean tears, And a silence in the blood.A large number of poems by contemporary poets are included in the volume and many of them for very good reading, more so in times when love is often lost in the hubbub of much else. The well-known poets in this section include Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, Ranjit Hoskote, AJ Thomas, Sudeep Sen, Nabina Das, Mamang Dai, Rochelle Potkar and Arundhathi Subramniam, of course, who says in her delightful poem Shorthand: The body speaks shorthand, coded yet blazingly simple, To hold each other all night, is all we want, and still we sit apart, tell stories, not trusting the only art, that matters right now — stenography.In shorthand: Here is a book which one would like to linger over slowly taking one poem at a time and savour the different textures, words and thoughts that lead to the many-splendoured thing called love. Of course, the summing up is done by the ghazal of the inimitable Mirza Ghalib, Hazaron khwaishein aisi: Thousands of desires, each one could have emptied my breath, So many of my wishes came through but in the end, so few!nirudutt@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-love-beneath-the-gentle-shade-of-the-chameli/story-dxbTfBJ8jdjPuuDtBtRZXN.html
22-11-2020||Delhi||Door-to-door survey: Volunteers complain of residents misbehaving, RWAs say they weren’t consulted||Several volunteers carrying out the door-to-door Covid-19 survey in Delhi on Saturday said residents in a few localities “misbehaved” with them and did not answer their queries, prompting residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to say that there was a lack of awareness about the survey and many volunteers were not carrying any identity proof or authorisation.The Delhi government on Friday started the door-to-door survey to screen people for Covid-19, encourage more testing, and to ascertain the number of high-risk individuals. The survey is expected to cover around 5.8 million people – more than one-fourth of Delhi’s total population of around 20 million.Also Read | ‘Covid-19 biggest challenge since World War 2’: PM Modi at G20 summitOn Day 2, the survey work was hit as volunteers faced problems of cooperation and mistrust. A volunteer, requesting anonymity, said residents of Greater Kailash-1 (GK-1) asked for proof that she was part of the survey -- she said she was not allowed to enter several households. “The government has not issued any identity card or document proof for the survey work. We were asked to produce one before entering any block but we could not. We had to complete 30 households on Tuesday but because of resistance from residents we could cover only 10 by 4pm,” she said.Around 9,500 teams of health officials and civic agency employees, other government employees, civil defence volunteers (CDVs), home guards, and government school teachers, are conducting the survey. Rajiv Kakria, member, RWA in GK-1, said, “How would anyone let a stranger in or respond to their queries relating to family details and medical history without them showing any identity proof or authorisation letter? I got calls from residents about the activity happening in the area. I then contacted a few government officials who assured us that the survey was government approved. It took a lot of time to resolve the issue.”But in south Delhi’s Navjeevan Vihar, the local RWA said it had received a communication from the district magistrate’s office regarding the survey a day before and they circulated the message to all residents. “We have requested the DM’s office to issue a letter or some form of ID to volunteers,” said Ruby Makhija, secretary, Navjeevan Vihar RWA. District officials, however, said they are involving resident bodies. A senior district official said, “On, Thursday SDMs held a video conferencing with the prominent RWAs, requesting their cooperation.”Sunil Kumar, a government school teacher conducting the survey work in localities around Rajauri Garden, said that the process went smooth for him on Saturday. “I did not encounter any misbehaviour. There are some people who are not cooperating but we are trying to convince them. The process would be smoother if we had some authorisation document with us,” he said. “The survey is going smoothly. We are monitoring day-to-day developments. We have sought cooperation from RWAs and other stakeholders and the response has been good,” said Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/door-to-door-survey-volunteers-complain-of-residents-misbehaving-rwas-say-they-weren-t-consulted/story-wUqVHeddrzIQNnuVaTaN6J.html

Officials said they received information that he would be visiting his parents’ home there for two days, following which a team from Bhondsi jail arrived and arrested him on Tuesday.Harinder Singh, superintendent of Bhondsi jail, said that Sameer was sentenced to 10 years in prison by a district court in 2009. He was granted parole of four weeks in August 2018 and had to report back in September 2018. “We have informed the police and they are investigating whether he committed more crimes during his parole,” he said.Singh said Sameer was involved in 17 cases of robbery, snatching, attempt to murder, Arms Act and theft at Alwar in Rajasthan, Rewari, Nuh and in eight police stations of Gurugram. He and his gang would target areas such as Sector 29, Sector 40, DLF Phase 2, Sohna Road and Civil Lines.Officials said this was the first time in Haryana that jail authorities arrested an absconding inmate despite a case being registered at a police station after an inmate failed to honour their parole condition. Sameer was booked under was Section 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sohna police station.Singh said they had sent teams in plainclothes to Palwal on Tuesday. “He was sitting with his family when the team reached his home. He tried to flee but was caught by Mohammad Sazeed, deputy superintendent, and Shiv Kumar, assistant superintendent of prisons. The family members tried to help him but we had managed to get them off,” he said.Parole is the conditional release of prisoners before they complete their sentence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-who-jumped-parole-two-years-ago-caught-while-visiting-parents/story-5BonUyKXQpFmbkfSWgIGgP.html

22-11-2020||World||Pakistan minister deletes tweet containing Macron Nazi jibe||A Pakistani minister on Sunday withdrew comments she made earlier that President Emmanuel Macron was treating Muslims like Nazis had treated Jews in World War Two.France’s foreign minister had demanded Pakistan authorities withdraw the comments posted on Twitter by Pakistan’s Federal Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari.She posted the remarks following a clash between Pakistan and France over the publication of images of the Prophet Mohammad by a French magazine. The images have sparked anger and protests in the Muslim world, especially in Pakistan.“Macron is doing to Muslims what the Nazis did to the Jews - Muslim children will get ID numbers (other children won’t) just as Jews were forced to wear the yellow star on their clothing for identification,” Mazari had said in a tweet linking to an online article.The article was however amended earlier on Sunday to reflect the fact that the idea, if implemented, would be applied to all children in France and not just to Muslim children.In a follow-up tweet on Sunday, Mazari initially doubled down on her claims following a condemnation by France’s foreign ministry late on Saturday, which described them as “blatant lies, imbued with an ideology of hatred and violence.”Later on Sunday, however, Mazari tweeted: “The article I had cited has been corrected by the relevant publication, I have also deleted my tweet on the same.”She said she had been alerted to the correction by the French ambassador to Pakistan.Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had told RTL radio the comments were unacceptable and should be withdrawn from Twitter, but said he was remaining prudent because some media had been taken advantage of and had since clarified their articles.Pakistan’s parliament at the end of October passed a resolution urging the government to recall its envoy from Paris, accusing Macron of “hate-mongering” against Muslims.Macron had paid tribute to a French history teacher who was beheaded by an 18-year-old man of Chechen origin for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in a class on freedom of speech.French officials have said the beheading was an assault on the core French value of freedom of expression.After satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo re-published the cartoons in September, Macron defended secularism, saying the freedom of belief went hand in hand with freedom of expression including the right to blaspheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-minister-deletes-tweet-containing-macron-nazi-jibe/story-gyRtW6D9phMtD5rb4wgP6H.html

In his address to the rally, PPP chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari predicted that the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan would be falling in January.Earlier on Sunday, Khan accused the PDM leaders of “playing reckless politics with people’s safety”. He tweeted that “the same PDM members who had wanted a strict lockdown and criticised me earlier [are] now playing reckless politics with people’s safety”.He added, “They are even defying court orders and holding a jalsa (rally) when cases are rising dramatically.” The opposition parties insist that they would observe safety precautions, and alleged that the government’s intentions to stop their rally was entirely political.Information minister Shibli Faraz said that if Covid cases rose in Peshawar in the coming days, the government would register an FIR against PDM leaders.In reply to the government’s insistence that the PDM postpone its rally, the joint leader of the opposition movement, Maulana Fazlur Rehman said that the Imran Khan government was a ‘big corona’ itself .“This government is the representative of a stolen mandate. It is not the representative of the people,” said Rehman, while addressing a press conference in Peshawar.Speaking of the government’s warnings against holding rallies, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) leader said that they found no other excuse, so started raising a hue and cry about the spread of coronavirus.Besides Rahman and Bilawal, the rally was addressed by PML-N vice-president Maryam Nawaz, but not by former PM and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, who addressed the previous PDM rally from London via a video link, apparently due to severe kidney pain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-oppn-alliance-holds-massive-rally-despite-govt-refusing-permission/story-GigAzmAqVjxcwTaPU6BSdP.html
22-11-2020||World||Pompeo touts Iran policy in Gulf ahead of Biden presidency||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday defended his tour of Gulf Arab states and the Trump administration’s continued efforts to squeeze Iran, even as a new US administration led by Joe Biden prepares to enter the White House in January.Although Pompeo has not taken questions from US-based reporters traveling with him over the past 10 days, he sat down with the Saudi-owned broadcaster Al-Arabiya in Dubai for brief televised remarks Sunday.“Our policies don’t change. Our duty doesn’t change. My responsibilities don’t change,” he said. “I still have an obligation — every hour, every minute — to defend the American people and to keep them foremost in our efforts, and we’ll do that. We’ll do that to the very last minute.” In what was likely his final tour of the Persian Gulf as secretary of state, he touted the Trump administration’s Mideast strategy that focused on Iran as “the central threat inside the region” and for a maximum pressure campaign that hampered Iran’s ability to support militias in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria.“It’ll be our policy until our time is complete,” he said, stopping short of saying when he’d cease work as the top U.S. diplomat.President Donald Trump has refused to concede to Biden, despite the Trump campaign’s futile efforts to block the certification of votes in various states.The Trump administration is attempting to ramp up pressure on Iran before Biden takes office as president. Biden has said he wants to return to rapprochement with Iran. Analysts say Biden is expected to be more willing to engage the Iranians in order to avoid major escalation, although he’s likely to press Tehran on its missile program and not just its nuclear program.Trump is viewed favorably by Gulf heavyweights Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for pulling the U.S out of a nuclear accord with Iran and reimposing sweeping sanctions that have drained Iran of vital oil revenue.Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia late Sunday to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before heading back to Washington.His tour also included stops in France, Turkey and Israel, including an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank and a museum that honors Christian Zionists.Trump was recently talked back from moving ahead with a military strike on Iran’s main nuclear site by advisors who included Pompeo, according to a New York Times report.When asked about this, a State Department official traveling with Pompeo told reporters that “all options are on the table” and that the Trump administration “will continue to pursue its policies until it’s not in office anymore.” Pompeo started his Gulf tour in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi early Saturday, meeting the emirate’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, who’s seen as the day-to-day ruler and the powerful figure behind the country’s major policy decisions.The State Department said they discussed the progress of the UAE’s decision to normalize ties with Israel — a move that was followed by Bahrain and Sudan.They also discussed “security cooperation and countering Iran’s malign influence in the region, as well as that of China,” the U.S. statement said.Also Read | US hits Iran with new sanctions as Pompeo defends strategyPompeo “also underscored the importance of Gulf unity.” The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt have largely balked at U.S. efforts to reconcile with Qatar, which they accuse of sponsoring terrorism and backing violent Islamist groups across the region.The quartet cut ties with Qatar in mid-2017 and have demanded the gas-rich Arab state shutter its flagship Al Jazeera news network among other demands, which Qatar has rejected outright, along with the accusations.Pompeo departed Abu Dhabi for Qatar on Saturday, although there are no direct commercial flights due to the stalemate.He had lunch with the ruler, Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and met with Qatar’s foreign minister. The State Department said Pompeo discussed regional issues, and “the importance of a united Gulf to stand against the Iranian regime’s destabilizing activity, and the risk to the region presented by China.” Qatar, however, has warm ties with Iran. The two countries also share a massive underwater gas field in the Persian Gulf.While in Qatar, Pompeo additionally met with representatives of the Afghan government and Taliban, where the warring sides are holding talks about the future of the country.Despite a sharp rise in violence this year, Washington plans to withdraw an estimated 2,500 troops before the middle of January, leaving about 2,000 soldiers in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-touts-iran-policy-in-gulf-ahead-of-biden-presidency/story-0knSoOttL07W9qsvFcEjsO.html
22-11-2020||World||US expects to start Covid-19 vaccination program in early December: Official||The United States expects to kick off a Covid-19 vaccination program in early December, the head of the government’s Covid-19 vaccine effort said on Sunday.Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser for Operation Warp Speed, a program to facilitate and accelerate vaccination effort, told CNN that the government’s plan is to ship vaccines to the immunisation sites within 24 hours of emergency use authorisation by Food and Drug Administration (FDA).According to US media reports, FDA vaccine advisors have scheduled a meeting from December 8-10 to discuss approval after Pfizer and Moderna announced that their vaccine candidates are 95 per cent effective.Also Read | Covid-19 vaccine may need ‘emergency authorisation’Slaoui said that he expects companies to ship the vaccines on the second day of the approval. Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE have submitted to FDA for emergency use authorisation after announcing that the final efficacy analysis of its vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, undergoing phase 3 trial met all of the study’s primary efficacy endpoints. In a video shared on Friday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said that the request for emergency use authorisation for the Covid-19 vaccine is now in the FDA’s hands.“This is a historic day, a historic day for science and for all of us. It took just 248 days to get from the day we announced our plans to collaborate with BioNTech to our FDA submission day,” he added.The Phase 3 trial of Pfizer’s vaccine candidate began on July 27 and as of November 13, as many as 41,135 volunteers have received its second dose. BNT162b2 is an mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate, the same technology used by Moderna to come up with its mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate. Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE expect to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.“We have operated at extraordinary speed in our clinical development program, from concept to regulatory filing, while always maintaining our focus on safety,” said Bourla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expects-to-start-covid-19-vaccination-program-in-early-december-official/story-kqQ7AwZT6FpYr1yiI7ItxH.html
22-11-2020||World||Covid-19: Prepare for economic shock, warns Rishi Sunak||Multi-billion-pound borrowing and steep decline in national income during the Covid-19 pandemic has set the stage for the UK facing “economic shock”, chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Sunday, as Britons remained anxious over meeting families during Christmas.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a ‘Covid winter plan’ to be followed during Christmas on Monday. The current lockdown in England is set to end on December 2, but caution over easing by experts has prompted continuing curbs during the Christmas period.Sunak, whose political stock has risen during the pandemic after he extended billions of pounds for furlough, grants to the self-employed and subsidies to businesses, indicated that income tax would need to rise next year. Pandemic-related borrowing has already reached nearly £250 billion.He wrote in The Sunday Times: “People will see the scale of the economic shock laid bare. We can see the data every month, and obviously the shock that our economy is facing at the moment is significant.”“Once we get through (the crisis) we’ll have to figure out what the best way of returning to sustainable public finances is. I’m hopeful that by the spring, with positive news on both mass testing and vaccines, we can start to look forward.”Sunak is due to present the annual Spending Review in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Besides the debilitating economic impact of Covid-19, the UK also faces a hit from January 1, when the Brexit process is completed and the UK moves out of the EU.The three-tier alert system before lockdown imposed earlier this month is expected to be strengthened with more curbs at each level, following criticism that the system was not effective enough. The revised system will be in place from December 3.A prime minister’s spokeswoman said: “Everyone’s efforts during the current national restrictions have helped bring the virus back under control, slowed its spread and eased pressures on the National Health Service.”“But the prime minister and his scientific advisers are clear the virus is still present - and without regional restrictions it could quickly run out of control again before vaccines and mass testing have had an effect. That would put in jeopardy the progress the country has made, and once again risk intolerable pressure on the NHS.”As of Saturday evening, there were 19,875 new cases and 341 deaths in the last 24 hours across the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-prepare-for-economic-shock-warns-rishi-sunak/story-8JG4rGao2u5eGaoxTIOpOO.html
22-11-2020||World||From India to Brazil: Astra-Oxford shot is key to escaping pandemic for many nations||Trial successes from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. have buoyed hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine is coming soon. But much of the world, outside of rich nations like the U.S., is counting on another company’s shot to escape the crisis.Findings from the final stage of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine studies are due to be released shortly, and the stakes for lower- and middle-income nations are immense. The shot developed with the University of Oxford accounts for more than 40% of the supplies going to those countries, based on deals tracked by London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.The Astra vaccine costs a fraction of the price set by Pfizer and will be manufactured in multiple countries, from India to Brazil. It should be easier to deploy far and wide than other shots that need to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures. But if the U.K. partners can’t match the lofty efficacy levels Pfizer and Moderna delivered or roll out their inoculation quickly, the pandemic might continue spreading death and disease in countries relying on it.Also Watch: PM Modi hold review meeting to discuss India’s vaccine strategy “There’s a lot riding on the Astra vaccine,” said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. For lower-income countries, “it’s huge.”Pfizer applied Friday for an emergency use authorization in the U.S., and may begin the rollout in mid-December. While wealthy nations are in a position to receive the first supplies of the Pfizer and Moderna shots thanks to significant quantities they’ve snapped up in advance, most regions are depending heavily on companies following the front-runners, especially AstraZeneca, Novavax Inc. and Johnson & Johnson. Supplies will likely struggle to meet demand in the months after vaccines arrive, raising concerns about global access.Also Read | Sputnik V priced lower than Pfizer and Moderna vaccineGreater Population“The vast majority of the global population live in low- and middle-income countries,” said Mark Eccleston-Turner, a law and infectious disease specialist at Keele University in England. “It’s not just a problem for people over there, far away from us. This is a problem for most people in the world.”A global program called Covax has made strides in an ambitious effort to deploy future vaccines equitably around the world, getting dozens of countries to join and securing deals for 700 million doses so far.AstraZeneca reached an agreement to supply the initiative, while a collaboration including the Serum Institute of India agreed to accelerate the production of Astra or Novavax shots for low- and middle-income nations, priced at a maximum of $3 per dose, with an option to secure more. A Covax pact with Sanofi and partner GlaxoSmithKline Plc followed last month.The program, led by the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, expects more deals in the coming weeks. Pfizer and BioNTech, along with Moderna, remain in talks with Covax.AstraZeneca has easily been the most active in reaching supply accords. Of all the volumes committed globally, almost a third -- about 3.2 billion doses -- are set to come from the U.K. company, according to Airfinity. More than 50 lower- and middle-income countries would receive Astra and Oxford’s shot, in regions including Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe, along with wealthy governments too, the research group found.If the vaccine is successful, fulfilling that demand won’t be easy. In the U.K., a shortfall in supplies of the shot expected by the end of the year casts doubt on how swiftly AstraZeneca will be able to immunize the public. Yet the company has said it’s confident it can begin supplying hundreds of millions of doses on a rolling basis once it gains approval.Price AdvantageOne of the key factors behind the reliance on the Astra-Oxford vaccine is the initial price. Astra has said it won’t profit during the pandemic and that the vaccine will cost between $4 and $5 a dose, though health advocates worry what that company and others will charge when the crisis is deemed over.The U.S. agreed in July to obtain the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine in a deal that sets the price at $19.50 a dose, or $39 for a two-shot immunization, a level BioNTech said could become a benchmark for developed nations. Moderna said it’s charging $32 to $37 a dose for smaller deals and less for bigger purchases.“Those prices really risk putting vaccines out of reach for a lot of the world,” said Margaret Wurth, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in New York.Astra-Oxford also has advantages beyond cost when it comes to the rollout in low- and middle-income countries. The global scope of manufacturing eases worries about countries restricting exports, and the product should be easier to transport and store, according to Eccleston-Turner, the Keele expert.The jab importantly can be kept at refrigerator temperatures, while those from Pfizer and Moderna, based on novel messenger RNA technology, require freezing for longer-term storage and transport.That’s why so many countries are eagerly awaiting the Astra results and focusing on the next candidates, including those from China. Russia also plans to produce the Sputnik V vaccine in other countries such as India and Brazil.“All of the wealthy countries are now fairly well positioned,” said Moon, the health specialist in Geneva. For developing countries, “it’s not as if they have been sitting back and saying we’ll see what trickles down to us. They’ve been aggressively pursuing what they can with the means at their disposal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-india-to-brazil-astra-oxford-shot-is-key-to-escaping-pandemic-for-many-nations/story-82SuTXAyp7l2FmYcELyMeP.html
22-11-2020||World||The Clean Network: All about US initiative to purge Chinese tech companies from 5G network||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday announced that Brazil, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic are now members of The Clean Network, a Trump administration’s initiative to purge Chinese tech companies from 5G network. The top US diplomat tweeted that “53 Clean Countries, 180 Clean Telcos, and dozens of leading companies” have joined the tide toward trusted 5G network.Pompeo had unveiled the Clean Network initiative in April, calling upon countries and corporations to join the effort to safeguard the privacy and thwart any attempt to obtain most sensitive information by “malign actors”, explicitly naming the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In August, the State Secretary announced the expansion of the Clean Network program which included Clean Carrier, Clean Store, Clean Apps, Clean Cloud, and Clean Cable. The Trump administration has termed some of the largest telecom companies around the globe as “Clean Telcos”, including Jio in India and O2 in the United Kingdom. Also Read | Canadian MPs urge Justin Trudeau government to toughen stand on Chinese ‘intimidation’, Huawei’s roleHere is everything you need to know about the US initiative:Clean Carrier: The State Department said that Chinese carriers pose a danger to US national security. It stated that such companies should not provide international telecommunications services to and from the United States.Clean Store: The program is aimed at removing untrusted applications from US mobile app stores. The department accused Chinese apps of threatening privacy, proliferating viruses, censoring content, and spreading propaganda and disinformation. Clean Apps: The Trump administration called Huawei an arm of China’s “surveillance state”, accusing it of trading on the innovations and reputations of leading US and foreign companies. The initiative is aimed at preventing untrusted Chinese smartphone manufacturers from pre-installing trusted apps or from making available for download on their apps store. Clean Cloud: It is aimed at preventing US citizens’ most sensitive personal information and businesses’ most valuable intellectual property, including COVID-19 vaccine research, from being stored and processed on cloud-based systems accessible to foreign adversaries. The department singled out Chinese companies such as Alibaba, Baidu, China Mobile, China Telecom, and Tencent.Clean Cable: Pompeo said that the administration is working to ensure that the CCP can’t compromise information carried by the undersea cables that connect the US and other countries to the global internet. The state department said that it will work with foreign partners to ensure that undersea cables around the world aren’t similarly subject to compromise.Clean Path: Pompeo announced that the Department of State will begin requiring a Clean Path for all 5G network traffic entering and exiting US diplomatic facilities. The 5G Clean Path is an end-to-end communication path that does not use any transmission, control, computing, or storage equipment from untrusted IT vendors.Later, the US dealt a massive blow to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. by expanding the scope of Foreign Direct Product Rule, which was aimed at preventing Huawei from circumventing US law. The Commerce Department added 38 Huawei affiliates to its Entity List which identifies foreign parties prohibited from receiving certain sensitive technologies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-clean-network-all-about-us-initiative-to-purge-chinese-tech-companies-from-5g-network/story-A4GK6YmkxnPNAb7BMt25MO.html

Russia, accused by U.S. intelligence agencies of intervening in 2016 to help get Trump elected, has been wary of Biden, fearing an increase in sanctions pressure and clashes over human rights.Putin described the Kremlin’s decision not to congratulate Biden as “a formality” with no ulterior motives. When asked if the move could damage U.S.-Russia relations, he said: “there’s nothing to damage, they’re already ruined.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-says-he-s-not-ready-to-recognize-joe-biden-as-us-president/story-agKWCSqxOiluK5hnJLQYWP.html

Two doses are required per person for the Pfizer, Sputnik V and Moderna vaccines. The price of Sputnik V will be much lower,” the official account said.Russia became the first country to register the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine on August 11. Sputnik V was developed by the Gamaleya National Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Russian Healthcare Ministry.On November 11, Russia had said that its vaccine Sputnik V is 92 per cent effective at protecting people from Covid-19 according to the first interim analysis.On November 17, Moderna, in its official statement, had announced that the independent, U.S. NIH-appointed Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273 has informed Moderna that the trial has met the statistical criteria pre-specified in the study protocol for efficacy, with a vaccine efficacy of 94.5%.Similarly, on November 18, Pfizer had said that final results from the late-stage trial of its coronavirus vaccine was found to be 95 per cent effective and had no serious side effects on older people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sputnik-v-priced-lower-than-pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines/story-KenRjLm5mxV1vD5rT3i7oN.html
22-11-2020||World||G20 to back ‘equitable’ access to coronavirus vaccine: Report||G20 leaders will pledge to “spare no effort” in ensuring the equitable distribution of coronavirus vaccines worldwide and reaffirm support for debt-laden poor countries, according to a draft communique seen by AFP Sunday.The leaders also struck a unified tone on supporting “multilateral” trade as well as the global fight against climate change, but the closing document lacks firm details on many of the issues dominating the virtual summit hosted by Riyadh.The two-day gathering that began Saturday comes as international efforts intensify for a large-scale rollout of coronavirus vaccines after a breakthrough in trials, and as EU and other leaders call for G20 nations to plug a $4.5-billion funding shortfall.“We have mobilised resources to address the immediate financing needs in global health to support the research, development, manufacturing and distribution of safe and effective Covid-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines,” the draft document said.“We will spare no effort to ensure their affordable and equitable access for all people, consistent with members’ commitments to incentivise innovation.”The communique offered no details on how the effort will be funded. There could be changes in the final version of the document, which will be released later Sunday by the Saudi hosts.In a comment echoed by other world leaders, French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday the coronavirus crisis was “a test for the G20”, stressing there “will be no effective response to the pandemic unless it is a global response”.G20 nations have contributed more than $21 billion to combat the pandemic, which has infected 56 million people globally and left 1.3 million dead, and injected $11 trillion to “safeguard” the virus-battered world economy, summit organisers said. But the group’s leaders face mounting pressure to help stave off possible credit defaults across developing nations. G20 nations have extended a debt service suspension initiative (DSSI) for developing countries until June next year, but UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pushed for a commitment to extend it until the end of 2021.The draft communique, however, did not offer a firm commitment.G20 finance ministers will examine the recommendation when the IMF and World Bank meet next spring “if the economic and financial situation requires” an extension by another six months, it said.- Closing ranks on climate -On trade, the club of the world’s richest nations also emphasised that supporting a multilateral system “is now as important as ever”.“We strive to realise the goal of a free, fair, inclusive, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable, and stable trade and investment environment, and to keep our markets open,” the communique said.Ahead of the summit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she hoped the US will adopt a more multilateralist stance under the incoming administration of Joe Biden.US President Donald Trump’s robust “America first” trade policy has rankled world leaders. Von der Leyen also added that she expected consensus and a “new momentum from the new US administration” on climate change, and a reversal of Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.Differences within the G20 group surfaced at last year’s summit in the Japanese city of Osaka as the United States demanded the insertion of a separate paragraph on issues such as environmental protection.But under the Saudi chairmanship, G20 leaders projected a unified stance, with the draft communique reiterating support for tackling “pressing” environmental challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-to-back-equitable-access-to-coronavirus-vaccine-report/story-2s7TOXq3ZNByIZylfx0KuM.html

22-11-2020||World||Frequent, rapid testing can curb Covid-19 transmission within weeks: Study||Testing half the population weekly with inexpensive, rapid-turnaround Covid-19 tests can drive the pandemic toward elimination within weeks even if the tests are significantly less sensitive than gold-standard clinical diagnostics, a new study says. The research, published in the journal Science Advances, noted that such a strategy could lead to “personalised stay-at-home orders” without shutting down restaurants, bars, retail stores and schools. According to the scientists, including those from the University of Colorado at Boulder in the US, the sensitivity levels of the different types of Covid-19 tests currently used across the world vary widely. Antigen tests require a relatively high viral load -- about 1,000 times as much virus compared to the PCR test -- to detect an infection, they said. Another test, known as RT-lamp can detect the virus at around 100 times as much virus compared to the PCR, the study noted. The scientists added that the benchmark PCR test requires as little as 5,000 to 10,000 copies of the viral genetic material, RNA, per milliliter of sample -- meaning it can catch the virus very early or very late.“Our big picture finding is that, when it comes to public health, it’s better to have a less sensitive test with results today than a more sensitive one with results tomorrow,” said study lead author Daniel Larremore from the University of Colorado at Boulder in the US. “Rather than telling everyone to stay home so you can be sure that one person who is sick doesn’t spread it, we could give only the contagious people stay-at-home orders so everyone else can go about their lives,” Larremore said.In the study, the scientists assessed whether test sensitivity, frequency, or turnaround time is most important to curb the spread of Covid-19.They analysed available literature on how viral load climbs and falls inside the body during infection, when people tend to experience symptoms, and when they become contagious.Using mathematical modelling the scientists forecasted the impact of screening with different kinds of tests on three hypothetical scenarios -- in 10,000 individuals; in a university-type setting of 20,000 people; and in a city of 8.4 million.They found that when it came to curbing spread, the frequency and turnaround time are much more important than test sensitivity.Citing a hypothetical example, the researchers said in a large city, widespread twice-weekly testing with a rapid, but less sensitive test, reduced the degree of infectiousness of the virus by 80 per cent. But twice-weekly testing with a more sensitive PCR test, which takes up to 48 hours to return results, reduced infectiousness by only 58 per cent, the study noted. When the amount of testing was the same, it said the rapid test always reduced infectiousness better than the slower, more sensitive PCR test.This is because about two-thirds of infected people have no symptoms, and as they await their results, they continue to spread the virus, the scientists explained. “This paper is one of the first to show we should worry less about test sensitivity and, when it comes to public health, prioritise frequency and turnaround,” said study senior author Roy Parker from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the US. The researchers believe the findings demonstrate the power of frequent testing in shortening the pandemic and saving lives.In one scenario, in which four per cent of individuals in a city were already infected, they said rapid testing three out of four people every three days reduced the number ultimately infected by 88 per cent and was “sufficient to drive the epidemic toward extinction within six weeks.” “These rapid tests are contagiousness tests. They are extremely effective in detecting Covid-19 when people are contagious,” said Michael Mina, another co-author of the study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the US.Some rapid tests, he added can return results in 15 minutes while the PCR tests can take several days. “Within a few weeks we could see this outbreak going from huge numbers of cases to very manageable levels,” Mina said.The researchers believe it is time to change the Covid-19 testing strategy from something made available to those with symptoms, to thinking of it as a vital tool for breaking transmission chains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frequent-rapid-testing-can-curb-covid-19-transmission-within-weeks-study/story-0ETqnJyZcYMu7azz5dl77L.html
22-11-2020||World||Boris Johnson to end England’s coronavirus lockdown on December 2||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to end an England-wide lockdown as scheduled on Dec. 2 and will announce a return to regional restrictions as statistics show that coronavirus infections have stabilized.Johnson’s office also confirmed plans to begin a nationwide Covid-19 vaccination program next month, assuming regulators approve a vaccine against the virus. The government also will increase mass testing in an effort to suppress the virus until vaccines can be rolled out.Johnson’s office said late Saturday that the government plans to return to using a three-tiered system of localized restrictions in England, with areas facing different lockdown measures based on the severity of their outbreaks. More communities are expected to be placed in the two highest virus alert categories, it said.The government put England under a four-week lockdown that started Nov. 5. The Cabinet is to discuss the plans Sunday, and the prime minister aims to give Parliament the details on Monday, according to the statement.The U.K. as a whole has the worst virus death toll in Europe, at over 54,700 deaths.Johnson announced the lockdown in England on Oct. 31 after public health officials warned that an exponential rise in new daily coronavirus infections was threatening to overwhelm the National Health Service as the winter flu season approached. The lockdown closed non-essential business like many shops, gyms, bars, restaurants — although takeout was permitted. It also banned most social gatherings but schools remain open.New known cases of Covid-19 have started to drop across the U.K., with the number of positive tests during the past seven days falling 13.8% from the week before. Some 2,861 Covid-related deaths were reported over the last 7-day period, 17 fewer than a week earlier. Still, the infection rate remains high, at 244 cases for every 100,000 people.Health Secretary Matt Hancock told reporters Friday that the lockdown has been successful in slowing the spread of the virus, though he stressed that people needed to keep following the rules to keep cases down.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the government’s deputy chief medical officer, warned that any gains from the November lockdown could be quickly lost to a virus that takes “just seconds” to spread.People should “keep up the pressure on this virus and push down on it as much as we can right to the end of the period (of lockdown),” he said.The government’s scientific advisory group, known as SAGE, is expected to publish reports on Monday showing that Johnson’s earlier three-tiered strategy wasn’t strong enough and recommending tougher restrictions when it returns.Under that system, a “medium” alert level requires restaurants and pubs to close at 10 p.m. and prohibits residents from mixing in groups larger than six. The “high” level prevents people from gathering indoors with anyone not in their household or extended “support bubble.”In areas under a “very high” alert, pubs and bars only can remain open and serve alcohol only if it comes with a hearty meal. People are advised not to travel in or out of those areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-to-end-england-s-coronavirus-lockdown-on-december-2/story-Qfq7fT3pjgiSa4Au8kMi4N.html

Llanos miraculously escaped and sustained only minor injuries. She fell in between two train tracks and narrowly missed the train’s impact as it passed over early morning Thursday.Vemulapati was taken into custody at the scene, police said.The report said Llanos had headphones on and was listening to Bible passages. Witnesses say she was waiting for the train when Vemulapati approached her, appearing to talk to himself. From the footage it appeared that he had timed the shove just as an incoming train was approaching the station and pushed her without saying a word, the report added.“It’s very disturbing. We see him waiting, calculating for the train to approach the station and at the opportune moment he pushed the victim onto the tracks,” Kathleen O’Reilly, NYPD Chief of Transit Capt., said.“She fell fortunately for her between the roll bed and rails, and by the grace of God sustained only minor injuries,” O’Reilly said.After shoving the woman, Vemulapati saw the police approaching and laid down on the platform. Police are saying Vemulapati is emotionally disturbed.Llanos, who was taken to a hospital, sustained minor cuts to her head and body. Her husband was grateful she was able to return to their Sunset Park apartment, saying she “got a new life today.” The NBC report added that the incident marked the second subway push arrest made on Thursday. Another man was taken into custody after police said he pushed a UPS worker onto the tracks at the 42nd Street-Bryant Park Station on Wednesday night. Police said Justin Pena attacked the victim after the man refused to give him money.The incident led the president of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to draw attention to the mental health problems in the city that carry over to subway platforms.“It’s gotta be addressed, and I’m desperate for this mayor or the next to take it on,” MTA President Sarah Feinberg said. “This city has a mental health crisis, we have got folks in this city who desperately need mental health care,” Feinberg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-homeless-man-arrested-for-pushing-woman-onto-subway-tracks-in-front-of-incoming-train/story-QuRSF2aPEabOWT5tyb2kPI.html

It is not the representative of the people,” said Rehman, while addressing a press conference in Peshawar, where a rally in defiance of government warnings is due to held on Sunday by the opposition parties, reported The News International.Speaking of the government’s warnings against holding rallies, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) leader said that they found no other excuse, so started raising a hue and cry about the spread of coronavirus.“This illegitimate government itself is a big corona,” he said.Rehman said that the opposition’s campaign against the government had reached its peak and the organisational structure of the movement is now complete.He further added that it was time for ‘Pakistan’s Trump’ to be removed from office.“A historic rally will take place tomorrow in Peshawar,” vowed the JUI-F leader, and added that the next PDM rally will be held in November 26 in Larkana, which will be hosted by his party.The PDM on Friday had vowed to defy the government ban on its public gathering in Peshawar on Sunday and warned the district administration that the use of force to stop the protesting citizens could spark street battles.While speaking at a joint press conference at the Peshawar Press Club, the representatives of the opposition parties declared that rallies across the country will be held as the PDM planned, until Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government is removed, reported Dawn.This came after the Peshawar deputy commissioner had refused to allow the opposition to hold their rally scheduled for November 22 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, citing COVID-19 concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/opposition-pakistan-democratic-movement-calls-imran-khan-s-pti-govt-illegitimate-big-corona/story-I08VnNhZIMPKNbmweOlUgK.html
22-11-2020||World||Violence erupts in Brazil after Black man beaten to death at Carrefour store||More than 1,000 demonstrators attacked a Carrefour Brasil supermarket in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre on Friday after security guards beat to death a Black man at the store.The killing, which has sparked protests across Brazil, occurred late on Thursday when a store employee called security after the man threatened to attack her, cable news channel GloboNews said, citing the Rio Grande do Sul state military police.Amateur footage of the fatal beating and tributes to the Black victim were published on social media. He was identified in local media by his father as 40-year-old Joao Alberto Silveira Freitas.News website G1 later reported that an initial analysis by the state forensics institute indicated the cause of death could be asphyxiation. In a statement on Friday, the local unit of France’s Carrefour SA said it deeply regretted what it called a brutal death and said it immediately took steps to ensure those responsible were legally punished.It said it would terminate the contract with the security firm, fire the employee in charge of the store at the time of the incident, and close the store as a mark of respect.In a series of tweets in Portuguese on Friday night, the Chairman and CEO of Carrefour, Alexandre Bompard, said that the images posted on social media were “unbearable.”“Internal measures have immediately been implemented by the Carrefour Brazil, notably towards the security company involved. These measures do not go far enough. My values, and the values of Carrefour do not allow for racism and violence,” Bompard said.He called for a complete review of employee and sub-contractors’ training on security, diversity and tolerance values.“I have asked the teams of Carrefour Brazil to fully cooperate with judicial authorities to get to the bottom of this odious action,” he added In Porto Alegre, protesters on Friday afternoon handed out stickers depicting the Carrefour logo stained with blood and called for a boycott of the chain. They held up a banner in Portuguese reading “Black Lives Matter” and signs calling for justice for Beto, a nickname for the victim.The protest turned violent on Friday evening as the demonstrators smashed windows and delivery vehicles in the supermarket’s parking area. A Reuters witness saw police firing teargas at the protesters.In Sao Paulo, dozens of protesters smashed the front windows of a Carrefour store with rocks, pulled off the front doors and stormed the building, spilling products into the aisles before dispersing. In Rio de Janeiro, roughly 200 shouting protesters gathered outside of another Carrefour store location.Nov. 20 is honored in many parts of Brazil as Black Awareness Day. Brazilians like to think of their country as a harmonious ‘racial democracy’ and far-right President Jair Bolsonaro denies the presence of racism. But the influence of slavery, abolished in 1888, is still evident. Black Brazilians are almost three times as likely to be victims of homicide, according to 2019 government data.“The culture of hate and racism needs to be combated at its source and the full weight of the law should be used to punish those that promote hate and racism,” Rodrigo Maia, the speaker of Brazil’s lower house of Congress, wrote in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-erupts-in-brazil-after-black-man-beaten-to-death-at-carrefour-store/story-U3dpaSn9eJzqeiODxee00I.html

If they don’t build the necessary infrastructure, we’ll have a third wave early next year,” said Nabarro, a Briton who campaigned unsuccessfully to become the WHO director general in 2017.Europe briefly enjoyed sinking infection rates that are now surging again: Germany and France on Saturday saw cases rise by 33,000 combined, Switzerland and Austria have thousands of cases daily, while Turkey reported a record 5,532 new infections.Nabarro singled out Switzerland’s move to allow skiing - with masks required in gondolas - as other Alpine nations like Austria have shuttered resorts. Nabarro said Switzerland could reach a “very high level of sicknesses and deaths”. “Once the infection rates sink, and they will sink, then we can be as free as we want,” Nabarro was quoted as saying by the Solothurner Zeitung. “But right now? Should ski resorts open? Under what conditions?” Nabarro lauded the response of Asian countries like South Korea, where infections are now relatively low: “People are fully engaged, they take on behaviours that make it difficult for the virus. They keep their distance, wear masks, isolate when they’re sick, wash hands and surfaces. They protect the most endangered groups.”Nabarro also said Asia did not relax restrictions prematurely. “You must wait until case numbers are low and stay low,” he said. “Europe’s reaction was incomplete.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-covid-envoy-fears-third-wave-calls-europe-response-incomplete/story-c7vMdRddbLWCmxfHwYkS1L.html
22-11-2020||World||Trump skips G20 session on Covid-19 to play golf||US President Donald Trump on Saturday skipped a session of the virtual G20 summit dedicated to discussing pandemic preparedness to play golf at his club outside the capital as the country braced for a new surge in Covid-19 cases after Thanksgiving, a national holiday. He tweet-stormed his unfounded election fraud claims the rest of the day.Trump delivered his main speech virtually at around 8 am local time, according to the daily guidance issued by the White House of his schedule. Shortly after, he was tweeting about the election, and around 10 am, his motorcade was rolling for the Trump National Golf Club in Loudon, Virginia.The outgoing American president spoke of the “need to work together to restore strong economic growth and jobs as we overcome the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a statement issued by the White House about his speech at the virtual summit of G20 leaders hosted by Saudi Arabia.Trump told the world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, of “the aggressive actions and safety measures” taken by his administration and the “pioneer groundbreaking treatments”, vaccines and therapies developed at “record-setting speed”.“It’s been a great honour to work with you, and I look forward to working with you again for a long time,” he told the summit, according to an audio recording of his remarks obtained and reported by UK’s Observer. The White House statement did not contain this remark, paraphrased or otherwise.Nearly every G20 leader has already congratulated President-elect Joe Biden either through public remarks or in phone conversations — Modi has done both, and is among the handful of world leaders to have spoken to Biden.These remarks reflected American president’s current priorities, along with his decision to skip the session on pandemic preparedness even as the US was the hardest hit in the world, with more than 12 million confirmed infections and 255,000 deaths, nearly a fifth of all the cases and mortalities globally.“I was at the Virtual G-20 meeting early this morning and the biggest subject was Covid,” he noted in a tweet later. He did not say why he did not stay, then, for the preparedness session.President Trump’s is focused instead on reversing his election defeat to Biden. He and his Republican allies have filed more than 30 lawsuits, without any success. His efforts suffered another setback on Saturday when a federal judge in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that carried President-elect Biden across the 270 mark, threw out a Trump campaign lawsuit saying it was “without merit”.The Trump campaign said the dismissal was an opportunity to approach the Supreme Court now.Some Republicans are running out of patience, though the party is mostly behind him. Pat Toomey, a Republican senator from Pennsylvania, called for Trump to accept the election outcome shortly after the court ruling and said, “President Trump has exhausted all plausible legal options to challenge the result of the presidential race in Pennsylvania. ... I congratulate President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on their victory.”Liz Cheney, a member of the House Republican leadership, also urged Trump to give up. “If the president cannot prove these claims (of election fraud) or demonstrate that they would change the election result, he should fulfil his oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States by respecting the sanctity of our electoral process,”Trump’s allies, meanwhile, pressed ahead with their efforts to block the certification of votes in Michigan, another key state he lost.Biden is projected to win the election 306-232, but Trump has refused to concede and sought to overturn the outcome of the election through unfounded allegations of fraud and irregularities and wild conspiracy theories suggesting among other things the involvement of Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan leader who died in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-skips-g20-session-on-covid-19-to-play-golf/story-DmGu2LACUKoemb8P7FsFEO.html

Trump did not participate.He is due to join another session of the G20 on Sunday morning, according to the White House schedule. But that is likely the last time Trump will meet a summit setting with other world leaders as the end of his presidency nears.CNN reported that Trump’s influence on the global stage is at a low ebb after losing the election. Most of the other G20 leaders have congratulated President-elect Joe Biden on his victory, with a notable exception in Russian President Vladimir Putin.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that Trump in his remarks “discussed with other world leaders the need to work together to restore strong economic growth and jobs as we overcome the Covid-19 pandemic.”“During his remarks, President Trump highlighted how the United States marshalled every resource at its disposal to respond to the crisis, as well as the unprecedented economic recovery of the United States on a foundation of tax and regulatory cuts, energy independence, and fair trade deals,” the spokeswoman said in a statement.“He spoke about the aggressive actions and safety measures the United States took to protect the vulnerable, pioneer groundbreaking treatments, and develop vaccines and therapies at record-setting speed, which will save millions of lives. President Trump also reaffirmed the importance of the G20 working together for future economic growth and prosperity,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-skips-g20-session-on-pandemic-to-visit-golf-club/story-tLwT4LLm3IEf8tMp2KTZuJ.html

After a fierce three-year fight backed by a US-led military coalition, Iraq declared IS defeated in late 2017.The coalition has significantly drawn down its troops this year. Also Read: Pentagon to cut troop levels to 2,500 in Iraq, AfghanistanIS’ sleeper cells have continued to wage hit-and-run attacks on security forces and state infrastructure, particularly in desert areas where troops are stretched thin.Attacks with high tolls and close to the capital have been rare, however.The latest attacks come as the United States announced that it will withdraw another 500 troops, reducing its deployment to 2,500 soldiers. Most other countries’ contributing forces to the coalition have pulled out since the coronavirus pandemic hit.However, the Iraqi government has “clearly indicated it wants to maintain its partnership with the United States and coalition forces as we continue to finish the fight against ISIS”, the US Middle East commander said Thursday, using another acronym for the jihadist group.General Kenneth McKenzie cited estimates that IS still has a body of 10,000 supporters in the Iraq-Syria region and remains a real threat.“The progress of the Iraqi Security Forces has allowed the United States to reduce force posture in Iraq,” he said.But US and coalition forces have to remain to help prevent IS from reconstituting as a cohesive group able to plot major attacks, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/9-iraqi-security-personnel-civilians-dead-in-is-ambush-police/story-dtlzM9L2AxGOM7IQRGQOOM.html
22-11-2020||World||Explorers livestream footage from Earth’s deepest underwater valley||China livestreamed footage of its new manned submersible parked at the bottom of the Mariana Trench on Friday, part of a historic mission into the deepest underwater valley on the planet.The “Fendouzhe”, or “Striver”, descended more than 10,000 metres into the submarine trench in the western Pacific Ocean with three researchers on board, state broadcaster CCTV said.Only a handful of people have ever visited the bottom of the Mariana Trench, a crescent-shaped depression in the Earth’s crust that is deeper than Mount Everest is high and more than 2,550 kilometres long.The first explorers visited the trench in 1960 on a brief expedition, after which there had been no missions until Hollywood director James Cameron made the first solo trip to the bottom in 2012. Cameron described a “desolate” and “alien” environment.Video footage shot and relayed by a deep-sea camera this week showed the green-and-white Chinese submersible moving through dark water surrounded by clouds of sediment as it slowly touched down on the seabed.Fendouzhe, which has made multiple dives in recent days, had earlier this month set a national record of 10,909 metres for manned deep-sea diving after landing in the deepest known point of the trench, Challenger Deep, just shy of the 10,927-metre world record set by an American explorer in 2019.The mission on November 10 beamed up the world’s first live video from Challenger Deep.The submersible, equipped with robotic arms to collect biological samples and sonar “eyes” that use sound waves to identify surrounding objects, is making repeated dives to test its capabilities. It is carrying so much equipment that engineers added a bulbous forehead-shaped protrusion containing buoyant materials to the vessel to help maintain its balance.Fendouzhe, China’s third deep-sea manned submersible, is observing “the many species and the distribution of living things on the seabed”, scientists on board told CCTV.The water pressure at the bottom of the trench is a crushing eight tons per square inch, around a thousand times the atmospheric pressure at sea level, yet scientists have found the dark, frigid waters of the trench to be teeming with life. The Chinese researchers will collect specimens for their work, CCTV said.Previous studies have found thriving communities of single-cell organisms surviving on organic waste that had settled on the ocean floor, but very few large animals. The mission will also conduct research on “deep-sea materials,” CCTV said, as China pushes ahead in deep-sea mining.Beijing this month set up a joint training and research centre with the International Seabed Authority, which will train professionals on deep-sea technology as well as conducting research on mining for valuable minerals at the bottom of the ocean.Fendouzhe is expected to set standards for China’s future deep-sea vessels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explorers-livestream-footage-from-earth-s-deepest-underwater-valley/story-GhnNy5LzDyxOH8xDayck1K.html
22-11-2020||World||UK’s Prince Harry welcomes Princess Diana interview inquiry||Britain’s Prince Harry has joined his brother William in welcoming a new investigation into how the BBC secured a famous and controversial 1995 interview with their mother Princess Diana, with a source describing it as a “drive for truth”.A former Supreme Court justice is leading a new inquiry into how the broadcaster obtained the interview and whether executives covered up any wrongdoing after accusations that the late princess was tricked into taking part. Prince William, the second in line to the throne, said earlier this week that the investigation was a step in the right direction and a source close to Harry said on Saturday that the prince was getting regular updates. The person familiar with the situation also questioned some British media reports which asked why Harry, living in California with his wife Meghan and son Archie, had not joined his brother in welcoming the investigation earlier.“Sadly, some people are not just seeing this as a drive for truth, but also trying to use this as an opportunity to try to drive a wedge between the brothers,” the person said.Diana’s Panorama interview with Martin Bashir was watched by more than 20 million viewers in Britain and became one of the defining moments of her failed marriage to Prince Charles. It included an admission of an affair and the line that there “were three of us in this marriage”, referring to Charles’ relationship with his now second wife, Camilla Parker-Bowles. This month, Diana’s brother Charles Spencer said the BBC had failed to apologise for what he said were forged documents and “other deceit” which led him to introduce Diana to Bashir.The BBC has said the broadcaster is determined to get to the truth about Spencer’s assertions and has appointed John Dyson, one of the country’s most senior retired judges, to lead the inquiry. Bashir has made no public comment on the situation and the corporation says the journalist, who gained global renown from the interview, is currently on sick leave, recovering from heart surgery and from contracting Covid-19. Harry and Meghan moved to California after stepping back from royal duties in January and have signed a multi-year production deal with Netflix as part of their plans to be more financially independent.The source added that the couple had decided to share their property in England, Frogmore Cottage, with his cousin Eugenie but would stay there when they visit the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-prince-harry-welcomes-princess-diana-interview-inquiry/story-xb9U9Mcnxee3zxkbAglbON.html
22-11-2020||World||Covid-19 cases in California climb to a record as state curfew begins||California added 15,442 new coronavirus cases, hitting a new high as the state’s evening curfew kicks in Saturday night.The cases topped Friday’s record of 13,005 infections, bringing the total to almost 1.1 million. The number of deaths increased by 86 to 18,643, state data showed. The increased patient load left California’s hospitals with just 1,921 intensive-case unit beds available, near the low in July.A 10 pm to 5 am curfew will be imposed in most counties for a month to ease the rate of infection, affecting areas that encompass 37 million people, or 94% of the population.Only 10 countries globally have more cases than California, where the number of cases now exceeds those in Mexico and Germany, which have been hot spots for the pandemic.Also Read | Moderna to charge $25-$37 for Covid-19 vaccine, CEO tells paperGovernor Gavin Newsom said earlier in the week that the curfew will stop nonessential work and gatherings to “flatten the curve again,” reflecting growing alarm among state officials as the third wave of coronavirus infections to hit the state gathers momentum.The jump in California cases come as infections across the U.S. have surpassed 12 million, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended against all travel on cruise ships, citing the high risk of infection.Officials have also urged residents to avoid travel and scale back Thanksgiving gatherings -- or cancel them altogether. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted Saturday to remind residents to celebrate virtually or only with members of the same household.The California order’s impact on businesses will be limited, and appears intended largely to prevent late-night socializing. Restaurants will need to close outdoor dining by 10 p.m., but they can continue offering takeout afterward. People working overnight shifts in factories, warehouses or logistics jobs won’t be affected. Grocery stores open 24 hours will be able to stay that way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-in-california-climb-to-a-record-as-state-curfew-begins/story-uz67cvKVIfk5usaBSLudrO.html

We want to deliver to Europe and are in constructive talks,” Bancel told WamS, adding it was just a “matter of days” until a contract would be ready.Moderna has said its experimental vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing Covid-19, based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial, becoming the second developer to report results that far exceeded expectations after Pfizer and its partner BioNTech.The EU has been in talks with Moderna for its experimental Covid-19 vaccine at least since July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-to-charge-25-37-for-covid-19-vaccine-ceo-tells-paper/story-oCRSSMW2vRE5VfgnEs2wJP.html
22-11-2020||World||Joe Biden poised to name cabinet||US President-elect Joe Biden is moving quickly to fill out his administration and could name top leaders for his cabinet as early as next week as President Donald Trump’s attempts to question the election outcome continue to fail. Biden has already decided on who will lead the treasury department. That pick, along with his nominee for secretary of state, may be announced before Thanksgiving, which falls on November 26.Indian American Mala Adiga was named on Friday as policy director to Jill Biden, the incoming first lady. She is a lawyer who earlier served in the departments of state and justice in the Obama administration, and had worked on the 2008 Obama-Biden campaign.Vivek Murthy, another Indian American, is among leading contenders for secretary of health and human services. Georgia on Friday certified Biden as the winner in the state and Michigan Republicans declared they had seen nothing so far to warrant reversing the outcome in their state after a meeting with Trump.The Trump campaign can still seek a recount of the Georgia votes under the state’s law, but its Republican leaders appear in no mood to indulge his efforts to question the election outcome with nothing more than stray instances of irregularities.“We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan and, as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan’s electors, just as we have said throughout this election,” Lee Chatfield, Speaker of the Republican-controlled state House and Mike Shirkey, leader of the Republican-controlled Senate, said in a joint statement after their meeting with Trump at the White House. The meeting was unprecedented in itself and seen as a sign of the president’s growing desperation. In his first public appearance in days - a briefing on pricing of medicines-- Trump falsely claimed once again he had won, but took no questions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-poised-to-name-cabinet/story-wuX5TZ8JuwdcaoEpcAWO8I.html

In a statement on its Telegram channels, IS said 28 Katyusha rockets fired by “soldiers of the caliphate” hit Kabul’s heavily fortified Green Zone that houses “the presidential palace, embassies of Crusader states, and the headquarters of Afghan forces”.  Mortar shells slammed into different parts of the Afghan capital on Saturday, also wounding 31 others, an Afghan official said. The shells were fired from two cars, interior ministry spokesperson Tariq Arian said. At least one rocket landed in the Iranian embassy compound.Violence in Afghanistan has spiked in recent months with increasingly horrific attacks often claimed by the Islamic State group affiliate. The Taliban have also continued near daily assaults on beleaguered Afghan government forces.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo met negotiators from the Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha on Saturday, amid signs of progress in their talks as Washington speeds up its withdrawal.“I would be most interested in getting your thoughts on how we can increase the probability of a successful outcome”, Pompeo said as he met the Afghan government side, noting the shared interest in such a scenario.The Afghan government and the Taliban are “very close” to breaking a deadlock in peace talks, a senior Afghan official said Saturday, adding that the US troops military presence was still necessary.“We are close, we are very close,“ said Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rocket-attack-in-kabul-by-islamic-state-kills-8/story-CpQbch646G01i5Qdo1lRyI.html

He has been “quarantining at his cabin since the result,” a spokesman said. Trump on Saturday tweeted that his son was doing “very well”. “My son Donald is doing very well. Thank you!” he posted after the disclosure of the diagnosis.Andrew Giuliani, the son of the president’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, also said he tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. The news came as the US reached a record for daily cases of more than 195,000.  China used the Covid-19 crisis for strategic gains across the Indo-Pacific region, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) has said in a report which noted the pandemic was replete with “significant” geopolitical ramifications.China’s increasingly active drive and India’s rivalry with Pakistan will continue to dominate the regional security environment when the pandemic dies down, said Strategic Survey 2020: The Annual Assessment of Geopolitics, which was launched virtually on Friday.“Competition intensified in the region. Beijing seemed steadily more intent on asserting strategic primacy in its maritime littoral. The US government…saw evidence that China was taking advantage of other governments’ preoccupation with the Covid-19 pandemic to gain strategic advantage throughout what the US, its allies and other states including India and Indonesia increasingly referred to as the Indo-Pacific region”, it said.Europe is risking a third virus wave early next year unless it takes more action now, according to David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s special envoy on Covid-19 preparedness and response.His comments came as Germany added nearly 23,000 new coronavirus infections as of Saturday morning, lifting the total above 900,000. Germany is already in a partial lockdown that has closed museums, bars and restaurants but kept schools and most shops open. That may be extended well into next month as Europe’s biggest economy seeks to regain control over the spread of the coronavirus before people head home for the holidays, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.The UK government, meanwhile, is preparing to relax its lockdown to allow “several” families to form a bubble for up to a week over the Christmas period, the Telegraph said on Saturday.Russia had 467 deaths from Covid-19 in the past day, a new daily record, the government’s virus response centre said on Saturday. There were also 24,822 new coronavirus cases in Russia, which was also a daily recordOntario, Canada’s largest province, ordered a lockdown in Toronto and one of its suburbs from Monday, a declaration that forces shopping malls, restaurants and other businesses to close their doors to slow a second wave.

22-11-2020||World||World Bank warns G20 against doing too little to tackle debt problems||World Bank President David Malpass on Saturday warned G20 leaders that failing to provide more permanent debt relief to some countries now could lead to increased poverty and a repeat of the disorderly defaults seen in the 1980s.Malpass said he was pleased by progress made by the Group of 20 major economies on increasing debt transparency and providing debt relief to the poorest countries, but more was needed.“Debt reduction and transparency will enable productive investment, a key to achieving an earlier, stronger and more lasting recovery,” Malpass told G20 leaders during a videoconference meeting. “We need to guard against doing too little now, and then suffering disorderly defaults and repeated debt restructurings as in the 1980s,” he said.The so-called ‘lost decade’ of the 1980s saw many highly indebted countries in Latin America and elsewhere unable to pay their debts, delaying growth and efforts to reduce poverty. Malpass, who began pushing for debt relief early in the Covid-19 crisis, warned that debt challenges were becoming more frequent, including in Chad, Angola, Ethiopia and Zambia, and failure to provide “more permanent debt relief” left a bleak outlook for reducing poverty.G20 leaders are poised to formally endorse extension of a temporary freeze in official bilateral debt payments by the poorest countries, and adoption of a common framework for debt restructuring in the future.Some countries, including China, have remained reluctant to embrace the need for debt cancellation, although top economists say that will likely be needed in some cases. Private sector creditors have also failed to join in, despite repeated calls by G20 leaders, civil society groups and the United Nations.Malpass said the Bank was working closely with the G20 in countries affected by fragility, conflict and violence, including the Sahel, Somalia, Lebanon, Gaza and the West Bank.In Sudan, he said he was hopeful that arrears clearance could move quickly, especially given the inflow of refugees from neighboring Ethiopia, which would allow substantial World Bank funding to begin flowing almost immediately.The United States last month moved to remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, clearing away one of the hurdles facing the heavily indebted African country, which has some $60 billion in external debt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-bank-warns-g20-against-doing-too-little-to-tackle-debt-problems/story-aiXYutsgqXlSZ3PVDD7XVK.html
22-11-2020||World||US air travelers surge over 1 million in holiday-season uptick||More than 1 million people flew through US domestic airports on Friday, the second-highest daily total since the coronavirus pandemic hit last spring, even as officials warn against travel around the Thanksgiving holiday.Airline passengers still lag substantially behind normal levels, but data posted by the Transportation Security Administration show that at least some people are bucking suggestions they stay home in light of the rapid growth in Covid-19 infections.A total of 1,019,836 people passed through US airport security screening portals on Friday, 40% of the nearly 2.6 million who flew on the equivalent day last year, according to TSA data.Since passenger counts plummeted from mid-March, only Oct. 18 had more people boarding flights. Friday’s total was well above the one-week average of 829,000 passengers a day.The increase came in spite of recent warnings from carriers, including American Airlines Group Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co., about softening holiday travel demand. The period around Thanksgiving is traditionally one of the busiest for travel.“There has been a deceleration in system bookings and an uptick in cancellations as a result of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases,” United said in a regulatory filing.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday urged people not to travel for Thanksgiving, which is Thursday, and to limit gatherings to those in the same household.Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recommended that people “think twice” about traveling over the holidays.Various governors have echoed the call to restrict gatherings for the popular holiday, while not necessarily issuing formal guidance.“Think about those you love and what you would do to protect them. It’s up to each and every one of us to be responsible and prevent the spread of Covid this holiday season,” Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, said Saturday on Twitter.Meanwhile, Republican and Democratic governors from several Midwestern states issued a joint video urging people to stay home for Thanksgiving, according to the Associated Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-air-travelers-surge-over-1-million-in-holiday-season-uptick/story-A9hr6v6MxsF9O9lGsHdZVM.html
22-11-2020||World||England will end Covid-19 lockdown with stricter tiered system||England will end a national Covid-19 lockdown on Dec. 2 and move into tougher tiered regional restrictions than before, with more areas facing severe constraints to prevent the virus from reigniting, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office said. Johnson ordered England in to a month-long lockdown in early November after infection cases and deaths started to rise again, angering businesses and some of his own political party over the economic consequences.A second wave of infections has started to flatten, official data shows, but scientific advisers are expected to warn on Monday that previous regional restrictions did not go far enough and harder measures are needed to prevent another national lockdown. “The Prime Minister and his scientific advisors are clear the virus is still present - and without regional restrictions it could quickly run out of control again before vaccines and mass testing have had an effect,” a spokeswoman said. “That would put in jeopardy the progress the country has made, and once again risk intolerable pressure on the NHS (National Health Service).”Britain has suffered the worst death toll in Europe and the deepest economic contraction of any G7 nation, prompting sharp criticism of Johnson’s handling of the pandemic. Prior to the latest lockdown, England had been placed into three tiers, with the toughest measures imposed in northern England, where movement was limited and pubs were forced to close unless they sold substantial meals. Johnson’s office said the prime minister would set out a new Covid Winter Plan on Monday, with more areas placed into the higher restrictions under the tiered system. He will discuss it with his cabinet of leading ministers on Sunday and present to parliament on Monday. The plan will also include details on interactions at Christmas.Ministers will announce which areas will be placed into which tier on Thursday, with lawmakers able to vote on the system before it comes into force. The tiers will be reviewed. The move is likely to be met with fierce resistance from some lawmakers who argue that the country cannot afford to close shops and hospitality again after unemployment numbers and debt jumped, and economic output plunged 20% in the second quarter. The government has argued that the virus will overwhelm hospitals and cripple the economy if it is left unchecked.The opposition Labour Party said a package of support would be needed for any business having to close. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also under varying levels of restrictions, set by their local governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-leader-to-end-england-s-national-lockdown-on-dec-2/story-AXW9JBXanIFkykwioXb5BN.html
22-11-2020||World||Donald Trump’s Pennsylvania lawsuit is ‘incoherent conspiracy,’ voters say||The Trump campaign’s lawsuit seeking to block Pennsylvania from certifying its election result is based on “absurd” logic contradicted by the facts in its own complaint, groups representing voters told a federal judge.President Donald Trump, who alleges a vast Democratic conspiracy in his refusal to concede defeat in the Nov. 3 election, has “utterly failed” to produce evidence of such a fraud while seeking to scrap tens of thousands of votes over technical disputes related to mail-in ballots, the groups said in a filing Friday evening.The campaign seeks “to justify mass disenfranchisement with an incoherent conspiracy theory,” the groups, including the Pennsylvania chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the League of Women Voters, said in the filing in Williamsport.“We did not establish a representative democracy to ask courts to ‘declare’ who wins our elections,” the groups said.US District Judge Matthew Brann, an Obama appointee, is simultaneously weighing the Trump campaign’s amended request for an injunction and Pennsylvania’s motion to dismiss the suit.The campaign seeks to audit 1.5 million ballots in Democratic-leaning counties and subject them to a “statistical analysis” to determine how many may be “illegal,” who the ballots were cast for, and provide an estimate on many should be thrown out.Trump Challenge to Election Results Hits Hardest at Black VotersThe campaign claims that at least 70,000 ballots were probably counted illegally in Pennsylvania because voters were allowed to fix, or “cure,” minor errors in Democratic-leaning counties before Election Day, while some Republican-led counties rejected such ballots.The voter groups said in their filing that election workers’ extensive documentation of voters who were allowed to “cure” errors contradicts the suit’s claim about a conspiracy. Workers also went to great lengths to help voters cast completed ballots, they said, contradicting the claim that officials were secretly counting defective ones.“Plaintiffs do not explain why, if these counties were conspiring to count defective ballots, they went out of their way to help voters fix mistakes to cast non-defective ballots,” the groups said. And while the campaign claims that the counties’ curing process was intended “to favor Biden,” similar protocols were used in several counties where voters favored Trump by wide margins, according to the filing.Those Republican-leaning counties aren’t named in the suit.The groups’ filing included examples of individual voters whose ballots would be rejected over seemingly irrational deficiencies if the campaign succeeds, including 73-year-old Natalie Price of Montgomery County, northwest of Philadelphia.“A day or two before the election, Ms. Price was notified that her ballot had been rejected because she did not write her name and address on the ballot declaration, which seemed unnecessary because it was pre-printed on the envelope,” according to the filing. Price traveled to a polling place and “added this duplicative information to her ballot.”For that, the filing says, the Trump campaign would deem her vote “illegal.”Michigan Lawmakers Who Met Trump Stand by Election OutcomeRejecting mail-in ballots from certified registered voters because they were given a chance to fix minor errors before Election Day would be a violation of the right to vote, they said. No evidence has been presented that ballots were cast by unregistered or invalid voters, they said.“While plaintiffs’ allegations and claims continue to twist and turn, in search of a legal theory that could justify this lawsuit, their ultimate goal has remained the same: to disenfranchise” millions of voters “in an effort to overturn an unfavorable election result,” the said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-pennsylvania-lawsuit-is-incoherent-conspiracy-voters-say/story-YPcR7rL7hnYKm27iPryVjI.html
22-11-2020||World||Donald Trump stays mum on sharing vaccines as leaders push for equality||Leaders of the world’s richest countries pushed for equality in the race to vaccinate people against the coronavirus, while President Donald Trump stayed quiet on sharing US-made vaccines with other nations.The battle to counter the pandemic dominated the first day of a virtual summit of Group of 20 nations on Saturday, hosted by Saudi Arabia.The US president told his counterparts that any American who wants the vaccine will be able to get it, and singled out American producers Pfizer Inc., whose jab has been developed along with a German company, and Moderna Inc., according to officials who asked not to be named discussing the talks, which weren’t open to the press.Trump praised American leadership, claiming credit for what he said was an efficient fight against the virus and success in bolstering the nation’s economy. But he said nothing about granting access to American vaccines by the rest of the world.US coronavirus deaths continue to soar, having recently passed 250,000, with the nation repeatedly reaching a record for daily cases. Total infections are nearing 12 million, with states including Ohio and California posting new Covid-19 case highs.Shortly after Trump’s remarks he left the virtual session -- while UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was speaking -- and was replaced first by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and then White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, according to officials familiar with the meeting. Some other leaders also dropped off after giving their speeches, the officials said.Trump later departed the White House for his Virginia golf course. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Russia in August trumpeted its success in becoming the first nation to register a Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V. US and European rivals, though, are now moving faster to produce their vaccines and obtain regulatory approval. The European Union has reached a deal with Pfizer, which is partnered with Germany’s BioNTech SE, and is negotiating an accord with Moderna.China, meanwhile, is already rolling out mass vaccine output to fight the disease, offering it as a tool of soft power.Echoing Trump, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said it was up to each individual to decide whether to be vaccinated, adding that the pandemic shouldn’t justify attacks on people’s freedom.Pfizer Covid Vaccine Faces Hurdles After FDA Filing FridayTrump wasn’t alone in praising his own country’s efforts. But Russian President Vladimir Putin also said his country is ready to share its vaccines with others that need it. That’s even as Russia hasn’t produced enough doses to start mass inoculation of its own population.“The main risk, of course, remains the likelihood, despite some positive signals, of mass, long-term unemployment and the accompanying rise in poverty and social dislocation,” Putin said in his speech. “And the role of the G-20 is to ensure this doesn’t happen.”“It is a case when competition may be inevitable, but we must proceed primarily from humanitarian considerations and make it a priority,” Putin added about vaccine availability, according to an official Kremlin translation of his remarks.China, likewise, made a point of offering up its vaccines. “China will honor its pledge, provide help and support to developing countries, and strive to make vaccines a global public good that is accessible and affordable to all countries,” President Xi Jinping told the meeting, according to state broadcaster CCTV.Xi also called on G-20 members to support the World Health Organization in coordinating resource allocation to ensure equitable and efficient distribution of vaccines worldwide.Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the meeting the G-20 should work to secure the “affordable and fair distribution of Covid-19 vaccine for everyone.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said countries should share vaccines, and stressed the importance of multilateral cooperation against the virus, according to a G-20 official.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who holds the rotating chairmanship of the 55-nation African Union, called for all countries to have “equitable and affordable access” to a vaccine once it becomes available and urged the G-20 to help ensure any funding shortfalls are addressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-stays-mum-on-sharing-vaccines-as-leaders-push-for-equality/story-E1C87kCPoY4uKBDjXYGRYJ.html
22-11-2020||World||One man’s ‘lie’ led to harsh lockdown in South Australia||South Australia’s drastic six-day coronavirus lockdown was triggered by a “lie” to contact tracers from a man who tested positive and restrictions across the state are set to be lifted much sooner than first planned, authorities said on Friday.The shock announcement came just two days after the state government ordered people to stay at home and shut many businesses to combat what was considered a highly contagious outbreak of coronavirus.South Australia state Premier Steven Marshall told a media conference in Adelaide that one man at a pizza bar tied to the outbreak told contact tracers he had only bought a pizza there, when he had actually worked several shifts at the food outlet alongside another worker who tested positive.Authorities assumed the man, who wasn’t named, had caught the virus during a very short exposure, leading them to believe the strain must be highly contagious.“Their (the man’s) story didn’t add up. We pursued them. We now know that they lied,” Marshall told reporters. “Had this person been truthful to the contact tracing teams, we would not have gone into a six-day lockdown.”“To say I am fuming about the actions of this individual is an absolute understatement. This selfish actions of this individual have put our whole state in a very difficult situation.”While the outbreak was still worrying, Marshall said restrictions would be lifted early with a stay-at-home order ending at midnight on Saturday when most businesses would also be allowed to open.Asked what punishment the individual might face, Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said there was “no penalty” for lying to tracers under the current law, though that would likely be reviewed.“I think it is stating the obvious to say that this person’s actions has had a devastating impact on our community,” said Stevens. “The hardship is not lost on us.”Stevens said a team reviewing information provided by the man to contract tracers wasn’t satisfied with “the feeling they got from this”. Stevens would not be drawn on the man’s likely motivation for misleading contact tracers.Home to about 1.8 million people, South Australia has recorded 25 cases from the latest cluster, linked to a returned traveller from the UK. The number of new cases in the state was still expected to rise over the next few days.The country as a whole has been relatively successful on containing the virus with only around 95 cases currently active.The state of Victoria on Friday reported its 21st day of zero cases, a well-earned reward for a marathon lockdown of the country’s second-largest city, Melbourne.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-man-s-lie-led-to-harsh-lockdown-in-south-australia/story-0z9OwLKwPw5AoRTrEwCZnK.html

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media, did not elaborate.In Kabul, at least one of the 23 mortar shells fired from two cars hit inside the Iranian Embassy compound. No one was injured, but it damaged the main building, the Iranian Embassy said in a tweet. At least 31 people were hurt elsewhere in the city, according to the Afghan Interior Ministry.The local Islamic State affiliate issued a statement claiming the attack that targeted the so-called Green Zone in Kabul which houses foreign embassies, the presidential palace and Afghan military compounds, according to SITE Intelligence Group.In Doha, Pompeo also met with the co-founder of the Taliban, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who signed the peace agreement with Washington in February ahead of the so-called intra-Afghan talks. The insurgent group’s spokesman, Mohammad Naeem, tweeted that further prisoner releases were discussed in the meeting, in addition to those that the two warring sides committed to ahead of peace talks under the US deal.Naeem said the Taliban also repeated their demand that Taliban leaders be removed from the United Nations sanctions list. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed earlier Saturday issued a statement assailing the Afghan government for requesting the U.N. maintain sanctions on Taliban leaders.For most Afghans, the overriding concern has been a sharp rise in violence this year and a surge of attacks by the Taliban against Afghanistan’s beleaguered security forces, since the start of peace talks in September.The announcement this week that the United States will accelerate its planned troop withdrawal has lent greater urgency to the intra-Afghan negotiations and to the calls for a reduction in violence. Washington announced it would withdraw another estimated 2,500 troops before the middle of January leaving about 2,000 American soldiers in Afghanistan.The Taliban have, however, held to their promise not to attack US and NATO troops.The United States has been pressing in recent weeks for a reduction in violence, while the Afghan government has been demanding a cease-fire. The Taliban have refused, saying a cease-fire will be part of negotiations.There are many within the Afghan government who want February’s peace deal scrapped. President-elect Joe Biden has previously advocated a small, intelligence based force in Afghanistan to focus on counter-terrorism.Meanwhile, Abdullah Abdullah, head of the government’s High Council for Reconciliation, condemned in a tweet Saturday’s attack on the capital, calling it a “cowardly” act. The council oversees the government’s negotiating team at the table with the Taliban in Doha.Pakistan, whose Prime Minister Imran Khan visited on Tuesday Kabul for the first time since he came to office, condemned the attack and warned “it is important to be vigilant against the spoilers who are working to undermine the peace efforts.” He did not identify “the spoilers.”Hours before the attack rattled Kabul, a bomb attached to a car killed one security personnel and wounded three others in an eastern neighborhood of the capital, said Kabul police spokesman Ferdaws Faramarz.Violence in Afghanistan has spiked in recent months with increasingly horrific attacks often claimed by the Islamic State group affiliate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-attack-hits-afghan-capital-pompeo-joins-peace-talks/story-6Sf2ZgzvupIvq5gDjxCmtI.html
22-11-2020||World||Protests staged across France against bill on police images||Thousands of people took to the streets in Paris and other French cities Saturday at the urging of civil liberties campaigners and journalist groups to protest a proposed security law they say would impinge on freedom of information and media rights.Pending legislation in France’s parliament would create a new criminal offense for publishing images of police officers with intent to cause them harm. Offenders would face a maximum penalty of up to one year in prison and a 45,000-euro ($53,000) fine.The government says the proposal is intended to protect police officers from online calls for violence. Critics fear that, if enacted, the measure would endanger journalists and other observers who take videos of officers at work, especially during violent demonstrations.In Paris, several thousand demonstrators gathered on the Trocadero square near the Eiffel Tower, chanting “Freedom, freedom” and “Everyone wants to film the police.”Reporters without Borders, Amnesty International France, the Human Rights League, journalists’ unions and other groups encouraged people to attend the protest. The crowd included many journalists and students.“We are not here to defend a privilege of our profession, press freedom and journalists’ freedom,” Edwy Plenel, co-founder and editor of investigative website Mediapart, said. “We are here to defend fundamental rights, the rights of all people.”Some members of the anti-government yellow vest movement also joined the demonstration.The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and France’s human rights ombudsman have also voiced concerns that the new provision could undermine fundamental rights.In response to the criticism, Prime Minister Jean Castex said Thursday that the measure would be amended to specify that it “won’t impede the freedom of information” and that it will focus only on images broadcast with “clear” intent to harm a police officer.Emmanuel Poupard, secretary general of the National Journalists Union (SNJ), said Saturday that he thinks the new amendment “doesn’t change anything.”The police image law “has only one goal: to boost the sense of impunity of law enforcement officers and make invisible police brutality,” he said.Protesters argue that recording officers in action is essential to being able to condemn and curb the actions of violent officers. They also worry how courts would determine whether images were posted with intent to harm.In July, three French police officers were charged with manslaughter over the death of a delivery man, Cedric Chouviat, that bystanders caught on video. Chouviat’s death had similarities with the killing of George Floyd in the US state of Minneapolis, which sparked outrage around the world and a series of Black Lives Matter demonstrations in France.The proposed law is championed by lawmakers from President Emmanuel Macron’s party, which has a majority in the National Assembly.Lawmakers are scheduled to vote Tuesday on the bill, which also includes other security measures. It will then go to the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-staged-across-france-against-bill-on-police-images/story-qsGjOQUFVZ3V0TGDas10HO.html
22-11-2020||World||Putin compares covid-induced economic crisis to great depression||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday at the G20 summit called the economic crisis caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic ‘a major world crisis’ since the Great Depression.“The scale of the challenges that humanity faces in 2020 is truly unprecedented. The coronavirus epidemic, global lockdown and freezing of economic activity have triggered a systemic economic crisis that the modern world has probably not known since the Great Depression,” Putin said at the summit as quoted by Sputnik.Putin further praised the US for its contribution to the world economic recovery during his economic speech and added that mass unemployment and poverty remain major issues for the world.“US President [Donald Trump] just spoke about the efforts of the United States, indeed, this is a very big contribution to the restoration of the US economy and, therefore, to the restoration of the world economy,” Putin said.He added, “The main risk, of course, remains ... despite some positive signals, the main risk will still remain massive long-term, so-called stagnant mass unemployment. With the subsequent growth of poverty and social disorder.”The Russian President further called for equal access to Covid-19 vaccines. “Russia supports the key project considered by the current summit, which aims to make efficient and safe vaccines accessible for everyone. There is no doubt that immunizing drugs should be common public property.He added, “And our country, Russia, of course, is ready to provide the vaccines developed by our scientists to those in need.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-compares-covid-induced-economic-crisis-to-great-depression/story-WaiLaISbAk2RSYT29sZBLP.html
22-11-2020||World||Trump’s attempts to overturn poll outcome fail, Joe Biden forges ahead||Georgia on Friday certified President-elect Joe Biden as the winner in the state and Michigan Republicans declared they had seen nothing so far to warrant reversing the outcome in their state after a meeting with President Donald Trump, rebuffing his efforts to overturn the election.The Trump campaign can still seek a recount of the Georgia votes under the state’s law, but its Republican leaders appear in the mood to indulge the president and his allies’ efforts to question the election outcome with nothing more than stray instances of irregularities and loads of allegations and wild theories.“We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan and, as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan’s electors, just as we have said throughout this election,” Lee Chatfield, Speaker of the Republican-controlled state House and Mike Shirkey, leader of the Republican-controlled Senate, said in a joint statement after their meeting with the president at the White House. The meeting was unprecedented in itself and seen as a sign of the president’s growing desperation. In his first public appearance in days, the outgoing president falsely claimed once again he had won. It was a briefing on pricing of medicines but he took no questions.Trump has refused to admit defeat, launched legal challenges that have all fallen without impacting outcome, and his lawyers and allies have taken to citing conspiracy theories that have together tainted the election among the president’s supporters who, polls show, believe it was unfair.The Trump administration has refused to cooperate with the incoming Biden team, which has had to resort to workarounds to prepare itself to take charge on January 20. Biden met a bipartisan group of governors to discuss Covid-19, which he has said will be a top priority for his administration.He has also continued to announce members of his team. Indian American Mala Adiga was named on Friday as policy director to Jill Biden, the incoming First Lady. She is a lawyer who earlier served in the departments of state and justice in the Obama administration, and had worked on the 2008 Obama-Biden campaign.The president-elect is expected to name members of his cabinet around Thanksgiving next week, and Vivek Murthy, another Indian American, is among leading contenders for secretary of health and human services. The former surgeon general currently co-chairs Biden’s advisory team on Covid-19.Biden has also met CEOs and business leaders and the US chamber of commerce, the most powerful lobbyist for the private sector, has urged the president start the transition process without any delay. Republican governors, who are critics of the president, have also joined in.The public face of the Trump administration’s obduracy is Emily Murphy, a Trump-appointee who heads the federal General Services Administration, which must under law officially issue an “ascertainment” recognizing Biden’s election to kickstart the transition process. She has refused thus far.Asked if the Biden administration can get access to everything, they needed pending that ascertainment, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Friday “the administration has done “everything statutorily required, and we will continue to do that”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-attempts-to-overturn-poll-outcome-fail-joe-biden-forges-ahead/story-cO8B3j0ch1WRvfLMTBtzEM.html
22-11-2020||World||US-European ocean monitoring satellite launches into orbit||A US-European satellite designed to extend a decades-long measurement of global sea surface heights was launched into Earth orbit from California on Saturday.A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the satellite blasted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base at 9:17 a.m. and arced southward over the Pacific Ocean. The Falcon’s first stage flew back to the launch site and landed for reuse.The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite was expected to deploy its solar panels and later make first contact with controllers.Named for a former NASA official who had a key role in developing space-based oceanography, the satellite’s main instrument is an extremely accurate radar altimeter that will bounce energy off the sea surface as it sweeps over Earth’s oceans. An identical twin, Sentinel-6B, will be launched in 2025 to ensure continuity of the record.Space-based sea level measurements have been uninterrupted since the 1992 launch of the US-French satellite TOPEX-Poseidon, which was followed by a series of satellites including the current Jason-3.Sea surface heights are affected by heating and cooling of water, allowing scientist to use the altimeter data to detect such weather-influencing conditions as the warm El Nino and the cool La Nina.The measurements are also important for understanding overall sea level rise due to global warming that scientists warn is a risk to the world’s coastlines and billions of people.“Our Earth is a system of intricately connected dynamics between land, ocean, ice, atmosphere and also of course our human communities, and that system is changing,” Karen St. Germain, NASA’s Earth Science Division director, said in a pre-launch briefing Friday.“Because 70% of the Earth’s surface is ocean, the oceans play an enormous role in how the whole system changes,” she said.The new satellite is expected to have unprecedented accuracy.“This is an extremely important parameter for climate monitoring,” Josef Aschbacher, the European Space Agency’s director of Earth observation, told The Associated Press this week.“We know that sea level is rising,” Aschbacher said. The big question is, by how much, how quickly.Other instruments on board will measure how radio signals pass through the atmosphere, providing data on atmospheric temperature and humidity that can help improve global weather forecasts.Europe and the United States are sharing the $1.1 billion (900 million euro) cost of the mission, which includes the twin satellite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-european-ocean-monitoring-satellite-launches-into-orbit/story-4V9KoiI6f85ft5TKQjwyoO.html
22-11-2020||World||Michigan lawmakers who met Trump stand by election outcome||Two Michigan lawmakers who met with Donald Trump amid the president’s effort to overturn the state’s decisive vote for Joe Biden said they haven’t yet seen any reason to alter the result.“We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan,” Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and House Speaker Lee Chatfield, both Republicans, said in a joint statement on Friday. “We will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan’s electors.”They added that allegations of fraud “should be taken seriously” and “thoroughly investigated,” but that certifying the Michigan vote “should be a deliberate process free from threats and intimidation.”Trump responded to the lawmakers in a pair of Saturday morning tweets asserting his team would show “massive” voter fraud. Thus far, more than two weeks after Election Day, Trump’s lawyers haven’t provided evidence that widespread irregularities occurred.Also Read | Trump tweets about voter ‘Fraud’ during G-20 opening meetingThe lawmakers’ meeting with Trump on Friday came after a bipartisan backlash against the president and his lawyers, who’ve discussed trying to persuade legislatures to appoint electors to vote for Trump, even though Biden won.Trump’s team is focused on Michigan, even though Biden leads the president there by roughly 156,000 votes, or 2.8 percentage points. The state has yet to certify its results. Trump won Michigan in 2016 by 0.3 points, or less than 11,000 votes.Longshot bidsThe effort in Michigan is part of a series of long-shot bids Trump and his allies are using in a bid to reverse his defeat. The president’s legal advisers have also suggested that state legislators in Pennsylvania could ignore the popular vote and choose pro-Trump electors. They’ve pressured state and local officials in Arizona and Georgia not to certify their election results, though Georgia on Friday brushed aside those pleas and moved forward with certification.Democrats and some Republicans, along with election lawyers and Biden’s aides, say efforts to overturn the Democrat’s victory don’t stand a chance of succeeding and are merely the result of Trump’s refusal to accept he lost. But they’ve warned that the president’s legal and public relations onslaught could inflict long-lasting damage on the nation’s democratic system and shake the public’s confidence in elections.Before the meeting with the Michigan lawmakers, Trump repeated his false claim that he defeated Biden. “I won, by the way. But, you know, we’ll find that out,” the president said during remarks Friday to reporters on prescription-drug pricing.Arranging meetingRudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney who’s leading the campaign’s legal push, was involved in arranging the Friday meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters earlier Friday that “this is not an advocacy meeting” and that nobody from the campaign would be there.“He routinely meets with lawmakers from all across the country,” McEnany said of Trump. In fact, it’s rare for Trump to host state lawmakers at the White House, and the president has largely remained out of sight since losing to Biden.Earlier Friday morning, as Shirkey left Detroit for Washington, he was surrounded by demonstrators at the airport who chanted “protect our votes.” Chatfield defended his decision to attend, tweeting earlier Friday: “No matter the party, when you have an opportunity to meet with the President of the United States, of course you take it.”Shirkey and Chatfield had both earlier dismissed the idea of overruling voters to overturn Biden’s victory.“That’s not going to happen,” Shirkey told news outlet Michigan Bridge earlier this week.Chatfield said in a Nov. 6 tweet that “whoever gets the most votes will win Michigan! Period. End of story.”‘History will judge’Michigan’s Democratic congressional delegation said in a joint statement on Thursday evening that “history will judge” Shirkey and Chatfield “on whether they choose to acknowledge the results of the election and defend our democracy, or simply be loyal to one man.”Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said Friday on CNN that the state’s election was secure. “The voters have spoken and there’s a procedure now that we’re going through to certify those results,” she said. “Any attempts to interfere or obstruct that process is, you know, at the very least improper.”Benson said the state board of canvassers is expected to meet Monday to certify the results, telling CNN that every county in Michigan has submitted its certification to the state.Trump’s legal team had sought to stop Michigan from certifying the results, citing irregularities in Detroit, but dropped its lawsuit Thursday morning.Giuliani claimed in a statement that the campaign had already accomplished its goal, after two Republican members of the canvassing board in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, sought to rescind their votes certifying the election results. But Benson said they couldn’t reverse their decision, and the next step would be for the state canvassing board to certify Michigan’s election results.Giuliani asserted at a news conference in Washington on Thursday that without Detroit’s votes, Trump would have won the state of Michigan.Biden responseBob Bauer, senior adviser to Biden, told reporters on Friday that such a move to flip the outcome in Michigan “can not be done.”“The Constitution does not permit a state legislature to do what Donald Trump wants the state legislature to do,” Bauer said.Democrats and some Republicans in Washington have widely condemned Trump’s efforts to subvert the will of the voters in swing states to flip the election in his favor.“It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American President,” said Utah Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican who’s been critical of Trump.Nebraska GOP Senator Ben Sasse also issued a critical statement after Giuliani staged a bizarre, 90-minute news conference on Thursday. Giuliani alleged without evidence that there was a “massive fraud” in Michigan, but Sasse countered that the president’s legal team has “refused to actually allege grand fraud” in court.“So no, obviously Rudy and his buddies should not pressure electors to ignore their certification obligations under the statute. We are a nation of laws, not tweets,” Sasse said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michigan-lawmakers-who-met-trump-stand-by-election-outcome/story-0ftpvnuNDBslnwMm80BlkK.html

22-11-2020||India||Kerala CM defends new law to check cyber bullying; very few are convinced||Amid growing protest over the Kerala Police Act amendment ordinance which the government claimed is intended to check cyber bullying, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday defended it saying fears that it will curb press freedom and free speech are baseless. Despite the CM putting up a brave face, the CPI(M) central leadership and junior left partner CPI are wary over the provisions of the ordinance signed by governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Saturday. The issue kicked off a nationwide debate with Congress and BJP criticising the left which always championed the cause of individual and media freedom. What really irked social media activists, journalists and others is that the ordinance covers any means of offensive communication or criticism on any platform and not just social media alone and they fear it can be used to target opponents and trap innocents. Any person who creates or sends any information that is considered offensive or is intended to offend or threaten another person through any means of communication is liable to face imprisonment of three years or a fine of Rs 10,000 or both, according to the 118 (A) amendment to the Police Act 2011. Unlike the defamation case (Sections 499 and 500 of the IPC) which needs a petitioner, the proposed amendment makes it a cognizable offence and any person can file a complaint or a police officer can register a case suo motu against the accused. Many experts have warned that it will be misused by political leadership and police and it won’t stand scrutiny before the court. But the chief minister brushed aside criticisms saying the decision was guided by growing abuse on social media targeting individuals and their personal freedom. “The new amendment will no way be used against impartial journalism. Apprehensions to the contrary are unfounded,” he said in a statement after it triggered a controversy. “Within the contours of our Constitution and legal framework, everybody has the right to make the strongest criticism. The new amendment will not hamper that freedom in any way. The government will consider all creative opinions and suggestions that are being aired in this regard,” he said, adding that such a law was necessary because the number of cyber attacks was increasing alarmingly. But the CM failed to convince even some of his allies. “There is a fear that the new amendment will muzzle free speech, jeopardise civil liberties and reverse media freedom. All apprehensions in this regard will have to be addressed” said CPI mouthpiece “Janayugam” in one of the articles. Also Read: There’s a lot in a name, says JP 77, a BJP nominee from Kerala’s Kozhikode In 2015, when the Supreme Court struck down the controversial Section 66 A of the Information Technology Act that made posting of offensive comments online a crime punishable by jail or fine, communist parties were quick to welcome it. But now, the lone communist government in the country has introduced a more stringent law to deal with cyber bullying, its critics said.Experts are also doubtful of the legal standing of the new ordinance. “It is an assault on freedom of speech and expression as guaranteed by the Article (19) (1) (a) of the Constitution. The law is loosely drafted and there are enough chances of misuse,” said Supreme Court lawyer M R Abhilash. Also Read: Kerala Governor signs controversial police act amendment ordinance The BJP and Congress leaders also came down heavily on the CPI(M). “Shocked by the law made by the LDF government of Kerala, making the so-called offensive post on social media punishable by three years in prison,” tweeted former minister and senior Congress leader P Chidamabaram. Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram Shashi Tharoor also criticised the move saying “it was loosely drafted and it could be used against political opponents.” BJP central leaders also slammed the move. The Kerala Union of working journalists dubbed the ordinance “undemocratic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-defends-new-law-to-check-cyber-bullying-very-few-are-convinced/story-YJbEaUc9Ivy5M4Nx9BtuQJ.html

22-11-2020||India||Mercury dips in most parts of north India, Delhi records coldest Nov morning since 2003||Minimum temperatures dipped in most parts of north India on Sunday with Srinagar recording a low of minus 3 degrees Celsius, while a cold wave swept parts of Delhi which recorded its coldest November morning since 2003.The national capital’s minimum temperature dropped to 6.9 degrees Celsius while the air quality remained “poor” and government agencies said it is likely to deteriorate further due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.“The Safdarjung Observatory which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 6.9 degrees Celsius. It is Delhi’s lowest minimum temperature in the month since November 2003, when the city recorded a low of 6.1 degrees Celsius,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre.The mercury dropped to 6.1 degrees Celsius at the Palam weather station.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than the normal for two consecutive days.“However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day,” Srivastava said, adding icy cold winds blowing from snow-laden western Himalayas have led to a dip in the mercury.The minimum temperature will rise by two to three degrees Celsius in the next four to five days under the influence of a fresh western disturbance.Jammu and Kashmir’s summer capital Srinagar recorded the coldest night of the season as the minimum temperature dropped several degrees below the freezing point across Kashmir region, while the weather department predicted a spell of wet weather in the Valley from Monday.Srinagar recorded a low of minus 3 degrees Celsius on Saturday night which is the lowest so far this season, a weather department official said, adding the minimum temperature settled below zero degree across the Kashmir valley.The famous ski-resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district was the coldest recorded place in the valley at minus 7.4 degrees Celsius, while the mercury settled at a low of minus 5.6 degrees Celsius in Pahalgam tourist resort in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district, he said.The official said a spell of rain and snow, especially over the higher reaches, with light to moderate intensity is most likely to occur between November 23-25.“Snowfall over the higher reaches of north-west J-K and Sonmarg-Zojila area is likely to commence from November 23 morning and is likely to affect both UTs till November 25,” he said.Cold conditions continued to sweep a few districts of Himachal Pradesh with the meteorological department forecasting rain and snowfall in the state on Wednesday.The Shimla Meteorological Centre had earlier forecast rain and snowfall from Sunday-Wednesday. However, its director Manmohan Singh said on Sunday that a ‘yellow weather’ warning had been issued for heavy rain at isolated places in the mid-hills and snowfall in high hills of the state for Wednesday.The weather office issues colour-coded warnings to alert people ahead of severe or hazardous weather that has the potential to cause damage, widespread disruption or danger to life. Yellow, the least dangerous of all the warnings, indicates the possibility of severe weather over the next few days.Keylong in Lahaul and Spiti district was the coldest place in the state at minus 6.4 degrees Celsius. Kalpa in Kinnaur district recorded a low of minus 2.6 degrees Celsius.The minimum temperature in Manali in Kullu district was at 0.2 degrees Celsius, while Kufri and Dalhousie recorded 3.6 degrees Celsius and 3.8 degrees Celsius respectively.Shimla recorded a low of 5.1 degrees Celsius. The highest temperature in the state was recorded in Una at 23.2 degrees Celsius.Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar recorded the lowest temperature in the state at 6.2 degrees Celsius with cold weather conditions prevailing in Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Allahabad and Kanpur divisions.The mercury fell to 7.3 degrees Celsius in Bareilly and state capital Lucknow recorded a minimum temperature of 9.5 degrees Celsius, while both Agra and Meerut registered a low of 9.4 degrees Celsius.

Addressing a virtual event on safeguarding the planet that was held on the margins of the G20 Summit, Modi called for collective efforts by countries to address the effects of climate change and to ensure that green technologies and finances reached developing countries. “Today, we are focused on saving our citizens and economies from the effects of the global pandemic. Equally important is to keep our focus on fighting climate change. Climate change must be fought not in silos but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way,” he said. Calling for enhanced research and innovation in new and sustainable technologies, he added: “We should do so with a spirit of cooperation and collaboration. The entire world can progress faster if there is greater support of technology and finance to the developing world.” In keeping with its traditional ethos of living in harmony with the environment, India has adopted low carbon and climate resilient development practices, he said. India is also exceeding targets set under the Paris Agreement and will reach its goal of generating 175 GW of renewable energy before the target date of 2022, he added. The popularisation of LED lights is helping cut 38 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year, while smoke-free kitchens have been provided to 80 million households. Efforts are also on to eliminate single-use plastics, and 26 million hectares of degraded land will be restored by 2030.

He said it is upsetting that people have stopped wearing masks and following social distancing norms.“We will have to take more precautions after Diwali. The threat of coronavirus has not passed. Several countries are seeing the second wave,” said Thackeray.He added: “We are standing at a dangerous turn. We have to decide whether we want to go for a lockdown or follow all the mandatory Covid-19 safety protocols.”Thackeray said that Delhi is facing a third wave and due to ongoing disease outbreak, Ahmedabad and other cities are seeing night curfews.“The spiralling cases in Delhi is a cause of concern and there is a night curfew in Ahmedabad. I don’t want another lockdown, but you should also understand the gravity of the situation,” the Maharashtra chief minister said.He also urged people not to crowd temples even as the state government has gone ahead with opening them and asked people to avoid moving around unnecessarily.“Unlock process did not mean that the pandemic is over. Even though the places of religious worship have been reopened, avoid crowding there. Several festivals passed off during the pandemic with majority people celebrating it without crowding. We have been able to control the spike, but we can’t be careless,” the chief minister said.Underlining his concern, Thackeray said, “Today the count of cases has come down but we are at a crossroads. Which way do we want to go? We need to keep our actions in check.”The chief minister urged people to avoid crowding, wear masks and keep their hands sanitised to fight the viral contagion and added that while he has been advised to impose a night curfew, he does not think anything can be achieved by imposing such restrictions.Adding that confusion still lingers on over availability of Covid-19 vaccine, Thackeray said that people have no option but to have mandatory use of masks, physical distancing and hand sanitisation. He also informed people about post-Covid-19 side effects and said, “Post-Covid-19 side effects are severe and can be seen impacting the brain, lungs, kidney among other organs. Pollution is also impacting people with co-morbidities.”On Sunday, Maharashtra added 5,753 cases of infection, taking the state’s cumulative tally to 17,80,208.

India has been reporting thousands of coronavirus cases and hundreds of related deaths every day, prompting the government to find a way to provide emergency authorisation to Covid-19 vaccine candidates.According to people aware of the developments, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also wanted to know the details about the emergency authorisation process at a review meeting on Friday on procurement and delivery strategy of Covid-19 vaccines. “Held a meeting to review India’s vaccination strategy and the way forward. Important issues related to the progress of vaccine development, regulatory approvals, and procurement were discussed,” PM Modi tweeted after the meeting.Also Read | Government exploring modalities of emergency authorisation of Covid-19 vaccineHow does the emergency use authorisation work in India?In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants emergency use authorisation (EUA) and a process has been laid out for the same.

It was dug 20 feet deep beneath the ground and has a diameter of three feet,” he informed.“We have recovered ropes and 10 to 15 sand bags that were used to give support to it (at its mouth), “ said the BSF IG. He added that the sand bags bore markings of Karachi, Pakistan. The BSF detected it around 12.30 pm on Sunday.Jamwal further said that the tunnel established Pakistan’s involvement beyond any doubt in the Ban toll plaza encounter.“We are going to lodge a strong protest with the Rangers with all the evidence and pictures,” he added. A senior intelligence official said that the four terrorists were in constant touch with their handlers in Pakistan via digital mobile radio.“Kahan pahunche, kya soorat e haal hai. Koi mushkil toh nahi,” these texts were sent to the four terrorists.The handlers, in Shakargarh area of Punjab’s Narowal district in Pakistan, had asked the terrorists about their whereabouts and if they had reached safely. The recovered digital mobile radio has been manufactured by a Pakistani company ‘Micro Electronics’ and QMobile smartphone.“The messages were sent by a handler in Shakargarh,” said the official.In addition, a wireless set and a GPS device have also been recovered.The four Jaish terrorists, believed to be Pakistani nationals, had sneaked into India from the Samba sector on Thursday night along with a huge consignment of arms and ammunition, including six AK-56 rifles, five AK-47 rifles, three pistols, 16 AK magazines, a packet of RDX, 20 Chinese hand grenades, six UBGL grenades and 20 kgs of explosive.Also Read: BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain says Article 370 not there now, it will never beActing on intelligence inputs, security forces intercepted the truck carrying theterrorists around 4.50am at Ban toll plaza near Nagrota in Jammu district.

They are said to be stable. “A few days ago, (Jaish founder Masood Azhar’s brother) Abdul Rauf Asghar aka Rauf Lala was seen across the International Border in Shakargarh area of Narowal district. The area has launch pads (to push terrorists into India),” said one of the officials cited above, requesting anonymity. Intelligence agencies had warned of a possible infiltration bid and a major terror attack on November 26 (coinciding with the 2008 Mumbai attacks and just before the beginning of the local body elections), this official said.

As guns fell silent, the bodies of the terrorists were recovered from inside the truck. Officials said that medicines with Pakistani markings found on the terrorists proved they infiltrated from across the border. “Once into the Indian territory, it is not a big deal for these terrorists, trained in guerrilla warfare, to cover the distance from the international border to Jammu-Pathankot highway and the possibility of sleeper cells on Indian side helping them is also not ruled out,” this official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cross-border-tunnel-half-a-dozen-other-proof-give-away-pak-hand-in-ban-toll-plaza-encounter/story-yYWTzIpmbIeDwtO2sldlGL.html

Asked about remarks made by Sibal and Chidambaram in the wake of party’s dismal performance in the Bihar assembly elections and its poor performance in the assembly bye-elections across 11 states, Azad the two leaders have not said anything wrong.“Both Sibal and Chidambaram have not said anything wrong but retrospection does not mean that anyone is against Sonia Gandhi. It does not mean that Rahul Gandhi is bad. Retrospection means there should be a discussion on why we lost in Bihar, why we won few seats in Madhya Pradesh. And after a discussion on these, how to apply the conclusion we get from the discussion on these issues-- this is what we have to do,” he said.“The medicine for the party is to conduct block level, district level and PCC elections. I won’t blame the leadership because the elections could not take place but they will have to be conducted in the future. Second, the leaders who get elected will have to leave the five-star culture,” he added.Sibal had said in an interview to a national daily that people of the country not just in Bihar but wherever bye-elections were held do not consider Congress to be an effective alternative.Sibal was also among 23 leaders who wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi demanding sweeping changes in the party. He had also said that time for “introspection” was over.Chidambaram had also expressed concern over results of bypolls and said there was a need for comprehensive review to see why RJD-Congress alliance lost despite being so close to victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sibal-chidambaram-not-wrong-retrospection-does-not-mean-removal-of-gandhis-says-ghulam-nabi-azad/story-3apJu5ds7iARbzrzmYf1nN.html
22-11-2020||India||India’s manufacturing poised to witness recovery in July-Sep: Survey||India’s manufacturing sector is poised to witness recovery in the July-September quarter, even as hiring outlook for the segment remains bleak, according to a survey. Industry body FICCI’s latest quarterly survey on manufacturing points towards recovery of the manufacturing sector in the second quarter ended September as compared to the previous quarter, with a rise in percentage of respondents reporting higher production. The proportion of respondents reporting higher output during July-September rose to 24 per cent, as compared to 10 per cent in the previous quarter. Besides, the percentage of respondents expecting low or same production is 74 per cent in the second quarter which was 90 per cent in the first quarter of 2020-21. However, hiring outlook for the sector, though improving slightly, shows a bleak picture as 80 per cent of the respondents mentioned that they are not likely to hire additional workforce in the next three months. “This presents slightly improved situation in the hiring scenario as compared to the previous quarter Q-1 of 2020-21, where 85 per cent of the respondents were not in favour of hiring additional workforce,” FICCI said. Moreover, the average interest rate paid by manufacturers has reduced slightly to 9.2 per cent per annum as against 9.4 per cent per annum during the last quarter and the highest rate is reported to be 12.5 per cent. The recent cuts in repo rate by the RBI has not led to a consequential reduction in the lending rate as reported by 55 per cent of the respondents, found the survey. Based on expectations in different sectors, all the sectors except medical devices are likely to register low growth in Q-2 2020-21. The primary reason for such depressed expectations seems to be the imposition of lockdown, subdued demand, restricted exports and other guidelines in place as a response towards Covid-19 outbreak. The survey covered wide areas of relevance for manufacturing like exports, capacity utilisation, ongoing restrictions, availability of labour/workforce and others. In many of these areas there are signs of operations inching towards normal and in coming months could see better performance. The survey assessed the sentiments of manufacturers for July-September 2020-21 for 12 major sectors namely automotive, capital goods, cement and ceramics, chemicals, fertilizers and pharmaceuticals, electronics & electricals, leather and footwear, medical devices, metal & metal products, paper products, textiles, textile machinery, and miscellaneous. Responses were drawn from over 300 manufacturing units from both large and SME segments with a combined annual turnover of around Rs 3 lakh crore. The survey showed that overall capacity utilisation in manufacturing has risen to 65 per cent as compared to 61.5 per cent in Q4 2019-20. The future investment outlook, however, is subdued as only 18 per cent respondents reported plans for capacity additions for the next six months as compared to 22 per cent in the previous quarter, the survey revealed. High raw material prices, high cost of finance, shortage of skilled labour and working capital, high logistics cost, low domestic and global demand due to imposition of lockdown across several countries, lack of financial assistance, are some of the major constraints affecting expansion plans of the respondents. Significantly, the percentage of respondents expecting increase in exports in July-September has increased substantially to 24 per cent when compared to the previous quarter, wherein merely 8 per cent respondents were expecting a rise in exports. Also, 19 per cent are expecting exports to continue to be on same path as that of same quarter last year, the survey noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-manufacturing-poised-to-witness-recovery-in-july-sep-survey/story-DSsOkQ6nJt1l61kaps1eSI.html

Many mothers and sisters have suffered its bad consequences. This is a state matter and state governments should enact law against it,” BJP general secretary Arun Singh told reporters at a press conference.Some state governments are working in this regard and will continue to do so, he added.About Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel’s attack on the saffron party over the issue and his reference to interfaith marriages of some BJP leaders, Singh said Baghel should first answer whether his government has fulfilled the promises like waiving farm loans and starting unemployment allowance the Congress had made during the Assembly polls in 2018.His government has become synonymous with corruption and malgovernance, the BJP general secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-says-love-jihad-serious-problem-states-should-act/story-lve8y9Hz3lla2yXbc9PhzI.html
22-11-2020||India||BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain says Article 370 not there now, it will never be||The BJP Sunday said Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was “buried” by Parliament following proper procedures of law, and expressed hope that it will not be restored by the Supreme Court.Several mainstream parties from Jammu and Kashmir have challenged in the Supreme Court the Centre’s August 5, 2019 decision to withdraw Article 370 and also divide the state into two union territories.“I do not want to discuss anything on the SC (Supreme Court), the judiciary. But, (Article) 370 is gone. The ‘Gupkar gang’ is sure it (Article 370) will be restored, but I am also sure it will not be restored. The way they are making a claim, I too am.“We have abrogated it according to proper procedures and both the houses of the Parliament have passed it. Parliament frames laws and it (Art 370) has been abrogated,” BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain told PTI.He was recently appointed the BJPs in-charge for the elections in Kashmir.The special status of the erstwhile state was abrogated at the highest temple of democracy and the law was repealed by the “makers of Constitution”, he said, referring to the Parliament.“The BJP has done nothing. It is the Parliament which has done it...Was it done at the BJP’s Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg office? It was abrogated at the highest temple of democracy. The makers of the Constitution abrogated it,” he said.Asked about the challenge ín Supreme Court, the BJP leader said, “When some decision is taken, we will see it. But as of now, it (Article 370) has been buried in a grave”.Hussain said no power in the world, including the United Nations, can restore the special status of J-K.“Article 370 is gone and even the UN, the whole world, does not have the courage (to restore it). Pakistan pleaded before Saudi Arabia, the Organisation of Islamic Countries, but has anyone said anything?... Article 370 is not there now and it will never be. It is gone forever,” he asserted.Asked how was the party sure that Article 370 will not be restored when the case was sub-judice and the Supreme Court was still hearing the matter, the BJP national spokesperson said every issue is being taken to the court nowadays. “The Article has been revoked. If it is sub-judice, does it mean Article 370 is there? It is not. Every issue is taken to court...If the court has granted a stay, then it is a different issue, but there is no stay from anywhere. “If (PDP president) Mehbooba Mufti is saying they will get it back, then let them hold on to their belief, I will hold on to mine,” he said.Hussain said the government and the Attorney General of the country will respond to the issue in the court. Referring to the upcoming District Development Council (DDC) polls in J-K, the BJP leader said the whole election is about development. “We are pro-development and we will undertake development in J-K. It is a question of our credibility. The Prime Minister loves J-K and this whole election is on development. We want to live in the hearts of the people of Kashmir. “We want the youth who have gone astray and picked up guns to hold pens in their hands. We will respect the aspirations of the people of J-K and we will win Kashmir through love,” he said. Asked about the concerns raised by political parties about their candidates not being able to campaign, the former Union minister said the administration must take care of their security. “When elections took place in Punjab after terrorism, the candidates were taken in police protection. If they go separately, they will become the target of the terrorists. So, Mehbooba’s allegations are wrong. BJP candidates are being given the same treatment as those of the Gupkar gang.“The BJP candidates are also complaining about the same thing. It is the responsibility of the administration to protect their lives,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-shahnawaz-hussain-says-article-370-not-there-now-it-will-never-be/story-TKYc4h4bDYFSFdgUrXglwM.html

Using these principles, negotiations should be speedily initiated. It was also decided at the meeting that a NEGVAC group should be proactively reaching out to each company as their results from phase three are announced, a source said.Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have announced that its vaccine appears 95 per cent effective at preventing mild to severe Covid-19 disease in a large, ongoing study.

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, home minister Narottam Mishra, forest minister Vijay Shah, agriculture minister Kamal Patel, rural development minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia, and animal husbandry minister Prem Singh Patel participated in the meeting that decided to launch an awareness campaign to educate people about the many beneficial properties of the cow and its by-products.“The conservation of the cow is important for environmental conservation.

Cow urine will be used as pest control and medicine,” Chauhan said.“The 4000 cow shelters will be opened in the state where production units for making cow-dung cakes, organic manure, pesticide and milk powder will be set up in public-private partnership (PPP) mode.

22-11-2020||India||New amendment made to Kerala Police Act won’t be used against free speech: Pinarayi Vijayan||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday said that the Kerala Police Act will in no way be used against free speech or impartial journalism and apprehensions to the contrary are unfounded.“The State Government was repeatedly receiving complaints against the wide misuse of social media, especially by certain online channels. Even prominent public and cultural figures had made such complaints. They have brought to the notice of the Government instances where inhuman and vile cyber attacks were carried out by some in the guise of journalism and how it even harmed the family lives of many. It has often turned into targeted attacks using untruths and even sleazy content. Many families are bearing the consequences of such attacks,” Vijayan said, according to news agency ANI.He added that the use of personal likes or dislikes, political or non-political interests which can unsettle the peaceful atmosphere, and those being used to settle scores arising out of revenge cannot be allowed.“In several instances, such cyber attacks have resulted in heart-wrenching tragedies. Such attacks that are carried out without hearing the side of those who are being attacked do not fall under the category of journalism. They are simply personal vendetta in action. Many a time, monetary interests are behind such devious designs,” he added.Vijayan further said that along with ensuring the freedom of the press, the government also has the responsibility of upholding a citizen’s individual freedom and his/her dignity as enshrined in the Constitution. The popular idea that one’s freedom ends where the other’s nose begins needs to be respected. One has the liberty to swing one’s fist, but it ends where the other’s nose begins. However, there have been instances of this idea being repeatedly violated,” he added.Asserting that in the name of freedom of the press, individual freedom cannot be violated, Vijayan said in the name of individual freedom, the freedom of the press cannot be violated. “The government is duty-bound to protect both. It is in this context that even at the international level measures are being put in place against the infringement of personal dignity. The amendment in the Kerala Police Act is only those that are in tune with such measures,” he added. The Kerala CM said a person’s respect and dignity are essential in modern society, adding that it has constitutional validation as well. “The government has the responsibility to ensure it. In general, traditional media functions within these constitutional limits. However, certain online media have scant regard for such constitutional provisions and behave as if anything goes, creating an atmosphere of anarchy. This will alter our social order, and it cannot be allowed,”he added. “Within the contours of our Constitution and the legal framework, everybody has the right to make the strongest criticisms. The new amendment will not hamper that freedom in any way. If seen in a positive light, no one can perceive infringement of freedom in it. Only those who think that it is their freedom to wreak havoc in others’ lives, can see this as an affront on their freedom. And that is not something that modern society would allow anywhere in the world,” said the Kerala CM. He further added, “Personal defamation and attack on dignity have even resulted in suicides and it has been brought to the attention of the Government by those in responsible positions. In such circumstances, the Government cannot simply ignore it. Our effort to ensure the respect and dignity of each individual should not create any apprehension in the minds of the media and the general public. The amendment only has clauses that are in tune with the sections that ensure the freedom of the press and individual liberty.”Vijayan said the amendment has been introduced also in the context of the cyber-attacks being faced by women and transgenders, adding that the government will certainly consider all creative opinions and suggestions that are being aired with regard to this amendment.Amid resistance from the opposition parties, Kerala Governor Arif Muhammad Khan has signed the Kerala Police Act amendment ordinance.The law aims to stop bullying, insulting or disgracing individuals through any content and circulating the same through any communication medium. The offenders will be awarded a sentence of three years/penalty of Rs 10,000 or both.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-amendment-made-to-kerala-police-act-won-t-be-used-against-free-speech-pinarayi-vijayan/story-ay1vS0SjYScsVFkFnTg1mK.html

22-11-2020||India||Parliamentary panel underscores need for govt to formulate laws to counter bio-terrorism||A parliamentary panel has highlighted the need for the government to formulate effective laws to counter bio-terrorism, stating the adverse effects of Covid-19 pandemic have taught a lesson on the importance of controlling biological agents and the need of strategic partnerships among different nations. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health, in its report “The Outbreak of Pandemic Covid-19 And its Management”, underlined the need of bio-safety to prevent the world community from any activity signalling bio-terrorism. The chairperson of the parliamentary standing committee, Ram Gopal Yadav, submitted the report to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday.  The committee’s attention has been drawn to the fact that novel coronavirus, like viruses infecting large populations across the globe and emerging as pandemics, can be used as biological weapons against enemy nations. Bio-security, therefore, is a critical area of concern, the report said. The Department of Health and Family has submitted that a holistic approach is needed for ensuring bio-security against biological weapons, that inter-alia include approach for deterrence, prevention, protection and response against biological weapons, engagement with agencies and active participation in ongoing international treaties and strengthening bio-safety and bio-security platforms in India. It also has pitched for instituting robust bio-repositories for high-risk emerging/ reemerging infectious pathogens, strengthening disease surveillance including at animal-human interface, training and capacity building for management of public health emergencies arising from use of bio-weapons and strengthening research and surveillance activities related to development of diagnostics vaccines and drugs.  “The adverse effects of Covid-19 pandemic have taught the lesson on the importance of controlling biological agents and the need of strategic partnerships among different nations.  “The committee, therefore, feels that the present time is the most appropriate for the government to formulate effective laws to counter bio-terrorism,” the committee said in its report. The panel stated it also believes that with the expanding network of VRDLs, ICMR would serve as an important platform for diagnosis and surveillance of existing as well as emerging viral infections and thus make the country bio-secured against life-threatening viruses and the menace of bio-terrorism.   The committee agreed with the Department of Health Research that a holistic approach is needed for ensuring bio-security against biological weapons. The ministry should also engage with agencies and actively participate in ongoing international treaties.  The committee strongly recommended the ministry to conduct more research and work towards training and capacity building for management of public health emergencies arising from use of bio-weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliamentary-panel-underscores-need-for-govt-to-formulate-laws-to-counter-bio-terrorism/story-u6g31PJLdornbPowsTKZ1O.html

The son of the jeweller was abducted in the morning when he and his friend, 21, was practising for an upcoming cricket tournament at Railway Inter College in Garhara. Eyewitnesses recounted that armed men abducted both of the jeweller’s son and his friend from Bado Bazar area in the district town and the latter was set free near Simaria railway cabin. The kidnappers sped off in a sports utility vehicle (SUV), they added. Panic-stricken members of kidnapped boy’s family started looking for him after he did not reach home.However, he could not be traced, despite frenetic bids. Soon, they got a call from his mobile phone, and the caller -- one of the kidnappers -- demanded a ransom of Rs 1 crore. Awakash Kumar, superintendent of police (SP), Begusarai, said the jeweller, a resident of Beehat under the jurisdiction of Garhara police station, informed him about the ransom demand. “Police are trying to trace the kidnappers on the basis of their SIM (subscriber identification module) card location and close circuit TV (CCTV) footage from the abduction spot,” said a police officer. Negotiations between the kidnappers and the family members are said to be still in progress. Traders of Beehat protested against local police authorities alleging that security in the area is lax. The agitators blocked the busy Begusarai-Patna road and shouted anti-police slogans.

As many as 23 persons including 15 police and security personnel were injured in the clash. Two security personnel including Biswajit Debbarma were referred to Govind Ballabh Pant hospital in Agartala on Saturday in critical condition. Biswajit later succumbed to the head injury received in the clash, said a police official on Sunday. Two local organisations namely Nagarik Suraksha Mancha and Mizo Convention, under the banner of Joint Movement Committee, started an indefinite strike at Kanchanpur in North district against permanent resettlement of Bru migrants on November 16. They want Bru migrants to be settled in all the eight districts of the state and not be concentrated in Kanchanpur sub division. The movement later spread to different parts including Panisagar, Pecharthal and Kailashahar in Unakoti district. They blocked National Highway-8 at Panisagar on Saturday where the protesters turned violent and tried to snatch weapons from the security personnel. The police had to resort to lathi charge, and then open fire to bring the situation under control, said police. 46-years-old carpenter, Srikanta Das, also a protester, died in the firing. Over 32,000 Bru migrants have been staying at six relief camps located at Kanchanpur and Panisagar sub divisions in North District for over two decades after they came here from Mizoram’s Mamit, Kolasib and Lunglei districts in 1997, escaping an ethnic clash.

The state government has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the violent clash, to be done by North District Magistrate Nagesh Kumar and the report would be submitted within one month. The government also announced Rs. 5 lakh as compensation for the dead carpenter’s family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anti-bru-resettlement-clash-claims-another-life-as-fireman-succumbs/story-Xezj37PGxj6v1QCMu1mJtL.html

Malik, who is Maharashtra’s minority development minister asked if the central agency is protecting drug traffickers by giving them publicity by putting people of the film industry behind bars. “The way NCB is arresting who consume drugs. They are addicts who should be sent to rehab, not jail. NCB’s duty is to track down drug traffickers but no action is being taken against them. Is NCB protecting them by giving publicity, arresting drug addicts especially from film industry?” he asked, according to news agency ANI.“There is something wrong within the system. They must see from where the drugs are coming. Who were the traffickers and peddlers? There is no action against them,” the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader added.In the latest raid by NCB in its probe launched into the consumption and possession of drugs by people in Bollywood, officials searched Singh and Limbachiyaa’s office and house on Saturday and recovered 86.5 gram of cannabis, according to reports.The agency started probing the drugs case after it received official communication from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), in which there were various chats related to drug consumption, procurement, usage and transportation in connection with actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in June this year.Actors Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Shraddha Kapoor and Rakul Preet Singh were also questioned in relation to the case in September. Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, some employees of the late actor and a few others were arrested under various sections of the NDPS act. Rhea Chakraborty is currently out on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-ncb-giving-publicity-to-drug-traffickers-by-arresting-people-from-film-industry-nawab-malik/story-0pUgW9mtTYtZpDOFs36TKK.html
22-11-2020||India||At review meet, PM asked about emergency authorisation process of vaccines: Officials||At a recent review meeting on procurement and delivery strategy of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to know the details about a vaccine’s emergency authorisation process.According to some officials present in the meeting, the discussions underlined how the country’s top leadership is getting ready as possible vaccine candidates race towards the finishing line. On Friday, the PM chaired a meeting of experts on procurement and delivery strategy of Covid-19 vaccines.Later, he tweeted: “Held a meeting to review India’s vaccination strategy and the way forward. Important issues related to the progress of vaccine development, regulatory approvals, and procurement were discussed.” Modi specifically asked about the process involved in the emergency authorisation of any new vaccine. His intent, the officials suggested, was to ensure that the government was not caught off guard or tangled in legal or bureaucratic processes during approval. Two officials informed the PM that rules were in place for the emergency authorisation of vaccines. “We said our existing legal framework is sufficient for granting such an authorisation. The Epidemic Diseases Act, 2020, gives power to the states to take any measure to prevent an epidemic. It can be used for vaccines as well,” an official said. The PM was also informed that the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, was widely used during the 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions and in Covid-19-related containment zones. The Act can also come in handy to roll out vaccines.“Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, it shall be lawful for the Central Government to issue direction in writing to the Ministries or Departments of the Government of India, or the National Executive Committee or the State Government, State Authority, State Executive Committee, statutory bodies or any of its officers or employees, as the case may be, to facilitate or assist in the disaster management and such Ministry or Department of Government or Authority, Executive Committee, statutory body, officer or employee shall be bound to comply with such direction,” the Act states. The Centre is also armed with the New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, which mentions “special situations for a new drug where relaxation, abbreviations, omission, or deferment of data may be considered”, said another official. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, principal scientific advisor Vijay Raghavan, and Dr. VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, among others, had attended the meeting. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the PM was apprised of the progress on the research related to Covid-19 vaccine candidates both at home and abroad. The PM was informed that emergency authorisation for an anti-Covid-19 jab was yet to be issued by any country in the world. Pfizer, which has developed a vaccine with its German counterpart, BioNTech, announced on Saturday that it would seek the US Food and Drug Administration’s (USFDA) approval for emergency authorisation. The PM was told that emergency authorisation would require some more time and could not be granted immediately after a vaccine candidate’s appeal. The PM was also apprised of the status of the domestic vaccine makers. In India, five Covid-19 vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of development. Four of the vaccine candidates are undergoing the phase II and III and another one phase I and II of trials. The PM was informed about the trial results and what could be expected in the coming weeks and regulatory approvals, the official added. The progress of talks with other countries and foreign vaccine manufacturers were also discussed. Initially, the country is looking at administering vaccines to up to 300 million Indians by next July and the PM was informed about the priority list in the first phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-review-meet-pm-asked-about-emergency-authorisation-process-of-vaccines-officials/story-zCEcyRSHlpsKB5GIs1ZbVP.html

But then, Banerjee returned to his family at Birati in Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district on Friday night while preparations were on for his shraddh following Hindu rituals. There is more to what is being described as faux pas and apathy by the staff at the Balaram Basu hospital in Khardah, located in the same district, where Banerjee was admitted on November 4. The state health department is conducting an inquiry into it. The man who died and was cremated on November 13 by Banerjee’s son Sanjib was one Mohinimohan Mukherjee, 75, a resident of Khardah in the same district and a retired employee of the local civic body. Mukherjee, too, was admitted at Balaram Basu hospital on November 4 but was transferred to the Covid-19 hospital at Barasat in North 24 Parganas on November 7, health department officials said. However, the medical records that were sent with him to the Barasat hospital belonged to Banerjee. The records got swapped and Banerjee remained under treatment as Mohinimohan Mukherjee till he recovered. The truth came to light on Friday when the Balaram Basu hospital staff called up Mukherjee’s family to inform that he was ready for discharge as he had tested negative for Covid-19 after treatment. “When I went to the hospital I was shocked to see a different person sitting in a wheelchair,” Mukherjee’s son Sandip told the local media. “The hospital authorities realized that they had made a faux pas and informed Banerjee’s family,” he added. Banerjee’s family took him home late on Friday night. The district health department has formed a four-member committee to inquire the incident. “This is indeed unfortunate. The inquiry committee’s report has been sent to the state health department and necessary action will be taken,” district chief medical officer of health (CMOH) Tapas Roy said while talking to the media. Banerjee’s family did not talk to the media till Sunday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/declared-dead-covid-patient-returns-home-after-recovery/story-bOW9LUfcWKLtGIEH9EuaGP.html

I have told the Assembly Speaker that if the schools are closed, I will take my life in the Assembly,” said Bahinipati.However, school and mass education minister Sameer Dash said 7,772 schools and not 14,000 schools would be closed down for imparting quality education to the students. “It is not possible to provide those students even a classroom and a class teacher. Suppose there are 15 students in a school studying in Class I to Class V. How is it possible to impart quality education,” he asked. He, however, said a memorandum in this respect, following a meeting of all parties, will be submitted to the chief minister.In two separate notifications issued by the state school and mass education department during August and September this year, the government had decided to shut down the schools with student strength less than 20. The government argued that it would lead to improvement in the learning environment, better infrastructure facilities, better academic environment and co-curricular facilities for the students.Also read: Tejashwi Yadav faces corruption charges, must not become leader of opposition - JD(U)The move termed “Consolidation and rationalisation” under Niti Aayog’s Sustainable Action for Transforming Human Capital in Education (SATH-E) project is already under implementation with several such schools being merged with the nearest bigger schools called Lead Schools over last few months.At an all-party meeting organised in Bhubaneswar by Odisha Abhibhabaka Mahasangha, the BJP demanded that when the pandemic is yet to subside this kind of decision to close down government schools is not acceptable.

The reinforced concrete pipes have diameter from six to eight feet, which allows troops to easily move underground from one location to other without being exposed to enemy fire. The other benefit of tunnels is that they can be heated and shelter the troops from polar temperatures and snow blizzards.Also Read: China is fortifying defences across Ladakh border, not prepping to disengageWhile the ninth round of India-China military dialogue to disengage and de-escalate from the friction points is expected to take place soon, the Indian Army has settled down to defend the LAC from any further transgression by the PLA. The Indian security planners are quite clear that the restoration of status quo ante has to begin with PLA, which started the entire build-up by transgressing on the north banks of Pangong Tso early May 2020. The PLA then followed the Pangong Tso aggression by making similar moves in Galwan river valley and Gogra-Hot Springs area near Kongka La.The Indian Army is not only defending the Ladakh LAC but also keeping a close watch on PLA moves in Central, Sikkim and Eastern sectors with the Chinese army continuing to build military infrastructure in Tibet.The Indian diplomacy is also in no hurry to negotiate an early withdrawal of PLA from east Ladakh and believes that restoration of status quo ante is the only just solution even if it takes a long time. “The PLA always like a staring match waiting for adversary to blink. But this aggressive tactic will not succeed with India,” said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-take-a-leaf-out-of-chinese-warfare-deploys-tunnel-defences-in-ladakh/story-4RVVPMjeofhzB9kUQCKTeL.html

The central agency had searched the couple’s office and house and recovered 86.5 gram of cannabis from both the places, according to reports.The agency, acting on a tip-off, had on Saturday conducted search at Singh’s office and residence as part of its probe into the alleged drug use in the entertainment industry. “Both Ms Bharti Singh and her husband Harsh Limbachiya accepted consumption of ganja,” an NCB release earlier said.Here is what we know so far:1. Singh, who has appeared in a number of comedy and reality shows on television and also hosted such shows, was arrested by NCB after the seizure of cannabis from her house in suburban Andheri on Saturday. The comedian was arrested under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.2. Her husband was arrested on Sunday after more than 12 hours of questioning.3. Singh and Limbachiyaa were taken to a hospital for medical examination on Sunday.The couple along with two others arrested in the case would be produced before a court in Mumbai after their medical examination.4. The quantity of drug allegedly seized from Singh’s possession is considered as “small quantity” under the act, as against “commercial quantity”, an NCB official said.5. Up to 1,000 gm of ganja is considered small quantity, which attracts jail term up to six months and/or fine of Rs 10,000. Possession of commercial quantity -- 20 kg or more -- can attract up to 20 years in jail. For the quantity in between, the punishment can be as much as 10 years in jail.6. “Singh’s name had cropped up during the interrogation of a drug peddler,” the official said.7. NCB had earlier raided a place in Khar Danda area and nabbed a 21-year-old trafficker with various drugs including 15 blots of LSD (commercial quantity), ganja (40 grams), and Nitrazepam (psychotropic medicines).8. NCB has been probing the alleged drug use in Bollywood after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June this year on the basis of WhatsApp chats.9. The central agency earlier arrested Rajput’s girlfriend, Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, some employees of the late actor and a few others under various sections of the NDPS act. Rhea Chakraborty and some other accused are currently out on bail. 10.

A study by global travel technology company, Amadeus, found that technology plays a crucial role in supporting recovery amid the pandemic.40 per cent of Indians said that they want an effective test, track and trace programmes to contain infections. Mobile applications that provide on-trip notifications and alerts emerged as the most appealing technology to increase confidence for Indian travellers. Ability to have boarding passes on their mobile phones would also avoid any physical or face-to-face contact.The company collected data from over 6,000 travellers across India, Singapore, France, Germany, UK and US. Indian respondents said that access to technology that reduces human contact, queues and physical touchpoints was the ultimate factor for getting them travelling again. This was most important for baby boomers, where 73 per cent of respondents cited it as their top concern compared with 28 per cent of Generation Z. This was followed by the assurance of sanitisation, hygiene and safety measures in hotels and accommodations and limiting the number of passengers on flights.Also read: PM Modi launches ‘Har Ghar Nal Yojna’, 3,000 villages in UP to benefit34 per cent of the Indian respondents said that they want to minimize face-to-face or physical contact with others, 32 per cent of them said that they would want such a technology that would reduce queues and congestion in public places, compared to 45 per cent in Singapore. 31 per cent Indians want to minimize the requirement of physical documents.Cyril Tetaz, executive vice president of airlines Amadeus Asia-Pacific said, “Beyond technology, collaboration across industry and governments will continue to be key to this recovery. We need to educate travellers with the right information around safety and sanitisation measures during the stages of their journey, despite recent research from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) on the extremely low rates of transmissions onboard aircraft due to cabin air filtering systems and other protection measures.”On the other hand, AirAsia India conducted a study to identify the ‘travel intent’ among the Indian consumers who flew in the last 24 months to understand their travel purpose and preferences - pre and post Covid. The airline’s collected data stated that ‘while the demand has been slowly and steadily recovering post-Covid lockdown, it is encouraging to see optimism for travel over the next three months. 50 per cent of surveyed respondents stated that they definitely planned to travel over the next 3 months with another 36 per cent indicating that they are considering travelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-pandemic-56-of-indians-believe-technology-will-boost-their-confidence-to-travel-study/story-tP8MqLr1RHRFoSO4yn2tZJ.html

22-11-2020||India||Petition in SC alleges lack of publicity of Bihar poll candidates’ criminal past||A contempt petition has been filed in the Supreme Court (SC) against the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and prominent political parties in the fray in the Bihar assembly elections, which concluded on November 7, for allegedly flouting the mandatory direction of the apex court to widely publicise criminal antecedents of candidates, who had contested the polls. Brajesh Singh, a Nalanda-based lawyer, moved the SC, seeking that contempt proceedings be initiated against CEC Sunil Arora, Bihar’s Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) HR Srinivas, KC Tyagi of the ruling Janata Dal (United), Jagdanand Singh of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Abdul Khalik of the Loktantrik Janta Party (LJP), Randeep Singh Surjewala of Indian National Congress (INC) and BL Santhosh of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The petition has accused these political parties of not complying with the direction to give publicity of criminal antecedents of candidates in widely circulated newspapers, social media platforms, and their respective websites. The SC had given this direction on February 13 while deciding on a contempt petition urging political parties to comply with the law laid down by a five-judge constitution bench in September 2018, which had ordered candidates to mandatorily disclose their criminal cases before polls. In February, the apex court had directed what the form and content of such disclosure should be. It even required political parties to give compelling reasons for selecting such persons with criminal antecedents. The contempt petition stated that most political parties published details of criminal cases against their candidates in less circulated newspapers instead of leading dailies in Bihar. According to the petition, this amounted to contempt of the court orders, which required publicity to be done through widely circulated newspapers and that, too, at least three times after filing of nomination papers of a tainted candidate. The petition pointed out that “political parties mainly published the criminal antecedents of their candidates on their websites and in some less circulated based newspapers and some in a limited manner on social media but nobody got it published in any national newspapers as directed by the apex court”. The petition further stated that some political parties fielded candidates with dozens of criminal cases against them, including serious offences. Such brazen violation of the SC direction was cocking a snook at the apex court’s order, which had sought to create checks and balances while nominating a candidate. A survey, which was conducted by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), a non-partisan, non-governmental organisation (NGO) that works in the area of electoral and political reforms, has revealed that of the 241 elected candidates in the 243-member newly constituted Bihar Assembly, 163 have pending criminal cases pending against them. The figure translates to 68% of the elected lawmakers are tainted. Of this 68%, over 50% or 123 legislators have serious criminal cases pending against them such as murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping, and crimes against women. In the previous Bihar legislative assembly, 142 lawmakers were tainted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petition-in-sc-complain-about-lack-of-publicity-of-bihar-poll-candidates-criminal-past/story-JDxTd9ZhurB7wf87rSgTJI.html

They gunned down two villagers, who have identified as Birendra Yadav and Jai Ram Yadav. The rebels opened fire about 50 rounds of bullets,” said Rajiv Mishra, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Gaya. The CoBRA battalion, which was conducting an area domination operation about 500 metres (m) away from the spot, took on the Maoist rebels after hearing gunshots.The Maoist commander was killed in the retaliatory fire, while four CoBRA jawans and three civilians sustained injuries. Soon, the Maoist rebels beat a hasty retreat in a bid to escape the CoBRA jawans’ line of fire.“The injured civilians are out of danger. Bloodstains were found at the spot, which indicated some of the Maoist rebels might have been killed or wounded by gunshots. Search operations are in progress in the area,” the SSP.The incident spot is located about 150 kilometres (km) away from the state capital, Patna.“The pre-meditated attack is a fallout of the frustration among the rank and file of the Maoist rebels, who don’t see any future in their violent mission against the state. They tried to target villagers in a bid to unleash a reign of terror in a bid to dissuade their members from laying down arms and joining the mainstream,” the SSP said.“The deceased Birendra was a Maoist sympathiser and his sister-in-law heads the Nadarpur panchayat. Earlier, his elder brother, brother, Sambhu Yadav, was killed by the LWE ultras in 2005 and his house was also set on fire,” the SSP added.Police suspect that the recovered Insas and AK-47 rifles might have been looted from security forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-kill-two-villagers-in-gaya-their-commander-gunned-down-by-forces/story-HqfOC2d4NXyGHX1h2vrv2K.html

The legislator added that there was not much the state governments could do as the border issue between the two states was pending in the Supreme Court.Yanthan also reiterated what Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma recently reported to have said, that once a settlement comes vis-à-vis the Naga political issue, the border matter would also be resolved.Also read: Human trials of Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate to begin in India this weekMeanwhile, when contacted, deputy commissioner (DC) Mokokchung Limawabang Jamir said although no untoward incidents were reported, the public were getting restive due to the economic blockade and authorities were apprehensive that the situation may flare up if the indefinite blockade continued.The official informed that he was in touch with his Jorhat counterpart and there will be a DC/SP level meeting on November 25 in Jorhat to discuss the issue and de-escalate the tension.“I have spoken to DC Jorhat this morning telephonically, requesting her to intervene and convince the blockade enforcers to call off the indefinite blockade. She (DC Jorhat) assured that she will discuss with the organisations,” Jamir said.The current issue is stated to have escalated after Assam organizations accused Nagaland of setting up a police camp inside Dissoi Valley Reserved Forest and deployed armed Assam police to the area and also erected a temporary camp near the disputed area.Nagaland and Assam share a 512-kilometre boundary and a dispute that has been going on for over five decades.

The two-day long exercise, SITMEX-2020, is scheduled in a “non-contact, at sea only format”, in wake of the Covid-19 restrictions.The primary aim of the exercise is to further consolidate interoperability between the three navies and also enhance understanding, sharing best practices and procedures for multi-faceted maritime operations.This edition of the exercise would involve a war-at-sea exercise, naval manoeuvres, weapon firing on the surface and aerial targets, seamanship evolutions, and coordinated navigation operations.The Indian Navy is represented by two indigenous warships -- an ASW corvette, INS Kamorta, and a guided Missile corvette, INS Karmuk. The force would also include the ships’ integral air assets.The Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) is represented by RSS Intrepid, a formidable class stealth frigate, and RSS Endeavour, an Endurance class landing platform dock. The Thailand Navy is being represented by HTMS Kraburi, a Chao Phraya class frigate.The exercise despite the challenging times posed by the pandemic is a direct testimony to India’s long-standing friendship with Singapore and Thailand with special emphasis on strong military cooperation in the Maritime domain. The exercise is envisaged to see greater cooperation in the coming years with the participation of advanced platforms in complex exercises spanning over the entire spectrum of warfare at sea. On conclusion of SITMEX, participating ships from RSN will exercise with the Indian Navy as part of SIMBEX 20, in the Bay of Bengal.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his keynote address at Shangri-La Dialogue in June 2018, announced the conduct of a trilateral naval exercise between India, Singapore, and Thailand.The maiden edition of the exercise was conducted off Andaman and Nicobar Islands in September 2019 with the harbour phase conducted at Port Blair and a sea phase in the Andaman Sea spanning over five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sitmex-2020-india-singapore-thailand-naval-exercise-begins/story-zwfE9hUcZk7iFxGgRTAcHM.html
22-11-2020||India||India needs to orient its political system to deliver on governance | Opinion||Governance in India over the years exemplifies the proverb ‘plus ca change, plus c’est la même chose’, the more it changes, the more it remains the same.India has been ruled by political parties across the spectrum, from the left to right, and, everything in between. Yet, the picture of governance overall remains dismal. Idealists have headed the government, pragmatists have headed the government, and, so have sheer opportunists. But the end result has been no different. At one end, the party with overwhelming majority has headed the state, and, at the other, a single member party has held the reins of power. All permutations and combinations have been tried at various times but good governance has been conspicuous by its absence.Good governance, reduced to its essence, has only three-fold function.The first is to maintain law and order, the second, to assure justice and fair play, and the third, to provide civil amenities required for proper living. With these three assured, developmental activities normally generate themselves.On the economic front, we started with Soviet-style five-year-plans which, of late, are being rolled back once too often. The massive investments in the public sector enterprises not withstanding, these enterprises have, by and large, become loss-making units. The ‘Nava Ratna’ group apart, the public sector has actually become the private sector of the politician. We have played with the public sector, private sector, public-private partnership and what not, making changes all along. But the economy is nowhere near the level required for the population of one and a quarter billion and growing.On the political front, we have a working parliamentary democracy, Westminster style. Style yes, but working, no. Close to half of our parliamentarians have criminal cases of all hues against them. They have not become the members of the august house by themselves but have been elected by the people. The same is true of the gram panchayat at the lowest end of the democratic governance as the gram pradhan is no saint and yet chosen by the village folk.Governance has failed across the board and the question is why? The answer, if we look for it, is obvious.Our leading lights, political, social and the whole ‘think tank’, in the cricketing parlance, have read the pitch wrong and overestimated the batsmen.The best bowling of the finest ideas is ineffective on a dead pitch. To quote the famous philosopher Kant, “laziness and cowardice are the reasons why so great a portion of mankind, after nature has long since discharged them from external direction, nevertheless remains under lifelong tutelage and why it is so easy for others to set themselves up as their guardians”. Our society is the pitch, full of the slush of laziness and cowardice, not allowing any ball of ideas, pace or spin, to move any further than the first drop.This civilization, several millennia old, is tired, and the people unresponsive; are resigned to fate.The people’s representatives, elected or selected, are a weak batting side unable to face the in-swingers of greed, or the out-swingers of ambition, or the googly of flattery. As John Adams, the successor of George Washington put it: “It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy . It is not true and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government. When unchecked, they produce the same effects of fraud and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, avarice or ambition for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation.”Our representatives are neither philosophers nor moralists, and can resist, in the words of Oscar Wilde, anything but temptation. In mathematical language, one can define human frailties as a tensor, an entity which is invariant of the coordinate system. Changing the political frame of reference only changes its projection on a preferred axis but the entity remains the same. The administrators swear by the constitution in public, but swear at it in private. Manifestos change, slogans change, and the color of the cap changes but the wearer is still a wolf in sheep’s clothing who, given half a chance, would devour Little Red Riding Hood.Let us face facts, the noble concept of democracy had a short run even in the city state of Athens and Socrates was sentenced to death for being truthful. The dictatorship of the proletariat mutated into power in the hands of the communist party, and labour camps in Siberia for the dissenters. Likewise, the national socialism of Hitler resulted in world war and gas chambers for an entire race. It is high time that we accept that concepts of absolute liberty, absolute justice, economic, social or whatever, absolute equality and absolute fraternity, like absolute alcohol, get badly diluted when put to practice out in the open. The best we can attempt is to orient the political system so that the projections on the good axes exceed those on the bad ones.(The writer is Vice Chancellor Emeritus of Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-needs-to-orient-its-political-system-to-deliver-on-governance-opinion/story-EpeVrU1KwpxPOYYdKiNgVL.html

22-11-2020||India||Farmers agree to let trains run in Punjab||Punjab’s farmer unions announced on Saturday that they will completely lift their nearly two-month-long rail blockade against the Centre’s new agriculture laws from Monday, clearing the way for movement of goods and passenger trains to ply in the state. However, the unions have given 15 days’ time to the Centre to take a decision on the withdrawal of the laws; if that doesn’t happen, they have threatened to restart the blockade.Saturday’s announcement came after chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh invited leaders of all 31 farmer unions to Chandigarh for talks to break the deadlock over resuming train services in Punjab. Also Read | Famers plan protest in Delhi from Nov 26“Had a fruitful meeting with Kisan Unions. Happy to share that starting from November 23, unions have decided to end rail blockades for 15 days. I welcome this step as it will restore normalcy to our economy. I urge the Centre to resume rail services to Punjab forthwith,” the chief minister tweeted soon after the meeting. Amarinder urged the Centre to support his government in creating a congenial environment for ending the agitation, which he said had grave repercussions for the state and the nation. Punjab farmers’ bodies initially said on Wednesday that they would consider allowing passenger trains to run in the state if the Centre started running the goods trains first. However, the railways refused, saying it would either operate both freight and passenger trains or none. The suspension of goods trains has hit supplies of fertilisers for the agriculture sector and coal for thermal power plants, besides adversely affecting industry. The decision to lift the rail blockade was announced by Bharti Kissan Union (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal at a meeting of representatives of the farmer unions with the chief minister to resolve the imbroglio.“If the Centre fails to address our issues and clarify its stand on withdrawal of bills within 15 days, we will again start our agitation,” said Rajewal.

Singh also promised the farmer representatives that he would look into their other demands, including those related to a sugarcane price hike and clearance of dues, as well as withdrawal of FIRs registered in stubble burning cases. He said he would hold talks with them on these issues within the next week, and also set up a committee of officers to discuss the matter. Singh said the Centre’s decision to engage with the farmer unions indicated that it was realising the grave repercussions of the hastily passed farm laws, particularly in the context of the omnipresent Pakistan threat to disturb India’s, especially Punjab’s, peace. Islamabad is sending guns, drugs, fake currency, etc through drones, and a large amount of arms and ammunition had been seized along the Punjab border, he said, adding that it is the responsibility of every Punjabi to ensure peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-agree-to-let-trains-run-in-punjab/story-sEZCqRumf1tM0u9yUHReBM.html
22-11-2020||India||Nagrota encounter: India pulls up Pakistan envoy on J&K plot||India summoned on Saturday Pakistan’s senior-most diplomat in New Delhi and lodged a strong protest over an attempted attack by the UN-designated terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) that was foiled by security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. The external affairs ministry summoned Aftab Hassan Khan, chargé d’affaires at the Pakistan high commission, and demanded that “Pakistan desists from its policy of supporting terrorists and terror groups operating from its territory and dismantle the terror infrastructure operated by terrorist outfits to launch attacks in other countries”, according to an official statement. Also Read | Nagrota attack: MEA expresses ‘serious concern’, says attempt to derail DDC electionKhan was told the Indian government is “firmly and resolutely committed to take all necessary measures to safeguard its national security in the fight against terrorism”. On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said security forces in Jammu and Kashmir had foiled a plan by JeM to “wreak major havoc and destruction” by killing four members of the group and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives. The four terrorists were gunned down during a three-hour gun battle on the Jammu-Srinagar highway on Thursday. The statement said security forces had thwarted a “major terror attack” in Nagrota, and that initial reports indicated the attackers were “members of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a terrorist organisation proscribed by the United Nations and several countries”. The huge cache of arms, ammunition and explosives seized on Thursday indicated “detailed planning for a major attack to destabilise the peace and security in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, in particular, to derail the ongoing democratic exercise of conduct of local district development council elections”, it added. “The government of India expressed its serious concerns at continued terror attacks by JeM against India,” the statement said. India’s long-standing demand that Pakistan “fulfil its international obligations and bilateral commitments to not allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India in any manner” was reiterated to the Pakistani chargé d’affaires. The statement said the JeM has been part of several attacks in India in the past, including the suicide attack in Pulwama in February 2019 that killed 40 Indian troopers and triggered a standoff between the two sides. India had carried out an air strike on a JeM facility in Balakot in retaliation for the suicide bombing. On Friday, Pakistan rejected allegations levelled by the Indian prime minister and contended they were part of “India’s desperate attempts to divert international attention from” the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. A statement issued by the Foreign Office is Islamabad also accused India of involvement in “state-sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan”. “It is evident that India has stepped up anti-Pakistan propaganda, following presentation of the dossier by Pakistan providing irrefutable evidence of India’s state-sponsorship of terrorism,” it said, referring to a dossier that was unveiled earlier this month by the civilian and military leadership. Pakistan claimed the dossier contained proof of the alleged involvement of Indian intelligence operatives in acts of terrorism but the allegations were rubbished by India. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said Pakistan still has control over terrorist infrastructure that can be used against India. “Pakistan has alternatively used the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) as the situation demands. With the focus now on LeT and Hafiz Saeed, the JeM could be used and this group has a history of carrying out spectacular attacks. Pakistan retains the capacity to disturb the status quo, both in Jammu and Kashmir, and the hinterland,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagrota-encounter-india-pulls-up-pakistan-envoy-on-j-k-plot/story-tD87ymO6fAUxyo1C3exS8L.html
22-11-2020||India||BJD targeting family, says wife of BJP’s Jay Panda||Bharatiya Janata Party vice-president Baijayant Panda and his wife, Jagi Mangat Panda, on Saturday accused the Biju Janata Dal government in Odisha of orchestrating cases against them out of political vendetta even as the BJD refuted the allegations of a witch-hunt.Alleging that the state government has been targeting their family for speaking out against alleged corruption in the state, Panda’s wife said, “It is no secret that ever since my husband Jay Panda started speaking out about the BJD’s widespread corruption five years ago, and joined the BJP, the Odisha government and BJD have been targeting and harassing our family and the organisations connected with us, including actual violence against us on several locations.” She said that the Odisha police were filing false cases against them and the companies associated with them. “In the past two months, the Odisha police have registered about 20 false cases against OTV, its sister companies, employees and my family members, including my 84-year-old father,” she said.Her statements have come a day after the Orissa high court lifted the interim protection from arrest of the BJP leader and his wife, along with the managing director of their TV channel OTV, in connection with a fraudulent land transaction. On Friday, a single judge bench of the Orissa HC vacated its interim stay on the arrest of the couple while rejecting their petition to quash the FIR filed in connection with the land transaction of Odisha Infratech Pvt Ltd. Panda and his wife are promoters of the company. According to the FIR, filed by the Economic Offence Wing of the Odisha police, Panda allegedly cheated 22 people, belonging to the Dalit community, to acquire their land in the state’s Khurda district.Jagi Mangat Panda said that her company will seek redressal in the court against the alleged harassment by state authorities. “Though there has been no wrongdoing by us and we are confident that this will ultimately be proved in the courts,” she said.The Naveen Patnaik led BJD, however, refuted these allegations of a witch-hunt against Panda.“It’s an open and shut case of fraud in land transaction in which several Dalit people have been taken for a ride. The couple, who are promoters of the company Odisha Infratech Pvt that bought the land in violation of several existing laws such as Scheduled Caste Atrocities Act and Odisha Land Reforms Act, would be summoned for joining the investigation. There is no witch-hunt,” said BJD MP Pinaki Mishra.“As per the Odisha Land Reforms Act, non-Dalit people cannot buy Dalit land. Only Dalit people can buy land of another Dalit. To bypass this law, Panda used his driver Rabi Sethi, who is a Dalit, to buy this land in Sarua and then transferred it to his company. Though Sethi was only earning Rs 8,000 per month, lakhs of rupees were transferred in these land purchases. Later, Sethi and the 22 land owners complained to the Khurda district collector stating this action as illegal and fraud,” he said.Jay Panda’s quote awaited||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjd-targeting-family-says-wife-of-bjp-s-jay-panda/story-SfHBVqhhTJjYZaSrftDxyN.html
22-11-2020||India||Kerala guv approves ordinance to check cyber bullying; experts wary||Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan cleared a state government ordinance amending the Police Act to allow any person or the authorities to file a case over social media posts that are intimidating, insulting or defamatory, a move the administration said is meant to counter cyber bullying but critics have called it a threat to free speech and media freedom.At present, defamation cases under Section 499 and 500 of Indian Penal Code can only be filed by a person who has been targeted. Kerala’s new law will allow any third person or a police officer to file complaint.Anyone producing, publishing or disseminating such content on social media will face a prison term of up to five years or a fine of up to Rs10,000 or both. The Governor, who returned to the official residence recently after recovering from Covid-19, signed the ordinance, according to an official at Raj Bhavan who asked not to be named. “We agree cyber bullying of women and children should be contained at any cost. But in the guise of fighting cyber crime, the government may target journalists who are exposing many misdeeds. Some of the wordings in the ordinance buttress our fear,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. But the government defended its position saying existing laws were not effective in dealing with such crimes. It also pointed out that the High Court had directed the state chief secretary and the director general of police (DGP) in May to initiate effective steps to curtail hate speech and bullying in social media. “Apprehension in this regard is ill-founded. Our only aim is to curb cyber attacks that are posing a major threat to private life,” said state law minister A K Balan. But the opposition wasn’t convinced. The government decided to fast-track the ordinance after three women activists, including dubbing artist Bhagyalakshmi, assaulted Youtuber Vijay P Nair last month for allegedly derogatory comments that he made on video. The High Court pulled up the activists for taking law into their hands, but they contended that they filed a complaint and police failed to take any action. Cyber and legal experts said the law could lead to serious misuse. “It will do more harm than any good. No blogger, online media person or cyber activist can write on any topic. It can be used to settle scores. Intention is good, but implementation will be disastrous,” said legal expert and cyber activist Jiyas Jamal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-guv-approves-ordinance-to-check-cyber-bullying-experts-wary/story-ed5iSbZDOkBT45Aw7TnMKN.html
22-11-2020||India||1 killed in police firing during stir in Tripura over Bru resettlement||At least one person was killed and nearly 23 were injured in North Tripura on Saturday when police opened fire at protesters, who had blocked the Assam-Agartala National Highway at Panisagar against the resettlement of Bru migrants from neighbouring Mizoram, police said. According to the police, 46-year-old Srikanta Das died in police firing and others were injured when police personnel used baton charge to control a group of people protesting in support of an indefinite bandh, or shutdown, against rehabilitation of Bru refugees. Those injured include 15 police and fire service personnel, an official added.Tripura’s additional director general of police, Rajiv Singh, said the police fired in self defence as the protesters became violent. “The National Highway was blocked since morning without permission. They didn’t move even when we tried to convince them. As they turned violent, we resorted to mild lathi charge. The protesters became uncontrollable and they tried to snatch weapons and in self-defence police fired,” he said.In view of the violence, a huge contingent of security forces has been mobilised in affected parts of the state. The police has claimed that the situation is under control.A magistrate-level probe has been ordered by the government into the incident. Later in the day, state law minister Ratan Lal Nath announced ₹ 5 lakh compensation to the family of the person who died in the protest.On November 16, two local organisations --- Nagarik Suraksha Mancha and Mizo Convention under the banner Joint Movement Committee -- launched an indefinite strike at Kanchanpur in North district against the central government’s decision to rehabilitate around 35,000 tribal Bru refugees from Mizoram back to Tripura.They demanded that the Bru migrants should get settlement in all the eight districts of the state to prevent their concentration in Kanchanpur sub division.The law and order situation deteriorated on November 18, when the local administration imposed prohibitory orders after a water supply operator was allegedly assaulted by some local people. Soon, the protest spread to different parts of North district including Panisagar, Pecharthal and Kailasahar in Unakoti district.Convener of JMC Sushanta Bikash Barua has, however, claimed that the police fired on the protesters who were agitating peacefully.“Protesters were agitating peacefully. The police opened fire on them without any provocation. One died on the spot and many others were severely injured,” Baruah was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The Bru issue started in September 1997 following demands of a separate autonomous district council by carving out areas of western Mizoram adjoining Bangladesh and Tripura. About 30,000 Bru tribals had fled Mizoram due to the ethnic tension and took shelter in refugee camps in Tripura.In January 2020, the Union home ministry signed an agreement with the governments of Tripura and Mizoram and the Bru migrants for their permanent settlement in Tripura. The Centre also announced a Rs. 600 crore package for their resettlement.Anthony Debbarma, a social activist, said, “The resettlement of the Bru people was decided by the Centre. Whatever situation occurred today, it should not have happened. But we want to say the protesters who are against their resettlement might have forgotten that they themselves resettled here. We condemned such kinds of protests.”According to an expert, the Bru resettlement process, as agreement was already signed, should happen without disturbing anyone’s interests. “The state government should have talked to the protesters beforehand, to come out with a solution. We could have avoided such kind of incident today,” the expert said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-killed-in-police-firing-during-stir-in-tripura-over-bru-resettlement/story-FRFptJLR8CQm9cRteMhrtK.html
22-11-2020||India||PM Modi calls for decisive action by G20 to counter Covid-19 impact||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called for greater transparency in governance systems and decisive action by the G20 to counter the impact of the Covid-19 crisis that should focus on both economic recovery and preserving the planet. Modi participated in the two-day virtual summit being chaired by Saudi Arabia along with the heads of state and government of the 19 member countries and representatives of the European Union and international organisations. Describing the pandemic as an important turning point in history and the biggest challenge faced by the world since World War 2, he called for decisive action by the G20 that should not be limited to economic recovery, jobs and trade, but also focus on preserving the earth. Also Read | ‘Covid-19 biggest challenge since World War 2’: PM Modi at G20 summitModi called for greater transparency in governance systems to inspire people to deal with shared challenges and said dealing with the environment as “trustees rather than owners” will lead to a holistic and healthy lifestyle, a principle whose benchmark could be a per capita carbon footprint. He also sought a new global index for the post-coronavirus world consisting of four elements – creation of a vast talent pool, ensuring technology reaches all segments of society, transparency in governance systems, and dealing with the earth with a spirit of trusteeship. This can help the G20 lay the foundation of a new world, he said. In the past few decades, there was an emphasis on capital and finance and the time has now come to focus on multi-skilling and re-skilling. This will enhance the dignity of people and make them more resilient to face crises, he said. He added any assessment of new technology should be based on its impact on ease of living and quality of life. Since “work from anywhere” is the new normal in the post-Covid-19 world, Modi suggested the creation of a G20 “virtual secretariat” as a follow-up and documentation repository. This was the third summit this month where Modi and President Xi Jinping were on the same platform amid the India-China border standoff. They had earlier joined the summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping. The summit with the theme “Realising opportunities of the 21st century for all” has assumed importance in the wake of the pandemic, and its agenda includes two sessions focused on overcoming the pandemic, economic recovery and restoring jobs, and building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future. There are also side events on pandemic preparedness and safeguarding the planet. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Gavi Board chair, told the event on pandemic preparedness: “The virus is winning. Only through adequate financing for a global exit strategy like Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) can economic vitality be restored at home and catastrophe in the poorest countries averted.” A commitment by G20 leaders to invest $4.6 billion to fill the ACT Accelerator’s immediate funding gap will save lives, lay the groundwork for mass procurement and delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines, he said. In his opening remarks, Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz said the G20 countries pledged over $21 billion to support global efforts to combat the pandemic and injected over $11 trillion to support individuals and businesses. “Although we are optimistic about the progress made in developing vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics tools for Covid-19, we must work to create the conditions for affordable and equitable access to these tools for all peoples. At the same time, we must prepare better for any future pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-calls-for-decisive-action-by-g20-to-counter-covid-19-impact/story-QGtalonQTsaHa54CGFZ4CK.html
22-11-2020||India||Low testing in initial stages may have led to Covid-19 surge: Panel||The parliamentary standing committee of health submitted its report on India’s response to the coronavirus disease pandemic on Saturday, appreciating the role of the 68-day lockdown in slowing the spread of the virus, criticising the initial shortage of equipment and infrastructure, and stressing the importance of being ready for a possible second wave of the infection.The multi-party committee of Indian Parliament said “poor contact tracing and less testing” might have led to the exponential growth of Covid-19 cases in the country, adding that a multitude of advisories may have led to confusion. Click here for complete coverage on Covid-19 The standing committee on health presented its report—the first from a parliamentary committee on Covid—on a day when the total cases in India touched 9,095,782, with 133,262 deaths, and even as Delhi reels under a fresh surge of infections. The panel pointed out “few glaring lapses” such as “shortage of emergency supplies, red-tapism, shortage and quality of testing kits, and delay in domestic production” and said India must also be prepared to tackle a possible second wave of Covid—as evident in many European countries—especially in the winter season and “superspreading series of festive-events”. On November 21, HT wrote about the imminent onset of the second wave. The committee blamed poor contact tracing and inadequate testing for the exponential growth of cases in the country. HT repeatedly pointed this out in the initial months of the pandemic. It was only in August that India became aggressive with its testing. However, even then, many of the tests were conducted using rapid antigen testing kits, which are unreliable, a fact that didn’t escape the panel’s notice. The committee said it is worried at the use of “less reliable diagnostic tests which increase the chances of false negatives.” Rapid antigen tests sometimes fail to identify 50% of infections. It added that RT-PCR tests remain the gold standard . Panel chairman, Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav, virtually presented the report to Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday. The report said the Covid would have hit India harder if “we had not hit the history books for guidance”. It termed janta curfew on March 22, the marathon federal lockdown, the phased and gradual reopening, travel restrictions and social distancing measures as “successful” but observed “there have been few glaring lapses like shortage of emergency supplies, red-tapism, shortage and quality of testing kits, delay in domestic production etc.” The report also added that a “plethora of guidelines issued by the ministry” for containment of outbreak “caused ambiguity in interpretation”. “The contradiction in guidelines and the resultant chaos among the general masses could have been averted” and “the separate guidelines on the quarantine issue by different State Governments created more panic and confusion” it said. The parliamentary panel also expressed concern that “the total number of government hospital beds in the country was grossly inadequate” in the wake of rising incidence of Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/low-testing-in-initial-stages-may-have-led-to-covid-19-surge-panel/story-8ItPtekyFnbGMxH2gwMInL.html
22-11-2020||India||Delhi winter to be colder than usual this year||The Capital is likely to have a colder winter than usual this year, according to India Meteorological Department scientists who cited a Pacific Ocean weather phenomenon known as La Nina, which leads to a cascading impact on global weather in winter months.During La Nina, temperatures in central Pacific Ocean drops below normal levels, triggering wind patterns can influence weather in far away regions. This has been linked to colder than usual winters in northwest India.“Both maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to remain around 2-2.5°C below normal this entire season. Also, since winter is setting in early with temperatures already low, the minimum is likely to fall to 5-6°C as early as December 10. This usually happens after December 20,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC). He added that day temperatures, or the maximum, will begin falling in early December. Local factors too have contributed to making days colder. Delhi has had a cloudless streak, with only one Western Disturbance so far bringing in any moisture. “When there are no clouds, the ground cools faster and the minimum temperatures stay low,” he explained. On Friday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 7.5°C, five notches below normal and the lowest November temperature in 14 years. On Saturday, it rose slightly to settle at 8.5°C, while the maximum was at 24.6°C..In the immediate days, Srivastava said that the minimum is expected to fall further to 7°C on Sunday before a Western Disturbance on November 23 briefly causes a slight increase. Once that passes, days and nights will become colder again. “When global conditions like La Nina are prevailing, there is a tendency for regions under northwest India to get colder,” said VK Soni of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre.Soni added that at present, the dip in mercury is accompanied by strong winds that helps in blowing away pollutants but after November 23, wind speed is likely to reduce and trigger a deterioration in air quality.On Saturday, the average wind speed was around 16-17kmph, and the air was in the poor zone with the 24-hour average air quality index at 4pm being 251.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weather-experts-predict-colder-than-normal-winter-as-la-nina-takes-hold-in-delhi/story-O3s9LL8gBlHXtL55Kqmu1J.html
22-11-2020||India||Man who stabbed Agra dentist held after encounter||A 38-year-old dental surgeon was stabbed to death at her home in Agra and her two children were injured by a robber who entered the house on the pretext of recharging the family’s set-top-box on Friday afternoon, police officials said on Saturday, adding that the suspect has been arrested. According to police, the accused, identified as Shubham Pathak, entered the house of the deceased, Dr Nisha Singhal, with the intention of robbing the family. “Dr Nisha Singhal was at home along with her two children when the accused reached the house. He was a known face for the doctor’s family as he used to come for television re-charging,” inspector general (Agra Range) A Satish Ganesh said. The accused allegedly stabbed the dentist with a knife multiple times while her children were in another room, Ganesh said. Her husband, Dr Ajay Singhal, was not at the house at the time of the incident, he added.The accused was arrested on Saturday following a brief gunfight. “Police teams were constituted and the accused was seen driving a motorcycle in trans-Yamuna area the following day (Saturday). Police vigil was enhanced and a barrier was placed at 100 feet road where the accused reached but he saw the police and tried to escape. He then fired at police and was injured in counter firing and arrested,” Ganesh said, adding that Pathak has been hospitalised with a bullet injury in his legs.“During interrogation, the accused confessed to the crime. He also attacked the son and daughter of the doctor,” the IG said. The children, four and eight, are being treated at a hospital, he said.The police have recovered the jewellery and cash that Pathak stole from Singhal’s house. “Police recovered ₹24,000 cash, jewellery, Singhal’s Aadhaar card and Pathak’s driving license from his bag,” the IG said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-who-stabbed-agra-dentist-held-after-encounter/story-evquqZX5X3hmjzfzzedjKP.html
22-11-2020||India||AIADMK and BJP reaffirm Tamil Nadu coalition||The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will fight the 2021 Tamil Nadu elections as partners, chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam announced in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday, reaffirming an alliance that seemed to be strained in recent weeks.The announcement came while Shah is on a two-day visit to the state, which began in Chennai with an unscheduled stop by the Union minister outside the airport to greet big crowds of BJP supporters. Later, he inaugurated a string of projects and hit out at the main rival coalition, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Congress. “The victorious alliance will continue for the coming elections,” said Panneerselvam after Shah inaugurated infrastructure projects worth ₹67,378 crore. The two partnered along with other regional parties for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections when the BJP drew a blank and the AIADMK won one seat. The state has 39 constituencies.Though Shah did not speak on the alliance, he said the Narendra Modi-led Union government will support Tamil Nadu’s administration. In a 43-minute speech, Shah spoke in Hindi aided by a Tamil translator. He attacked the opposition DMK-Congress coalition, mostly on the issues of corruption and dynasty politics. “I’m surprised they can even speak of corruption after the 2G scam. What right do they have?” said Shah. He added that Modi has been against corruption, dynasty politics and caste-based politics. “People will teach a lesson to those who practice family politics,” he said. “I hear DMK leaders often say that the Centre is being unjust towards Tamil Nadu. What did you do when you were with the Congress in power for ten years,” said Shah. He added that Centre’s budgetary allocation for Tamil Nadu under the Modi government was higher than what it was during former prime minister Manmohan Singh’s tenure in 2013-2014.The rousing welcome according to the BJP leader was unusual since the party’s leader have faced protests in previous visits. In 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended government events by taking a helicopter as people with black flags lined the streets. But some protests were evident on Saturday as the #gobackAmithShah hashtag began trending on Twitter since Friday night, in tandem with another hashtag #TNwelcomesChanakya that popped up on Saturday.Following the inaugurations, Shah held meetings with AIADMK and BJP leaders at a private hotel to prepare for the polls. BJP has been attempting to make inroads into Tamil Nadu, where elections this year will be the first since the deaths of the two Dravidian political stalwarts, AIADMK’s J Jayalalithaa and DMK’s M Karunanidhi. The AIADMK has been in power for the past 10 years.In recent weeks, a series of confrontations between the AIADMK-led government and the Tamil Nadu BJP fuelled speculation that the coalition was under a strain. In particular was the fight over BJP’s Vetrivel yatra (victorious spear march), which the government said cannot proceed due to Covid-19 concerns, and the choice of the chief ministerial candidate. According to AIADMK leaders, the timing of the announcement on Saturday came as a surprise. A senior leader, who asked not to be named, said party members were not consulted. “It was totally unexpected,” the leader said. “There was no indication of this announcement even when we had a consultative meeting a day ago (Friday). We had not discussed alliances.”Political experts too said the timing may not be right. “It is too early to announce alliances,” said Ramu Manivannan, head, politics and public administration department, University of Madras. “And it should not have been done on a stage organised for government programmes.” Late in the night, Shah began consultations with BJP’s core committee members that included state president L Murugan and veteran leaders Pon Radhakrishnan, L Ganesan and H Raja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-and-bjp-reaffirm-tamil-nadu-coalition/story-AvoAX2WmCHUOaJZKkLNPJI.html
22-11-2020||India||Telangana BJP starts attracting Congress leaders ahead of GHMC polls||Fresh from the victory in the recent by-elections to the Dubbak assembly seat in Siddipet district, the Bharatiya Janata Party in Telangana has started attracting potential leaders from other parties ahead of the prestigious elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). On Saturday, senior Congress leader and former Union minister of state for transport Sarvey Satyanarayana announced that he was quitting the party to join the BJP. “The Congress has collapsed totally in Telangana and has no future. The people have realized that BJP is the only alternative to the Telangana Rashtra Samiti,” Satyanarayana told reporters. Considered to be a hardcore loyalist of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, Satyanarayana had been sulking ever since he was denied a party ticket to contest the 2019 parliamentary elections from Malkajgiri which he had represented in the past. On Friday, BJP state president Bandi Sanjay and former MP G Vivek went to Satyanarayana’s residence in Secunderabad and convinced him to join the BJP. “I have no complaints against Sonia ji. I am joining the BJP with her blessings. The Telangana PCC leaders are responsible for the debacle of the party in all the elections, including the recent Dubbak by-polls,” the ex-Union minister said. The BJP leaders also held talks with Youth Congress leader M Vikram Goud, son of former Congress minister late Mukesh Goud, and invited him into the party. Goud had been unhappy with the PCC leadership for denying party tickets to his followers in the ongoing GHMC elections. “He is expected to join the BJP in a day or two,” a state BJP leader familiar with the development said. Another senior Congress leader and former Hyderabad Mayor Banda Karthika Reddy along with her husband Chandra Reddy also joined the BJP three days ago. So did former MLA from Serilingampalli P Bhikshapathi Yadav and his son Ravi Kumar Yadav, a Youth Congress leader, earlier in the week. The BJP also made an attempt to attract prominent industrialist and former MP from Chevella constituency Konda Vishweshwar Reddy. BJP national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, who was appointed as the party in-charge for GHMC polls, went to Reddy’s residence and held parleys. However, the former MP issued a statement stating that he would continue in the Congress party and the meeting with Bhupendra Yadav had no political significance. Another former MP and actor M Vijayashanti, who had been the star campaigner of the Congress in the last elections, is also likely to join the BJP soon. She has been keeping away from the Congress party activities for quite some time. PCC working president and former MP Ponnam Prabhakar lashed out at the BJP for “shamelessly luring the Congress leaders,” as it had no strength of its own. He said leaders like Banda Karthika Reddy and Sarvey Satyanarayana had been suspended from the party long ago for their anti-party activities. “The BJP leaders are trying to attract voters by polarizing Hindu votes, showing the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen as a villain,” Prabhakar alleged. Meanwhile, the BJP leaders are also looking to trap disgruntled TRS leaders as well to gain advantage in the GHMC elections. On Saturday, Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy, along with other leaders, met senior TRS leader and former chairman of state legislative council T Swamy Goud and invited him into the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-bjp-starts-attracting-congress-leaders-ahead-of-ghmc-polls/story-aNwble1NvGqKfZMdhnMfHK.html

22-11-2020||Editorials||A draconian step in Kerala||Kerala has decided to enforce a new law to give police the sweeping powers to arrest and prosecute people for social media posts deemed intimidating, insulting or defamatory — bringing back a provision that critics say will lead to State overreach and undermine fundamental rights guaranteed to all Indians. The law, being brought in through an executive order the governor signed off on Saturday, says a person can be punished with a prison term of up to three years or a fine of up to ₹10,000 (or both) if they are found guilty under what will be known as Section 118(A) of the Kerala Police Act. The move is necessary to stop hate speech and cyber bullying, the state government has said, citing in particular a recent case of a YouTuber who made purportedly derogatory remarks targeting women in a video.The key wording of the Section 118(A) — it seeks to punish people for “any matter or subject for threatening, abusing, humiliating or defaming a person or class of persons” — harks back to two similar laws that have been struck down by Indian courts. In 2015, the Supreme Court found that Section 66A of the Information Technology Act violated the fundamental right to free speech under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and did not qualify as a reasonable restriction under Article 19(2). Known as the Shreya Singhal order, it is seen as a milestone for Indian jurisprudence for several reasons. It upheld the liberty of thought and expression as “cardinal” and criticised vague legal wordings that allowed for misinterpretation and misuse by law enforcement. It also addressed a more fundamental challenge in regulating speech, when judges J Chelameswar and Rohinton F Nariman said: “What may be offensive to one person may not be offensive to another”.The old Kerala law — Section 118(D) of Kerala Police Act — suffered from same problems as Section 66A and was struck down by the top court. There is little to suggest the new one is on a more sound legal footing. It appears to violate the spirit of the Shreya Singhal judgment and, by defining the crime it attempts at punishing as cognisable, gives the State the power to open investigations on its own. The Kerala government’s justifications fail to address the criticism that there are sections of the Indian Penal Code and IT Act that it can instead utilise. Those laws also have in-built safeguards. Kerala must step back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-draconian-step-in-kerala/story-MPfJFG9veK3TkpZVWEPVqN.html
22-11-2020||Editorials||Renew commitment to renewable energy||Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated that India is confident of having 175GW of renewable energy (RE) by 2022 and 450GW by 2030. On November 26, the PM will inaugurate the third Global Renewable Energy Investment Meeting and Expo, once again signaling to the global renewable community India’s commitment to the development and scaling up of RE to meet its energy requirements. As of September 30, India’s total installed power capacity is over 373 GW, and, of that, coal accounts for 199.59 GW while renewable is 89.22 GW. With a population of 1.4 billion and a growing economy, India will be vital for the future of global energy markets. Ensuring citizens access to electricity and clean cooking has been at the top of the political agenda. Around 750 million people in India gained access to electricity between 2000 and 2019. There has been significant progress in reducing traditional biomass in cooking, the leading cause of indoor air pollution. The government has encouraged clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas. It promotes cleaner cooking and off-grid electrification solutions, including shifting toward using solar photovoltaics for cooking and charging batteries. Yet, experts have raised valid questions about India’s ambitious RE target: If India is genuinely going for 450 GW of RE, then why is the government auctioning more coal blocks since the coal sites already licensed is much more than the actual demand? The solution may lie in enhancing efficiency and improving finance instead of adding more generation capacity. At the same time, planners have to factor in that India’s energy demand could double by 2040, with electricity demand potentially tripling due to increased appliance ownership and cooling needs. Despite the present challenges the sector is facing — fall in energy demand by almost one third, prevailing price instability impacted investment decisions, projected contraction in global energy demand — India must stick to the green path to meet its climate and sustainable development goals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/renew-commitment-to-renewable-energy/story-MTdB81KDEEx528XJDhYz0O.html
