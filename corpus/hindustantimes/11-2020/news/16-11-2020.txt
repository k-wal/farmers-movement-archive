16-11-2020||News||Covid-19 vaccine: Room for cautious optimism | Analysis||The Covid-19 pandemic has galvanised the world scientific community to fast-track the creation of a vaccine against the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Recent reports about a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine, BTN162b2, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech being 90% effective in trial volunteers has brought cheer and hope that a vaccine for one of the deadliest diseases in history is finally within reach. The global stock markets soared in anticipation that the economy will recover at a faster pace. The phase 3 trial of this vaccine requiring two doses, three weeks apart, officially began on July 27. It has already enrolled 43,538 participants, of which at least 42% belong to diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. An interim analysis of 94 individuals conducted by an independent data-monitoring committee found that the vaccine efficacy rate was above 90%, seven days after the second dose. This means that protection was achieved 28 days after the first dose.The data is still not enough to qualify it for emergency-use authorisation, yet the findings are remarkable, especially since it validates the cutting-edge genetic strategy of utilising mRNA (or DNA) for producing a vaccine. Such technology has not been deployed in any successful vaccine against any infectious disease so far.So what are RNA-based vaccines and is there sufficient data on their safety and efficacy? Traditionally, vaccines are developed by using the whole organism (viruses or bacteria) that is already inactivated with a proven record of safety. However, the proteins produced by this product are sufficiently immunogenic to prime the host immune system to mount an effective immune response against the disease-causing pathogen. The mRNA vaccines, in contrast, utilise a unique process of making the body produce specific viral proteins itself. Here the scientists produce a synthetic version of mRNA and use it as a template to build a protein that is exactly similar to the one produced by the natural virus. The advantage is that such synthetic proteins are solitary and lack the ability to assemble and form a virus. The host immune system is tricked to detect these as natural viral proteins and it starts to mount a robust defensive response. Besides, Pfizer and BioNTech, the other company that is also in an advanced stage of producing a similar vaccine is the United States (US)-based Moderna with its product, mRNA-1273, which the company claims is over 94% effective. Once data becomes available from the latter, it will be interesting to perform a comparative analysis on the safety and efficacy of the two. There are also reports about the equally high efficacy of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V. Indeed, there could soon be more than one quality product available to control the pandemic. Speaking specifically for Sars-CoV-2, the mRNA vaccines encode a part of the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. The region is called the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which enables the virus to infect cells lining the human lung epithelium. The idea is to generate a highly-potent immune response that can interfere with the key starting point of the virus infection and block its replication. The mRNA vaccines are expected to be more potent because they can activate both the innate (pre-existing and present since birth) and the acquired (develops in response to surrounding pathogens as one ages) component of the immune system, providing an extra layer of protection. Once standardised, they are quicker and easier to produce in large scales than conventional vaccines. Pfizer’s two doses in three weeks is a good strategy because the second dose acts as a booster for generating a strong immune response. However, such cutting-edge technology has serious and logistic challenges for the mass administration of the vaccine. The mRNA vaccine needs to be stored at -70°C or below. They lose potency at normal refrigeration temperatures or even at -20C. This could pose practical difficulties of maintaining ultra-cold chains in several countries, including India. Further questions relate to the technology and associated issues. The concerns include whether the proteins chosen for the vaccine are of the right type, are able to induce a targeted immune response, how long the immunity lasts and, most important, whether there are any long-term adverse reactions to the product. It is understandable that the availability of a Covid-19 vaccine will initially be limited. The challenge will be to select the right one from the several that might become available. Pfizer may not be the best option for mass vaccination, also because it is not a part of the World Health Organization’s COVAX distribution programme. Nations will have to develop strategic prioritisation plans based on demography and chosen priorities. Policymakers will have to decide how much of the population should be vaccinated, particularly the elderly and those at higher risk of hospitalisation or death when infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-vaccine-room-for-cautious-optimism/story-lyFYekj2IdunuEGttvJv7L.html
16-11-2020||News||For multilateralism, a change in climate, writes Syed Akbaruddin||As the ripples of the United States (US) presidential election results spread, myriad views are being expounded about the implications. All elections have consequences, but the US elections have global consequences. I recall two elections in 2016 that signalled global multilateral change. On October 5, 2016, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) indicated that Antonio Guterres would be the ninth United Nations Secretary General (UNSG). It was akin to the projection of votes in the US presidential elections. While formal decisions would follow, the die was cast. I recollect the then president of the UNSC for October 2016, ambassador Vitaly Churkin, rushing to the Indian Mission where we were having a lunch for Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) ambassadors, and sharing that in the first straw poll under his presidency, he had brought the process to a closure. A month later, in the early hours of November 9, with the projections of results indicating the election of Donald Trump as the President of the US, the terms of the job of the UNSG changed substantially. Whatever may have been candidate Guterres’s aspirations, SG Guterres, from the time he took office in January 2017, had an overarching defensive goal. He has been admirably shepherding multilateralism and the UN through the tumultuous winds of change, which candidate Guterres never planned for. As he looks to the last year of his current term, the suave former Portuguese prime minister may be forgiven for feeling his efforts have not been in vain. On day one of the impending change of guard in the US on January 20, 2021, there are prospects for some good news for the UNSG. President-elect Joe Biden, has, throughout his campaign, said that he will bring the US back into the Paris Agreement and reverse the intention of moving the US out of the World Health Organization. This symbolises that the climate is changing for multilateralism. President-elect Biden has repeatedly asserted that he is committed to targeting carbon neutrality by 2050. As he formalises this commitment, he will add to countries covering 50% of the world’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and half of global CO2 emissions who have made a net-zero commitment. This is a goal that Guterres is assiduously promoting. In 2021, the climate crisis will rise to the top of the multilateral agenda, with active US support. In reality, the US never fully turned away from multilateralism. There is no better example than this year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner, the UN’s World Food Program (WFP). It is an agency whose last five directors general, including the current one, have been US nationals. Until October, the US’s voluntary contribution of $2.7 billion comprised 43% of the entire budget. By contrast, China contributed $4 million. After having established a larger multilateral architecture, the US pursued an a la carte approach — selectively meeting some of its responsibilities but not fulfilling others. Consequently, the many contributions it made to multilateral institutions were overshadowed by the anxiety some of its decisions caused. Changing this strategy lies primarily in the realm of the US President’s executive decisions. Indicating re-engagement with the Human Rights Council, joining the global effort to assist countries to get access to the Covid-19 vaccine through COVAX and restoring funding for the UN Refugee and Works Agency (UNRWA) are some other executive decisions that can be taken swiftly.Multilateralism needs US engagement across the board. Where the US has engaged, it has garnered the enthusiastic support of others. The coordination to ensure the election of Daren Tang of Singapore as director-general of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), earlier this year, is a case in point. Where the US sought to plough a lonely furrow, the results have not been to its own satisfaction. The jettisoning of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran is an example. The US’s re-engagement multilaterally is in India’s interests. As India’s interests grow, areas of cooperation that India and the US can work together in will keep expanding. A US which takes sharply distant positions in multilateral organisations tends to open up areas of discord between us. As the climate is set to change for multilateralism, the US will likely take to advocacy to battle the climate crisis. In 2021, the US and the UN will both focus on the subject. The European Union will join in. China will be keen to be seen as a helpful partner. Many small developing island states view it as an existential issue. Although the field is getting crowded, India needs to seize opportunities for leadership here. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi is viewed globally as a climate champion. His advocacy of renewables and the International Solar Alliance are acknowledged as notable Climate Action initiatives. India’s adoption of renewables is on the fast track, as is its promotion of disaster-resilient infrastructure. We must highlight all this and add to our initiatives, making adjustments if required. Looking ahead, global public goods in environment and health, and not conventional peace and security issues, are likely to be areas of multilateral focus. An early opportunity will be the Climate Ambition Summit to which the United Kingdom, as host, has invited PM Modi to join in December 2020, as a precursor to the Conference of Parties-26 next year. The early bird really will catch the worm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/for-multilateralism-a-change-in-climate/story-ZeENji3KRR2KSzJSoIB6rJ.html
16-11-2020||News||There is a shift in global trade. But 2020 is not 1930 or 2008 | Analytics||There is a general sense, both among policymakers and observers, that trade in the post-Covid-19 world will undergo fundamental shifts. Two factors seem to have led to these conclusions. The first is the nature of trade during the crisis and the second is the dramatic decline in global trade and employment. However, what is most critical is that the global crisis has focused attention on the required changes in the multilateral trade order. The special World Trade Organization (WTO) section on Covid-19 reveals a striking similarity in the response of countries. All of them tightened export restrictions on medical hardware and eliminated all duties on imports and medicines. However, the nature of the pandemic enforced co-operation. Producers of medical hardware (developed countries) needed to co-operate with pharma exporters (for example, developing countries such as India) to control the pandemic. The end result was a remarkable degree of cooperation among both sets of countries. This was never a feature of global restrictions during the trade wars after 1930 and 2008. The nature of the pandemic, which has sharpened the focus on global public goods, sets this period apart from meltdowns of the 1930s and 2008. This is not surprising as the previous two episodes of recession were the consequences of an endogenous failure of expectations after a decade or more of global expansion. The current trade crisis is completely exogenous, driven by government action and the fear of the unknown which has separated buyers from sellers. For example, multilateral agencies estimate that global employment in the Covid-19 period will fall by as much as 25% to 30%. Consequently, global trade will also decline by about 15% in the second quarter of 2020. Closer to home, India’s exports declined by about 60% in the first couple of months of the crisis. Globally, most economists have suggested typical Keynesian pump priming measures. However, the causal factor today is not economic and hence Keynesian demand stimuli will not work and will lead individuals to increase their savings. The real problem is the fear psychosis, which will only disappear once a vaccine is made available and/ or the impact of the pandemic wanes over time. The recovery from the pandemic will manifest itself in a V-shape pattern rather than the U-shape associated with endogenous trade cycles. The most significant change is in the nature of trade since the 1960s and 1970s. By and large, since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1948, countries have largely traded manufactured goods. In addition, these manufactured goods were distinct so that if one country exported food products, it imported computers and cars. This is why GATT was devoted largely to rules regulating merchandise trade. However, in the last four decades, the nature of commodity trade has changed dramatically. For one, the type of commodities now traded fall in the category of so-called Intra Industry Trade (IIT): Here trade is largely in intermediate inputs rather than in final consumption goods. Second, since about 2008, global merchandise trade has reached its peak as a share of global trade (around 60%) and the growing segment is now trade in services. In fact, technological developments in the last two decades and fragmentation of production imply that it may be difficult to separate one from the other. The moot point is that typically protection via nominal tariffs may be outdated as a country is simultaneously importing and exporting commodities in the same industrial category. The second change in the nature of global trade is the nature of actors involved: 60% of trade today is intra-firm and 50% between subsidiaries of the same transnational company. Yet, WTO is a forum in which only countries can participate. Future multilateral and plurilateral agreements will have to address these issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/there-is-a-shift-in-global-trade-but-2020-is-not-1930-or-2008/story-MWPq1FI9xQ7YJh3pR7N0hP.html
