09-11-2020||News||The robustness of the US federal set-up||Joe Biden is the 46th President of the United States of America (US) after an arduous and messy presidential election. The American election has spewed many suppositions such as the “victory of Trumpism” or the “lingering death of liberalism”, for pundits to debate intensely over the coming weeks.But one supposition seems beyond debate — India, the world’s largest democracy, runs elections better than the US, the world’s oldest democracy.Indian national elections appear much more efficient than the American national elections. In India, votes are counted fast and results are announced by the end of counting day. Disputes over counting are few and rare. Never does an incumbent head refuse to vacate office after an electoral loss, at least not yet.In contrast, the world has witnessed the chaos and disarray in the counting process of the US presidential election. It thus seems tempting for Indian commentators to offer some lessons to “big brother” and to export India’s more efficient election process to the US. But the seeming mess in the US’s electoral process is intentional and a small price to pay for a much larger good — federalism.To elect their president in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, an American voter in the state of Pennsylvania could vote by mail but a voter in the state of Texas needed an excuse beyond Covid-19 to vote by mail. A voter in the state of New York made a choice between Donald Trump or Joe Biden, but a voter in neighbouring Maine ranked both the candidates in their order of preference. When the voting process to elect the president is uniquely different across each of the 50 states of the US, then inexorably, the counting process will be complex too.Electing a president is arguably the most significant event for American democracy. Yet, there is no one set of national rules for electing the president. Each state has the powers to frame its own rules. Fifty different rules are more complex to administer than one set of rules. Such extreme decentralisation with 50 state election commissions running an election for the US president is bound to be more inefficient than one centralised election commission with a uniform set of rules for all.The US’s intensely federal structure and its inevitable inefficiencies are a deliberate design and not an accident. A heavily decentralised model with powers handed down to state and local governments has served the US extraordinarily well. When states frame their own rules for governance and compete with each other, the larger nation benefits. For example, in the current election, one state — Maine — decided that the current electoral system of plurality voting is obsolete and chose the rank choice voting system for all elections held in their state. If it works well, it is likely that the other states may adopt it too.Had there been one set of standard national electoral rules for all states, such a natural experiment would not be possible. Decentralisation enables a competitive marketplace among states and local governments that foster new ideas and innovation. Further, when the spectre of institutional capture looms large across many democracies currently, capturing one central institution is much easier than the ability to capture many institutions at the state level.The staunch decentralisation and devolution of powers in the country’s system is perhaps a critical factor in the US’s overall success as a nation, that is much under-appreciated and recognised. Inefficiency is a small price to pay for much larger and more sustainable benefits.In contrast, India is heavily centralised with a trend towards greater centralisation in recent years. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, supported by both national parties, is one glaring recent example of how we as a nation sacrificed federalism at the altar of economic efficiency. Let us imagine a situation where the American company, Apple, wants to make a big investment in India. It is better for various states such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh to compete with each other to attract Apple to their state than for a prime minister or a Union Cabinet minister to decide where Apple should invest. States can compete only when they have powers to frame their own rules over taxation, land, labour, environment and other areas. India’s states have been slowly stripped of most of their powers, including the basic right of taxation, which is the exact opposite of the US’s federal structure.Some argue that it is wrong to compare India’s federal structure with the US’s where each state has sovereign rights with its own constitution, flag and boundary. It is a valid argument but has surpassed its validity period. India’s Constitution-drafters were right at that time to be apprehensive of secessionist tendencies of different states given India’s extreme diversity and hence adopted the approach of a strong Centre with limited powers to states. Seven decades later, the time has come for India to devolve most powers to states and enable a more vibrant and competitive federalism environment, not centralise even more in the garb of “one nation one policy” and efficiency.The fleeting chaos over the presidential elections will pass and the US will soon have a new President. But the underlying federal structure that has served the country admirably will remain steadfast, regardless of this chaotic experience. Indian commentators may well be justified to want to export our election process to the US. It is of greater importance that India imports ideas of genuine devolution and decentralisation from the US.Praveen Chakravarty is a political economist and a senior office-bearer of the CongressThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-robustness-of-the-us-federal-set-up/story-8QqOCv529TwTVOQIKdN9GO.html
09-11-2020||News||US: The end of a corrosive chapter||When Democratic challenger and former Vice-President Joe Biden emerged victorious in the race for the presidency, one could almost hear the hushed sounds of tens of millions of Americans collectively exhaling. While expressions of joy would come later, it was relief — not elation — that struck many Americans first. Relief that a protracted ballot counting process had turned in a decisive manner. Relief that an interminable campaign had reached its finale. But, above all, relief that a fog of perpetual exhaustion might finally lift.The past four years have challenged American democracy. While the country’s political institutions have long shown signs of disrepair, the Donald Trump presidency exposed their abject decay. The president governed as if checks and balances were a nuisance, rather than a necessity. The career bureaucracy was vilified — its professional ranks hollowed out. The Senate — one of the world’s most revered deliberative bodies — struggled to muster a veneer of legislative accountability. And, even as the Biden team executes plans for a transition, many Americans are unsure whether the incumbent will willingly exit centre-stage.As draining as the attack on institutions has been, it has paled in comparison to the assault on democratic norms. Perhaps the biggest lesson of the Trump era is the revelation that institutions are only as sound as the social practices that undergird them. The president weaponised social media to target political opponents, civil society, and the media. From his obscured income tax returns to his questionable business dealings, the president embodied conflicts of interest. Even on questions of foreign policy, presidential whim — rather than any coherent policy process — often dictated the United States (US)’s posture towards friends and foes alike.For the roughly 75 million Americans who backed Biden, the desire to turn the page is palpable. Women, ethnic and racial minorities, and urban and suburban dwellers turned out in historic numbers to put an end to the Trump presidency. This is no small matter: Trump is the first incumbent president to lose his re-election bid in a quarter century.But this victory was not preordained. The so-called blue wave of disenchanted, frustrated Democrats was met by a corresponding red surge of passionate Trump supporters who basked in the President’s derision for political correctness and his dogged efforts to codify conservative principles into law and regulation. Despite the fact that Biden garnered five million more votes than Trump, more than 70 million Americans stood solidly behind Trump and the margins in several battleground states were razor-thin. Democrats longed for an unambiguous repudiation of Trumpism; what they got instead was a mild rebuke.To a certain extent, the post-election bliss Democrats are experiencing is muted — for three reasons. First, driven by optimistic polls, expectations among rank-and-file Democrats ran sky-high — they expected to win the White House, regain Senate control, and expand their ranks in the House. The latter two did not materialise, although it’s possible that Democrats could still wrangle control of the Senate if two run-off elections in the state of Georgia go their way.Second, the Democrats are a house divided. In the past week, social media has been brimming with recriminations emanating from the progressive Left as well as the moderate Centre, each blaming the other for a disappointing showing in down-ballot races. In the wake of a massive victory at the presidential level, conversations in Democratic circles resemble a circular firing squad rather than a jubilant victory lap.But there is a third factor giving Democrats pause: Biden will assume the presidency at a time when America is encumbered by three simultaneous crises. A brutal second wave of the coronavirus pandemic has reared its unwelcome head, racking up more than 100,000 cases and 1,000 deaths per day. The economy, while showing tentative signs of recovery, cannot fire on all cylinders as long as the pandemic rages unabated. But there is a third crisis — over race relations — that came to a boil this summer and is simmering just below the surface, and which Biden and Kamala Harris will be under tremendous pressure to address expeditiously.What does this mean for India? While Biden will want to signal the US’s return as a responsible global stakeholder, the incoming administration will initially be consumed by domestic affairs. In the medium-term, the outlook for India is bright — expect Biden to carry forward many of the cooperative policies that the Obama administration pursued, on subjects from the climate crisis to defence collaboration. Economic irritants won’t disappear overnight, but a less hostile outlook on immigration and trade deficits will help. Many in Delhi worry that a Biden administration will apply greater scrutiny to issues like civil liberties and human rights. While such talk is overblown — China’s behaviour has all but assured that — it is curious that many seem to care more about the US’s attitude toward democratic freedoms than the health of those freedoms to begin with. In any case, America’s democratic deficits are plentiful — giving Indians ample fodder with which to push back.With this election, the US closes a corrosive chapter in its political history but under a cloud of uncertainty over its ability to author a new, more constructive one. If it can muster the political will to do so, this can only redound to India’s benefit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/us-the-end-of-a-corrosive-chapter/story-Kzw3F8rb0LyYNL4XkjYspI.html
09-11-2020||News||In Bihar, the local has indeed turned vocal||Ending his campaign for the Bihar assembly polls, chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar said that this is his last election. But irrespective of whether it is, it has definitely been his toughest one in the past decade-and-a-half as exit polls now confirm. Why is it that Kumar is today struggling in a state that got rid of the stench of caste-wars, massacres and lawlessness 15 years ago by voting for him in 2005 and reposing faith in him again in 2010 and 2015?Nitish Kumar gave Bihar a dream run from 2005 to 2010. The nightmares of kidnapping and extortion were overnight buried with vikas (development) that was fuelled by good governance. Kumar consolidated, aided in no small measure by a somewhat embedded media, showcasing his mesmeric chemistry with people who showered love on him for gifts of new roads, growing power supply and peace.Kumar transformed Bihar, with roads, electricity, school buildings and bicycles to schoolgirls. He also did bring in jobs. The police forces were augmented. Women battalions and constabulary were raised. Bihar’s feudal misogyny caved in as families now took pride in their betis (daughters). However, beneath the altar of his development model, the youth were desperately searching for employment.There is, in some ways, a parallel with the 2011 election in West Bengal, which saw the end of Left rule — and where the limited shelf-life of its revolutionary land reforms, Operation Barga, had become clear. In three decades, descendants of beneficiaries had moved out for employment. Land holdings couldn’t sustain multiplying families anymore. And the Left’s efforts at industrialisation were politically mismanaged. Bihar — in the Lalu Prasad-Rabri Devi era and before — had suffered land and caste wars. The Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), now partners, had been at diametrically opposite ends. Kumar succeeded in ensuring that peace returned to the villages. But that was not enough.Migration for education, jobs and a better life has been a steady Bihari phenomenon. And that is fundamentally because the political economy in the state, just like in West Bengal, is broken. There has been a fragmentation of land — and agriculture is neither seen as aspirational nor deemed to be a pragmatic option. Manufacturing and services are limited. Those with resources invest in the education of their children with the sole objective of sending them out of Bihar for professional advancement. Those without resources make desperate journeys to cities for livelihood.It goes to the media’s credit that the plight of Biharis in their escape home during the lockdown was captured. “It is better to die at home” became a soulful anthem that soon after stirred the air with cries for jobs at home. A good many returnees went back, many taken by contractors by air or road, but many others stayed behind, retrenched. Many among them are the educated whose aspirations appear to be dying young. When the polls were announced, Bihar’s young voters began asserting themselves — the local had, indeed, became vocal.While the blame for migration for education and jobs cannot be put solely at Kumar’s doorstep, given that citizens generously credited him with the earlier turnaround, it is but inevitable that he will also face the ire of his Naya Bihar’s unmet aspirations. It did not help that from the master of managing political extremes, Kumar came to be perceived as a conjurer of survival politics.The RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav leveraged the perception of this governance deficit and political vacillation. But he was not the only campaign phenomenon in Bihar. It was “Bihar ke do ladke” — Bihar’s two boys, the other being the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP)’s Chirag Paswan. Both drew frenzied crowds. While Yadav promised jobs, Paswan promised to probe corruption, even jail for Kumar if proven guilty. It is the first time anyone was attacking Nitish personally on corruption, even though corruption in the ranks and an arrogant babudom remain Bihar’s worst kept secret. The storm against Kumar from two young men threaten not only to dwarf the CM but also inflict collateral damage on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the bargain, despite Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi‘s popularity. Aware of this challenge, the PM himself told Biharis that he needed Kumar for Bihar’s development.The Opposition has also carefully, and smartly, targeted government servants. Among them are 3,74,000 contract teachers, who earn a fraction of what regular teachers get, whose numbers have dwindled to 65,000. Yadav promised themequal pay for equal work. In addition, he also promised to double the honorarium of aanganwaadi sevikas, tola sevaks, jeevika didis and ASHA workers in an effort to wean the women vote.For a Nitish Kumar who is on the back foot, survival hinges on the Modi magic. While his re-election in 2010 and 2015 was attributed to the gender vote, the 2020 poll is turning to be a generational vote. The results will reveal young Bihar’s mind on November 10. It will also reveal whether Nitish Kumar has swum ashore with the BJP — or the latter has sunk with Nitish Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-bihar-the-local-has-indeed-turned-vocal/story-ivONIunShIndG4F8nkLkzJ.html

09-11-2020||News||The Biden presidency and India-US ties||Hope has been rekindled in the participatory democratic process as the American voter has definitively chosen the Democratic candidate and former United States (US) Vice-President (VP) Joe Biden as the 46th President along with Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. The latter’s victory is particularly poignant for its many resonances — this is the first time that a woman, a person of colour, and an Indian-American will occupy the office of the vice-presidency. While it seems that Donald Trump will use every legal option to delay and defy the verdict of the Electoral College, the US is preparing for a new occupant in the White House on January 20.President-elect Biden is no stranger to India and played a valuable role as a legislator in the rapprochement over the nuclear issue when it was being steered by the George W Bush-Manmohan Singh combine. He is familiar with the essential continuity in the India-US bilateral relationship. Hence the road map for the next four years with Biden at the helm will, in all likelihood, strengthen ties in those sectors where progress was made (defence cooperation) on the Trump watch and repair the damage done in areas such as trade where restoring the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) would enable Indian exports.Under Trump, the India-US bilateral track retained the structural orientation that had been envisioned in the Bill Clinton-Atal Bihari Vajpayee years. It is instructive to recall the Biden approach to Indian sensitivities about how to frame the relationship with the US, for Delhi is reluctant to go down the path of a formal alliance, for good reason. In his July 2013 visit to India, the then Vice-President Biden noted: “There is no contradiction between strategic autonomy and a strategic partnership. Global powers are capable of both.”The current collective global challenge is dominated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the figures are stark. The US and India lead the list in the total number of cases, and the scale of the economic-fiscal haemorrhaging is yet to be estimated accurately. The pandemic is one of the many critical global challenges where the US leadership would have been desirable, and this is where the Biden-Trump contrast is striking. The climate crisis and maritime pollution are huge (as Trump would put it) and some experts aver that the world has crossed the tipping point. It is irrefutable that sustained collective action based on credible scientific data and an equitable sharing of the mitigation effort is the way ahead but this is exactly what President Trump rejected.The Biden presidency offers the hope that the US commitment to multilateralism will be back on track and here there are many areas where Delhi could be a relevant stakeholder in global load-sharing. It is encouraging to note that in his statements, Biden has promised to bring the US back into the World Health Organization (WHO)’s fold and focused on the need to give this challenge the highest policy priority in relation to Covid-19.For all the opprobrium that the Trump presidency has elicited, his unpredictable China policy merits scrutiny from both the US and Indian perspective. Trump forced the US establishment and the world at large to acknowledge the predatory nature of China’s global aspirations and its corrosive impact. How this policy shift towards Beijing will unfold in the Biden years will be extremely relevant for the global strategic order and its regional/Asian implications will be even more acute for Delhi.Post-Galwan, the China challenge looms large for India and the recent statement by Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat is pertinent. In relation to the current military stand-off in Ladakh, General Rawat asserted: “Our posturing is unambiguous. We will not accept any shifting of the LAC. In the overall security calculus, border confrontations, transgressions, unprovoked tactical military actions spiralling into a larger conflict therefore cannot be discounted.”How the Biden team will frame the China challenge to Indian sovereignty in relation to abiding US interest will be a critical indicator for the Narendra Modi government in mediating the Delhi-Beijing relationship. The more recent defence cooperation traction accorded to the bilateral track, by way of Delhi signing the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement and inviting Australia to be part of the Malabar naval exercises, is illustrative of the potential that needs to be explored.There are many areas/sectors in the multilateral basket relevant to India and paradoxically, China, that a Biden presidency could enable if it remains committed to a pragmatic and equitable global partnership. The post-Covid-19 era is yet to arrive and the immediate road ahead for the US President-elect will be to identify policy priorities and the manner in which they will be pursued. And in engaging with a new team in the White House, Delhi will benefit in prioritising the hi-tech sector namely core ICT (computing communications) and AI (artificial intelligence) for the long term. To maximise the possibilities of the “strategic partnership” that Biden referred to, India must be astute and overcome an inherent difidence and institutional prickliness, as it defines its own modest relevance in a partnership that was estranged till 2005.C Uday Bhaskar is director, Society for Policy Studies The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-biden-presidency-and-india-us-ties/story-IGqQRRvHMPX7cw1Av1T9qJ.html
