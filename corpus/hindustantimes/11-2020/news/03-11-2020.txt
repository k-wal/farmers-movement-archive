03-11-2020||News||A financial model for higher education||India’s gross enrollment ratio (GER) in higher education is 28%. It lags behind the global average of 38% and behind China’s 51%. If India wants to become a knowledge economy, our higher education institutions (HEIs) will have to play a leading role in boosting the innovation ecosystem while, at the same time, increasing GER to 50%. This calls for the scaling up of existing institutions as well as the creation of new premier ones. To put things in perspective, 23 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) will admit as many as 15,000 undergraduates this year, while just one state university in the United States (US), Arizona State University, admits 13,500 undergraduates each year. While the scaling-up of existing institutions and the creation of new institutions require additional budgetary allocations, running them well calls for money on a recurring basis. As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the nation’s expenditure on higher education remains low. This lower investment per student also has a strong correlation with global rankings. The new National Education Policy (NEP) is trying to address this issue by allocating a fixed percentage of GDP for higher education. It also talks about granting administrative autonomy to higher education institutions. Currently, these institutions receive upwards of 80% of funds from the government. They must explore 21st-century financial models to secure financial and administrative autonomy.What is needed is a structural overhaul and creation of a diversified financial model for our institutions. Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) have been able to achieve autonomy by charging a higher tuition fee, contributing up to 85% of their funds. Is charging high fees the only viable financial model? It need not be if we follow the best practices of various countries and use a combination of these models. Tuition fees contribute up to a quarter of the income for the most universities in the US, Australia and Asia. In the IITs, it contributes to only 6-7%, since only a fraction (approximately one-third) of students pay the upper limit of tuition fees. Others pay a much lower amount, based on their social category and economic status. This contribution can be increased not only by charging market competitive tuition fees, but also by bringing all students into the fee-paying category. This can be achieved by decoupling students and their families from the upfront financial barriers by offering them collateral-free and interest-free Income Contingency Loans (ICLs) through a centralised financial structure. Australia’s Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) is a widely-praised ICL model that is managed by the Australian taxation office. The repayments are linked to the debtor’s income level and are collected directly by the Australian tax authorities. ICLs are different from the education loans offered in the US that have caused massive student debt problems. A scheme can be piloted in India with IITs, which could also offer professional, executive and online programmes that do not require the infrastructure conventional degree programmes do.A third of the income could come from the research activities. Though research is primarily government-sponsored, universities such as UC Berkeley, Harvard and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne raise up to a third of their research funds from non-government sources. Research at IITs is predominantly government-sponsored. A critical challenge has been managing and operating research facilities with insufficient overheads (ranging 5-10%) from these government grants. Alongside the expected increase in overheads, IITs could tap funds from the private sector, invest in and incubate research start-ups, and strengthen technology transfer and intellectual property licensing mechanisms. Mechanisms such as Foundation of Innovative Technology Transfer (FITT) at IIT Delhi and Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE) at IIT Bombay may facilitate institutional equity investment in deep-tech start-ups. The recent launch of the world’s most affordable Covid-19 testing kit by IIT Delhi and the supply of over 4.5 million export-quality personal protective equipment by IIT Delhi start-ups are small demonstrations of the potential such investments by HEIs can generate. For boosting industry participation in research, IIT Madras has shown a way through the creation of technology parks. IIT Delhi is currently developing three technology parks for various industry sectors. Harvard, Stanford and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have pioneered the concept of endowments, now adopted by public universities across the world. Endowment investment returns can easily contribute up to a third of the university’s income. Endowments are raised not only from the alumni but also from industry, philanthropists and governments. Last year, IIT Delhi launched an endowment fund with a target of raising $1 billion, that will provide a conservative investment income of ₹700 crore every year. A successful endowment model will require the creation of fund-raising teams and investment policy changes to overcome bureaucratic hurdles. The new financial model for HEIs will be fuelled by the income from, one, deferred tuition payments; two, research grants/equity investments in startups/technology transfer fees; and, three, endowment donations. The transition is imminent, and it is up to us whether to lead or follow.V Ramgopal Rao is director, IIT-Delhi, and Anurag Sachan is executive, IIT-Delhi The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-financial-model-for-higher-education/story-FQGCKDvFaDjykPUcXmhveN.html
03-11-2020||News||A Suitable Boy: Where love is intricate and the personal is political||I first read Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy in the mid-2000s. I watched Mira Nair’s Monsoon Wedding in 2001. Both these works, though ostensibly about deliberations of spouse-selection and the mayhem of organising weddings, offer insights into Indian social and political realities. So, I was looking forward to watching Nair’s adaptation of A Suitable Boy. Seth’s novel in tracing a 19-year-old girl, Lata’s choice of spouse from among three suitors, lays out how an individual’s quest for companionship is shaped by society, and, in so doing, convincingly explains how the personal is political. Similarly, Nair’s film addresses difficult and sensitive issues of child abuse and infidelity in the joyful framework of weddings. Nair has been bold to undertake an adaptation of this 1,500-page masterpiece. This certainly runs the risk of not being able to capture the complexities of the characters, political situations, and personal struggles. Nonetheless, this series is appealing for it has captured two key themes of the novel, which resonate with contemporary times, namely, inter-religious marriages and the different meanings of love. Lata’s attraction and compatibility with Kabir Durrani, her first suitor, is set against the backdrop of Hindu-Muslim relations in post-Independent India. Amid rising communal tensions (due to construction of a temple right next to a mosque), Kabir’s declarations of love remain insufficient to make him a suitable choice. Lata’s family has nothing against Kabir, they claim, yet marrying a Muslim in those troubled times, they remind Lata, is far from wise. Written in the 1990s, this novel was set in the 1950s, but Seth could well have sketched this character to suit current times, as furore over Hindu-Muslim unions continues, evident in the reaction to the now-retracted advertisement by the jewellery brand, Tanishq. Seth’s novel has generated debates on who would have been the ideal suitor for Lata. To some, Lata’s choice in Haresh Kapoor, the career-focused man, was conservative. The romantics would have opted for the suave, charming, lawyer-turned-poet Amit Chatterjee, and the daring would have liked to see Lata with the handsome, cricket-playing Muslim classmate, Kabir Durrani. In developing these characters, Seth generated a poignant discussion on whether there exists different types of love (passion, compatibility, duty), and which of these should motivate marriage. A strength of this series is that it has developed Haresh’s character well, and in doing so, contributed to this debate on different meanings of love. Nair has not presented Haresh simplistically as that choice which fits well with middle-class values and moralities of having a good job and being of an appropriate caste. Rather, she has been able to draw out that Lata chose Haresh for his sincerity, willingness to make adjustments for her, and a sense that he would let her grow into an individual of her own. This nuanced lens, however, is not adopted for Amit Chatterjee’s character, who is only depicted as a society man, charmed by Lata but too modern for her. Whereas in the novel, we see how Amit and Lata are deeply attracted to each other, perhaps due to a shared passion for poetry, but Amit’s expressions of interest are inconsistent and too few and far between, which makes Lata think of him as unpredictable to venture into married life.These experiences and deliberations of love and attraction seem quite relevant particularly for the urbane youth who seem to believe that romantic and passionate love must be the only worthy basis for marriage. This series, then, has reopened this debate in the Indian context, on whether marriage can be based on a love that does not emanate from intense passion, without necessarily questioning one’s sense of modernity. Nair’s adaptation has captured well how the personal is always political, and has explained well that religion, pride, and intent create an intricate web that is to be traversed in order to find a suitable spouse.

03-11-2020||News||Donald Trump and the future of the Republican Party | Opinion||Donald Trump upturned the political applecart in 2016 by assembling a coalition of anger. Now he’s arousing them to new heights of fear and loathing. He is losing parts of the coalition as a result but hopes enough fence-sitters and fellow-travellers who stayed home in 2016 will rally to him. In addition, the Republican Party is using every administrative trick to put up obstacles to Democratic voters and counting on a Right-tilting Supreme Court to wink at them. But the American Right-wing should be praying for a Trump defeat. If he were to come back, he would put the Republicans on a path to ideological perdition. The 2016 polls undercounted the number of working-class and small-town White voters who wanted an anti-establishment candidate. As a team under political scientist Loren Collingwood showed, dislike for their national elite was so strong millions of them voted for Barack Obama because he was an outsider even though many were unhappy about his colour. Trump repudiated almost every element of traditional Right-wing ideology along the way, including free trade, open borders and fiscal conservatism, and won their backing in large part because he did so. Trump is hurting today because Covid-19 showed his administrative competence was not on par with his ability to tap this anger. He also didn’t deliver on his promises to overturn the establishment. Lots of noisy immigration bashing, racist signalling, tax cuts and so on, but the system is largely intact. Finally, his own misogyny, entitlement and boorishness appealed to no one. His support among White women of all classes has flagged. Elderly Whites are appalled by his pandemic response. College educated White men align with his policies but find the man distasteful. He has picked up new support. Twice as many young Latinos and Blacks like his elite-bashing. But almost every election analyst in the US says Trump has lost more than he has gained – and this makes returning to the White House more a maze than a path. It could yet happen, thanks largely to vagaries of the US electoral college system. If he can hold onto all the southern and western states he won in 2016, he would need only two largish Midwestern states, say Pennsylvania and Ohio, to breast the tape. Or it could end up in the Supreme Court. But the odds are against him. Democratic candidate Joe Biden has the 232 electoral college votes that went for Hillary Clinton in the bag. He only needs 38 more to win and he can get them from roughly any three of the dozen swing states in play. And most polls have him leading in two-thirds of them. The polls, the pocketbooks and the pandemic are lining up for Biden. The real question for the Republican Party is their own future. In 2012, the party realised its base was increasingly Whites in non-metropolitan areas, an aging and shrinking demographic. A famous party analysis, called “the autopsy,” laid out a strategy to target Latinos and youth. The party began implementing it, but then Trump came along. He broke the party’s fraying coalition of blue-collar Whites and business, doubling down on the first part and discarding the second. He energised the base so they came out in numbers, picked up discontented in other groups as well, but has put the Republicans on a dismal path.If Trump returns, the Republican Party will be fully redrawn as a caricature: Protectionist, isolationist, anti-immigrant, blue collar and deeply racist. The party will jettison its belief in free markets, minimal government and balanced budgets. More importantly, it will lose its ability to attract socially conservative minorities, the party’s best hope to create a winning electoral coalition. For history buffs: he will resurrect the short-lived Know Nothing Party of the 1850s, imbuing it with a similar sense of paranoia. It is one reason big business, both Silicon Valley and Wall Street, leans against Trump. If he returns, they will fully turn against the Republicans. It is true that there is much less political space in the US for free trade and untrammelled markets. Trump pressed the accelerator on an existing bipartisan trend. Biden’s election manifesto is all about industrial policy and managed trade. But, as the Pew Research Center and others have shown, today a Democrat is more likely to be in favour of trade agreements and foreign policy alliances than a Republican. Trump 2.0, by driving away minorities, college-educated Whites and Big Tech, will push his party further down this path. The problem is the residue he will have left are what Hillary Clinton called “deplorables” — disgruntled working-class Whites steeped in racism and QAnon. Hence the many anti-Trump Republican groups, like the Lincoln Project, and so many traditional conservatives have endorsed Biden. They hope a Trump defeat will allow them to recapture the base, return to “the autopsy” and align the US Right with an increasingly more diversified and digital America. The New Yorker recently cited Indian-American Nikki Haley as the standard-bearer of this school. However, there are strong signs that even without Trump, the Republicans will not change their present path. Too many of their Nextgen leaders see his formula as a winner. They will be less crude and polarising, but they will be about preserving a mythical White America and using state intervention and evangelical rulebooks to do so. The US’s fate under them can be summed up in Trump’s quip, “I think if this country gets any kinder or gentler, it’s literally going to cease to exist.”pchaudhuri@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/donald-trump-and-the-future-of-the-republican-party-opinion/story-8u8GaCoBFmgWPSUHyEbFgO.html
03-11-2020||News||Gilgit-Baltistan: Pakistan plays the role of supplicant to Chinese expansion | Analysis||Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan was most worried about Chinese reaction when India announced abrogation of Article 370, which altered Jammu and Kashmir’s status in August last year. After all, Pakistan had lured China into its fold under the pretext of showing Jammu and Kashmir as part of its territory.Warning from Foreign SecretaryForeign secretary Harsh Shringla warned against debt-trap diplomacySpeaking to think tanks in Germany, Shringla said the world was increasingly witnessing debt-trap diplomacyHe also said that countries should be cautious about terms of engagementPakistan does not have territorial contiguity with China; it is only through the Occupied Kashmir and Northern Areas, precisely through the territories of Gilgit-Baltistan that Pakistan has been able to link with China. Earlier, Chinese interest in the area was limited to Shakshgam Valley as it wanted continuous connectivity through the area to its Xinjiang region. Pakistan was only too happy to comply with the Chinese request and handed it over 5180 sq km of its territory in 1963.This was the first reality check of the so-called ‘love and affection’ of Pakistan for the people of Jammu and Kashmir it has continued to project for decades now.Right from the beginning, Pakistan tried to project Northern Areas, as they were then called, in different light. It abrogated many of the privileges associated with erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in the region, including abolition of state subject law in 1974, and making the home of Shias into a Sunni majority area. The people of G-B still do not have even the most basic rights and privileges. They cannot elect their leaders freely as all the leaders are first screened and allowed to contest only after they swore allegiance to Pakistan.Pakistan got China to construct Karakoram highway in order to have a backup plan for the region. The ecologically fragile region witnessed the folly of human intervention when in 2010 in Hunza, a landslide killed 20 people and blocked the flow of River Hunza. The resultant flooding displaced more than 6,000 people and inundated about 20 km of the Karakoram highway.Undeterred by the tragedy, Pakistan again approached China for the construction of a realigned road. China, by this time flush with funds and carrying the impression of an emerging power, had realised the potential of the route which could have provided it alternate access to the Arabian Sea and through that to the Middle East and other countries.This would have not only provided it an alternate trade route, but also acted as a backup plan should its access through the Malacca Strait is choked in any eventuality. China realised the value in having a friendship with Pakistan, which in any case would never be in a position to oppose Beijing’s desires and decisions. The Chinese thus sold them the idea of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Pakistan, misgoverned right from the inception, did not have the capacity to evaluate the pros and cons of the Chinese intentions. In any case, it did not have an alternative development plan to show to the people and therefore lapped the offer. However, Chinese were adamant that the legality of the area through which the corridor would pass should not come into the question.China realised the precarious legal position Pakistan has over these territories when international lending agencies backtracked from financing the Diamer Bhasha Dam project, located in Kohistan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Diamer in Gilgit-Baltistan, based on Indian opposition. The project for which the foundation stone was laid in 1998, has suffered innumerable delays on account of the untenable legal position of Pakistan in the territory. However, China under Xi Jinping decided to come to the rescue of Pakistan and the Imran Khan government entered into an agreement with China Power in May, 2020.It is interesting to note that not so long ago, in 2017, Pakistan had dropped the idea of getting the project financed under CPEC framework as China had placed strict conditions including the ownership of the project. Going by experience, China has always thought of undertaking construction projects in other countries as those fulfilling its own interests, as the investment potential of these are neither evaluated nor realised. It is not difficult to imagine what conditions China would have imposed to an even more desperate Pakistan in 2020 while agreeing on Daimer Bhasha Dam.China has other interests in the Gilgit-Baltistan region as well - the projects financed and undertaken by it include Sust Dry Port, upgradation of Karakoram Highway (KKH), 820 km OFC project connecting Khunjerab to Rawalpindi and Jaglot-Skardu road. All these projects can be seen to be actually catering to the Chinese interests, a fact gradually sinking into the minds of an average Pakistani, who does not see any opportunity coming his way. The Chinese banks finance the projects undertaken by their companies involving their engineers and machinery and even labour. The markets in Pakistan are flush with Chinese goods and the Chinese people never deny an opportunity to snub a local in Pakistan.Shops selling pork have become the mainstay in the majority of Islamic Republic of Pakistan’s towns to cater to the Chinese demands. There is so much mistrust between the Pakistanis and Chinese community that in a recent advertisement for renting out an upscale house in Islamabad, the owner specially mentioned that the offer was not for the Chinese.It was in this background that when India decided to abrogate Article 370, the Chinese sensed threat to their strategic as well as investment plan and put pressure on Pakistan to find a way out. Imran Khan visited Gilgit-Baltistan on the so called 73rd Independence Day of the region on November 1 to announce provincial status for the state. Interestingly, Khan visited the region last year also on the same occasion when, going out of sync, he announced that Gilgit-Baltistan has always been the bridge between Pakistan and China. It is worth mentioning here that previously at no point of time in its entire history, the day had been celebrated with Pakistan PM’s visit to the region.People of Gilgit-Baltistan are apprehensive not only about Pakistan’s intention but China’s too. Some of the pro-independence parties, including JKLF, have opposed Pak government decision to grant provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan. So called PM of Azad Kashmir, Farooq Haider Khan, along with local units of the mainstream parties of Pakistan have also opposed the move, fearing it may be overtaken by the Chinese.The Emir of Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir, Khalid Mahmood, rejected Khan’s announcement of giving provisional provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan, saying this is direct interference in the region’s elections. He added that it weakened Pakistan’s stand internationally and is a violation of United Nations resolutions. His fellow party leader and convener of the All Parties Kashmir Coordination Council, Abdur Rashid Turabi, said that before making Gilgit-Baltistan a province broad based consultations must be held.People of the area have already been expressing their resentment against Chinese projects. Residents of Chilas organised a protest (September 18) against non-payment of compensation for the land acquired for the construction of the Diamer Bhasha Dam. Earlier, under the banner of Graduate Alliance and Geologists Association Diamer, the residents had staged a protest (on September 9 and 11) asserting their claim on the jobs and opposing inadequate employment of the local youth.People have also been vehemently opposing Islamabad’s decision to lease pasture land to Chinese companies for mining.Mirza Hussain, a member of the Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly, had alleged in 2019 that 300 mining leases were awarded to Chinese companies without consulting people. Pakistan, at the behest of China, introduced web-based customs duty at Sust Port in 2018. Despite protests by the local traders that this will lead to loss of jobs for the local population and threat to boycott the trade, Pakistan did not relent. It is interesting to note that when a number of girl’s schools were burnt in Tanger and Darel region in Gilgit-Baltistan in 2018, Pakistan had shown complete apathy for the people of the region. Lt Gen Nadeem Raza, Commander of the 10th Corps, while addressing a public gathering at Chilas, completely ignored the importance of the education of girls, and instead chose to caution that such incidents negatively impact the implementation of CPEC.In Pakistan, it is well known that the establishment calls the shots. It is for this reason that the Chinese, instead of relying on the political leaders, wanted that the Army should be spearheading the CPEC. It pressurised the Pakistan government to establish CPEC Authority and appoint an army officer as its head. Accordingly, Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa was appointed as the Chairman of the authority in 2019. It is also interesting to note that despite the plethora of allegations regarding corruption by him, the Pakistan government has not been able to take any action against him. Moreover, there is also a proposal to exempt the CPEC from the purview of the National Accountability Bureau.The present political structure of Gilgit-Baltistan suits Pakistan to undertake such decisions about it. With no political representation and no opposition, it is free to do whatever it wants with the territory. It is this relationship that permits Pakistan to play the role of a client state to the Chinese, a job it has always been willing to undertake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/gilgit-baltistan-pakistan-plays-the-role-of-supplicant-to-chinese-expansion-analysis/story-8f0r5UPmP7E8R7EsXrpojO.html

03-11-2020||News||China’s quest to control Tibet’s spiritual space | Opinion||The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) first acknowledged the importance of the religious authority of Tibetan lamas in 1992 when it approved the elevation of Ogyen Trinley Dorje, a boy recognised by the Dalai Lama as the 17th Karmapa, the head of the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. Three years later, China asserted its claim of sovereignty in the centuries-old tradition of reincarnation by the resurrection of the Qing dynasty method of using the golden urn for the selection of the 11th Panchen Lama, Tibet’s second highest spiritual leader. Elliot Sperling, the world’s foremost authority on the subject, argues that the anachronistic resurrection of the golden urn is meant to establish legitimacy through historical continuity. But the existence of the golden urn in Tibetan religious and political affairs offers little evidence to confirm whether the Qing dynasty exercised any control over its impartial use. Many sources indicate that the urn was merely symbolic as the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas were chosen according to the wishes and traditions of the Tibetan Buddhist authorities. In the selection of the 11th Panchen Lama, the Chinese authorities rigged the golden urn and literally handpicked their candidate. Arjia Rinpoche, a revered religious leader who was part of the selection committee, exposed this underhand operation in his book Surviving the Dragon: A Tibetan Lama’s Account of 40 Years under Chinese Rule. The Chinese authorities are said to have abducted the Dalai Lama’s chosen boy and his family members. Their whereabouts still remain shrouded in secrecy. Similarly, Ngabo Ngawang Jigme, the then vice-chairman of the standing committee of the National People’s Congress, exposed Beijing’s claim of sovereignty in the recognition of Tibetan lamas on the basis that Kuomintang’s representative Wu Chung-tsin presided over the enthronement ceremony of the 14th Dalai Lama in 1940 in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. Basil Gould, the British representative at the ceremony, observed that the Chinese delegates were not given priority over other foreign representatives. In recent years, the Chinese government has further strengthened its control over the recognition of Tibetan lamas in Tibet through quixotic laws and orders. In July 2007, the state administration for religious affair issued an administrative diktat called the Order No 5 or formally known as the Management Measures for the Reincarnation of Living Buddhas in Tibetan Buddhism. This consists of 14 articles designed to control the core belief system of Tibetan Buddhism. The regulation asserts control over the searches, testing, recognition, education, and training of religious figures. The United Front Work Department, the CCP organ that deals with religious and ethnic affairs, organised a patriotic training programme in October 2016 for a group of 20 young incarnate lamas on what could be described as a communist pilgrimage, visiting military bases, a defence academy and revolutionary sites, including Mao Zedong’s memorial museum. In addition, the Chinese government, under the aegis of the Chinese Buddhist Association, launched an online database in January 2016. The database exclusively carries profiles of 1,311 Party-approved lamas. Although Beijing maintains that the database will “help protect the legitimate rights and interests of Tibetan Buddhism”, it is clear that it will use this database as a tool to further alienate the Dalai Lama and curtail the influence of all the top lamas of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism, all of whom are in India, and that of Bon, Tibet’s homegrown religion. In 2011, the Chinese government established the Tibetan Buddhist Academy near Lhasa and instituted a separate class for young incarnate lamas under 16. Six of them are currently in the academy. The grooming of these young lamas, including the 7th Reting Rinpoche and 6th Dedrug Rinpoche, whose immediate predecessors served as regents before the Chinese occupation of Tibet, clearly illustrates Beijing’s political intention; these cherry-picked lamas will be used to validate the potential Beijing-selected 15th Dalai Lama and to show the world that the Tibetan Buddhist clergy’s acceptance of its choice. The urgency became evident when China began promoting its chosen Panchen Lama both domestically and internationally. The Panchen Lama’s appearance at the Third World Buddhist Forum held in Hong Kong in 2012 and his visit to Thailand in 2019 as a part of a Buddhist delegation are seen as Beijing’s intention to boost his international standing and recognition. Beijing will gradually increase his visits to Asian Buddhist countries, including Mongolia. His frequent visits to the Tibet Autonomous Region and other Tibetan areas incorporated into the neighbouring Chinese provinces reflect the urgency with which Beijing seeks his acceptance by the Tibetan people. It hopes that this will give him the spiritual gravitas to select the next Dalai Lama given the tradition of mutual recognition between the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas. This way, China can control the Tibetan spiritual space, something it has long sought to do.

Both these works, though ostensibly about deliberations of spouse-selection and the mayhem of organising weddings, offer insights into Indian social and political realities. So, I was looking forward to watching Nair’s adaptation of A Suitable Boy. Seth’s novel in tracing a 19-year-old girl, Lata’s choice of spouse from among three suitors, lays out how an individual’s quest for companionship is shaped by society, and, in so doing, convincingly explains how the personal is political. Similarly, Nair’s film addresses difficult and sensitive issues of child abuse and infidelity in the joyful framework of weddings. Nair has been bold to undertake an adaptation of this 1,500-page masterpiece. This certainly runs the risk of not being able to capture the complexities of the characters, political situations, and personal struggles. Nonetheless, this series is appealing for it has captured two key themes of the novel, which resonate with contemporary times, namely, inter-religious marriages and the different meanings of love. Lata’s attraction and compatibility with Kabir Durrani, her first suitor, is set against the backdrop of Hindu-Muslim relations in post-Independent India. Amid rising communal tensions (due to construction of a temple right next to a mosque), Kabir’s declarations of love remain insufficient to make him a suitable choice. Lata’s family has nothing against Kabir, they claim, yet marrying a Muslim in those troubled times, they remind Lata, is far from wise. Written in the 1990s, this novel was set in the 1950s, but Seth could well have sketched this character to suit current times, as furore over Hindu-Muslim unions continues, evident in the reaction to the now-retracted advertisement by the jewellery brand, Tanishq. Seth’s novel has generated debates on who would have been the ideal suitor for Lata. To some, Lata’s choice in Haresh Kapoor, the career-focused man, was conservative. The romantics would have opted for the suave, charming, lawyer-turned-poet Amit Chatterjee, and the daring would have liked to see Lata with the handsome, cricket-playing Muslim classmate, Kabir Durrani. In developing these characters, Seth generated a poignant discussion on whether there exists different types of love (passion, compatibility, duty), and which of these should motivate marriage. A strength of this series is that it has developed Haresh’s character well, and in doing so, contributed to this debate on different meanings of love. Nair has not presented Haresh simplistically as that choice which fits well with middle-class values and moralities of having a good job and being of an appropriate caste. Rather, she has been able to draw out that Lata chose Haresh for his sincerity, willingness to make adjustments for her, and a sense that he would let her grow into an individual of her own. This nuanced lens, however, is not adopted for Amit Chatterjee’s character, who is only depicted as a society man, charmed by Lata but too modern for her. Whereas in the novel, we see how Amit and Lata are deeply attracted to each other, perhaps due to a shared passion for poetry, but Amit’s expressions of interest are inconsistent and too few and far between, which makes Lata think of him as unpredictable to venture into married life.These experiences and deliberations of love and attraction seem quite relevant particularly for the urbane youth who seem to believe that romantic and passionate love must be the only worthy basis for marriage. This series, then, has reopened this debate in the Indian context, on whether marriage can be based on a love that does not emanate from intense passion, without necessarily questioning one’s sense of modernity. Nair’s adaptation has captured well how the personal is always political, and has explained well that religion, pride, and intent create an intricate web that is to be traversed in order to find a suitable spouse.

03-11-2020||News||Donald Trump and the future of the Republican Party | Opinion||Donald Trump upturned the political applecart in 2016 by assembling a coalition of anger. Now he’s arousing them to new heights of fear and loathing. He is losing parts of the coalition as a result but hopes enough fence-sitters and fellow-travellers who stayed home in 2016 will rally to him. In addition, the Republican Party is using every administrative trick to put up obstacles to Democratic voters and counting on a Right-tilting Supreme Court to wink at them. But the American Right-wing should be praying for a Trump defeat. If he were to come back, he would put the Republicans on a path to ideological perdition. The 2016 polls undercounted the number of working-class and small-town White voters who wanted an anti-establishment candidate. As a team under political scientist Loren Collingwood showed, dislike for their national elite was so strong millions of them voted for Barack Obama because he was an outsider even though many were unhappy about his colour. Trump repudiated almost every element of traditional Right-wing ideology along the way, including free trade, open borders and fiscal conservatism, and won their backing in large part because he did so. Trump is hurting today because Covid-19 showed his administrative competence was not on par with his ability to tap this anger. He also didn’t deliver on his promises to overturn the establishment. Lots of noisy immigration bashing, racist signalling, tax cuts and so on, but the system is largely intact. Finally, his own misogyny, entitlement and boorishness appealed to no one. His support among White women of all classes has flagged. Elderly Whites are appalled by his pandemic response. College educated White men align with his policies but find the man distasteful. He has picked up new support. Twice as many young Latinos and Blacks like his elite-bashing. But almost every election analyst in the US says Trump has lost more than he has gained – and this makes returning to the White House more a maze than a path. It could yet happen, thanks largely to vagaries of the US electoral college system. If he can hold onto all the southern and western states he won in 2016, he would need only two largish Midwestern states, say Pennsylvania and Ohio, to breast the tape. Or it could end up in the Supreme Court. But the odds are against him. Democratic candidate Joe Biden has the 232 electoral college votes that went for Hillary Clinton in the bag. He only needs 38 more to win and he can get them from roughly any three of the dozen swing states in play. And most polls have him leading in two-thirds of them. The polls, the pocketbooks and the pandemic are lining up for Biden. The real question for the Republican Party is their own future. In 2012, the party realised its base was increasingly Whites in non-metropolitan areas, an aging and shrinking demographic. A famous party analysis, called “the autopsy,” laid out a strategy to target Latinos and youth. The party began implementing it, but then Trump came along. He broke the party’s fraying coalition of blue-collar Whites and business, doubling down on the first part and discarding the second. He energised the base so they came out in numbers, picked up discontented in other groups as well, but has put the Republicans on a dismal path.If Trump returns, the Republican Party will be fully redrawn as a caricature: Protectionist, isolationist, anti-immigrant, blue collar and deeply racist. The party will jettison its belief in free markets, minimal government and balanced budgets. More importantly, it will lose its ability to attract socially conservative minorities, the party’s best hope to create a winning electoral coalition. For history buffs: he will resurrect the short-lived Know Nothing Party of the 1850s, imbuing it with a similar sense of paranoia. It is one reason big business, both Silicon Valley and Wall Street, leans against Trump. If he returns, they will fully turn against the Republicans. It is true that there is much less political space in the US for free trade and untrammelled markets. Trump pressed the accelerator on an existing bipartisan trend. Biden’s election manifesto is all about industrial policy and managed trade. But, as the Pew Research Center and others have shown, today a Democrat is more likely to be in favour of trade agreements and foreign policy alliances than a Republican. Trump 2.0, by driving away minorities, college-educated Whites and Big Tech, will push his party further down this path. The problem is the residue he will have left are what Hillary Clinton called “deplorables” — disgruntled working-class Whites steeped in racism and QAnon. Hence the many anti-Trump Republican groups, like the Lincoln Project, and so many traditional conservatives have endorsed Biden. They hope a Trump defeat will allow them to recapture the base, return to “the autopsy” and align the US Right with an increasingly more diversified and digital America. The New Yorker recently cited Indian-American Nikki Haley as the standard-bearer of this school. However, there are strong signs that even without Trump, the Republicans will not change their present path. Too many of their Nextgen leaders see his formula as a winner. They will be less crude and polarising, but they will be about preserving a mythical White America and using state intervention and evangelical rulebooks to do so. The US’s fate under them can be summed up in Trump’s quip, “I think if this country gets any kinder or gentler, it’s literally going to cease to exist.”pchaudhuri@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/donald-trump-and-the-future-of-the-republican-party-opinion/story-8u8GaCoBFmgWPSUHyEbFgO.html
