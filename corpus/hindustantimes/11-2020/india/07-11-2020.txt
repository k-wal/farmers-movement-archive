UAE President, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, approved federal law decrees to amend personal status, civil transactions, penal code, and criminal procedural laws to enhance the legislative environment and “entrench the principles of tolerance in the society and strengthen the country’s position as a preferred hub that attracts people to reside and work”, state-run WAM news agency reported. The UAE is home to some 3.4 million Indians, one of the largest diaspora populations in West Asia, and the expatriates include professionals and blue collar workers. The changes were described by The National newspaper as “one of the biggest overhauls of the legal system in years” and the new laws “reflect progressive measures to improve living standards” and to ensure the UAE remains “a destination for foreign direct investment”. Several of the changes will have significant implications for expatriates, as the laws of the country of origin will now apply in matters such as divorces instead of Shariah or Islamic law. “Based on the UAE’s solid commitment to protecting women’s rights, amendments to the penal code and criminal procedural law have repealed the article giving reduced (lenient) sentence in what is called ‘honour crimes’,” WAM reported. In cases of divorce or separation of expatriates in the UAE, the laws of the country where the marriage took place will apply, and a court could mediate in the division of joint assets and joint accounts. Cases of wills or division of assets of a deceased expatriate who didn’t leave a will also will be handled under the laws of the country of nationality, instead of Shariah, as was the case in the past. Suicide and attempted suicide were decriminalised under the changes. Anyone who survived an attempt to take their life could have been prosecuted under the earlier laws. Alcohol consumption too was decriminalised and a person drinking or in possession of alcohol or selling alcohol in authorised areas without an alcohol licence won’t face penalties, according to media reports. However, a person must be 21 years old to drink legally and anyone found selling alcohol to an underage person will still be punished. The changes also allow the “legal cohabitation of unmarried couples”. So far, it was illegal for an unmarried couple or unrelated persons to share a home in the UAE. Consensual sex won’t be punished under the changes, but consensual sex involving a person under 14 years of age or a mentally challenged person will be punished. A person convicted of sexual intercourse with a minor or mentally challenged person by force will be given the death penalty. A key change to the penal code was the abolition of an article that allowed reduced punishment for so-called “honour crimes”. Under the changes, such crimes will be treated as assault or murder. Another important change that could benefit Indians is an amendment to the penal procedural law that states arresting officers must have an interpreter present if a suspect or witness doesn’t know Arabic. Courts must also ensure that legal translators are available for defendants and witnesses who don’t speak Arabic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-unveils-major-changes-to-personal-and-criminal-laws/story-OVg8fVLWMTbQzX1D9CEQbO.html
07-11-2020||India||New farm laws: Open to talks with farmers, says govt||Ahead of another farmer protest planned for month-end against the three farm laws, the Centre on Saturday asserted that these laws are in the interest of the farming community and it was still open to have dialogue with them and clear their doubts.       Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar as well as food minister Piyush Goyal said these laws are enacted by the central government in order to give more options to farmers to sell their produce at better rates, but states like Punjab are “misleading” them. Ever since the three laws were passed in Parliament in September, farmers have been protesting largely in the Congress-ruled states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Punjab which have brought their own farm laws to negate the central acts. Speaking to reporters, Tomar said: “If they (Opposition) wear farmers’ glasses and see the laws, they will be able to see the benefits for farmers. If they see from the political prism, they cannot see the benefits.”     He also reiterated that farmers will continue to get MSP for the notified crops and procurement centres will continue to function.       “Opposition is spreading misinformation and lies,” he alleged adding that the data on paddy procurement undertaken in Punjab so far in the ongoing kharif season itself shows the Centre’s commitment towards MSP buying.       Stating that such protests are confined to Punjab, Goyal said those will wither way. It was not successful in neighbouring Haryana.     “Procurement centres are fully operational even now. In fact, we have increased them substantially this year. So, there is no question of the Centre scrapping MSP procurement...,” he said, and urged the Opposition to stop misleading farmers. He said the total paddy procurement across the country has risen sharply to 745 lakh tonne till November 6 of the 2020-21 kharif marketing season from 318 lakh tonne in the same period of 2013-14.     Goyal also mentioned that unless the protesting farmers do not clear the rail tracks in Punjab and the state government does not ensure law and order, the services cannot be resumed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-farm-laws-open-to-talks-with-farmers-says-govt/story-UcifxWbSx6gjpO5PdohusM.html

But as per the current estimates the chances for this year are only Rs 33,704 crore as the income. With this, the state’s own income will be reduced by Rs 33,904 crore.The officials said the state government’s share in the Central taxes had also decreased considerably. In the Union Budget it was mentioned that for 2020-2021 financial year, the Centre would allocate Rs 16,727 crore to the State as its (State’s) share. According to this, the state should get Rs 8363 crore for the financial year 2020-2021 from April to October. But the state received only Rs 6,339 crore from the Centre. As on date there is a reduction of Rs 2025 crore in the taxes. By the end of financial year 2020-2021, it is estimated that the state would get Rs 11,898 Crore instead of Rs 16,727 crore, which was its actual due. With this, the state would lose Rs 4,829 crore, they said.Under several centrally sponsored and assisted schemes, the state has to get Rs 9,725 crore from the centre. By October, the state should have got Rs 5,673 crore, but it got only Rs 4,592 crore - a shortfall of Rs 1,081 crore from the Centre. By end of this financial year, the state may get only Rs 8,923 crore instead of Rs 9,725 crore. Thus, there will be Rs 802 crore cut in the centrally sponsored and assisted schemes’ funds.Since there will be a shortfall of Rs 52,750 crore in the state’s overall income, the chief minister instructed the officials concerned to fix priorities accordingly and prepare financial management plan.The officials from the finance department also told the chief minister that there had been no financial assistance from the Centre to rehabilitate the victims of the recent rains and floods. The matter was mentioned when the topic on the Centre’s assistance for the recent rains and floods came up for discussion on Saturday at the review meeting.Rao had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 15 stating that there was a loss of crops and properties to the extent of Rs 5,000 crore due to rains and floods and requested for release of Rs 1,350 crore as an immediate relief.“The President, Vice President and the PM have expressed their shock over the heavy rains and floods. They spoke with the CM and personally inquired about the situation. The Central team also visited the state and assessed the situation. After all this, we have expected some assistance from the Centre. But as on date, not even a single rupee is released,” the officials told KCR as Rao is also known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-to-cut-budget-allocations-after-rs-53k-cr-revenue-loss-due-to-covid-19/story-O9ds20qD76FMRZ6sqE5ndI.html
07-11-2020||India||Centre’s first drone pilot training programme announced at IGRUA||The Centre-run flight training institute Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA) here on Saturday announced its expansion plan to begin drone pilot training courses, a first of its kind initiative by a government body.The premier aircraft pilot training institute in Uttar Pradesh had recently entered into an agreement with Delhi-based private firm Drone Destination for the collaborative effort.Noting that drones are an “absolutely new and emerging area with immeasurable potential and opportunities”, Ministry of Civil Aviation (MOCA) Secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola said “making of drones is becoming a reality in India”.“We led the software revolution, and in the drone revolution also we have the potential of becoming number one. In that direction, we have taken a small step. The first thing is even drone operations require pilots and one of the first training centres for drones is being established in IGRUA,” Kharola said.“The entire regulatory framework for drones has been put in place and very soon drones would be regulated, monitored, observed and controlled just as is being done for aircraft,” he added.He also noted that in the coming years, the number of drones flying in the Indian skies may go into hundreds of thousands and their monitoring would be a challenge.Also Read | Country’s first batch of certified pilots ready to operate drones“The challenge is that we have to ensure that not only we become leaders in drone manufacturing but also in their management,” Kharola said.He also mooted the idea for IGRUA, a government-run autonomous institute, to eventually move into drone manufacturing, design and management besides imparting training for its pilots.Kharola, who was joined by MOCA Joint Secretary Amber Dubey, was speaking at the 36th foundation day of IGRUA.IGRUA Director Krishnendu Gupta said drone pilot training would begin shortly at the institute’s campus located at Fursatganj in Amethi.“Under the collaborative initiative, IGRUA will provide its resources while the Drone Destination will chip in with its expertise in drones to train the aspirants,” Gupta told PTI.He said the course duration would be around two-weeks and added that the institute will soon also begin a programme on English Language Proficiency (ELP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-s-first-drone-pilot-training-programme-announced-at-igrua/story-g8MEZehYb51WLbKrLxN3SO.html
07-11-2020||India||After a muted Durga Puja, Bengal prepares for winter’s fairs and festivals||After celebrating a muted Durga Puja and the Calcutta High Court imposing multiple restrictions on Kali Puja and other pujas, Bengal is now looking forward to its multiple fairs and festivals that are organized every year during the winter.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has directed various departments to explore if fairs could be held in various districts which would not only help the artisans to sell their handicrafts but would also help the government to showcase its projects ahead of the Bengal polls. “The chief minister, in a recent administrative meeting, has asked officials to explore whether in each of the blocks in the districts small fairs and exhibitions could be organised. Officials have been directed to plan from now so that the fairs could be held during the peak winter months of December and January,” a senior official. Starting from November, multiple fairs and festivals are organized in Kolkata and in the districts that attract lakhs of visitors. Artisans and traders from across the state participate in the fairs to sell their products resulting in a huge volume of trade. The list includes some of the biggest fairs and festivals such as the International Kolkata Book Fair, the Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF), the handicraft fair, trade fair and food festival. In January the Ganga Sagar Mela, the second largest congregation of pilgrims in India after the Kumbh Mela, is held. “While preparations have already begun for the Ganga Sagar Mela, the KIFF has been postponed till January. Talks are yet to be held to hold the book fair,” said a senior official. The chief minister has also asked the tourism department and the MSME department to explore whether small fairs could be organized in and around the tourist destinations in the coming months. “This would not just help to promote tourism but would also help to support the local artisans. Some of the fairs have been started by the TMC government after it came to power,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-a-muted-durga-puja-bengal-prepares-for-winter-s-fairs-and-festivals/story-I8uSj9kPNZ3oyUiwpHqaCJ.html

07-11-2020||India||Day after Amit Shah’s visit to Bengal, TMC, BJP taunt each other||The political temperature in Bengal shot up a few degrees on Saturday with the ruling Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party attacking each other a day after Union home minister Amit Shah returned from a two-day visit. While the TMC questioned the credentials of Jay Shah, son of the Union home minister, who holds the post of the secretary of Board of Control for Cricket in India, the BJP started a twitter campaign with the hashtag #BanglarPappuDiwas (Bengal’s Pappu Day) tagging Abhishek Banerjee, nephew of chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Shah had come on a two-day visit to Bengal to take stock of the party’s organisational preparedness ahead of the crucial 2021 Bengal assembly elections. During his many interactions with the media and BHP workers Shah hit out at the TMC over its alleged minority appeasement and deteriorating law and order, demanded a white paper on political killings and urged voters to give the BJP a chance to run West Bengal. “What credentials Jay Shah has to suddenly hold one of India’s top administrative cricket posts? Or what magic formula Jay Shah had to become BCCI secretary out of nowhere?” the TMC said in a statement, released after Shah’s visit. The statement also accused Shah of playing dirty politics. The BJP, however, hit out and launched a counter-offensive against Abhishek Banerjee with the party’s IT cell starting a Twitter campaign targeting the chief minister’s nephew. “India has seen how BJP’s development agenda and positivity scores over dynasty politics nationally. Bengal can’t afford to get mired in the same incompetence of family politics. Bengal will reject @abhishekAITC brand of siphoning public money and politics of fear. #BanglarPappuDiwas,” tweeted Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP’s national general secretary. After the BJP’s impressive performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which the party won 18 out of the 42 seats, the BJP is now eyeing the West Bengal assembly. On October 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the people of Bengal on the occasion of Durga Sasthi virtually sounding the poll bugle. Shah’s visit seemed to have also temporarily ended some of the infighting in the Bengal unit of the BJP.In the last week of October, West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh dissolved all the district committees of the BJPs Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the state youth front headed by Lok Sabha member Saumitra Khan. Later, an aggrieved Khan left the BJYM WhatsApp group, saying he would resign from the BJP. He, however, returned to the group after a few hours and uploaded a video message on his Twitter handle. The party’s central leaders had to intervene.On Saturday, however, a day after Shah’s visit, the BJP came up with a fresh list of BJYM district presidents. “There aren’t any differences. A new list of BJYM district presidents have been announced with the permission of central leadership. This is final,” said a senior BJP leader. While the BJP has already made some organisational changes in its Bengal unit and central leaders want the state unit to hit the road with full steam and subsequently intensify campaign for the assembly polls due in about five months, Shah during his visit is known to have laid out detailed plans and guidelines on how to reach the finish line. The entire movement will be monitored from Delhi, a senior BJP leader said. On Saturday both the BJP and the TMC announced new members who joined their parties. While the BJP said that two former local CPI (M) leaders joined the party, the TMC said that some members of the civil society including former police officers and professors signed up for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-amit-shah-s-visit-to-bengal-tmc-bjp-taunt-each-other/story-wAstfnrVMvn0zKPYWubHuJ.html

Nath is making calls to them. It was Nath who played the politics of horse trading and effected manipulations. Nath has muddied politics of Madhya Pradesh,” Chouhan told reporters.He was responding to a query on allegations raised by Nath on Friday that the BJP was again trying to lure away some legislators of the Congress.By-elections were held on November 3 for the 28 constituencies, 25 of which fell vacant due to resignations by Congress MLAs who joined the BJP earlier this year while the rest three seats have been unrepresented due to demise of the sitting legislators.“...Whenever Congress resorts to this (horse-trading), it’s termed as management but when someone comes to us (join the BJP) on his own, then it is called a horse-trading,” Chouhan said.Holding Nath responsible for “political corruption”, the senior BJP leader said MLAs of the BJP would not fall prey to the attempts being made by the Congress to lure them.“Our MLAs work for principles and ideology,” he said.Chouhan further said Congress and Nath were rattled as they have sensed imminent defeat in the bypolls.On Friday, Nath issued a statement accusing the BJP of luring its MLAs with “offers”.“The BJP is sensing a crushing defeat in the byelections. They are now resorting to horse trading (of MLAs). I have spoken with several MLAs of the Congress who informed me about the offers and allurements they were receiving from the BJP,” stated the former chief minister, who lost power in March this year after 22 MLAs of the Congress joined the BJP under former MP Jyotiraditya Scindia.In the 230-member Madhya Pradesh Assembly, the BJP currently has 107 members and required nine more MLAs to attain a simple majority, while the Congress’ tally stands at 87.Among other members, the BSP has two legislators, while the SP has one member besides four Independents.

07-11-2020||India||SIT advises action against IPS officer, 24 others for links with slain gangster Vikas Dubey||The Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted to probe various aspects of the Kanpur ambush by slain gangster Vikas Dubey recommended action against 25 police personnel of Kanpur and Lucknow, including a deputy inspector general (DIG) rank officer said a senior police official privy to the SIT report.The other offices against whom action has been recommended include an additional superintendent of police (ASP) and two deputy superintendents of police (DSPs).The SIT report pointed towards a nexus between Vikas Dubey and police as well as officials from other government departments, the official added. The SIT had submitted its findings to the state government on Wednesday.The official said the IPS officer allegedly had links with Dubey’s aides and facilitated their work during his posting in Kanpur around a year ago. The probe also showed that the officer was soft on taking action against Dubey and his aides even after getting several complaints and alerts from his subordinates.He said ASP had been posted in the rural area of Kanpur for a long time and was transferred from there only a week before Vikas Dubey and his aides killed eight police personnel, including deputy SP Devendra Mishra, in an ambush during a raid on his house at Bikru village in Kanpur district on the night of July 3. He said the ASP, too, allegedly had links with Dubey and his associates.The official said a deputy SP, who was posted in Kanpur as circle officer (Local Intelligence Unit) for a long time was also on the list of officers against whom action was recommended. Action against the DSP has been recommended for his failure to provide inputs about the fire power of Vikas Dubey’s gang, he added.He said action was also recommended against another DSP, who was posted as circle officer (CO) of the Sarojininagar area in Lucknow during 2017 and two inspectors who were posted at the Krishna Nagar police station at that time. He said the DSP and two inspectors were held responsible for negligence that led to the release of a .30 bore Springfield rifle that was later allegedly used by Dubey to open indiscriminate fire on the police team at Bikru.He said three police officers of Lucknow had reportedly not taken proper measures to keep the rifle seized or ensure cancellation of the licence after the weapon’s seizure from Dubey when he was arrested from his residence at Lucknow’s Krishna Nagar on October 30, 2017. He said the rifle was in the name of his brother Deepak Dubey and it was released from the local court in six months due to improper pursuance of the matter by the investigation officers as well as the supervising officer. He said the two former inspectors were investigation officers while the deputy SP was the supervising officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-advises-action-against-ips-officer-24-others-for-links-with-slain-gangster-vikas-dubey/story-2ZtUJZcG3wZ3HRHFDrSo7O.html
07-11-2020||India||Yashvardhan Kumar Sinha appointed new Chief Information Commissioner||Yashvardhan Kumar Sinha was appointed as the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) on Saturday, according to a Rashtrapati Bhavan statement. President Ram Nath Kovind administered the oath of office to Sinha as the Chief Information Commissioner in the Central Information Commission at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan, it said. The post of the chief of transparency watchdog was lying vacant for over two months after Bimal Julka completed his term on August 26. Sinha, a former diplomat, joined as the Information Commissioner on January 1, 2019. He has served as India’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka. Sinha, aged 62, will have a tenure of about three years as the CIC. A CIC and Information Commissioner are appointed for a tenure of five years or till they attain the age of 65 years. Later, Sinha administered the oath of office to journalist Uday Mahurkar, former Labour Secretary Heera Lal Samariya and former Deputy Comptroller and Auditor General Saroj Punhani as Information Commissioners. With the induction of Mahurkar, Samariya and Punhani, the strength of Information Commissioner has gone up to seven. Vanaja N Sarna, Neeraj Kumar Gupta, Suresh Chandra and Amita Pandove are the other Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission. Transparency watchdog Central Information Commission, mandated to decide complaints and appeals filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, can have a Chief Information Commissioner and ten Information Commissioners. There is still a vacancy of three Information Commissioners in the Commission. “Mahurkar, a veteran journalist, before joining as Information Commissioner in the Central Information Commission, was functioning as Senior Deputy Editor with a leading media house,” a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry said. He has graduated from Gujarat’s Maharaja Sayajirao University in Indian history, culture and archaeology. Samariya, a 1985-batch IAS officer of Telangana cadre, retired as Secretary, Ministry of Labour & Employment in September. “His area of expertise includes Administration and Governance,” it said. Punhani, an Indian Audit and Accounts Service (IAAS) officer of 1984 batch, served as the Deputy Comptroller & Auditor General (HR & Training) in government of India. “Her area of expertise includes Administration and Governance,” the statement added. All four -- CIC and three Information Commissioners -- were short-listed for the posts by a three-member committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in its meeting held late last month. Besides Modi, leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Home Minister Amit Shah are members of the panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yashvardhan-kumar-sinha-appointed-new-chief-information-commissioner/story-IKpsL1CZdVtLMYGAXmJgTM.html

The pendency of this matter does not preclude you (Goswami) or the other accused from approaching the concerned lower court seeking regular bail,” the court said.If a bail plea is filed, then the sessions court shall decide it within four days, it said.The high court was hearing petitions filed by Goswami, a high-profile TV journalist, and two other accused -- Feroze Shaikh and Nitish Sarda -- seeking interim bail and challenging their “illegal arrest”.The trio were arrested by Alibaug police in Maharashtra’s Raigad district on November 4 in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother in 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by the accused’s respective firms.The petitions also sought a stay to the investigation and quashing of the FIR.The court, which on Saturday only heard arguments on interim bail, said it would hear the petitioners on quashing of the FIR on December 10, after Diwali vacation.After his arrest from his Lower Parel residence here amid high drama on Wednesday, Goswami was taken to Alibaug, where the Chief Judicial Magistrate remanded him and two others in judicial custody till November 18.As the magistrate refused to remand them in police custody, the Alibaug police filed revision plea in the Raigad district court, which said earlier on Saturday that it will hear it on November 9.Goswami is presently lodged at a local school which has been designated as a COVID-19 centre for the Alibaug prison.The high court, hearing the arguments on Saturday, sought to know why the petitioners did not move the lower court first for bail. “The high court is already overburdened with regular bail appeals. We do not want to undermine the authority of the sessions court which is empowered to hear regular bail plea,” Justice Shinde said.In his bail plea, Goswami alleged that he and his family were assaulted by the police during the arrest, and he suffered a “six-inch deep gash on his left hand, a serious injury to his spinal cord”.But his lawyers did not raise these allegations during the arguments.Senior counsel Amit Desai, appearing for Maharashtra government, opposed bail, saying there was fresh material to reopen the case which had been closed earlier.The accused should have approached the sessions court first, and if they do so, the “police will not seek adjournments or prolong the hearing,” Desai said. Desai also argued that just because Alibaug police had filed an `A’ Summary report closing the case, it does not mean there can be no fresh probe. “`A’ summary does not mean the offence did not occur or that the case is false. It only means that the investigation could not be completed. This is a matter that is now again under investigation,” he said.He also contended that no permission was required to be taken from the magistrate to carry out further probe.“The state government ordered the (fresh) probe pursuant to which the police intimated the magistrate on October 15, 2020. The magistrate noted `Seen’ and kept the file on record.“After this, the statements of several witnesses including the victim’s family were recorded before the magistrate under section 164 of CrPC,” he said.Senior counsel Shirish Gupte, appearing for victim Anvay Naik’s wife Akshata Naik, also opposed the pleas, and said the magistrate had accepted the closure report in 2019 without giving the victim’s family an opportunity to object.Advocate Devadatt Kamat, appearing for Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, sought deletion of Singh’s name as respondent in Goswami’s plea, saying the case was filed by Alibaug police and he had nothing to do with it. The HC, meanwhile, also sought response from the state government on a petition filed by Anvay Naik’s daughter Adnya Naik seeking a fresh probe by an independent agency. It will be heard on December 8.Goswami’s lawyers, during the hearing earlier, had claimed that the allegations against him were baseless and Maharashtra government only wanted to harass him because of his outspokenness as a journalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-high-court-reserves-order-on-arnab-goswami-s-bail-plea-no-immediate-relief/story-M4ODWdO5JfC2GToC7yd0OP.html
07-11-2020||India||After last week’s violence against minorities, India has taken up the issue with Bangladesh: MEA||Following vandalisation of houses, belonging to a minority community in Bangladesh, the Indian High Commission in Dhaka and Posts in the neighbouring country are in close contact with the local government, said the Ministry of External Affairs on Saturday.“We have seen reports of an incident of violence directed against the minority community in the Muradnagar upazila of Cumilla in eastern Bangladesh,” Anurag Srivastava, spokesperson of the ministry, said in a statement.“Our High Commission and Posts in Bangladesh are in close contact with local authorities in the Government of Bangladesh who have taken this incident, and all other incidents relating to efforts to stoke social and communal tensions, very seriously,” he said.He added India had been informed that law enforcement authorities are investigating the outbreak of violence. “They continue to remain vigilant to prevent any untoward disturbance,” the spokesperson said further.According to media reports, last week houses were vandalised after a Bangladeshi national -- who lives in France -- allegedly praised President Emmanuel Macron for taking decisions against “inhumane ideologies” after a teacher in Paris was beheaded for showing caricatures of the Prophet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-last-week-s-violence-against-minorities-india-has-taken-up-the-issue-with-bangladesh-mea/story-GZgmvw47GPm2EYyCOqleLO.html
07-11-2020||India||Centre says open for talks with farmers on farm laws ahead of another protest||Ahead of another farmer protest planned for month-end against the three farm laws, the Centre on Saturday asserted that these laws are in the interest of the farming community and it was still open to have dialogue with them and clear their doubts.       Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar as well as food minister Piyush Goyal said these laws are enacted by the central government in order to give more options to farmers to sell their produce at better rates, but states like Punjab are “misleading” them. Ever since the three laws were passed in Parliament in September, farmers have been protesting largely in the Congress-ruled states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Punjab which have brought their own farm laws to negate the central acts. Speaking to reporters, Tomar said: “If they (Opposition) wear farmers’ glasses and see the laws, they will be able to see the benefits for farmers. If they see from the political prism, they cannot see the benefits.”     He also reiterated that farmers will continue to get the minimum support price (MSP) for the notified crops and procurement centres will continue to function.       “Opposition is spreading misinformation and lies,” he alleged adding that the data on paddy procurement undertaken in Punjab so far in the ongoing kharif season itself shows the Centre’s commitment towards MSP buying.       About 169 lakh tonne of paddy has been procured in Punjab alone till November 6 of the 2020-21 kharif marketing season, as against 81 lakh tonne in the same period of 2013-14, he added.     Stating that such protests are confined to Punjab, Goyal said those will wither way. It was not successful in neighbouring Haryana.    “Procurement centres are fully operational even now. In fact, we have increased them substantially this year. So, there is no question of the Centre scrapping MSP procurement...,” he said, and urged the Opposition to stop misleading farmers.      He said the total paddy procurement across the country has risen sharply to 745 lakh tonne till November 6 of the 2020-21 kharif marketing season from 318 lakh tonne in the same period of 2013-14.     Goyal also mentioned that unless the protesting farmers do not clear the rail tracks in Punjab and the state government does not ensure law and order, the services cannot be resumed. Paddy procurement commenced from September 26 in Punjab and elsewhere from October 1. It may be noted that Bharti Kisan Union (Lakhowal) had organised road blockade on November 5, while another protest is being planned under the banner of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) in Delhi on November 26-27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-says-open-for-talks-with-farmers-on-farm-laws-ahead-of-another-protest/story-4k5nmKrMGkX5OOcs12ON3K.html
07-11-2020||India||Bihar exit poll: Times Now-CVoter says Tejashwi ahead of Nitish Kumar in race to power||The Times Now-C Voter exit poll has projected that the RJD-led Grand Alliance could be within striking distance of pipping the Nitish Kumar-led NDA to the winning post by a narrow margin. The exit poll doesn’t give the Tejashwi Yadav-led alliance a clear majority in the 243-member house, but if its projection of 120 seats for the GA against NDA’s 116 seats comes true, it would only need to win the support of two MLAs from outside the alliance to reach the half-way mark of 122 seats.The projections, if they match the poll outcome on November 10 when the votes are counted, would be a big setback for the Nitish Kumar-led ruling combine which had hoped to sail through the elections faced by a relatively inexperienced opposition leadership.The exit poll trends have been released on the last day of the three-phased assembly elections in Bihar.Exit polls have often proved to be way off the mark in the past including in the 2015 Bihar assembly elections when only one pollster got the outcome right. Exit polls are conducted by interviewing the voters after they have cast their votes and are limited by a narrow sample size and unreliability of responses received. The opposition alliance is led by the RJD, which is contesting on 144 seats; followed by the Congress on 70 seats and CPI(ML) on 19. In the NDA camp, the JD(U) is contesting on 115 seats and BJP on 110. The polling came to an end on Saturday evening with over 55% votes polled for the 78 seats of the 243 member assembly that voted in the third phase.In the first and the second phase on October 28 and November 3 respectively, 71 and 94 constituencies had gone to polls. On Saturday, people in the remaining 78 constituencies voted.JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar, who has already spent over 14 years as chief minister, was seeking another shot at the state’s chief minister. This is said to be one of his toughest electoral challenges given the relentless attacks not only from the opposition but also erstwhile ally and former NDA constituent, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP).He had rejected suggestions that he faced an anti-incumbency factor and addressed over 110 election meetings. At his last rally in Purnea, he had announced that this would be his last election. As the opposition latched on to this statement, claiming that Nitish Kumar had run out of steam, the JD (U) rushed to clarify that he did not mean that he would exit politics but that he was addressing his last election meeting for the 2020 Bihar elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-exit-poll-times-now-cvoter-says-tejashwi-ahead-of-nitish-kumar-in-race-to-power/story-aJC7bfk56hM61yuY66eiUL.html
07-11-2020||India||ISRO gearing up for launch of small satellite launch vehicles: K Sivan||Indian Space Research Organisation is gearing up for a series of missions, including launch of small satellite launch vehicles, chairman K Sivan said on Saturday. He made the comments after the successful launch of earth observation satellite - EOS-01- and nine customer satellites onboard its Polar rocket, PSLV-C49, from this spaceport, about 110 km from Chennai. Addressing the scientists at the Mission Control Centre, he said “..we have started this mission (PSLV-C49/EOS-01) after COVID pandemic.Now we have a series of missions on our hands.Immediately we are going to have the PSLV-C50. It is going to launch satellite CMS01 then we will be having the new vehicle SSLV, the first development flight.” According to ISRO, those satellites which weigh less and come with limited launch options, can be sent on Small Satellite Launch Vehicles (SSLVs). The earth observation satellite sent on PSLV-C49 was weighing around 630 kg. Currently, small satellites are sent along with other big satellites which are launched using ISRO’s trusted workhorse polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLVs) or Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle (GSLV). Sivan said ISRO was also planning to launch Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle GSLV-F10 carrying earth observation satellite -- EOS-03. “I am sure team ISRO will always rise to the occasion and meet the requirements as per the demand put on them,” he said. Meanwhile, in a press release, ISRO said following the successful launch of the PSLV-C49/EOS-01 on Saturday, the ISRO Telemetry Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru assumed control of the earth observation satellite which is the primary satellite. “In the coming days, the satellite will be brought to its final operational configuration,” the release said. EOS-01, an earth observation satellite, is intended for applications in agriculture, forestry and disaster management support. The nine customer satellites are from Lithuania, Luxembourg and USA were launched under a commercial agreement with NewSpace India Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-gearing-up-for-launch-of-small-satellite-launch-vehicles-k-sivan/story-0MsZhmGsIlx0984Y1GNR6I.html
07-11-2020||India||‘When you act you have to detach yourself from being a trainer’||Best remembered for his role of Suleiman Isa in ‘Sacred Games’ and Kakaji in ‘Manmarziyaan,’ celebrity acting coach Saurabh Sachdev feels teaching someone how to act and acting yourself are two very different streams. “It’s a different ball game to teach and act yourself. When you act you have to detach yourself from being a trainer. When I enact scenes with my students it actually becomes challenging as an actor to not to think as a coach and hold back from finding flaws in my protégé’s act,” said Saurabh who has been busy with his global online classes during the pandemic. Known to have trained the likes of Varun Dhawan, Arjun Kapoor, Richa Chadha, Freida Pinto to name a few, Saurabh says it has been a tough phase for all institutes and training centres. “Like others my training institute ‘The Actors Truth’ too is closed since March and I have been taking online classes. Though teaching online did bring in many more students from far and wide but at the same time it became very challenging to train in such a manner. Acting is such a profession which is not viable without human connect in real time so it does get complicated to teach virtually.” Suarabh is all happy as his recently released series and film has earned him praises around. Talking more about his OTT series-cum-film, he said, “When Bejoy Nambiar offered me this character in ‘Taish,’ I was totally thrilled as it had many interesting layers and a superb story. I remember how he gave me a full-hand in carving my character and the same time suggested not to go overboard. The way the series has shaped up it has been a very contented project. Next in line is another web series ‘Raat Baaki Hai,’ with an interesting cast.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/when-you-act-you-have-to-detach-yourself-from-being-a-trainer/story-yb6HN8bgiEseVSMK6lXLIP.html
07-11-2020||India||Stories on OTT ar more relatable, says Mansi||Impressed with its content and storytelling, actor Mansi Srivastava is making a gradual shift from TV to OTT shows. She lately did a series ‘Ratri Ke Yatri’ with Iqbal Khan and is currently shooting for Sharon Anish Khan’s show ‘The Prayag Raj’ in Lucknow. “I’m making a steady shift from one medium to another as I have realised that web has a broader reach, more audience and I can well relate to its way of storytelling as an actor. I find it more natural and subtle. Now, the scenario has changed and a lot of actors are doing digital shows,” said the ‘Ishqbaaz’ actor. The actor candidly admits that she does not relate to all the roles on TV. “I did a few shows and I very well understand that in television we need ‘extra’ drama.” She started her journey with ‘Suvreen Guggal: Topper of the year.’ “Next I did a web show ‘By The Way’ (BTW) that had mini episodes but at that time digital was not so big. So I came back to TV as it was better doing something than just waiting for films. I tried and selecting good roles. Beyond that, it was not in my hand! Probably, that is why I’m satisfied with my TV career.” Mansi played lead in ‘Do Dil Bandhe ek Dori se’, did ‘Sasural Simar Ka’, a cop in ‘Ishqbaaz’, comedy in ‘Peterson Hill’, negative-supernatural in ‘Divya Drishti’ while her last show was ‘Vidya.’ Talking more about her current project, she said, “In this series, I am playing Riya Bajpai, a college student. She is the most descent character in the show without any ‘maar-dhar’ and abuses. It has a good growth graph during the course of the show. We have shot in three colleges in Lucknow.” Shooting in Covid conditions she feels a bit scared. “I keep taking steam inhalation on the set and also taking all precautions. In college scenes, we have 100s of junior artistes plus the vast crew so it’s a bit daunting.During unlock phase my father was tested Covid positive and recovered, so I know that how dangerous it is. I hope others understand,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/stories-on-ott-ar-more-relatable-says-mansi/story-wuE1qr0dM8XFdNgFEKLZOP.html
07-11-2020||India||Muslim League MLA arrested in alleged gold jewellery cheating case in Kerala||The Kerala police on Saturday arrested Muslim League legislator from north Kerala M C Kamaruddin in connection with an alleged gold investment cheating case. He was the chairman of Fashion Gold, a chain of jewellery shops started with the help of local funding. The jewellery chain closed four months back after accumulated loss leaving many investors in the lurch. More than 110 cases were filed against the promoters and investors blamed the mismanagement and misappropriation of funds for the loss. According to the police, investors have lost between Rs 30 to Rs 50 crore. When the case cropped up two months back, the Muslim League had asked the legislator to take up immediate steps to repay money to investors but he sought more time. The party is likely to action against him. Many opposition leaders said the arrest was a politically motivated to distract attention from the issues the government was facing. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s principal secretary M Sivasankar was arrested in connection with gold smuggling case and the CPI(M) state secretary’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri was detained in Bengaluru last week in a money laundering case related to a drug bust. Opposition leaders said Kamaruddin was arrested when he was trying to settle the issue. The Muslim League was in the forefront of attack against the CM and his cabinet colleague K T Jaleel in the gold smuggling case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-league-mla-arrested-in-alleged-gold-jewellery-cheating-case-in-kerala/story-AsUQFAsY8wvw3kqbcCJ3qJ.html

07-11-2020||India||Notice to Maharashtra govt on plea against cops who closed 2018 case against Arnab Goswami||The Bombay High Court on Saturday issued a notice on petition filed by Adnya Anvay Naik, seeking enquiry against the police officers who filed a closure report in the 2018 abetment to suicide case against Republic TV editor Arnab Gowswami.Adnya Anvay Naik is the daughter of the 52-year-old interior designer Anvay Nayak who alleged in his suicide note that he was abetted to kill himself by Arnab Goswami and two others in 2018. He alleged that he and his mother had to take the extreme step because they were under pressure due to the failure of the owners of three companies to clear payments (worth Rs5.40 crore) due to them. Feroz Shaikh of IcastX/Skimedia and Nitish Sarda of Smartworks were the other two people named in the suicide note. Anvay’s wife Akshata lodged a complaint with the Alibag police against Goswami, Shaikh and Sarda for allegedly abetting their suicide on the basis of the note.The police on April 26, 2019, closed the case saying they could not gather evidence against the three accused named in the complaint. On May 5, Akshata released a video seeking justice for her husband following which Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh ordered a reinvestigation into the case.A local court on October 16 allowed the Alibag police to reopen the case for further investigation and Arnab Goswami moved the Bombay high court seeking to quash the fresh case two days before he was arrested by Mumbai police on November 4.The hearing on his interim bail plea before the Bombay high court remained incomplete on Friday and the division bench of Justice SS Shinde and Justice MS Karnik is likely to decide on his bail plea Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/notice-to-maharashtra-govt-on-plea-against-cops-who-closed-2018-case-against-arnab-goswami/story-yR5QSg0GwrWpIHphs5PayI.html
07-11-2020||India||Screening of 200 people finds 4.5% are carriers of cystic fibrosis gene: Study||Genetic screening of 200 unrelated persons has found that 4.5% of them were carriers of cystic fibrosis gene, according to a study recently published in the journal BMC Medical Genetics. A carrier is a person that has the gene that causes the disease, but not the disease. If both carrier parents pass on the gene to their child, the child will then have the disease.Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening condition that causes the body’s mucus, sweat, and digestive juices to become thick and sticky, clogging up the tubes and ducts. There is no cure for the disease, but medication helps in easing the symptoms and prolonging life.A carrier frequency of 9 in 200 persons, as was found in the pilot study by doctors from Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, will mean a disease prevalence of 1 in 2,000 persons. This is much higher than the earlier estimated prevalence as the disease was considered to be rare in the Indian population.“Based on this study, cystic fibrosis should be added to beta-thalassemia and spinal muscular disorders that should be screened in all pregnant women to prevent these diseases. It should also be added to the list of disorders for which new-born screening is being done. Sir Ganga Ram Hospital is planning to add CF to the existing new-born screening programme,” said Dr I C Verma, senior consultant, Institute of Medical Genetics and Genomics at the hospital.The study found that 26% of the persons screened were carriers of one or more genetic disorders. The analysis of the genetic sequencing of the individuals was done between October 2016 and June 2018 in partnership with Medgenome Laboratories in Bengaluru.The carrier frequency was highest for congenital deafness as 12 persons were found to be carriers of one of the four genes the doctors tested for. With three persons carrying the gene for Pompe Disease – a condition that leads to an abnormal build-up of glycogen (sugar molecule) inside cells impairing the work of organs tissues – was the third common genetic disorder.None of the 88 partners screened were carriers of the same disorder, the study found.“Our study also found that the disease-causing pathogenic variants in the Indian population were different from those commonly observed in the West. It is because of our unique system of marriages within the same caste/community and presence of consanguineous marriages,” said Dr Sunita Bijarnia-Mahay, one of the authors and a senior consultant at the Institute of Medical Genetics and Genomics.Dr Ratna Puri, the chairperson of the Institute of Medical Genetics and Genomics, said: “This is a new finding and the high carrier frequency of Cystic Fibrosis shall be verified in a larger population sample soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/screening-of-200-people-finds-4-5-are-carriers-of-cystic-fibrosis-gene-study/story-ISKLcVcBgGFCiZZoivk6rK.html

The launch was carried out from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) in Andhra Pradesh’s Sriharikota. It was to take place at 3:02pm but was delayed by 10 minutes due to bad weather conditions.Also Read | ISRO launches PSLV C-49 carrying EOS-01, 9 other satellitesHere’s all you need to know about Isro’s latest space mission:1. The EOS-01, as per Isro’s official website, is an earth observation satellite intended for purposes such as agriculture, forestry and disaster management support.2. The satellite was launched onboard Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)-C49. Saturday’s launch represents the 51st mission of the PSLV. This is also the 76th mission launch from SDSC.3. A total of 10 satellites, including EOS-01, have been launched in this mission. While EOS-01 is the only Indian and primary satellite of the mission, the other nine are foreign: Four each from the US and Luxembourg and one from Lithuania.4. The nine foreign satellites, called the ‘customer’ satellites, have been launched under a commercial agreement with the NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), which is the commercial arm of Isro and comes under the Department of Space.5. This is Isro’s first launch in almost a year, as well as the first of any kind since the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown came into effect in March. On December 11, 2019, the space agency had launched RISAT2-BR1, which is an earth observation satellite similar to EOS-01.6. Then, on January 17, 2020, GSAT-30, a telecommunication satellite was sent into space. This launch, however, took place from a base in French Guiana.7. In view of the ongoing pandemic, Isro had put in strict norms during the launch. While media was not allowed to gather at SDSC, the launch viewing gallery was also kept closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eos-01-launched-all-you-need-to-know-about-isro-s-latest-space-mission/story-CpL8WVgt5BgxZ4oiKee9rO.html

They were acquitted as per law, but the BJP did not say then that the actions (cases) were politically motivated or part of vendetta,” the editorial said.The Sena further alleged that the BJP was maligning the image of the family members of Anvay Naik, the interior designer who had committed suicide in 2018 allegedly over non-payment of dues by Republic TV.Referring to posters showing Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhhav Thackeray with Indira Gandhi, who had imposed Emergency in 1975, the Sena said the comparison with the late prime minister was a matter of pride.“The BJP has gone out of its mind by putting up posters of Uddhav Thackeray and Indira Gandhi reminding people of Emergency, in Delhi. This is not only childishness but also ignorance. Comparison with Indira Gandhi is a matter of pride.Also Read| ‘Forced to consume liquid’: Arnab Goswami in bail plea in 2018 caseThe iron lady had avenged partition of our country by breaking Pakistan in 1971,” the editorial said.The Congress is one of the constituents of the Sena- led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, apart from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The Sena also took a swipe at the BJP for announcing wearing of black badges by its leaders until Goswami is released.“Thankfully, they haven’t resorted to jail bharo and fasting as part of protests,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-like-trump-shiv-sena-s-latest-jibe-at-bjp-over-arnab-goswami-s-arrest/story-o2Swpe4SDQDgaSIjLjzKGM.html

07-11-2020||India||Bengal Congress MLA Qazi Abdur Rahim joins TMC||A Congress legislator along with his supporters joined the Trinamool Congress here on Saturday. Baduria MLA Qazi Abdur Rahim joined the ruling party in West Bengal at its headquarters in the presence of senior ministers Firhad Hakim and Partha Chatterjee.“I have realised that Didi (Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee) is the only hope in the fight against the BJP. So, I am joining the TMC to strengthen her hand,” Rahim said. Senior Congress leader Manoj Chakraborty said the induction of opposition Congress and CPI(M) MLAs into the TMC reflects the ruling party’s intention to “weaken secular forces” in the state.The Congress had won 44 seats in the 2016 assembly elections but 18 of its MLAs have switched over to the ruling TMC since then. However, barring former Sabang legislator Manas Bhunia, who later became a Rajya Sabha MP, none of the Congress turncoats have resigned from their MLA posts.Besides Rahim, former BJP Mahila Morcha vice president Moumita Basu Chakraborty and some retired bureaucrats also joined the TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-congress-mla-qazi-abdur-rahim-joins-tmc/story-ixQ9TMfgtU8oK9GCNRgzdP.html

07-11-2020||India||Estimated GST shortfall could shrink after green shoots on revenue front||The Rs 2.35 lakh crore estimated shortfall in Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections this financial year is expected to shrink significantly with the revenue mop-up seeing positive growth since September this year and the growth momentum is expected to continue in the remaining five months, two officials said.Besides positive GST collections since September, numbers of states having negative year-on-year revenue growth have also reduced from 15 in September to seven in October, Union finance ministry officials said requesting anonymity.A comparison of revenue data between September and October this year shows that numbers of territories having negative growth on annualised basis in October have reduced by over 50%.“The trend, if sustained in the next five months, would reduce the gap between the protected revenue and actual revenue for FY-21 by about Rs 35,000 crore,” one of the officials said.Overall GST collections that saw first positive annualised growth of 4% in September, after having plunged by 72% in March, posted over 10% YOY growth at Rs 1.05 lakh crore in October.According to official data, 15 territories that posted negative growth in September compared to the same month last year were Chandigarh (-10% drop in GST revenue), Delhi (-7%), Sikkim (-49%), Arunachal Pradesh (-20%), Manipur (-19%), Mizoram (-42%), Tripura (-3%), Meghalaya (-6%), Daman and Diu (-83%), Karnataka (-5%), Goa (-23%), Lakshadweep (-58%), Puducherry (-1%), Telangana (-2%) and other territory (-16%). Apart from that the annualised growth in revenue collections in three states – Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Ladakh (because the union territory was created this financial year) – in September this year was stagnant.In contract, the year-on-year revenue collections contracted only in seven territories in October this year – Chandigarh (-3%), Delhi (-8%), Sikkim (-5%), Daman and Diu (-91%), Lakshadweep (-55%), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (-42%) and other territory (-28%).“It is expected that the collections in November onwards would be even better, which would not only reduce the estimated shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore [in 2020-21] but also see improved collections of compensation cess, therefore, proportionately reduce the borrowing liabilities,” the second official said.At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime, the GST law assured state governments a 14% increase in their annual tax revenue for five years ending June 30, 2022, and the Centre committed to meet any shortfall in revenue through the cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal, and other tobacco commodities.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent 68-day hard lockdown since March 25, the GST collections fell sharply in April and remained in negative territory until August this year. On August 27, the Centre had given states the choice of borrowing Rs 97,000 crore (the shortfall resulting from GST implementation issues) without having to pay principal or interest, or the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore revenue deficit from the indirect tax (including that arising from the Covid-19 pandemic) projected for this fiscal year. The Rs. 97,000 crore was subsequently raised to Rs.1.1 lakh crore on October 5. Seven states are still opposing the Centre’s proposal and demand full compensation of Rs 2.35 lakh crore under the first option.MS Mani, a partner at consulting firm Deloitte India, said, “With the increase in GST collections for the past two months and an expectation of robust collections in the next few months, the collections deficit is expected to be lower - both in respect of GST and in respect of Compensation Cess. This could potentially reduce the borrowing plans of the states... The easing of revenue pressures may also enable a renewed focus on the policy agenda by the GST Council.”Archit Gupta, founder and chief executive officer of the financial technology platform ClearTax, said, “Judging from the overall growth rate of the past three months, it looks like the economy is on the road to recovery, and one can expect to see a marginal increase month-on-month over the next few months of the financial year.It is plausible that the government may revise the Rs. 2.35 lakh crore shortfall in the coming months, based on the actual figures of the GST collections,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/estimated-gst-shortfall-could-shrink-after-green-shoots-on-revenue-front/story-M6Pc4b5cIdWFSPvzNJ1m1J.html
07-11-2020||India||Tribal burnt alive for not returning Rs 5,000 taken during lockdown: Police||A 32-year-old tribal man was allegedly burnt alive for not returning Rs 5,000, which he borrowed from an accused during lockdown in Guna district, 214 km north of Bhopal, on Friday late night, said police. The victim, Vijay Sahariya, a resident of Ukawad Khurd village of the district, was rushed to a district hospital where he died while undergoing treatment. Police arrested the accused Radheshyam Lodha, a resident of Ukawad Khurd village, under section 302 (murder) of the IPC and under relevant sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act on Friday late night, said Rajesh Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (SP), Guna. The SP said, “The farm labourer Vijay Sahariya had borrowed Rs 5,000 from a farmer Radheshyam Lodha, who used to give money to people on interest, in May this year as the former was facing a tough time due to lockdown. Sahariya started working at Lodha’s agricultural land and when he asked for his payment Lodha refused to give and demanded his money back. Sahariya was requesting him to give his payment after deducting Rs 5,000 but Lodha was unmoved.” “On Friday night, they again had a discussion over this matter and after a heated argument, Lodha beat Sahariya up. Lodha brought a can of kerosene oil from his house and poured the oil on Sahariya’s body. Lodha set Sahariya on fire. When Sahariya cried for help, the villagers rushed to the spot and tried to douse the fire,” said the officer. He was rushed to the district hospital where he died while undergoing treatment, he added. In his statement to the police at the hospital, Sahariya accused Lodha. When police arrested Lodha, he confessed his crime, said TS Baghel, additional superintendent of police, Guna. Guna collector Kumar Purshottam provided a financial aid of Rs 20,000 to perform last rites to the family. “The victim’s family will also be provided a financial aid of Rs 8.50 lakh under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, said the collector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribal-burnt-alive-for-not-returning-rs-5-000-taken-during-lockdown-police/story-YSNcsqkhxCOzPXuWdpaSCP.html

07-11-2020||India||‘Unacceptable’: Tamil Nadu Congress slams parties demanding release of Rajiv Gandhi assassination convicts||Opposing the release of seven Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convicts, Congress in Tamil Nadu said on Saturday that political parties making this demand was unacceptable.Against the backdrop of parties, including its key ally in Tamil Nadu the DMK pressing for release of the convicts, including A G Perarivalan, whose plea for pardon is pending with the Governor, TNCC chief K S Alagiri said only the judiciary should decide on remission of their sentences.If the Rajiv case case convicts were to be set free, a demand would arise for the release of all “murder convicts” who have spent over 25 years in prison, he said.“If the court announces the release of seven Rajiv case convicts, we will accept it.However, political parties rooting for their release is unacceptable,” Tamil Nadu Congress Committee chief Alagiri said in a statement.“It is not Tamil culture to lend support for convicts who assassinated a former Prime Minister and brought harm to India.” Propping up a movement for the release of murder convicts meant that there was no need for police stations, courts and also necessity to talk about law and order maintenance, he said.Those convicted for murder should be considered only as convicts and addressing such persons as “Tamils” is inappropriate, he said.“Release seven Tamils” is a phrase usually used by several pro-Tamil, Dravidian groups and parties to strengthen their demand for remission to Rajiv case convicts and its use is perceived to have undertones to the decades old conflict in Sri Lanka.It is a thing of pride to address leaders like Abdul Kalam, Kamarajar, Perarignar Anna, Kalaignar Karunanidhi, Jeevanandam and math genius Ramanujam as Tamils, and not the convicts, the TNCC leader said.P Jeevanandam (1907-63), popularly known as ‘Thozhar’ (comrade) Jeeva was a pioneer of the Left movement in Tamil Nadu.The over a decade old demand for the release of all seven Rajiv case convicts recently gained momentum with the DMK demanding Governor Banwarilal Purohit accept the 2018 Tamil Nadu government’s recommendation, remit their life sentences and set them free.Most parties in Tamil Nadu, including the ruling AIADMK support the release of the convicts.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court had expressed unhappiness over the pendency of Perarivalan’s plea (seeking pardon in the Rajiv case) for over two years with Governor Banwarilal Purohit.Nalini, V Sriharan alias Murugan, Santhan, A G Perarivalan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and P Ravichandran are the seven convicts in prison for nearly three decades.Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated on May 21, 1991 at Sriperumbudur near here by a woman suicide bomber, Dhanu, at an election rally.

07-11-2020||India||Alcohol, superstition take a toll on tribals in Odisha villages||Two months ago, Muka Talam, a tribal in Odisha’s Benchnpalli village, complained of swelling of hands and belly. He died a few days later unable to eat anything. Like him, Bata Ganga and Jogendra Bata of the same village, too, showed similar symptoms before they died. After them, Ganga Bata and Beti Lachha, all in the age group of 35-50 died, while about 8-10 other villagers showed symptoms of swollen feet and stomach, loss of appetite, and acute weakness.As locals complained of a mysterious disease killing the villagers, health officials from the district headquarters of Malkangiri, who visited Benchanpalli to probe the deaths, on Friday said there was no mystery. “It is mostly... alcoholism leading to kidney and liver problems. In two cases of deaths, the deceased had cancer and stroke,” said Dr PK Nanda, chief district medical officer, Malkangiri.Nanda said the deaths happened because villagers consulted a Dishari, or a local witchdoctor, first and then went to the local primary health centre. “Most of them consume local brew laced with urea for a better kick. Over a period, this proves lethal for them,” he said. “We have sent the sample of the alcohol that the villagers consumed to the State Forensic Science Laboratory in Bhubaneswar to ascertain the composition. We are waiting for the report.”Two months ago, around 10 Koya tribals died after showing similar symptoms in Sodiguda village. Between February and June, about a dozen deaths were reported from Kenduguda village under Malkangiri block. Many of those who died complained of swollen legs and stomach. Villagers said that most of those who died did not even have the strength to walk or stand properly and suffered acute respiratory problems.Doctors in Malkangiri said the deaths in Sodiguda and Bapanpalli were mostly due to alcoholism and the unwillingness of the tribals to go to local health centres fearing Covid-19. “As it is most of the villages are situated at least 10 km away from the nearest health centres and travelling is not easy. Now because of Covid, many tribals are avoiding going there,” said a doctor.Experts said apart from alcoholism, anaemia is also a reason for the deaths. As per the 2015-16 National Family Health Survey, at least 47.2% of men in the age group of 15 and 49 years in Malkangiri were anaemic. For women in the same age group, the percentage was 71.3.“With such a high anaemic population, do you expect the villagers to have any immunity. The deaths have happened in the tribal villages where malnutrition and undernourishment are acute,” said Durga Tripathy of Harmony, a Malkangiri based NGO.Officials called vacancies of doctors in primary and community health centres a major stumbling block in providing health services. Of the 197 posts of doctors, only 91 have been filled up so far. The entire district has only one eye specialist while there are just five gynaecologists.“We would also start a drive to make the tribals aware of the ill-effects of using adulterants in the country liquor,” said Malkangiri district collector Manish Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alcohol-superstition-take-a-toll-on-tribals-in-odisha-villages/story-eHDbHLLa9iNdCMlooJjQkJ.html
07-11-2020||India||US poll fever grips India; internet search, interest soar||Polls are underway in India’s fourth-largest electoral state, Bihar, but Indians seem to be more interested in the US presidential elections. The largest democracy’s deep interest in that of the oldest one, the US, is reflected in Google Trends. It is in sync with the global focus on the presidential election given the American influence over world affairs. As counting started in the US on November 3 ET (early morning of November 4 in India), Google Trends showed “US Election Results” topped the search charts with more than 5 million hits. It overtook “Arnab Goswami” on the day police arrested India’s most talked-about TV personality after reopening an abetment of suicide case against him. Goswami’s arrest hit the headlines and generated over 3 million search hits on the internet. Throughout November 4, “US Election” and “American Election 2020 result” accounted for over a million searches individually on the internet. They secured the third and fourth spots among the chartthrobs in India. The US, home to 3.8 million Indian Americans, has come a long way from the Cold War era to become one of India’s strongest allies, especially over the past two decades. In a WhatsApp group of a Ghaziabad housing society, residents took a break from the usual chatter over pollution, and Diwali advisories to discuss the Donald Trump versus Joe Biden battle. As the complex counting process has continued, the hype, too, has subsided considerably. But still more people continue to search for US polls than for Bihar. Internet search related to Joe Biden, now on the verge of becoming the next US president, increased from 7.30 am on November 4 to peak the next day. The data shows that as results started trickling in on November 5 morning, among every 100 searches in India on Google, 34 were about Biden and 14 about Bihar. But as the exhaustive counting dragged on, Bihar got 16 searches against every 21 hits for the US election. Analysts believe, search for Biden, Trump, and US polls will again soar once the results are finally declared and Americans get their 46th president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-onto-internet-to-check-us-poll-results-as-interest-soars/story-4gjCUVlbF3rcbF8aibJoPO.html

07-11-2020||India||Train services between Bihar-Jharkhand to resume from November 11||Passenger train services between Bihar and Jharkhand are set to resume from November 11, after the break of four months since it was discontinued to check the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).To start with, the east central railway (ECR) zone has decided to run six pairs of Puja special trains on timing and schedules of the most popular trains to connect various different cities of Jharkhand like Ranchi, Dhanbad, Barkakana, Tata Nagar, Garhwa on their routes. Two pairs of trains will go to Bilaspur and Durg in Chhattisgarh and Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh.ECR chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar said that the festival special trains would continue to run till December 2 to cater to rush during Diwali and Chhath, after the railway board gave its consent to operate them in adherence to the stipulated Covid protocols.While the railways resumed the passenger trains services on different routes across the country in a calibrated manner from May 25 after the waiver in lockdown norms, which was enforced on March 24 to contain spread of Covid-19, special trains to cities like Ranchi, Dhanbad, Tata Nagar and Bokaro were suspended again since July 11, leaving the people to fend for themselves.Bus service on the Patna-Ranchi route was resumed in early September, but the cost of travel has jumped almost four times the normal fare in the absence of alternatives. “Passengers are being made to pay Rs 900-1200 for a seat to travel to Ranchi from Patna and vice versa against usual fare of Rs 300-400,” said Md Khalid, a resident of Ranchi’s Hindpirhi area.Bus operators have their own plea to justify the hefty rise in fare, saying that they had to procure permissions to run the busses stealthily in Jharkhand, which had banned the bus operations from Bihar. “One of the luxury buses has been caught by the Ranchi police on charges of violation of the government orders,” said the manager of Royal Arzoo bus. Direct flight services between Patna and Ranchi are still in suspension. Those aspiring to travel to Ranchi from Patna and vice versa are compelled to take connecting flights via Delhi or Kolkata, and thus making it a costly affair. “These days it costs around Rs 9000-10000 for one way journey from Patna to Ranchi against the normal airfare of Rs 3,500 to 4,500,” said Munna Jha, a frequent flier.With limited facilities for public transport, private cabs have also increased their tariff between Patna and Ranchi. “I had to pay Rs 9,500 as rent for a cab travel from Ranchi to Patna last week due to an emergency. Earlier, it used to cost around Rs 6000-7000 for a one-way journey,” said Mahendra Sahni, a grocery shop owner of Kankerbagh.The railways announcement to run special trains came as a sigh of relief to those aspiring to travel to Jharkhand cities from Bihar or wanted to return. The nine pairs of trains will run as per the schedules of Patna-Ranchi Jan Shatabdi, Patna-Dhanbad Ganga Damodar express, Patna-Barkakand Palamu express, Singrauli-Patna express, Rajendra Nagar-Durg Express via Tata Nagar and Jainagar Manihari express.The ECR is also contemplating running special trains in places of Hatia-Patna-Islampur express and Hatia-Purnia Court Kosi Express soon. The CPRO said that train service between Bihar and Jharkhand destinations was suspended on the Jharkhand government’s request to counter the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/train-services-between-bihar-jharkhand-to-resume-from-november-11/story-k8z0vQ8MV2B08Unc0fJZaP.html
07-11-2020||India||Tech, innovation will be key in post-Covid world: Modi at IIT-Delhi event||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that technology and innovation would play a major role in the post-Covid-19 world as he urged graduating Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi students to contribute to the success of his government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) campaign. “The post-Covid-19 world is going to be very different and technology has to play a major role in it. Covid-19 has changed the way things are being conducted today. Virtual reality and augmented reality are becoming the working reality now...it has taught us while globalisation is important, self-reliance is equally important. The country is now committed to giving you the ease of doing business so that you can work on providing ease of living to your countrymen through your ideas and innovations,” he said in his address as the chief guest at IIT Delhi’s 51 convocation ceremony via video conferencing.Modi urged the students to work for finding solutions to the country’s existing problems. “Indians have immense faith in the need for technology… There are immense possibilities for you in the country and also there are immense challenges confronting the country for which you can give solutions. A lot of work can be done in areas such as disaster management, maintaining the ground-water level, solar power generation, telemedicine, and big data analysis. I can place before you several other examples of the country’s needs,” he said. Modi added the challenges can be addressed with innovations, new ideas, and efforts...”That is why it is my request to identify the needs of the country and associate yourself with Atmanirbhar Bharat.”Modi asked the students to try to turn the adversity into opportunity amid the pandemic. “You may be feeling your batch is not lucky. I am sure you are asking why did this happen with our graduating batch. But think of it differently. You have a first-mover advantage. You have more time to learn and adapt to the new norms emerging in the workplace and beyond. So, make the most use of it and think of the brighter side too.”Modi asked the students to continue challenging themselves. “It is important that one keeps challenging oneself and continues to learn every day. It is also important that you treat yourself as a student for life. Never think that what you know is enough.”Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, who was the guest of honour at the event, congratulated IIT Delhi for completing 60 years. He lauded the institute for its achievements including developing a low-cost Covid-19 testing kit. He asked the graduating students to contribute to the country’s development.Nishank also launched an online certificate programme called eVIDYA under which the institute will offer online certificate courses in areas like cyber-physical system, security, renewable energy storage, and conversion, embedded systems, machine learning, and construction project management, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tech-innovation-will-be-key-in-post-covid-world-modi-at-iit-delhi-event/story-WndBkJRD5qYslVx6tXBLHL.html
07-11-2020||India||India’s candidate elected to key UN committee in closely contested race||India’s candidate has been elected in a closely contested race to a key UN committee that controls the financial and budgetary purse of the world body. Vidisha Maitra, a career diplomat currently posted as first secretary in the permanent mission of India to the UN in New York, was elected to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) by 126 votes to 64 votes. Maitra was India’s candidate for the only post in the committee from the Asia Pacific Group, and the other candidate was from Iraq. India has served as a member of the committee since its inception in 1946. A place on the committee is seen as one of the most coveted positions in the United Nations system. New Delhi’s win in this election is also crucial as India is set to start a two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council next year. ACABQ performs several key functions, including the examination of the budget submitted by the UN Secretary General to the General Assembly, and advising the General Assembly on administrative and budgetary matters. The committee also plays a crucial role in ensuring that resources of member states are used effectively and that the UN’s mandates are properly funded. Members of ACABQ are elected by the 193 member states in the General Assembly on the basis of broad geographical representation, personal qualifications and experience, and they serve for a period of three years. ACABQ’s members also serve in a personal capacity and not as representatives of member states. Before being posted to New York, Maitra served in different capacities in the external affairs ministry in New Delhi, and in India’s missions in Paris, Port Louis and New York over the past 11 years. She has extensive experience in strategic policy planning and research, defence acquisition matters, formulation and implementation of development assistance and infrastructure projects, international taxation issues, and investment and trade promotion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-candidate-elected-to-key-un-committee-in-closely-contested-race/story-wgzzzgw7INDiYriUtkkaFM.html

Phuldungsei village, located at Kanchanpur sub division of North district of Tripura, has been accepted as part of Tripura state though its eastern side falls in Mizoram.Mizoram’s Mamit district magistrate Lalrozama stated that a Tripura-based organisation SONGRONGMA planned to construct a Shiv temple at Thaidawr Ylang in the district without seeking permission from the state government.In October, the Mizoram government imposed prohibitory orders in and around the village in Mamit district. The order was withdrawn after the Tripura government termed the move “highly objectionable”.“The borders can be identified through maps. If Mizoram has any kind of objection and feels the need of demarcation of border, they can take up the matter with the Centre. Though we are separate states, we are part of India. It doesn’t look good if two states fight with each other,” Deb told the mediapersons at the Civil Secretariat on the sidelines of a programme on Friday evening.He also said that Tripura provided permanent settlement to over 32,000 Bru migrants despite having the second largest population after Assam in the northeast, as per quadripartite pact of the MHA with the state governments of Tripura and Mizoram and leaders of Bru community in January.In reference to Jammu and Kashmir, Deb said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah resolved the prolonged restriction imposed in Jammu and Kashmir due to Article 370 and Article 35 (A). “ This is our country. We can go any place and anyone can visit here,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/borders-can-be-identified-using-maps-tripura-cm-to-mizoram-amid-standoff/story-enS4lTL4LRJ6wZbuGUItcN.html
07-11-2020||India||Recovery in domestic air passenger traffic continues in October: Report||Domestic air travel demand continued on an upward trajectory month-on-month, with the October volume witnessing a 33 per cent growth to 52 lakh passengers over September, ICRA said. On a year-on-year basis, however, the domestic travel demand declined 58 per cent and internationally the fall was 87 per cent, it said. The Indian aviation industry has witnessed continued recovery in domestic passenger traffic in October with a sequential growth (over September) of around 33 per cent to around 52 lakh passengers, ICRA said in a release on Friday. ICRA further noted that the capacity deployment in October 2020 at around 52 per cent over the same month last year, is a significant increase over the around 33 per cent capacity deployed in August and around 46 per cent capacity in September this year. The civil aviation ministry in June had permitted increasing the capacity to 45 per cent with effect from June 27 from a maximum of one-third at the time of resumption of domestic flights from May 25, which was further scaled up to 60 per cent from September 2. The capacity is expected to go up to 70-75 per cent in the coming days in view of the festive season, the government had said. According to ICRA, the cumulative domestic passenger volumes since the resumption of domestic flight services in a graded manner from May 25, till October 31, was around 16 million. “The number of flights departing has also gradually increased from 416 on Day 1 to 1,749 on Day 156 (October 26, 2020). For October, the average daily departures were around 1,574, significantly lower than the average daily departures of 3,031 in October 2019, though better than around 1,311 in September 2020,” said Kinjal Shah, Vice President, ICRA. Also, the average number of passengers per flight during October 2020, was 106, as against an average of 131 passengers per flight in October 2019, she said. Therefore, it is expected that the domestic aviation industry operated at a passenger load factor (PLF) of around 68 per cent in October 2020, as against 83.6 per cent in October 2019, that too on a low capacity, she added. PLF or seat factor is a measure of how much of an airline’s passenger carrying capacity is used or average percentage of seats filled in an aircraft. According to Shah, the PLF for October was higher than 63.2 per cent in September, despite the increase in capacity deployment by around 24 per cent. Under the Vande Bharat Mission, the international passenger traffic, both (inbound and outbound, was 10,96,709 between May 7 (when the services commenced) to October 31, as per ICRA. The international passenger traffic declined 87 per cent to 255,075 year-on-year, though sequentially it improved by about 22 per cent, ICRA said in the release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recovery-in-domestic-air-passenger-traffic-continues-in-october-report/story-WpeDVZhScZTbyAIRODDMYP.html
07-11-2020||India||Shaan feels that the number game on streaming platforms is a trap||The fact that he continues to be a favourite with several music lovers in the country needs no justification. But lately, singer Shaan has been experimenting quite a bit with his sound and music. He says that he is enjoying this phase of creating new music and trying out newer things. But one thing that has become a bone of contention in every musician’s life nowadays is the number game of digital streaming platforms. And Shaan feels that it is a trap.“At the end of the day, all the streaming platforms are being handled by algorithms by certain artificial intelligence situation, so there are a lot of loopholes that people can exploit. And I can’t tell what are paid views and what are real views. There are songs that you have absolutely not heard of, and the artiste is not exactly massy, and yet the song has a 100 or 200 million views, so it beats logic” says Shaan, adding that when music companies are asked about it, they maintain that the audience has loved them. “I am not denying that it can happen but what it actually does is then create a win-win situation for the guys who deal with these views and likes and the digital marketers.”  JUST 1 WEEK TO GO ! We're eager to share the song with you and we hope that you have subscribed to my channel (Link in Bio) on YouTube so that you don't miss out the premiere on 11th November at 11am! #Sniper #BreakTheBox #DareToBeDifferent #Shaan #SingerShaan #ShaanMusic #ShaanSingle #SonaliRaut #KunwarJuneja #NewMusic #IndiePop #HipHop #ComingSoon @isonaliraut @adityadevmusic @junejakunwar @mgmehulgadani @riyazzamlaniA post shared by  Shaan (@singer_shaan) on Nov 4, 2020 at 2:03am PSTShaan believes that this is an easy way for newer artistes, who have access to money, to do things their way. “Artistes now say that if not 200 million, make my song reach at least 10 or 20 million. That is a trap and if I have to get into this trap, I will have spend all my hard earned money. A lot of youngsters who have access to money and feel that this is a way to get instant gratification, are doing it. There are funders putting in money, so this has become a kind of strange business where there is no return,” he explains.  "Haath mein pistol, lekin naam ‘Sniper’ ?? 🧐 " Yeh raaz khulega jald, don't be hyper !! 😎😂 Till then, can you guess what's going to happen in my #NewSong with @isonaliraut?

So, when this idea came about, I said we should get an actor to do it because where will I play such a suave character, but the director convinced me to play it. Sometimes, you do things that you are not very sure of, but the point is to do it convincingly and properly, so it was a good experience shooting a video like this. I am glad that whoever has seen the teaser and the shots are really liking it. I learnt how to flip a gun for this song, not shoot (laughs).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/shaan-feels-that-the-number-game-on-streaming-platforms-is-a-trap/story-weIOfYjmTO0sPkv1ebL74O.html
07-11-2020||India||Drugs case: Showik Chakraborty moves fresh bail application in special NDPS court||Showik Chakraborty, the brother of actor Rhea Chakraborty, has moved a fresh bail application before a special court in Mumbai in connection with a drugs case related to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Chakraborty, in his bail application filed on November 3, claimed innocence submitting that he has been falsely implicated in the case even though no drugs or psychotropic substances were seized from his possession.The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had arrested Showik, his sister, and others under several relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in connection with a case emerging out of the investigation into the death of Sushant Singh Rajput.“In the facts and circumstances of the present case, given that no commercial quantity has been alleged in respect of the applicant, there has been no recovery from the applicant and that all allegations pertain only to small quantities, the embargo imposed by Section 37 of the NDPS Act, 1985 would not be applicable,” the bail application said.It said that a perusal of the remand applications of all the accused arrested in the case makes it evident that there is nothing on record to suggest that the present applicant is in any way involved with the financing, illicit trafficking and/or harboring of offenders in relation to any narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.“Apart from allegedly procuring the drugs for the late actor, there are no allegations against the applicant of being involved in any other form of illicit traffic or even of purchasing drugs for any other person. Hence, terming the applicant as being part of a “drug syndicate” or having financed the “illicit traffic” of drugs is wholly farfetched and without application of mind,” it said.“There is not a shred of evidence to connect the applicant with financing any illicit traffic or harbouring any offenders and hence the ingredients of Section 27A of the NDPS Act, 1985 are not made out in the present facts and circumstances,” it added.Showik claimed that Sushant utilised him, his sister and members of his household staff to facilitate his drug habit while ensuring that he did not leave a paper trail of his own in the form of any electronic evidence whatsoever.“There is electronic evidence to show that the applicant’s sister was in fact trying her level best to rid the late actor of his drug habit by consistently restricting the quantity of drugs he had access to. The applicant’s sister also discussed her concerns regarding the late actor combining his drug habit with prescription medication with his doctor namely Kersi Chavda. However, the late actor being an adult and having his own mind was the ultimate decision,” it added.Earlier, a special NDPS court had rejected Showik’s bail application in the matter, after which the same was challenged in the Bombay High Court, which was also rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drugs-case-showik-chakraborty-moves-fresh-bail-application-in-special-ndps-court/story-q9R4ElnIP8ZLIBFphYhTdL.html

This mandates very high levels of knowledge, dedication, commitment and sacrifice and leadership at all levels at all times. This is what each service and the nation would expect from you,” he added.The convocation ceremony of 139th NDA course was held the academy on Friday.

Presiding over a meeting on Friday evening, the chief minister issued instructions for elaborate celebrations in Ayodhya on the occasion. Outsiders, however, will not be allowed for Deepotsav and people would be encouraged to light a diya virtually at Ram Ki Paidi from their homes. It will be the fourth consecutive Deepotsav in Ayodhya. Last year, the Ayodhya administration created a world record by lighting 410,000 earthen lamps. Not just Deepotsav, outsiders would not be allowed to participate in other attractions of the town, like Kartik Purnima Mela, Panch Koshi and 14 Koshi Parikramas, an official said. The borders of Ayodhya will be sealed from November 11 and only locals will be allowed to take part in the ceremonies. “No outsider will be allowed in Ayodhya this year on Deepotsav, Kartik Purnima and other festive occasions. All these events will be restricted to locals only,” said MP Agarwal, the divisional commissioner of Ayodhya. The five-day Deepotsav celebrations will begin in Ayodhya on November 12, followed by formal inauguration of the main event on November 13, the day before Diwali. Other festive events will continue till Kartik Purnima on November 30. The Ayodhya administration was anticipating the presence of a large crowd this year on Deepotsav and Kartik Purnima as construction work of the Ram temple has begun. Every year, a large number of people visit Ayodhya from the nearby districts, including Barabanki, Basti, Amethi, Gonda and Ambedkar Nagar for the Deepotsav celebrations. For Kartik Purnima, people assemble on the banks of the Saryu for ritual bathing in the river. Ayodhya’s deputy inspector general of police Deepak Kumar will coordinate with police chiefs of the adjoining districts. The Ayodhya police will create a WhatsApp group, which will have police personnel from the adjoining districts too. The step is being taken for the quick sharing of information. The Ayodhya police will start checking the entry of vehicles from November 11 onwards. This year, the Ayodhya administration will strive to break last year’s record and around 8,000 students from Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University and the degree colleges of Ayodhya will be trained for the purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-to-be-in-ayodhya-for-deepotsav-curbs-introduced-for-festive-days/story-kaP9nTwe5p4JvRvdehFZeJ.html

TMC leaders alleged that home minister Amit Amit Shah was so ignorant of Bengal’s culture that he garlanded the wrong statue. Calling Shah a “bohiragato (outsider)” the TMC tweeted, “’Bohiragato’ are at it again! Union Home Minister Amit Shah is so ignorant of Bengal’s culture that he insulted Bhagwan Birsa Munda by garlanding a wrong idol and placed his photo at someone else’s foot. Will he ever respect Bengal?” Retweeting this, TMC Rajya Sabha member and party spokesperson Derek O’Brien wrote, “You may be an expert on the Gujarat Gymkhana. But not Bengal.” The TMC also carried out a symbolic purification programme at the site of the statue on Friday afternoon by washing the ground with river water. Born in 1875, Birsa Munda led a rebellion against the Bengal Presidency, a British administration zone which is now part of Jharkhand and Bengal. Shah, who was in the state for two days, flew to Bankura from Kolkata in a chopper on Thursday morning and began his tour by paying homage to Birsa Munda. He was driven to a huge statue of a tribal man at Puwabagan, about 10 km away from Bankura town, but he garlanded a framed image of the tribal leader kept at the base of the statue. “The statue is that of a tribal hunter. It was installed a few years ago as part of a road beautification programme. It is not a statue of Birsa Munda. We brought this to the notice of Bankura district leaders a day before the event. But instead of taking Shah to one of the statues of Birsa Munda, the party went ahead with the ceremony,” said Sangiri Hembram, a leader of the local tribal organization Bharat Jakat Majhi Pargana Mahal. Vivekananda Patra, president of the BJP’s Bankura district unit, admitted that an error was made while attempting to spot a statue of Birsa Munda not far from Bankura town where Shah held a closed-door meeting with leaders from 13 districts. “The moment we came to know of the mistake we bought a printed image of the tribal leader. Shah did not garland the statue. He placed flowers before the framed image,” said Patra. BJP state leader Debjit Sarkar said in Kolkata that being the Union home minister, whose travel routes have to be checked in advance by security personnel, Shah’s convoy could not be taken to another statue of Birsa Shah at the last minute. Hours after Thursday’s ceremony, Shah went to Chaturdihi village with BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, national secretary Arvind Menon, national vice-president Mukul Roy and other leaders to have lunch at the home of Bibhishan Hansda, a member of the local tribal community. Shah sat on the floor with the others and had rice, chapati, dal and curry cooked in earthenware. The TMC took a jibe at Shah for this as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-on-gujarat-gymkhana-not-bengal-tmc-on-amit-shah-s-statue-flub/story-i7XCrLdZ2fQ2JA6180xiXO.html

However, there was a wide gap between the minimum temperature in the suburbs and in south Mumbai. The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 24 degrees Celsius, which was at the normal mark. The weather bureau said minimum temperature was expected to hover in the range of 19-21 degrees Celsius over the next week due to the current wind pattern. “For the first time this season, Mumbai has recorded the minimum temperature below 20 degrees Celsius. The cool winds from easterly and northeasterly direction is leading to this, which is also reducing moisture in the city’s air --- typical of the weather pattern during this time of the year,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general western region, India Meteorological Department. The maximum temperature has remained at the normal mark in the suburbs and a degree Celsius below normal in south Mumbai. Owing to a rise in wind speed over the past 48 hours, the air quality index (AQI) has remained in the moderate category, as per the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The AQI, which was at 221 (in poor category) earlier in the week, stood at 149 (moderate) on Saturday. Pollution levels are likely to decline further as an AQI of 132 (moderate) has been predicted for Sunday. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.Location-wise minimum temperatures, as recorded by IMD’s automatic weather stations, showed Kandivali was the coolest at 18.9 degrees Celsius, followed by Malad at 19.6, while Panvel was the coolest in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region at 14.8 degrees Celsius.

The officer said the raid which started on Thursday was continuing at many places and serious violations of Foreign Contributions Regulation Act and (FCRA) Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) were detected. The Believers’ Church runs a medical college and many other educational institutions in Kerala and other states. It also owns Cheruvally estate in Pathanamthitta district which has been identified as the location for the proposed Sabarimala airport. In 2017, the Union home ministry had barred three NGOs associated with the church from accepting funds but the latest raids show fund flow continued from foreign countries in other names. It is alleged that more than Rs 100 crore came in the last three years. A senior I-T official said the department will release details once raids are over. He said raids were based on specific information on tax evasion and misuse of foreign funds. The church said it will give a statement after the conclusion of raids. An independent denomination, the indigenous church has witnessed massive growth in the last one and a half decade and its head KP Yohanan is known for his religious discourses. The 70-year-old priest is the founder and president of Gospel of Asia, a large non-profit evangelist organisation with main focus on India and Asia. He has also authored more than 100 books on Christian living and mission. A controversial religious head, he was in news when the church brought Chreuvally Estate, a rubber and tea plantation spread over 10 kms radius, from plantation group Harisons Malayalam Limited. In July, the Kerala High Court had directed the state government not to acquire the land for the airport by force after KP Yohanan moved the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-t-raids-at-kerala-church-foreign-funding-rules-violation-detected/story-IgTzC1UnpEYBRkWOGuo2uO.html

The hearing remained incomplete on Friday as there was scarcity of time. The high court does not assemble on Saturdays. So, the case can be heard at length, the bench observed on Friday. The 47-year-old journalist was arrested by Alibag police on Wednesday from his Lower Parel residence and produced him to a magistrate’s court which remanded him in judicial custody till November 18. Goswami is being represented by two lawyers — Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda. Here is what happened during Friday’s hearing:> The bench said that the normal practice to seek bail is to first approach the lower court magistrate or sessions court concerned. If bail is refused, then one can move the high court.> Harish Salve said Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) gives the high court special powers to hear bail pleas. “His (Goswami’s) liberty is at stake,” Salve said.> A bail plea was moved before the magistrate’s court in Alibag but it was later withdrawn as the case lies in the jurisdiction of the sessions court. The local police moved the sessions court seeking Goswami’s police custody. > “What is the harm if this gentleman is released om bail? What is going to happen between now and after Diwali?” Salve submitted before the bench, as reported by Livelaw.> “The problem cannot be that he will go back to the TV channel and scream and will make allegations against Parambir Singh(Mumbai Police Commissioner).

07-11-2020||India||Amit Shah sets the agenda for 2021 Bengal election,slams TMC over appeasement politics||Union Home Minister Amit Shah hit out at the All India Trinamool Congress(TMC) government on Friday over alleged minority appeasement and deteriorating law and order, demanded a white paper on political killings and urged voters to give the The Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) a chance to run West Bengal. Alleging that there had been politicisation and criminalisation of government officers in the state, the BJP leader, who was on a two-day visit, said the TMC government had stopped sending crime statistics to the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) after 2018. During a visit to the Dakshineswar Kali Temple, Shah castigated the TMC government for adopting appeasement politics, which he said had hurt the state’s age-old tradition of upholding the nation’s spiritual consciousness.The home minister stood by West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar for working “within the constitutional limits”, saying the utterances against the latter by the elected representatives of the TMC were “unacceptable”.“After 2018, the West Bengal government has not sent the crime statistics to the NCRB. What is the state government trying to hide?” he asked. “I want to ask (Chief Minister) Mamata Banerjee to come out with a white paper on political killings in Bengal.”  “The state tops the chart in political killings. In regards to women safety and security, West Bengal has an abysmal record,” Shah said.The BJP leader launched a tirade against the chief minister’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee. “The aim is to build a strong Bengal in a new era of development. Mamata Banerjee aims to make her nephew the next chief minister,” he said at a press conference in Kolkata. “In West Bengal, there are three kinds of laws: one for the nephew, one for minority appeasement, and one for common people.” he added.Shah also touched upon the issue of infiltration through the porous borders, saying the boundaries of West Bengal were not secure.He urged the people to give the BJP, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a chance in the 2021 assembly election so that it could deliver ‘shonar Bangla’ (golden Bengal) to the masses.The 10 years of the TMC rule is marked with “tolabaji (extortion), violence, and political killings, Shah remarked. “The Mamata Banerjee government has failed to keep its promises. Their promises have been proved to be hollow over the past 10 years and hopes of people have turned into despair,” he said. “I urge the people of the state to give the BJP a chance as they have given Congress, the communists and the TMC a chance in the past.” Shah acknowledged that West Bengal was the prime focus of the BJP, adding that the party would fight and win it with a “massive mandate”. Asked about the possibility of President’s rule in the state, Shah said: “As far as Article 356 issue is concerned, it can’t be discussed in a press conference. It’s a constitutional matter and the Centre takes a decision based on the report from the governor.”  “And there’s also no need to impose Article 356 as the government will change next April (assembly polls),” he added. On Gorkha Janamukti Morcha(GJM) leader Bimal Gurung walking out of the National Democratic Alliance(NDA) and joining hands with the TMC, Shah feels that the former had been working for the Gorkhas and would continue to do so in future “But this instance is a classic example of vendetta politics of the TMC. Why is the TMC not arresting him (Gurung) now when he has so many cases against him?” Shah asked. Reacting to it, TMC leader Sukhendu Sekhar Roy accused Shah of peddling a “bunch of lies”. “He was quoting an NCRB report of 2018 to prove women are not safe in Bengal. He is peddling falsehood,” Roy said. “The same NCRB report shows atrocities on women are far higher in Uttar Pradesh in the same year.” “Why didn’t he go to Hathras? For 40-long hours, no reporter, including women journalists, were allowed to go to Hathras,” the TMC MP said. TMC leader Derek O’Brien echoed Roy and said: “Shah’s mission to defame and insult Bengal continues.”  “As far his predictions of 200-plus seats, people have seen how his predictions had gone wrong in Bihar in 2015, Delhi in 2015 and 2020, in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in 2018,” O’Brien said. “Be rest assured, Bengal has and will always stand up to protect the soul of the country.” Earlier, Shah also had lunch at the house of a party worker, who belonged to the Matua community, in Baguihati area of North 24 Parganas district.The Matuas, a refugee community from erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), is a deciding factor in around 40-50 assembly seats in the state.During an internal party meeting, Shah assured that the Centre would ensure a free-and-fair election without any violence and urged the party workers to strengthen the booth committees ahead of the April-May polls.The saffron party, after having a limited presence in the state for decades, has emerged as the main rival of the TMC by winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the 2019 general election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-sets-the-agenda-for-2021-bengal-election-slams-tmc-over-appeasement-politics/story-qlHUO8MHw1KqKA975xZnRK.html
07-11-2020||India||Milind Soman faces FIR, charged with obscenity for naked run on Goa beach||Actor and model Milind Soman has been booked for obscenity after he uploaded a photograph of himself running in the buff on a beach in south Goa. The south Goa Superintendent of Police Pankaj Kumar Singh confirmed that the actor was booked under section 294 (obscenity) of the Indian Penal Code, along with other relevant sections of the Information Technology Act. On November 4, Soman had uploaded a photo on Twitter which showed him running naked on a Goa beach on his 55th birthday. The actor captioned the picture, clicked against the wide expanse of the ocean, as “Happy Birthday to me...55 and running”. There has been no comment from the actor on the FIR against him. The FIR comes even as the Canacona judicial magistrate granted model and actress Poonam Pandey bail, observing that all nudity didn’t amount to obscenity. The model was arrested on Thursday for shooting an “objectionable” video in Goa.“It is important to note that when such representation is in pursuance of art, it is an exception. Making of films obviously is an artistic endeavour and even if it was otherwise, determination of the same would be a matter of trial. One cannot, given the facts and circumstances, come to a conclusion that all nudity is obscene,” the magistrate said. “When it comes to fundamental rights of an individual, which are sacrosanct, especially the right to free speech and expression, which constitutes an essential foundation of a democracy and without which life itself would be meaningless, acting in a video or film, which may be perceived by some as obscene and yet some others may perceive it as artistic, cannot be a ground to jail a person, especially where the acts complained of have been documented on film,” Chief Judicial Magistrate Audi Shanoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/milind-sonam-faces-fir-charged-with-obscenity-for-naked-run-on-goa-beach/story-qNTXV5B9mxn0ccplDyddLI.html
07-11-2020||India||US supercarrier Nimitz to join Vikramaditya for QUAD Malabar exercise off Goa coast||Indian Navy’s flagship Vikramaditya and US supercarrier Nimitz along with two destroyers of the Australian and Japanese navies will conduct full-spectrum exercises off the coast of Goa as part of Malabar war games from November 17 to 20.The two carrier groups, with MiG-29K fighters on board Vikramaditya and F-18 fighters on board Nimitz, will participate in war games, while the involvement of the two other countries, which are, like India and the US, members of the Quad grouping, will strengthen multi-operability in full domain exercises. It is also expected to help all four countries understand the ethos and level of training of each other’s navies, commanders and personnel.The exercise will take place in quite a congested environment with at least 70 foreign warships patrolling the area between the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy’s warships are not in the vicinity but are not too far off either -- ostensibly conducting anti-pirate operations off the Gulf of Aden.According to top naval commanders, the Indian Navy is fully deployed on both the eastern as well as the western seaboard and prepared for contingencies in case the situation takes a turn for the worse in East Ladakh region. Analysts say it is clear that the Quad members are committed to keep the sea lanes of communication open for navigation and are ready to meet the challenge brought upon by PLA Navy by imposing constraints in South China Sea.With the Indian Navy expected to commission indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant along with its second nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine, INS Arighat, by next year, India will be able to project power from Malacca Straits to Gulf of Aden and beyond, the analysts added.Under navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh, the focus of the force has also been on rapidly developing military infrastructure in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands so that India can project power well beyond the Malacca Straits. The navy is also keen on building a third aircraft carrier so that it turns into truly blue water navy.While there is an intensive debate among national security planners over the viability of a third aircraft carrier in an age when so-called standoff weapons and long range ballistic missiles are the order of the day, the navy’s argument is that a rising power like India cannot be tethered to the shore-line. This argument makes sense, say analysts, as China’s influence in Africa, Middle-East and Persian Gulf under the Belt Road Initiative has grown with Beijing leveraging its debt-hold on these countries.With China reaching the Indian Ocean through Pakistan and Myanmar, the navy wants Indian maritime and commercial interests to be protected by three aircraft carriers, one each of Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean. The counter argument made by the national security planners is that India should simply turn some of its 1,062 island territories into permanent military bases to influence events in the region.With the US, India, Australia and Japan communicating through deployed assets, liaison officers in each other’s naval commands, and Indian Ocean Monitoring Centres, the Quad, the analysts added, is definitely a force to reckon with in Indo-Pacific with situational awareness of both West Asia and Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-supercarrier-nimitz-to-join-vikramaditya-for-quad-malabar-exercise-off-goa-coast/story-cEROSoFZP8nb23faaLltxM.html
07-11-2020||India||SIT files charge sheet in Ballabgarh case||The special investigation team (SIT) of Faridabad police on Friday filed a 700-page charge sheet in the murder case of Nikita Tomar, a 20-year-old college student who was shot dead by a stalker outside her college on October 26. Police said the charge sheet, which lists 60 witnesses, was prepared on the basis of technical, forensic and material evidence recovered during the investigation and was submitted to the court in less than two weeks after the murder.Tomar was shot dead allegedly by Touseef Ahmad, a resident of Kabeer Nagar in Sohna, in the presence of his friend, Rehaan (who goes by one name), a resident of Riwasan in Nuh. A footage of the incident purportedly shows that the two men arrived at the spot in a Hyundai i20 and tried to force Tomar, a Bcom final-year student, into the vehicle as she came out of Aggarwal College after writing an exam, police said.OP Singh, Faridabad police commissioner, said that they had formed a special investigation team (SIT) on October 27 led by Anil Kumar Yadav , assistant commissioner of police (crime), to probe the murder.“Ten crime investigation agencies (CIA) were working on this case and submitting reports to me every day. The teams have recovered crucial evidence which are enough to hold suspects guilt and they will be given harsh punishment based on our chargesheet, which was filed in 11 days after the murder,” he said.Police said that statements of friends, shopkeepers and an auto driver are crucial in the case and the suspect’s close aide has also shared important information which is against the suspect. The man who sold the country-made pistol was also arrested from Nuh on October 28.The charge sheet has been filed under Sections 302 (murder), 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder) and 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage), 302 (murder), 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code and several sections of the Arms Act was registered at the Ballabhgarh city police station.Yadav said that in the charge sheet they have mentioned the motive of murder –Tomar had stopped talking to Touseef after she returned from his house in Nuh in 2018 where her parents had registered a kidnapping case against him.“An incident of abduction was reported on August 3, 2018, against the suspect, and the victim was recovered from Nuh…after his family members and relatives apologised, the families had an agreement… Touseef was warned against repeating any such incident,” Singh said.“The brother of the deceased, Naveen Tomar, has told police in a statement that the main accused (Touseef) was known to his sister and had been harassing her; he was forcing her to convert to Islam,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-files-charge-sheet-in-ballabgarh-case/story-QK5zSTpUbzfXOhRWoedNFJ.html
07-11-2020||India||Hathras case: CBI likely to question former SP, SDM||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is likely to question former Hathras superintendent of police (SP) Vikrant Vir and sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) PP Meena, to expedite the probe in connection with the alleged gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman by four upper caste men in Hathras, senior officers privy to the investigation said on Friday.Vir was the Hathras SP when the incident took place. The state government later suspended him on October 1 for his alleged negligence in handling the case after a public outcry over cremation of the woman’s body in the early hours of September 30. He is under suspension since then.A senior CBI official requesting anonymity said the premier investigating agency may question Vir about the probe and the action taken in the case during the initial stage after the woman was assaulted on September 14. He said the former SP would also be questioned about the allegation of forcibly cremating the body and favouring the accused.The police had initially lodged an FIR of attempt to murder that was later altered to include gang rape and murder charges.The official further said that an IAS officer, PP Meena, who was posted as sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in Hathras, would be questioned about the happenings and allegations of enforcing restrictions on the victim’s family and media.The probe agency has recorded the statements of the victim’s brother, her mother and aunt, and six local police personnel. The four accused, who are lodged in jail, and their family members were also questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-cbi-likely-to-question-former-sp-sdm/story-QcwYx71SfoHFIR9gCF87cM.html
07-11-2020||India||CBI left with limited tools to counter states’ action||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has limited legal options in the seven states that have withdrawn general consent to the agency for conducting probes within their boundaries, according to current and former agency officials and experts.Since CBI does not have any legal tools to reverse the decision of these states and policing is a state subject, CBI officials who did not want to be named pointed out that they might have to approach courts on a case-by-case basis for conducting investigations and carrying out searches.They added that the central government is aware of the matter and is deliberating how to navigate the situation.“CBI cannot challenge the decision by state governments as police is state subject, but it can go to high courts or Supreme Court in individual cases,” former CBI director AP Singh said.He added that unlike CBI, other federal agencies such as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) enjoy all-India jurisdiction without any prior permission under some relevant sections related to terrorism and money laundering.According to a CBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity, the central agency’s biggest worry in this imbroglio is the withdrawal of general consent by bigger states such as Maharashtra and Kerala.The move makes it mandatory for the federal agency to seek the state government’s permission before taking up cases within its borders.CBI comes under the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act which requires states to give the agency a general consent to act. This is because public order and police are under the purview of state governments, which routinely renew the permission under section 6 of the legislation.“After New Delhi, our Mumbai unit accounts for majority of cases registered every year. (Not having general consent in) Maharashtra definitely is a big loss,” said the CBI official cited above.For example, CBI has not registered a single first information report, or FIR, at its Mumbai branch since the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government withdrew the general consent on October 21. Usually, three to four --- sometimes more --- FIRs pertaining to corruption and bank fraud, among other offences, are registered in agency’s Mumbai unit every month.A second serving CBI official, who too requested anonymity, said that “while general consent has been withdrawn in the past too, never has agency been blocked by seven states in a row”.Apart from Maharashtra, Kerala and Jharkhand, which have withdrawn general consent for CBI probes within the past month, other states to have taken a similar step are the Congress-ruled Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government, and the Mizo National Front (MNF)-ruled Mizoram.These state governments have claimed that the Centre is using the agency to settle political scores.Tripura too stopped CBI from conducting investigations in the state last year, but the general consent was reinstated earlier this year.Similarly, the Andhra Pradesh government blocked the agency in November 2018, when Chandrababu Naidu was the chief minister. When YS Jagan Mohan Reddy became the state chief minister last year, he restored the general consent.“What is happening is completely understandable. CBI has become a complete tool and instrument in the hands of the central government to practise the politics of vendetta or circumvention against non-BJP, non-NDA (National Democratic Alliance) states. Misuse as instrument of harassment and the terror have resulted in the legitimate reaction of states withdrawing general all time consent,” senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-left-with-limited-tools-to-counter-states-action/story-SlKhMVaEKAbnkqIcPYhYYO.html
07-11-2020||India||Can resolve all issues through dialogue, says Nepal PM Oli||India and Nepal can resolve all problems between them through dialogue as they have a long-standing special relationship, Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli told visiting Indian Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Friday.Oli’s remarks came against the backdrop of a border row that took bilateral ties to a fresh low earlier this year. Naravane’s visit, during which he was conferred the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army in keeping with a long-standing tradition, was seen as an effort to improve the relationship.Naravane’s meeting with Oli was seen as the most important engagement during his three-day visit, apart from his talks on Thursday with his Nepali Army counterpart Gen Purna Chandra Thapa.Rajan Bhattarai, the foreign affairs adviser to Nepal’s premier, tweeted that Oli said during the meeting that Nepal and India have a “long-standing special relationship”. Oli also expressed confidence that there is real friendship between the two countries and all problems between them could be resolved through dialogue, Bhattarai said.Chief of Army Staff (CoAS) Narravane conveyed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s best wishes to Oli and the two sides exchanged views on their bilateral partnership. Naravane said he would work to strengthen bilateral defence cooperation, according to a statement from the Indian embassy in Kathmandu.The Indian Army added in a tweet that Oli and Naravane discussed the strengthening of bilateral defence and strategic ties.Naravane also addressed student officers and faculty of the Nepali Army Command and Staff College at Shivapuri earlier on Friday. He recalled the historical linkages between both countries and said these transcend professional exchanges and annual joint exercises.Before winding up his visit, Naravane visited the Indian embassy, where he was briefed about welfare activities for more than 230,000 Indian Army veterans and their families in Nepal.Nearly 30,000 Gurkhas serve in seven regiments of the Indian Army.As a reflection of the importance attached by India to these ties, Naravane presented the second tranche of ₹5 lakh out of the total aid of ₹10 lakh announced for Lance Havaldar (retired) Dil Bahadur Chettri, who won the Mahavir Chakra for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during the 1971 war with Pakistan.Chhetri quit service on his own request in 1976 due to personal reasons before reaching the age of retirement. However, he had no major source of income and survived solely on his gallantry award allowance. The financial assistance was approved as a welfare measure to alleviate his hardships and he was given the first tranche of ₹5 lakh in November last year.The Indian Army chief’s visit came months after bilateral ties were hit in May, when defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a key border road to Lipulekh region, which is claimed by Nepal.Kathmandu responded by issuing a new map that showed Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, all controlled by India, as part of Nepalese territory, exacerbating the row.The visit was expected to prepare the ground for more political engagements and talks on the border issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-resolve-all-issues-through-dialogue-says-nepal-pm-oli/story-4IuTccv5fWOaCb3l5y7ZTL.html

There has been a settlement with the Bodos after a long struggle; talks are in an advanced stage with the NSCN to resolve the Naga issue,” he said.Bhalla also ruled out any possibilities of China making any attempts in the northeastern region through insurgent groups operating there at a time when armies of both countries are locked in a standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. “There could be potential but not that much. These people (insurgents) have lost that kind of massive support. The leadership of ULFA is back in Assam and talking to the government. The NSCN people, after the ceasefire, are sitting in Delhi and talking to us for the final settlement. We don’t see that kind of major disruptions coming,” he said.The home secretary also said that government was yet to take a call on allowing Chinese telecom companies to enter into 5G trials in India but acknowledged that the penetration of the neighbouring country into the existing network is too extensive. Bhalla, however, said that the government is making special safeguards to ensure safety and security of the country’s communication network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naga-talks-at-advanced-stage-says-home-secy/story-6vZ9Nt6WdXxCDAFxKmmhoI.html
07-11-2020||India||Favour localisation of data: Truecaller to JPC||Truecaller, a Sweden-based mobile app that helps identify unknown phone numbers and block spam calls, told the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on Personal Data Protection, headed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Meenakshi Lekhi, on Friday that it supports data localisation, a person familiar with the matter said.The JPC has met several industry leaders such as Amazon, Google, Twitter, Facebook, Paytm, Reliance Jio, Ola, Uber and Bharti Airtel over last two weeks to discuss the nuances of the Data Protection Bill. The JPC is due to submit its report by the winter session of Parliament.The person cited above told HT that while Airtel, Jio, Ola and Paytm have supported data localisation, Truecaller is the first international firm to back the move. “After hearing their reasons, it makes sense that other companies do so as well. They haven’t just cited cost-efficiency but also increased security, safety and speed of business for having the data centres in India,” the person said.Data localisation has been a sore point for many tech giants, including the four biggest technology companies in the world -- Amazon, Google, Facebook and Twitter. They have argued that localisation may lead to the possibility of a “fractured internet” or “splinternet”.Amazon has expressed reservations over restrictions in cross-border data transfer, saying that it will hamper India’s business and economy.A person familiar with Twitter’s testimony, however, said that the House panel did not pose any question on data localisation to the social media giant.The person cited above said that the prevalent view, before Truecaller spoke to the panel, had been that Indian and foreign companies are divided on the issue of data localisation.“Truecaller’s stance shows that it is not only cheaper but also more efficient to store data in India,” the person said.The Personal Data Protection Bill proposes that tech companies store data of all Indian citizens within the country and that sensitive data, such as financial or healthcare data, not be stored outside India. Currently, the companies are allowed to only process sensitive data outside India. A Truecaller spokesperson confirmed that the company has a data centre in India just outside Mumbai, where it has stored data of Indian users since 2017. Truecaller launched its India arm in 2013.Lekhi said data localisation was the way forward. “The interaction with different stakeholders has been a fantastic one,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/favour-localisation-of-data-truecaller-to-jpc/story-mzeOIq2xLlJwYrLlSK49KM.html

The chief secretary also asked the BBIL to set up a ‘state of art’ biotech incubation center, common facilities and IT corridor along with the first phase construction of the industry.The company was also requested to promote the local start-ups.Secretary Skill Development and Technical Education and Chairman & Managing Director IDCO SK Singh said: “Land is readily available at Biotech Park, Andharua for groundbreaking works. The building plan as per the design has also been approved”.Principal Secretary Science and Technology S Sadangi said: “the required statutory clearances and pollution control board permission has been availed for setting up the unit”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-to-manufacture-10-types-of-vaccines-including-covid-19-at-odisha-unit/story-0Wnzt7sBAEFHRHLUd2zbfJ.html
07-11-2020||India||Arnab Goswami’s bail to be heard today||The Supreme Court on Friday issued a contempt notice to the Maharashtra assembly’s assistant secretary for allegedly “intimidating” journalist Arnab Goswami for approaching the top court last month with transcripts of a debate on a breach of privilege motion initiated against him in connection with his television show on actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Goswami was arrested by Mumbai Police earlier this week in connection with the 2018 suicide of an interior designer. There was no immediate relief for him on Friday as the hearing on his interim bail plea before the Bombay high court remained incomplete. The division bench of Justice SS Shinde and Justice MS Karnik is likely to decide on his bail plea Saturday.An October 13 letter by the assembly’s assistant secretary purportedly cautioned him against disclosing House proceedings without the Speaker’s approval even as the editor-in-chief of Republic TV approached the apex court against the initiation of the privilege motion. The Supreme Court stayed Goswami’s arrest in this particular case and said it is “unprecedented” and “serious” that a state legislature is threatening a citizen for approaching the apex court with documents, which he received from the assembly as part of a notice asking him to explain his stand. The three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, also allowed Goswami to add the Union government as a party to the case, issued a notice to attorney general KK Venugopal, and appointed senior advocate Arvind Datar to assist the court as an amicus curiae. It posted the matter for November 23 and asked the secretary, Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, to be present during the hearing. “There is no doubt that if a citizen of India is deterred in any case from approaching this court in exercise of his right under Article 32 (allowing citizens to move Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights) of the Constitution of India, it would amount to a serious and direct interference in the administration of justice in the country,” the bench, also comprising Justice AS Bopanna and Justice V Ramasubramanian, said in its order. The privilege motion case in the Supreme Court pertains to a news show hosted by Goswami, who accused the Maharashtra government of not going in the right direction in the Rajput death probe and allegedly made derogatory comments targeted at chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, according to House proceedings. Following this, proceedings were initiated on a breach of privilege motion moved on September 9 by Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik. Goswami later filed a petition in the top court with transcripts of the debate seeking a stay on the motion. Senior advocate Harish Salve, who appeared for Goswami, produced an affidavit to bring the letter on record. “This is a matter of utmost seriousness... At times, constitutional courts must see the reality, and not the smokescreen. I want a stay of any further proceedings in this matter,” Salve said. CJI Bobde termed the matter “very serious” and said: “We have never seen such a letter in a privilege case. We find it very difficult to overlook it. How dare this officer say this?” The bench then show-caused Vilas Athawale, assistant secretary, Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, and asked as to why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who represented the Maharashtra government, informed the court that no action was expected to be taken against Goswami in the privilege motion case. Rajendra Bhagwat, secretary, Maharashtra legislative assembly, refused to react on the matter, saying it is sub-judice. Meanwhile, a division bench of the Bombay high court will continue to hear on Saturday the bail petition filed Goswami. Goswami was picked up from his home in Lower Parel by Alibag Police on charges of allegedly abetting the suicide of a 53-year-old Anvay Naik. Naik and his mother Kumud were found dead at their house in May 2018. A suicide note alleged that the two were forced to end their lives because he was not paid dues amounting to ₹5.4 crore by Goswami, two others.

07-11-2020||India||Will implement CAA, says Shah on CM Mamata’s turf||The Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government is committed to implementing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Friday, while also exuding confidence that his party will comfortably register a victory in next year’s assembly elections in the battleground state of West Bengal. On a two-day visit to the state, Shah sounded the bugle for the 2021 elections, targeted chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s government over “corruption and atrocity and political killings”, had lunch at a Dalit man’s house in a symbolic move, and also appealed to residents to restore Bengal’s “lost glory”. “The BJP is committed to enforcing the new citizenship law across the nation. The process has been held back because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said at a press conference after a closed-door meeting with BJP leaders at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre at Rajarhat, on the suburbs of Kolkata. Senior BJP leaders who attended the meeting with Shah said he spoke at length on the citizenship law -- an emotive issue in the state that shares its borders with Bangladesh -- and said the BJP has kept the promise it made to the people. Shah also offered prayers at a temple of the Matua community, a dominant part the Namasudras (or Dalits), at New Town in Kolkata and had lunch at the home of one of the community members there. Members of the Matua community, who welcomed him, said they needed the citizenship law. “Citizenship right had been a long-standing demand of the Matua community,” said Brajen Majumdar, a lawyer. A large section of the Matua community migrated to Bengal from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) after 1947 to escape religious persecution. There are about 10 million people from the Namasudra community in Bengal, according to the 2011 Census. The contentious citizenship law promises to fast-track the citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who entered India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before 2015. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is strongly opposed to the law and citizenship screening on the basis of religion. Caste politics and Dalit votes will play a crucial role in the assembly polls due in six months, according to experts. “The lunch Shah had at the home of a Matua family may be seen as a political gimmick, but it is a fact that for millions of people, citizenship is an important issue,” said political observer Suvashis Maitra. After winning 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 elections, the BJP is gearing up to challenge CM Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress in the assembly polls. Dalit communities can influence poll results in over 50 of the state’s 294 assembly seats. In the evening, Shah launched an all-out offensive on the Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) government. “Our aim is to build a strong Bengal in a new era of development. Mamata Banerjee’s aim is to make her nephew (Abhishek Banerjee) the next CM,” he said at the press meet. “Rest assured, the BJP will come to power in Bengal with more than 200 seats (out of 294)…The anger in people shows that change is imminent. I appeal to the people to give the BJP an opportunity. We will turn this state into sonar Bangla (golden Bengal) in five years.”When asked if former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly was considered as a probable CM face amidst a buzz, Shah said: “The parliamentary committee of the BJP and the party president will decide whether we need a chief ministerial face for the coming polls in Bengal, and if at all we need one, then who it should be.”Hitting back, Saugata Roy, a Trinamool Lok Sabha MP and a party spokesperson, said: “The BJP is trying to divide people. Mamata Banerjee makes no discrimination among citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-implement-caa-says-shah-on-cm-mamata-s-turf/story-2z7NuLxmtoedOm7xtu05bO.html
07-11-2020||India||Delhiwale: Portrait of a working dad||This afternoon, leaf collector Mahesh is making a round of the central Delhi park where he works, dragging his bicycle cart behind him. He occasionally stops, picks up the fallen leaves and tosses them into his cart. All of them are destined for the garbage.But what’s this curious bundle, slumped in one corner of Mahesh’s cart?On taking a closer look, it doesn’t look like a bundle.It’s a child. She is sleeping in a slouched position, her head bent down on her knees.“That’s Nandini, my daughter,” says Mahesh, casually shrugging his shoulders as if it were the most normal thing in the world to have a baby bundled up in a cart of leaves. “It’s her afternoon sleep time.”Mahesh’s wife, Saraswati, is a leaf collector too, in the same park. Natives of Gwalior, in Madhya Pradesh, they arrived in the city more than a year ago and have been in this job since about that time. The couple’s other child, the younger boy Ankit, is with his mother “somewhere over there,” Mahesh says, vaguely waving his arm towards a great tuft of trees.The family has just had lunch—every day, they have it together on the park lawn. “We had roti and bhaaji, but I don’t know which bhaaji...,” says Mahesh, grinning widely. “I don’t cook food, my wife does.”He explains that he and Saraswati divide the duties of looking after the children. “Ankit is very young and stays with his mother, while I look after Nandini.”The little girl is a first standard student. “But her school is closed due to karuna (coronavirus).” As the girl has no access to online classes, she stays with her parents while they work. “Sometimes she plays with her bhaiya, sometimes she plays alone... and when she gets tired, she sleeps.”Turning around to look at her, Mahesh affectionately taps his hand on Nandini’s head, muttering “she is very naughty when she is awake.”The sleeping girl is barefoot.A moment later, Mahesh tries to wake her up. Nandini doesn’t stir. Mahesh lifts her in his arms. The girl lets herself fall on his shoulder, eyes still closed. Mahesh cries to her, “Dekh machli (see, fish),” pointing to a flock of birds. Nandini continues sleeping. Mahesh carefully places her back in the cart and carries onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-portrait-of-a-working-dad/story-UkM5em8v8DpM0FJkUnlBTL.html
07-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||This is the 200th instalment of a column on Covid-19 that I began on March 19. I’ve written it at least five days a week since (there are a few weeks when I wrote seven or six, and one week when I could manage only four). I’m still learning, but because the column requires extensive reading, it has deepened my understanding of the virus, testing, the human immune system, drugs, and therapies. My background (in math and engineering) has helped, but not as much as my colleagues Jamie Mullick, Sanchita Sharma, and Binayak Dasgupta, who have generously shared with me their expertise in math, public health, and science. Our understanding of the virus, how it affects us, and what works and what doesn’t, continues to grow, as the pandemic itself ebbs and flows across geographies – continuing to provide me with fodder for this column. And when they don’t, I come up with something – such as Dispatch 73, on June 4, where I wrote about masks, and used the opportunity to quote from Paul Laurence Dunbar’s poem We Wear The Mask, which is about racism and identity in the US (the column appeared around the time the Black Lives Matter protests peaked).“…Why should the world be over-wise,In counting all our tears and sighs?Nay, let them only see us, while,We wear the mask.”There are some Constant Readers who have told me I should continue to write the column till a vaccine comes out, and is widely available, but I don’t know – I do have a day job, after all. But I’m being self-indulgent; 200 is a personal milestone on a day there were other not-so-personal ones related to the pandemic.The first is the peak the US touched in terms of daily new cases: at least 121,000, according to the New York Times; 102,830 according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center; and 118,319 according to worldometers.info. The third wave of the pandemic has been the worst in the country, and across most states, the seven-day average is trending up, a clear indication that the number of cases could go even higher. The world, too, saw a new peak in terms of daily cases, 605,269 according to the New York Times, and 608,550 according to worldometers.info. The US and Europe are seeing a sharp spike in cases with the onset of winter, but there is a far more disturbing statistic. On November 5, the seven-day average of deaths from Covid-19 globally reached a peak too – 7,595, according to the New York Times. This is worrying despite case fatality rates being lower (until now) than they were in the first wave – more people are dying now simply because there are more, far more, cases. At this pace, the world will touch 50 million cases shortly. According to most dashboards, the number of daily deaths around the world from Covid-19 is nearing 10,000; the NYT database says this number was actually crossed on November 4 (there are usually some differences based on reporting times and time zones).Clearly, fears about winter accelerating the spread of the pandemic were not unfounded. In Europe and in most US states, hospitals have been overwhelmed by the number of patients needing care, putting pressure on not just already stretched health care systems, but also on doctors and other health care workers who are at a breaking point after around eight months of dealing with the pandemic (although there was some respite in Europe through the summer). India is relatively better off; while cases have risen in some regions (including Delhi), at a national level, both daily case numbers and the seven-day average of cases are at levels last seen in early July. There will be a second wave, though, and the country would do well to prepare for it now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-mf3A3BQA4KpgYSHyYpK9ZN.html

07-11-2020||India||India tops global survey on Covid-19 vaccination intent; rising hesitancy in many countries||Indians are the keenest on getting vaccinated whenever a Covid-19 vaccine is available, even as people in 10 out of 15 countries showed a growing reluctance about getting vaccinated, according to a global survey.In the World Economic Forum/Ipsos survey of 18,526 adults from 15 countries, 73% said they would get a Covid-19 vaccine if available, down from 77% in August.While vaccination intent has remained unchanged at 87% in India since August, it has declined in 10 of the 15 countries surveyed, most of all in China, Australia, Spain, and Brazil.Globally, the two main reasons for not wanting to get a Covid-19 vaccine are concerns about side effects (cited by 34%) and concerns about clinical trials moving too fast (cited by another 33%). In India also, 34% respondents said they are worried about side effects, while 16% are concerned about fast-moving trials.Besides, one in ten persons globally said they are against vaccines in general (19% in India), while another 10% said they don’t think a vaccine will be effective (14% in India), and 8% cited a low risk of getting Covid-19 (14% in India), as per the survey.The World Economic Forum (WEF) said the latest survey has shown a growing reluctance to receive a vaccine, despite progress made by numerous pharmaceutical companies working on vaccine trials and international organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi and CEPI working to ensure any future solution is available for those most in need.Arnaud Bernaert, Head of Shaping the Future of Health and Healthcare at the WEF, said, “This drop in vaccine confidence is a remarkable and sad trend as we edge closer to a possible vaccine roll-out.” “The numbers are significant enough to compromise the effectiveness of a Covid-19 vaccine to manage the disease and to see an end to the cycle of new lockdowns and restrictions. It is critical that governments and the private sector come together to build trust in the next steps. It’s important to know that when a vaccine is ready, it will make a difference,” Bernaert added.The survey also asked the respondents how soon after a vaccine becomes available would they get one.Nearly half of the adults globally said they would get vaccinated within three months after the Covid-19 vaccine is available to all (54% in India).Globally, 72% said they would get vaccinated within a year (82% in India).The WHO had called ‘public hesitancy towards vaccination’ as one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019, affecting not only public health but businesses and economies also.The survey was conducted by leading market research company Ipsos from October 8-13, 2020, with a sample of 18,526 adults in the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, and the UK.The survey also put Indians as being the second most optimistic about availability of a Covid-19 vaccine soon -- 34% expecting it within three months and 72% within six months. China topped the chart with 37% expecting a vaccine in three months and 75% in six months.Globally, 16% expect the first vaccine for general use in three months and 45% in six months.More than 4.8 crore people have tested positive for the virus so far globally, while more than 12 lakh have died.India’s Covid-19 caseload has crossed past 84 lakh, while nearly 1.25 lakh have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tops-global-survey-on-covid-19-vaccination-intent-rising-hesitancy-in-many-countries/story-wYs1Ag3SlCp3t6aMu8ZFjP.html
07-11-2020||India||Air pollution may lead to faster spread of Covid-19 infections, officials tell parliamentary panel||Air pollution may lead to a faster spread of Covid-19 infections as it causes coughing and sneezing, government officials told a parliamentary panel on Friday, according to sources.Top officials of the Union environment and health ministries and the governments of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab deposed before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development to find a “permanent solution” to air pollution in the national capital and adjoining areas.In addition, officials of the Central Pollution Control Board and from other departments also depose before the panel on the ongoing situation of air pollution in the national capital and its adjoining areas.The agenda of the meeting was to deliberate upon “steps taken for prevention of air pollution special emphasis on finding permanent solution to air pollution in Delhi and NCR.” In a presentation before the panel, officials from the central government expressed concern over the threat of Covid-19 spreading faster due to air pollution.“Higher air pollution may increase episodes of coughing and sneezing spreading Covid-19 faster. More particle surface for the virus to stick to and get transported over greater distance and may potentially survive longer,” the health ministry said in the presentation to the committee.Citing a Lancet study, the health ministry said, “There is average loss of 1.7 years of life expectancy in India due to air pollution.” Similarly it said in Delhi there is 1.7 times higher risk of respiratory ailments and prevalence of breathing problems and 10,000 to 30,000 air pollution deaths are reported annually.The environment ministry, in its presentation, shared the details of the status of air quality of Delhi during four years between 2016 and 2019.As per the presentation, the quality of Delhi air was good for only four days during this period and was very poor for 319 days.And the quality of air in Delhi was severe for 78 days.Delhi’s air quality on Thursday dropped to its worst level since December 2019 with farm fires accounting for 42% of its pollution, the maximum this season so far, according to data from central government agencies.Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions -- calm winds and low temperatures -- and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states led to a dense layer of haze on Wednesday night as the air quality index entered the ‘severe’ category.The haze thinned on Thursday with higher wind speed helping in dispersion of pollutants. However, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 450, the highest since December 30 last year, when it was 446.All the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded air quality in the ‘severe’ category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Noida also recorded ‘severe’ air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-may-lead-to-faster-spread-of-covid-19-infections-officials-tell-parliamentary-panel/story-cm2iBPo13QP3tsyLpVu9IJ.html
07-11-2020||India||Panel to tackle pollution set up as air still ‘severe’||The Union environment ministry has constituted the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas, picking former Delhi chief secretary MM Kutty as its chairperson, even as the Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to ensure there was no smog in the national capital region amid sliding air quality.Besides Kutty, who is a former secretary of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, professor Mukesh Khare, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, and Ramesh KJ, ex-director general, India Meteorological Department (IMD), were appointed as full-time technical members of the commission, according to a notification issued on Thursday.On October 29, the Union government issued an ordinance and put in place the new anti-pollution agency with sweeping powers spanning five northern states where it will monitor and act against sources of air pollution. The panel has replaced all ad hoc committees and bodies created under court orders, including the SC-appointed environment pollution control authority (Epca).In the Supreme Court on Thursday, a bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian posted petitions related to air pollution for hearing after the Diwali vacation. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, informed the bench that the new commission will begin functioning from Friday after the government appointed its members.“The only thing is that you ensure that there is no smog in the city. We are not concerned with commission. There are many commissions and many brains are working but just ensure that there is no smog in the city,” the bench said. Mehta replied that government is taking all efforts on war footing.Six full-time members of the commission took charge on Friday, a day after the air quality index stood at 450 in the “severe” category, the season’s worst so far. A layer of smog blanketed the Capital on Friday, too, with the average AQI over the previous 24 hours at 406 in the “severe” category.Experts said that a delay in the commission’s functioning at this crucial juncture, when the air quality starts sliding with the approaching winter, could hamper the efforts of control air pollution ahead of Diwali. Over the recent years, illegal use of firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR region has resulted in worsening of the situation, with toxic fumes engulfing the region. On Thursday, in exercise of its powers under the ordinance, a selection panel under Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar’s chairmanship selected Kutty.The selection panel, which also comprised Union ministers Piyush Goyal, Nitin Gadkari and Harsh Vardhan, and cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, named Arvind Kumar Nautiyal, joint secretary, environment ministry, as the commission’s full-time member. While Khare and Ramesh will be the agency’s full-time technical members, Ajay Mathur, the director-general of The Energy and Resources Institute, and Ashish Dhawan of Air Pollution Action Group, have been selected as the commission’s non-government members. Respective state governments and ministries will appoint the rest of the agency’s nine ex-officio members.The rules for the commission’s functioning were yet to be formulated but two full-time members, Kutty and Nautiyal, met RP Gupta, secretary, environment ministry, to discuss when they could start functioning.“We are working on it. The members take charge immediately but I am not sure when they will have their first meeting. Other members will have to be also selected and take charge,” said Ravi Agrawal, special secretary, environment ministry.The ordinance empowers the agency to make rules, set emission standards, and slap fines of up to ₹1 crore or imprison violators for up to five years. As per the ordinance, Kutty will have a term of three years from the date he takes charge or until he is 70 years of age.Nautiyal did not respond to HT’s calls or messages through the day. Mathur said: “We have spoken to each other several times since morning and I think we will be meeting very soon. The selection happened suddenly so members will have to rework their regular schedule to get completely involved in the commission,” he said.Khare said: “I have received the notification this morning, it is too early to say anything now. Once a plan is ready we will communicate our next step.”As per the ordinance, the members of the agency have to be drawn from Union ministries, departments, non-governmental organisations and the five states of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.“We all know what needs to be done. But the scale of action will be very important. The commission will have to take deep, multisector action for the entire region. For example, all power plants will have to meet the new emission standards; all industries will have to move to clean fuel; proper waste management infrastructure needs to be put in place and a strategy for regional public transit will be crucial. The commission will have to have a very strong compliance strategy,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.While welcoming the formation of the commission, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said he hoped that the new commission will swiftly act on the rising cases of stubble burning instances in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana.“We have been seeing the effectiveness of the Pusa bio-decomposer, which melts the stubble in fields and converts it into manure. We hope that the new commission sees this cost-effective solution and directs the governments of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to make use of this solution so that Delhi does not continue to suffer on its account year after year,” Rai said.Expressing concern over poor air quality in north India, especially in the national Capital, Javadekar said the government will encourage all possible technological interventions to mitigate pollution. “The central government has been working constantly on all the fronts towards mitigation of air pollution. The government is working towards abatement of air pollution by working at the source level, be it industries or thermal power stations, vehicular pollution, construction and demolition waste or stubble burning, which are the major sources of pollution generation,” he added.An official of the Delhi government’s environment ministry said on condition of anonymity that the appointment of the commission happened at a crucial stage when the air quality levels in the city were already showing a declining trend. The official said the commission will help in better coordination between states in tackling the problem.“The problem in Delhi is that a lot of things are not in the state government’s complete control. The task of coordination used to happen better with Epca, but now we hope the commission will take on this role,” a senior Delhi government official said, asking not to be named.Farm fires are likely to be one of the focus areas of the new commission. It will have the powers to issue directions, entertain complaints; regulate and prohibit activities that are likely to cause or increase air pollution, lay down parameters and standards; restrict industry activities, processes; and direct the closure, or prohibit any polluting activity in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-to-tackle-pollution-set-up-as-air-still-severe/story-q3F79e8qMkabomYaFvUewM.html
07-11-2020||India||Baba ka Dhaba row: Case of cheating filed against YouTube ‘influencer’||Delhi Police on Friday registered a case of cheating against YouTube “influencer”, Gaurav Wasan, after conducting a preliminary enquiry into a complaint of alleged misappropriation of funds filed by an elderly man who runs a roadside eatery, Baba ka Dhaba, in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar. The eatery, Baba ka Dhaba, run by Prasad, shot to fame last month after Wasan highlighted how Prasad could run out of business because his customers were staying away due to the coronavirus disease. A first information report (FIR) was registered under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code against Wasan at the Malviya Nagar police station. The police’s initial probe and examination of the transactions of Wasan and his family members revealed that he had cheated the elderly man, Kanta Prasad, of more than R4 lakh, a senior police officer privy to the development in the case said, requesting anonymity. “We have registered a cheating case against Wasan. He will soon be served a notice, asking him to join the probe,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur. Wasan did not respond to calls and text messages seeking his response. Prasad could not be reached for his comment, as calls made to him went unanswered. An 11-minute YouTube video blog, posted on October 7, detailed how Prasad and his wife, Badami Devi, both apparently in their eighties, were in dire straits outside their tiny eatery in Malviya Nagar. On October 31, DCP Thakur said, Prasad filed a complaint regarding cheating and fraud against Wasan. He alleged that Wasan had approached him and shot a video with him to help/promote his business (Baba ka Dhaba). Wasan posted the video on social media through his account namely “Swad Official” and requested the public to donate money to financially help Prasad, said Thakur. “The said video went viral and as per the complainant, the alleged Gaurav Wasan deliberately shared only his and his family members’ bank details and mobile number for donation. Wasan collected a huge amount through donation and later cheated the complainant (Prasad),” said the DCP. Wasan’s video on his YouTube page was widely circulated, leading to 3 million views and drawing thousands of Delhi residents, and some celebrities, to Prasad’s shop to buy food and take selfies. A month later, the crowds outside Baba Ka Dhaba have vanished. The allegations of misappropriation of funds were first made by a bunch of other users on YouTube, who made videos to allege that Wasan conned the elderly couple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baba-ka-dhaba-row-case-of-cheating-filed-against-youtube-influencer/story-av2Zp125n2QCTLAezg8nzN.html
07-11-2020||India||Court scraps MLA’s election over non-dislcosure of info in poll affidavit||The Manipur High Court has declared the election of Y Surchandra from Kakching Assembly Constituency in 2017 assembly elections as null and void over non-disclosure of information the election affidavit and has also named M Rameshwar, who secured the second place in the then elections, as the elected Member of Kakching Assembly Constituency.Justice MV Muralidaran of the High Court of Manipur passed a ruling in this regard on Thursday based on a petition filed by M Rameshwar Singh (48) of Kakching Khullen in Kakching district. In his petition, Rameshwar claimed that Surchandra has failed to disclose full particulars of his assets and liabilities including those of his dependants and also concealed vital material information in his election affidavits.During the then scrutiny of nomination papers on February 17, 2017, the petitioner and his election agents raised objections, but the returning officer accepted the nomination of Surchandra and allowed him to contest the election, the petition said.Surchandra, 65, contested the election as congress candidate and was declared the MLA from Kakching constituency after winning the seat with 11133 votes while Rameshwar got 10,503 votes.Reacting to the court verdict, Rameshwar said, “I feel good because the judgment shows that no one is above the law of the land.”It may be mentioned that Surchandra who had served as a congress MLA allegedly joined the BJP leading to his disqualification under the Tenth Schedule of the constitution as an elected Member ahead of the Rajya Sabha election in June this year. Since then, the seat for Kakching Assembly Constituency had been lying vacant in the 11th Manipur Legislative Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-scraps-mla-s-election-over-non-dislcosure-of-info-in-poll-affidavit/story-Ekqt6d6INEdPbK9VEOn9TK.html
