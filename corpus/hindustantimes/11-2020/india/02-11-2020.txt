This comes in less than a year after the people of Jharkhand voted in favour of the ruling JMM and Congress candidates in the regular assembly polls which were held in December 2019.The by-election on two seats was necessitated as chief minister Hemant Soren vacated Dumka assembly after registering victory from two seats and retained Barhait. Bermo fell vacant after veteran Congress legislator Rajendra Prasad Singh died of illness in May. There are 17 candidates in Dumka while 16 are in the fray in Bermo constituency. However, the contest is bipolar in both seats with the ruling JMM and Congress locked in a direct battle against the BJP candidates. The BJP has received an extra boost in its contest after Sudesh Mahto-led AJSU Party has also extended support to the saffron party. One of the oldest allies of the BJP in the state, AJSU is back in the national democratic alliance (NDA) folder, after having parted ways in December polls and going solo. While the JMM has fielded Basant Soren, younger son of party patriarch Shibu Soren from its traditional stronghold Dumka, Congress has fielded Jaimangal Singh, son of the deceased six-term party legislator Rajendra Singh from Bermo, inviting the ire of the opposition that has accused the ruling allies of nepotism. On the other hand, the BJP is banking on its old faces, former minister from Dumka Lois Marandi and two term-legislator Yogeshwar Mahto Batul from Bermo in Bokaro district. The campaigning for the two seats was led by the top local leaders and central leaders from neither the Congress nor the BJP entered the campaign trail. While three former BJP chief ministers campaigned for the BJP candidates, chief minister Hemant Soren remained the star campaigner for the ruling alliance, besides state-level leaders of the Congress. As the campaign reached its end on Sunday, the war of words got shriller, especially over the alleged unparliamentary language used by former CM Raghubar Das against the ruling combine. The BJP leaders also dared the state government to arrest its state president Deepak Prakash after a Congress leader registered an FIR accusing him of criminal conspiracy and treason.Prakash, also a member of Rajya Sabha had stated during the campaign that the JMM-Congress-RJD combine government would fall after the by-poll and the BJP would form government in the state within few months.Though both sides are claiming victory in both seats, the electoral outcome is unlikely to make any immediate impact to the stability of the 10-month old government as the numbers in the 81-member assembly are stacked in favour of the ruling JMM-Congress-RJD combine with support of at least 48 legislators of the existing 78 members.One seat fell vacant last month after the demise of JMM legislator and minority affairs minister Haji Hussain Ansari.Political experts say it would be too early to term the electoral outcome of the by-polls as a referendum on the government. “Almost six of nine months of this government has been under covid crisis. So it would be too early to view it as a litmus test. Though it is difficult to predict the outcome, ruling parties have a history of enjoying an advantage in by-polls,” said LK Kundan, who teaches political science at Ranchi University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-by-polls-bjp-eyes-to-wrest-dumka-bermo-from-ruling-jmm-congress/story-NG7MIVczxrjVZHk9Sjqz2L.html

02-11-2020||India||Baroda bypolls: Why this seat is a battle of prestige for Congress, BJP||A head-to-head contest between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress is in the offing for the Baroda bypoll in Haryana which will go to polls on Tuesday.Riding on the charisma of former chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the Congress is hoping for a fourth consecutive victory from this Deswali belt seat since 2009 assembly polls. Additionally, in a bid to open an account from this seat, the saffron party is making the last ditch effort. The seat fell vacant after the demise of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda on April 12 this year.A total of 14 candidates are in the fray for the bypoll. While the BJP has fielded Olympian wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, who lost by about 4,800 votes to Hooda in the 2019 assembly election, the Congress has put its money on a newcomer, Indu Raj Narwal, a former member of Sonepat zila parishad.A total of 1.78 lakh voters- 97,819 males, 80,429 females and 2 transgender will exercise their voting rights, according to figures released by the Election Commission officials. Of these, 5,092 voters are above 80 years of age and 1,860 service electors. As many as 280 polling stations (223 main and 57 auxiliary) have been formed and a booth can have a maximum of 1,000 electors.As the seat will undergo polling exercise during a coronavirus disease outbreak, the Election Commission of India has arranged for one lakh single–use gloves for Baroda voters to put on when they press the EVM button to cast their votes, 57,500 surgical masks, 3,500 face shields, 1,650 bottles of hand sanitiser (500 ml each) and 3,500 each personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and N-95 face masks. Why Baroda seat is a battle of prestige for HoodaAnant Ram, retired professor of political science at Bhiwani Government College, said the bypoll is a challenge for Hooda to save his bastion and similarly the results of the election will be a verdict on the performance of the BJP-JJP government.“A win here will underscore Hooda’s hold in the Deshwali belt and restore the Congress tally in the assembly to 31. However, the bypoll is significant for the BJP-JJP government as the outcome will reflect the performance of the government and mood of the voters towards the alliance partner, who had contested the 2019 assembly election separately and targeted guns at each other. Ram explained that the BJP has made an experiment to pitch a non-Jat candidate from the rural Jat dominated seat amid three laws’ protests. “If they win from the Baroda seat, they will adopt this strategy in other Jat dominated seats in the future elections. If they lose this election, it will impact the image of the chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar,” he added.BJP distributes money, liquor and refill gas cylinders to woo voters, alleges HoodaAddressing a press conference at his residence, leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda alleged that the BJP leaders and workers have been distributing money, liquor and refilling gas cylinders of poor voters to influence the election.“The BJP has reached such a low level but they can’t purchase the self respect of voters. The Congress will definitely defeat the BJP in this high-stake bypoll. Even the Jind Director Inspector General (DIG) OP Narwal, is canvassing in favour of the BJP candidate. We have written to the election commission of India (ECI) to take action in both incidents,” Hooda said.The Congress and Hooda are banking heavily on the support of Jat voters who have a brute 52% majority in this Deswali belt constituency. The Congress nominee, Indu Raj Narwal,40, is a Jat who comes from Rindhana village in neighbouring Gohana tehsil, a village known to spring up international kabaddi players. He was a surprise pick after Hooda’s original choice Kapoor Singh Narwal, a turncoat from the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) stable and who till recently was in the BJP, was not given a Congress nomination.His BJP rival, 37-year-ol Yogeshwar Dutt, a Commonwealth gold winning wrestler is a Brahmin and banks heavily on being a sporting icon and the BJP’s ability to sway the non-Jat votes. Dutt who comes from Bhainswal Kalan, a Jat dominated village had made his electoral debut in 2019 assembly polls after securing a BJP nomination from Baroda. His second shot at Baroda will depend on his star power and consolidation of non-Jats in this Jat dominated constituency. Brahmins account for about 12% votes in Baroda.Om Prakash Chautala’s Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has fielded Joginder Singh Malik,41, a candidate who badly lost the 2019 assembly election from Baroda. Malik, a Jat candidate finished a poor fifth securing only 3,145 votes, less than 3% of the total votes polled.Former BJP MP from Kurukshetra, Rajkumar Saini, who had floated his own outfit last year has also thrown his hat in the contest. However, the INLD candidate and Saini are unlikely to affect the outcome of the Congress versus BJP contest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baroda-bypolls-why-this-seat-is-a-battle-of-prestige-for-congress-bjp/story-Ko32ALSmvKX8hX1bys4O3J.html

The drug has been included as an “investigational therapy” and recommended only for restricted emergency use purposes. The drug, which is administered in the form of an injection, has been allowed for restricted emergency use for a maximum five-day period for treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 in adults and children hospitalised in moderate stage of the illness, subject to several safeguards. Several companies in India, such as Dr Reddy’s, Hetero and Cipla among others have been granted permission by the the DCGI to manufacture and market remdesivir for “restricted emergency use” on hospitalised Covid-19 patients.Written informed consent of each patient is required before the use of the drug and results of additional clinical trials, active post-marketing surveillance data and reporting of serious adverse events have to be submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcgi-rejects-dr-reddy-s-laboratories-application-for-full-marketing-authorisation-of-remdesivir/story-NWtbrcKTODailLMNzOwmWJ.html

The by-poll was necessitated after Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) MLA and former chief minister Ajit Jogi passed away in May this year. The constituency has been the bastion of Jogi for last two decades but this is the first time in last 20 years when the Jogis are not in the fray because Amit Jogi’s nomination from the JCC was rejected.Jogi’s nomination was rejected based on a high-power committee report which found that he was not a tribal. The nomination papers of Jogi’s wife Richa Jogi, who had filed nomination for the same seat, were also cancelled by the district collector on the same ground On Saturday, the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (Jogi) had extended support to the BJP candidate alleging that the ruling Congress has insulted late Ajit Jogi. The JCC has four MLAs in the 90-member Chhattisgarh assembly. In another development on Sunday, a couple of JCC MLAs extended their support to Congress in a press conference in Marwahi.

The Congress highlighted several pro-farmer and pro-tribal initiatives of the state government including the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna, cow dung procurement scheme, distribution of forest rights certificates, and relief measures to combat the Covid-19 outbreak. “We are winning the Marwahi by-poll from a margin of at least 30,000 votes. The people have understood that the present government is pro poor and pro tribal and hence they have decided to vote for us,” said state minister Jai Singh Agarwal, in-charge of the Congress for Marwahi by-poll.While the BJP accused the Congress government of failing on all fronts, it also alleged that the law and order situation in the state has deteriorated. As many as 1,90,907 voters - 93,694 males, 97,209 females and four from the third gender - will exercise their franchise for which 286 polling stations have been set up. Of these, 126 have been recognized as sensitive. The counting of votes will take place on November 10. It is worth mentioning that both the BJP and the Congress have fielded doctors in the Marwahi constituency. The BJP fielded a tribal surgeon, Gambhir Singh, as its candidate while the ruling Congress a veteran doctor Dr Krishan Kumar Dhruw, who had a long stint as the block medical officer (BMO) in the area. “Everyone knows that Congress has snatched the democratic right of the Jogi family which should be condemned. After the support of Jogi’s party, we are sure of winning because it has been the bastion of Jogis.

A group of community stalwarts scattered across the world has decided to chip in with a foundation. It will help create a sustainable ecosystem to incubate start-ups and encourage young entrepreneurs to scale up their businesses to the next level.The Global Kashmiri Pandit Business Foundation (GKPBF) was formally launched on 22 October, a day marked in the memories of Kashmiri Pandits as a Black Day when tribals backed by Pakistani army invaded Jammu and Kashmir in 1947.The foundation hopes the community would have something positive to remember the day for. “22nd October of year 2020 would be known as a historic day for Kashmiri Pandit (KP) community in the world,” said a statement issued by the foundation that hopes to build the ground for a new legacy.A little over 40 years after the 1947 invasion, the Kashmiri Pandit families in Kashmir found themselves under attack again in 1990 when Pakistan backed terrorists forced Pandits out of the Kashmir Valley.“But they forgot that we are seeds, we bloomed again after getting scattered all around the globe,” said founder and GKPBF director DK Bakshi.“Three decades of struggle put in by the most peaceful, educated but resilient community of KPs with utter confidence and grit came, saw and conquered the world. The talent in the community is absolutely of the highest order and today you name any country and you will find KP community there trying to work towards development of their families and future generations and giving it back to them who gave them those opportunities,” said DK Bakshi.The foundation, formally launched on 22 October at an online event, was the first step.   trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("GEO_MAP", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"/m/0cqt90","geo":"US","time":"today 3-m"},{"keyword":"/m/012gx2","geo":"US","time":"today 3-m"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0cqt90,%2Fm%2F012gx2&hl=en-US&tz=-330","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"});  The GKPBF co-founders include Ash Raina from Brisbane, Australia, DK Bakshi from Thailand, Jyotsna Fotedar from Gurugram India, Ravi Kachroo from Bangalore India, Vinod K.

02-11-2020||India||Supreme Court to hear Arnab Goswami’s plea against show cause notice on Nov 6||The Supreme Court Monday said it would hear on November 6 a plea by journalist Arnab Goswami who has challenged the show cause notice by the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly for initiation of breach of privilege motion against him for reportage related to the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.The show cause notice has been issued to Goswami for making certain remarks against Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackrey in his news debates on Rajput’s case.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was informed by Goswami’s counsel that it cannot be construed as a breach of privilege and the Editor-in-Chief of Republic TV has now been called before the Assembly on November 5.“We have come to know that now privilege committee has been constituted. Notice has been issued on behalf of the speaker,” his counsel told the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.In its order, the bench said, “There is nothing wrong in summoning by the Assembly but if any action is taken by the privilege committee then you can challenge it.” “As prayed for, list the matter on November 6, 2020. In the meantime, the petitioner (Goswami) is directed to file requisite affidavit.” On September 30, the apex court had sought Maharashtra Assembly secretary’s response on Goswami’s plea.Goswami’s counsel had earlier told the bench that the journalist has not interfered with either the proceedings of any of the committees of the Assembly or the Assembly itself. Rajput, 34, was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. The CBI is probing the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-arnab-goswami-s-plea-against-show-cause-notice-on-nov-6/story-XJo9Xc6emXVhowPTjkmY4H.html
02-11-2020||India||10 states to go to by-polls on Tuesday; keen contest in MP, UP, Gujarat, Karnataka||Along with the second phase of polling in Bihar, voting for 56 other assembly seats across 10 states would also take place on Tuesday, a first electoral test for political parties in times of Covid-19. Although the ruling party in the state wins the by-polls majority of times, there is a keen contest on cards in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka and Manipur.Except for Madhya Pradesh, the outcome of by-poll will have no impact on the incumbent state governments. In MP, the BJP needs to win at least 8 of the 28 assembly seats to have a majority in the 230-member house. The Congress needs to win all seats to touch the magic figure of 115. Even though 63 seats were vacant, the Election Commission announced polls on 56 seats. These 7 vacant seats are in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam, and West Bengal, all of which are scheduled to get new Assemblies next year. The remaining two seats – in Manipur - would go to polls in November 7. Counting of votes for all by-polls would be on November 10 along with Bihar.Also read: Karnataka by-polls - BJP looks to wrest Sira, RR Nagar; Congress hopes for upset winsUttar PradeshStage is set for multi-corner contests in the by-elections to seven assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday with ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress candidates in fray. Elections will take place in Naugawan Sadat (Amroha), Bulandshahr, Tundla (Firozabad), Bangarmau (Unnao), Ghatampur (Kanpur), Deoria and Malhani (Jaunpur) seats. Polling will begin at 7 am and continue till 6 pm with strict enforcement of Covid-19 guidelines. Of the seven, six seats were held by the BJP and one by SP.GujaratBy-polls to eight Assembly seats in Gujarat will be held on November 3. The eight seats that will go to polls — Abdasa, Limdi, Morbi, Dhari, Gadhada (ST), Karjan, Dangs (ST) and Kaprada (ST) — fell vacant after Congress MLAs representing them quit the party before the Rajya Sabha elections in June, thus bringing down the strength of the party in the polls. The elections were necessitated by the resignation of Congress MLAs before June 2020 assembly elections, helping the saffron party win both the RS seats. In all the assembly seats, it is a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP. The Congress sees good performance in by-polls as seeds of revival before 2022 assembly elections and the BJP would like to cement its position in state politics by winning all the seats. The new Gujarat BJP chief, CR Patil, has set himself an ambitious goal of winning all 182 seats in the Assembly elections of 2022. While the BJP’s campaign has been largely around the national issues of the Ram temple at Ayodhya, the abrogation of Article 370, and attacks against the “sinking ship” of the Congress, the Congress has focused on the MLAs who were “bought over” by the BJP. The economic distress brought by the pandemic and the lockdown have not got much attention from either party.KarnatakaAll the three main parties in Karnataka – the BJP, the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) - have made it a prestige battle to win the Sira and Raja Rajeshwari (RR) Nagar, two assembly constituencies which go to polls. The Sira seat fell vacant after the sitting JDS MLA B Satyanarayana died due to Covid-19. The RR Nagar seat is witnessing by-polls as MLA Munirathna resigned and crossed over from the Congress to the BJP helping topple the JDS-Congress coalition government in the state. The fate of 31 candidates who are in contention for the two seats will be sealed on Tuesday.Also read: Uttar Pradesh bypolls on Tuesday, multi-corner contests to decide fate of 88 candidatesBoth the constituencies are Vokkaliga dominated. While the BJP, which has never won any of the two constituencies, is looking to break into new territory and expand its base, for the Congress this is the first poll the party is facing elections under new Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar who wants to prove a point. For the regional JDS, it is an existential question as any loss would diminish the party’s historic role as a key third pole in the state politics. The outcome of the polls though is unlikely to affect the power balance in the state as BJP enjoys a clear simple majority with 117 members in the 225 member assembly apart from the support of three independents.However, a win for BJP in Sira, where CM Yediyurappa’s son B Y Vijayendra is leading the party’s campaign, would help cement his position in the party.JharkhandOf the two by-polls in Jharkhand, all eyes are on Dumka from where chief minister Hemant Soren’s young brother Basant Soren is in fray against former minister and BJP leader Lious Marandi. The other constituency going to polls is Bermo from where sitting Congress legislator Rajendra Prasad Singh died of illness in May. Hemant Soren vacated Dumka assembly after registering victory from two seats and retained Barhait. There are 17 candidates in Dumka while 16 are in the fray in Bermo constituency. The contest is bipolar in both seats with the ruling JMM and Congress locked in a direct battle against the BJP candidates.ChhattisgarhIn Chhattishgarh’s Marwahi assembly constituency, Congress’s Krishan Kumar Dhruv and BJP‘s Gambir Singh are pitted against each other with no one from the Jogi clan in the fray for the first time in 20 years. The election was necessitated after Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) MLA and former chief minister Ajit Jogi passed away in May and his wife Richa Jogi’s nomination was rejected on technical grounds. The Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (Jogi) had extended support to BJP candidate alleging that the ruling Congress has insulted Ajit Jogi.Odisha More than 5 lakh voters would decide the fate of candidates in Balasore Sadar and Tirtol. By-poll to the Balasore Sadar and Tirtol constituencies was necessitated following the death of incumbent MLAs - Madan Mohan Dutta of BJP and Bishnu Das of BJD respectively. Though Congress is in the fray in both the constituencies, the fight in the two seats will be mainly between the BJP and the BJD. In both the seats, the sons of the sitting MLAs were chosen by their respective parties as candidates. In Balasore, Manas Dutta is the BJP candidate while in Tirtol, Bijay Shankar Das is the BJD candidate. Though the result of the seats is not going to have any bearing on the Naveen Patnaik government, the BJD has deployed over a dozen state ministers and 35 MLAs to win Balasore Sadar. HaryanaBharatiya Janata Party’s Yogeshwar Dutt, an Olympian, is trying his luck for the second time as he takes on Indu Raj Narwal of the Congress. Dutt lost by 19,000 votes to Congress’ Sri Krishan Hooda in 2019 state assembly election who died on April 12 this year. The Congress is hoping for a fourth straight win from this Jat dominated constituency riding on former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s popularity. A total of 14 candidates are contesting. Anant Ram, retired professor of political science at Bhiwani Government College said the by-poll would indicate whether chief minister Manohar Lal Khatter has been able to dent Hooda’s popularity in this Jat belt which Congress almost swept in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-states-to-go-to-by-polls-on-tuesday-keen-contest-in-mp-up-gujarat-karnataka/story-BK67h7zJsx4Ql2LUhE25TM.html

02-11-2020||India||‘There is going to be a lot of work for next year’||‘Razi’ and ‘Chhichhore’ actor Shishir Sharma feels that senior actors, particularly with underlying ailments, need to be very cautious while working during this pandemic. The actor recently completed his shoot for the film ‘Bagawat’, directed by Sanjiv Jaiswal, in Lucknow.Sharing his apprehensions before he started to shoot, “All required safety measures were there but you tend to worry when you shoot with so many people around. The production team too was taking extra care of me. Rest, you can’t force people to be careful but I wish all to understand that it’s not just about them — it’s about others as well! All are susceptible to the virus but as I’m a diabetic so the fear is twofold,” he said.Agreeing that we all need to get back to work, Shishir said, “How long can we sit at home? We’re aware that Covid is here to stay till we have a vaccine so only way is to work with precautions. I’m keeping my diabetes in check and take vitamins to boost immunity.”Post-lockdown he shot for a few advertisements and then ‘Bagawat’ was his first major project in the unlock phase. Next, he is going to shoot for an OTT original film in Kerala. “Then I’ll be back in Uttar Pradesh to shoot Sanjay Upadhyay’s directorial ‘Ek Masoom Sawal’ in Vrindavan and Mathura. Besides, I have completed the patch-work for the second season of ‘City of Dreams.’ Major portion of which was shot before lockdown.”Last winter, he had shot three short films in Singapore which will also release soon. “Now, people have started planning projects that have been stalled so I hope there is going to be a lot of work for next year.”Shishir was in Lucknow last year too. “I shot for ‘Ek Chhoti Se Guzaarish’ with Smita Jaykar in Lucknow and Kanpur for Pragyesh Singh and had attended a premiere of another film ‘Shinaakht’ that was shot in Mumbai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/there-is-going-to-be-a-lot-of-work-for-next-year/story-SOCbCmit0QniuOeIs3Xj5I.html
02-11-2020||India||Oil drops as Covid-19 lockdowns widen and US election looms||Oil prices fell‮‮‮ ‬‬‬on Monday on worries that widening coronavirus lockdowns in Europe would weaken fuel demand while concerns remain over potential turbulence resulting from this week’s US presidential election.Brent crude was down 80 cents, or 2.1%, at $37.14 a barrel by 1140 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate fell 93 cents, or 2.6%, to $34.86. Both contracts fell more than $2 earlier in the session. Countries across Europe have reimposed lockdown measures to try to slow Covid-19 infection rates that have accelerated over the past month. “The number of lockdowns - and the oil demand the countries that imposed them account for - will lead to some demand destruction, depressing balances and putting further strain on the already fragile market,” said Rystad Energy analyst Paola Rodriguez-Masiu.Global oil trading companies expect further demand destruction, though estimates differ. Vitol sees winter demand at 96 million barrels per day (bpd) while Trafigura expects demand to drop to 92 million bpd or lower.A tight race in the lead up to the US election on Tuesday and accompanying uncertainty also prompted investor caution in global markets.“The concerns over oil supply and demand fundamentals ... are going to play second fiddle to the US presidential election and to how risk markets will react to the outcome,” said BNP Paribas analyst Harry Tchilinguirian.Oil pared some losses after Japan’s export orders grew for the first time in two years and China’s factory activity rose to its highest in nearly a decade in October. More manufacturing surveys are expected from the euro zone and the United States later in the day.Sharply rising Libyan oil production also added to price pressures. Libya’s output stands at about 800,000 barrels per day (bpd), up more than 100,000 bpd from a few days ago, a Libyan source told Reuters on Saturday.Meanwhile, output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose for a fourth month in October, a Reuters survey found.OPEC and allies including Russia are cutting output by about 7.7 million bpd to support prices. This OPEC+ group is scheduled to hold a policy meeting on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, with some analysts expecting a postponement of plans to ramp up output by 2 million bpd from January.“A resolute and coordinated announcement and action by OPEC+ are what is really needed to prevent any further price slide,” said Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oil-drops-as-covid-19-lockdowns-widen-and-us-election-looms/story-PpUQUZKkHFdgTE16SxczMJ.html

The notice came on a petition filed by Indian Social Responsibility Network, a non-profit organisation.Through the notice, the NGT sought responses from the environment ministry, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Delhi Police Commissioner and governments of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan.The four states are severely impacted by air pollution ahead of the winter season. The situation is aggravated by dipping temperature, high number of vehicles on the road, industries and crop fires. The Centre has already put in place a pollution control mechanism under Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).News agency PTI reported that the petitioner sought action against pollution caused by the use of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) at a time when the air quality is unsatisfactory with potential of severity of the spread of Covid-19.Also Read| ‘Metro travel in Delhi should be regulated’: Home ministry after Covid-19 review meetingThe plea referred to the statements from Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain which said during the festive season, there will be a rise in coronavirus infections because of air pollution.“Increased pollution may further affect the vulnerable groups and increase the fatality rate. Covid-19 cases in Delhi may go up to 15,000 per day, as against the current cases of about 5,000 per day,” the plea claimed. It also stated that the use of green crackers is not a remedy.Delhi, for the past few days, has been witnessing a sharp spike in its daily Covid-19 tally with possibilities that the national capital might face a fresh wave of the coronavirus disease outbreak.Also Read: Delhi AQI continues to remain very poor, at 310 on MondayEarlier, the Delhi government published a list of more than 800 open spaces across the national capital where people will be allowed to burn “green” firecrackers between 8 pm and 10 pm on the day of Diwali.Meanwhile, the Union home ministry in its release attributed the recent rise in coronavirus cases in Delhi due to festive season and leniency shown by residents in following virus related restrictions.

02-11-2020||India||From BRICS to SCO: India, China leaders to have face time at 5 summits in November||November is shaping up as one of the busiest months of 2020 for the external affairs ministry in terms of virtual summits of groupings such as the SCO, the BRICS and the ASEAN, with leaders of India and China expected to be on the same online platform at five meetings.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping are expected to join the virtual summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on November 10, the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping on November 17, and the G20 during November 21-22.The leaders of India and China are also expected to be part of the East Asia Summit on November 11 and the SCO council of heads of government meeting on November 30, which will be hosted by New Delhi.The virtual SCO summit, to be hosted by Russia, will be the first time that PM Modi and Xi will join an online meeting since the border standoff in Ladakh emerged into the open in May. The two leaders had joined a virtual G20 summit in April this year to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic, which has disrupted most diplomatic engagements.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the external affairs ministry is making hectic preparations for all these summits and meetings, especially to push India’s efforts to have a greater role in the manufacturing and delivery of vaccines for Covid-19 and in shaping the post-pandemic world order by reforming multilateral bodies and creating more resilient and diverse supply and value chains.Also read: India could resume foreign secretary-level dialogue with Nepal. There is one conditionHowever, the people said the summits and meetings will not result in any substantive bilateral engagements as they are all being held virtually. “In such meetings, there is no scope for things such as pull asides or even bilateral conversations. Besides, some of these meetings will feature numerous leaders presenting their views within a limited time,” one person said.Russia, which is hosting the SCO and the BRICS summits, had made a push for holding both meetings in-person but wasn’t able to make much headway as leaders of several countries were reluctant to travel amid the continuing spread of Covid-19, the people said. Of all the upcoming meetings, the G20 Summit being hosted by Saudi Arabia is expected to play a key role in efforts to shape the post-pandemic world order and global economic recovery from the impact of Covid-19. The East Asia Summit is usually attended by prime ministers of India and China and will be followed by the ASEAN-India Summit.The people said Pakistan will be invited to attend the SCO council of heads of government meeting being hosted by India, though there is no clarity on who will represent Islamabad at the meet.Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said all countries had responded to the abnormal circumstances created by the pandemic with innovative responses and that even such “truncated and limited” diplomatic engagements were welcome. “It is good the leaders will have some face time though they may not have substantial bilateral discussions,” he said.“The meeting of Prime Minister Modi and President Xi on a virtual platform will have no impact on the situation in Ladakh and there will be continuum in terms of optics. Even a limited outcome is more desirable than none, though some of these meetings will be important in terms of the Covid-19 response and economic recovery,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-face-off-likely-during-at-least-5-upcoming-virtual-meetings/story-BcF8To5ETToblCwopn8PKK.html

02-11-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh busts major scam in paddy procurement process||A resident of Gulenda village of Jabalpur district Ajeet Rajak cultivated crop of green peas in his one acre land but his name was registered in a co-operative society to sell paddy crop in October, said an official of the agriculture department. Rajak is among more than 300 farmers in Jabalpur, whose names were fraudulently used by middlemen and businessmen to register online at co-operative society, the official said. Middlemen and businessmen impersonated farmers and registered themselves in the cooperative societies to sell paddy, which they purchased from different places at much lower rates. The scamsters made money selling the paddy to the government at the minimum support price (MSP) which was higher that their purchase price.The irregularities came to light during physical verification of farmers in Jabalpur after many of them had complained to the agriculture department that their names were being misused. . The farmers who grew some other crops on their farmlands, were found registered with societies to sell paddy. More than 300 such registrations of farmers were found fake in Jabalpur only in the past 10 days, said the official. Similar complaints were lodged in Hoshangabad, Harda, Sehore, Narsinghpur and Raisen districts too. Now, the state government has asked the administration in all the districts to carry on physical verification of all farmers, who registered themselves with different societies, before procurement of paddy crop. The administration has been also asked to file FIRs against persons, who are committing fraud, said Kamal Patel, minister of farmers welfare and agriculture department. Jabalpur district collector Karamver Sharma said, “An FIR has been registered against three people including a businessman Kamlesh Patel and manager of a cooperative society of Gulenda.” Sharma said, “The registration for sale of paddy crop took place from September 15 to October 15 and verification started on October 20. During physical verification, farmers were surprised to know that their names figured in the list with societies for sale of paddy crop. In the inquiry it was found that middlemen and businessmen accessed the names of farmers with the help of society members and registered themselves in their names. Some even registered in the name of people who had died a few years ago.” “In the inquiry it came to light that the middlemen and businessmen, purchased the crop from farmers, who need money for different purposes in urgency, before procurement of the state government at much lower rate of Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,400 per quintal. Later, they registered in the name of farmers, who didn’t cultivate paddy or in name of those people who sold their agriculture produce to them so that these traders and middlemen could sell the paddy to the state government at MSP of Rs 1,865 per quintal,” said the collector. Raisen collector Umashankar Bhargava said, “We have started an inquiry in which we have received complaints and we are also carrying on physical verification of all the farmers.” According to an officer, online registration of farmers from private kiosk paved the way for fraudsters. “Earlier, farmers used to go to co-operative societies and got themselves registered. So, there was no possibility of fraud but now the farmers get themselves registered through the kiosks of MP Online. The kiosk owner, middlemen and society members hatched a conspiracy in the registration,” said the officer. Bhartiya KIsan Union, MP general secretary Anil Yadav said, “The fraudsters are misusing online registration and the officers and cooperative society members are also a part of it. It is a major scam and happening in almost all the districts. If the state government does verification properly, thousands of registrations will be found fake.” Last year the state government had procured 2.6 million tonnes of paddy and this year the target is 4 million tonnes. More than 5 lakh farmers were registered for procurement of paddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-busts-major-scam-in-paddy-procurement-process/story-X12n0Frlx54QcVVxam4POJ.html

They said the enforcement officer, who is posted in Gurugram, has been booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 420 for fraud, 467 for forging document with purpose of cheating, 471 for using forged document as genuine and 120-B for criminal conspiracy.A senior CBI official privy to the investigation said the preliminary enquiry suggested that Ramesh Chand Meena got the forged ST certificate issued from sub-divisional magistrate of Hindaun, Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan in June 1983.He said the accused used the same certificate to get employment as a lower division clerk with EPFO in August 1985 and had been working as a central government employee since then.“As per the findings, the accused not only forged the documents to get employment but also deprived genuine ST candidates of their rights,” he said.“The inquiry suggested that the accused in connivance, with other state government officials of Rajasthan, procured the forged ST certificate and even mentioned his fake permanent address,” the official said.He said the alleged forgery came to light when the accused applied for changing his permanent address, stating that he is a resident of Mathura and does not hail from Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan.He said the inquiry further revealed that the accused’s son Nikhil, in his documents, had mentioned that they had migrated from Alwar, Rajasthan, which was contrary to the claim of the accused in his ST certificate that he hailed from Sawai Madhopur district.He said CBI was investigating the matter in detail and recovery of money earned from his job procured using forged means could be recommended if concrete evidence was found against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/address-change-request-trips-epfo-officer-who-forged-st-certificate-for-job-35-years-ago/story-lko8r9FJu8FxlVtZq2IrkN.html

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde dismissed Saritha Nair’s petition terming it ‘frivolous’.Nair was barred from contesting the parliamentary polls as she was convicted in the solar scam case in the southern state with a sentence of three years. Nair’s nomination papers were rejected by the returning officers under Section 8(3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 which prescribed for disqualification on account of conviction and sentencing in a criminal case. She later obtained a stay in the case, which, however, was not considered by the returning officers.Nair had moved the top court against the October 31, 2019, decision of Kerala High Court by which her election petitions challenging the Lok Sabha polls in Wayanad and Ernakulam also were dismissed. She had earlier approached the Kerala high court over the election officers’ move stopping her from contesting the elections.The high court had held that the stay was on the sentence and not on conviction and hence her plea was rejected. “It was clear from the relief sought in the appeal petition that Nair had only sought suspension of the sentence and not the suspension of conviction,” the court had said.Gandhi had won Kerala’s Wayanad seat -- the second seat he contested in the 2019 polls -- with a margin of 431,770 votes. He defeated runner up PP Suneer of the Communist Party of India, who secured 274,597 votes, while Gandhi got 706,367 votes.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-dismisses-frivolous-plea-challenging-rahul-gandhi-s-election-as-wayanad-mp/story-QqVUb1OP60OWOOVHhKTzjP.html
02-11-2020||India||Shivraj Singh Chouhan lists Kamal Nath’s sins, Congress leader says everything’s a lie||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday accused Congress leader Kamal Nath of withdrawing crucial schemes floated by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under his regime. Nath, the former chief minister, was quick to respond by saying that all the allegations were a lie.The squabbling between the two senior leaders comes ahead of the by-polls on 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday. Of them, 25 seats became vacant after the Congress MLAs left the party in March to join the BJP. This resulted in the fall of the Kamal Nath-led Congress government. BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan then became the chief minister.“Today, Kamal Nath has given advertisements in newspapers that ‘What sin did I commit?’ Kamal Nath ji, you have sinned, you snatched away laptops of children who brought good numbers in Class 12, stalled the development of the state. You have converted Madhya Pradesh into a market of brokers,” Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, according to news agency ANI.Watch: MP bypolls: ‘BJP leaders are saleable, voters aren’t’, says Kamal Nath“The Rs 5,000 we paid to the poor for funerals was snatched away. We used to help the elderly make pilgrimages, you ended that plan. How many sins can I count? You have destroyed Madhya Pradesh, it was your sin and you have to pay the same penalty,” Chouhan added. The chief minister was referring to the MP Funeral Assistance Scheme, which provided aided the poor registered labourers by providing money for last rites of their loved ones.A little later, Kamal Nath responded. “Every single thing is their lie. I wonder how they can lie so shamelessly,” the Congress leader said. “Shivraj Singh’s lies also exceeded limits. He had said that Kamal Nath is a sinner. When I asked what I sin did I commit, he said that Kamal Nath did not waive loans. While his government itself has said that the debt of 27 lakh farmers has been waived, the rest was going to be in the second-third instalment,” Nath pointed out.Read more: Kamal Nath vs Shivraj Chouhan over Class IV employees’ retirement ageOn November 1, Nath had accused the BJP dispensation in the state of reducing the retirement age of Class-IV government employees. In a tweet, Nath said the ruling BJP has brought down the age of retirement of Class-IV employees from 62 years to 60 years, prompting the BJP government to issue a clarification about it. Chief minister Chouhan had dubbed it as a “rumour”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-lists-kamal-nath-s-sins-congress-leader-says-everything-s-a-lie/story-4utc9yvz4Qx2vb5DoEYdEJ.html

While four of them travelling in a sport utility vehicle were burnt alive along with the vehicle, one more person from another car died while undergoing treatment at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Kadapa town. Two others, who were grievously injured are undergoing treatment in the hospital. All the deceased and injured are believed to be smugglers from Salem in Tamil Nadu, who were transporting red sanders from the forests of Bhakarapet to their state. Several logs of red sanders worth lakhs of rupees were also gutted in the fire in the cars. Kadapa superintendent of police K K N Anburajan told Hindustan Times that the incident happened at around 3.30 am at Gotur village near airport on Kadapa-Tadipatri road on the outskirts of the city. “Bhakarapet forests are known for smuggling of red sanders by people from Tamil Nadu and of late, we have intensified operations to prevent smuggling. We have kept ambush parties of police at two check posts on the road. The smugglers coming in two vehicles saw the police forces at one of the check posts and tried to take a detour on the airport road. We did not chase the vehicles, as we knew that they would definitely be caught at another check post,” the SP said. Both the cars were travelling at high speed and did not notice a truck coming out of a construction venture in the area. “They rammed into the diesel tank of the truck resulting in its explosion. Both the cars caught fire and were burnt completely,” he said. Four persons travelling in the first car could not come out and were charred to death, as flames engulfed the vehicle, while three others who were travelling in another car managed to escape with injuries. One of them died while undergoing treatment at the hospital,” Anburajan said. Police and fire service personnel rushed to the accident spot and doused the fire using two fire tenders. “We have registered a case and are investigating,” the SP said. Red sanders, a precious wood which is an endemic species confined only to the Seshachalam forests spread across Chittoor, Kadapa and parts of Nellore and Kurnool, has been the prime target of timber smugglers for several years. The wood fetches crores of rupees in the international market, particularly in China and Japan, where it is used for making cosmetic products, furniture, musical instruments and even drugs. One tonne of the wood costs Rs 20 lakh locally, but it fetches around Rs 1 crore in the international market. Because of its high value, timber smugglers from Tamil Nadu have been indulging in large scale cutting and smuggling of the wood and exporting the logs abroad. They are engaging trained wood cutters and transporting them through dense forests into the Tamil Nadu borders. The wood cutters risk their lives to enter forests and smuggle the red sanders, because they are paid around Rs 1 lakh per tonne towards labour charges. The Andhra Pradesh government has constituted a Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling Task Force (RSASTF) in 2014 to periodically conduct combing operations in the forest areas and check the smuggling of the wood. There have been frequent encounters between the task force and the smugglers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-alleged-red-sanders-smugglers-die-in-fiery-road-crash-in-andhra-s-kadapa/story-9izHs7wUlW5jRX9Ux7cLPK.html

A single bench of Justice V G Arun posted the matter for hearing on Friday and trial will be deferred till then. The counsel appearing for the victim told the court that she had to undergo “severe ordeal” of continuous cross- examination for nine days by many lawyers of the accused and they raised objectionable questions. Though the prosecution raised repeated objections, the trial court did not intervene to protect the victim and overruled its objections. At this point the public prosecutor said the judge was not ready to heed the objections raised by him also on several occasions. He also said that the sequence of events show the “trial was not proceeding in a fair and transparent manner.” The approach of the trial court judge in the case was “unheard of in a criminal case trial,” he said. In the transfer application, the victim stated that “she was aggrieved by the attitude of the trial court and though proceedings were in-camera a battery of lawyers were present when she was cross-examined”. When many witnesses turned hostile the prosecution had asked the court to cancel the bail of the eighth accused in the case, actor Dileep and it was also turned down by the court, the victim pointed out. In January, the Supreme Court had ordered the court to complete the trial in six months. But the lockdown induced by Covid-19 rendered that virtually impossible. In August, the Supreme Court gave another six months to the trial court. The attack on the 33-year-old woman took place in February 2017 in Kochi. She was allegedly abducted and assaulted by a gang led by Pulsar Suni, a history-sheeter, in a moving car. They set her free after three hours but threatened to circulate the video of assault if she approached the police. However, she filed a complaint the same day. Dileep was arrested five months later on charges of hiring a criminal gang to settle personal scores with her. He is the eighth accused in the case. Dileep was in judicial custody for 85 days before he was granted bail under strict provisions. Later he moved different petitions which the prosecution claimed was to delay the trial but it began in a court in Ernakulam last month. Earlier, his plea for a CBI probe was rejected by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-stays-trial-in-actor-s-abduction-case-till-nov-6/story-bRvXNH92dn8znhdJbauv3O.html

Top leaders of the BJP have alleged several times in the past that more than 100 party workers have been killed by goons backed by the ruling Trinamool Congress during Mamata Banerjee’s regime. The TMC, however, has rubbished the allegations. A 32-year-old man Bijoy Shil was found hanging from a tree at Kalyani in Nadia around 50 km north of Kolkata, on Sunday. While BJP alleged that Shil was an active party worker and was murdered by TMC goons, TMC claimed that Shil was a TMC worker, though not active, and had probably died by suicide. “Investigation is on. Some political parties are trying to politicize the issue and create problems. The family members, including the deceased’s wife, have told the media that the victim didn’t belong to any party,” said a senior police officer of Nadia district. In another incident on Sunday, the BJP alleged that a party worker was killed at Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas district. Following the alleged killings, BJP decided to gherao multiple police stations in Kolkata and in the adjoining districts. Senior BJP leaders including MPs led the protests at various places. The BJP which made impressive gains in the 2019 parliamentary election winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal is now eyeing a victory in the 2021 assembly election in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-tries-to-gherao-police-stations-in-kolkata-to-protest-alleged-murders-of-party-workers/story-VIyanyhMjZt9BvBQ2YrfYO.html
02-11-2020||India||India’s manufacturing PMI rises for 3rd straight month; output rises at quickest pace since October 2007||India’s manufacturing sector activity improved for the third straight month in October with companies raising output to the greatest extent in 13 years amid robust sales growth, a monthly survey said on Monday. The headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose from 56.8 in September to 58.9 in October, and pointed to the strongest improvement in the health of the sector in over a decade.In April, the index had slipped into contraction mode, after remaining in the growth territory for 32 consecutive months. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.“Levels of new orders and output at Indian manufacturers continued to recover from the Covid-19 induced contractions seen earlier in the year, with the PMI results for October highlighting historically-sharp monthly rates of expansion,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.Lima further noted that “companies were convinced that the resurgence in sales will be sustained in coming months, as indicated by a strong upturn in input buying amid restocking efforts”. Manufacturers indicated that the ongoing relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions, better market conditions and improved demand helped them to secure new work in October.On the employment front, the compliance of government guidelines related to the Covid-19 pandemic caused a further reduction in employment. The fall was the seventh in consecutive months. “There was disappointing news on the employment front though, with October seeing another reduction in payroll numbers. Survey participants that noted job shedding mentioned having observed containment measures to halt the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019,” Lima said. Inflationary pressures, meanwhile, remained subdued as seen by a modest increase in input costs and only marginal rise in selling prices. Meanwhile, hopes of an end to Covid-19 cases and the reopening of other sectors in the economy underpinned positive sentiment towards the year-ahead outlook for production. The level of confidence was at a 50-month high. “Also, confidence towards the year-ahead outlook for production improved as firms hoped that fewer Covid-19 cases and the reopening of other businesses could boost output growth,” Lima noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-manufacturing-pmi-rises-for-3rd-straight-month-output-rises-at-quickest-pace-since-october-2007/story-gEmAFu5PVonIUOHHTBonWI.html

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde questioned the poll body over its decision. “Where does EC have the power to determine who will be the leader of a party under Section 77 of Representation of People Act?” the bench asked.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Nath, said that an advisory was issued by the commission on October 26 following which the October 30 order came citing a complaint against the Congress leader over his October 13 speech, Sibal said the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister was not heard on the issue.The order against Nath concerned two comments. He made a comment against chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan on October 13 and then on October 18, Nath had said at a rally in Gwalior that the Congress candidate was a simple man, unlike his opponent who is an ‘item’. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded Imarti Devi from the Darba seat in Gwalior in the bye-elections. The election regulatory body was represented by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi who said that the matter had become infructuous as elections are due tomorrow and campaigning has ended.“We are staying your order as you have no power to pass this order,” the bench said. The court directed EC to file its response to Nath’s petition that had argued that the selection of star campaigner under Section 77(1) of RP Act was the sole prerogative of the political party.Responding to the apex court’s stay, the Commission said, “Hon’ble Supreme Court is supreme. EC has been given an opportunity to file a reply in the matter, which shall be filed at the earliest.”Congress had submitted a list of 28 star campaigners to the Election Commission for MP bye-elections on October 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-election-commission-s-order-revoking-kamal-nath-s-star-campaigner-status-in-madhya-pradesh-by-polls/story-M8zCHCUdJ85s1jdAFCaToO.html

02-11-2020||India||Covid-19 warriors, survivors wield pen as pandemic inspires fiction||Dr Maheshwar Prasad Chaurasia always wanted to write a novel. In May, he attended a webinar on how to write and publish a book. At the workshop, his writing instructor suggested that he start his journey as an author with a non-fictional work. He decided to write a book on Delhi’s fight against the coronavirus disease pandemic. Dr Chaurasia was qualified to do so —as additional superintendent at Delhi’s government’s Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital, he was part of the core team that set up the city’s first quarantine centres, isolation wards and testing facilities in the initial months of the pandemic. “Those were the early days of the pandemic and we did not know much about the virus. Doctors and officials went sleepless for days as they fought the pandemic. People were in a panic and were asking so many questions. My book is about how the doctors and the administration fought the pandemic in its initial months,” says Chaurasia , whose book -- Just Switch Off Corona -- was released last month. Chaurasia is not the only writer to have been inspired by the pandemic. Hundreds of books with titles such as Corona: A Checkmate; Murder in the Time of Corona; The Corona Wars; Corona Kiss; The Pandemic Plot; My Pandemic Experience, have been published in the past couple of months. Interestingly, a majority of these books -- poetry, fiction, non-fiction in English, Hindi, Tamil and many other Indian languages -- are by first- time writers and have been brought out by self- publishing companies. The writers of these books include doctors, information technology (IT) professionals, teachers, most of whom seem to have drawn from their own experiences and understanding of the pandemic. Dr Kumar Shyam, who lives in Hapur, a town in the National Capital Region, about 70 km from Delhi, last month published The Pandemic Plot, a novel that he says draws from the conspiracy theories surrounding the origin and nature of the coronavirus. The book that moves from Wuhan in China to Italy is the story of an international medical team comprising scientists from many countries, including India, who go on a mission to find the answers to some of the trickiest questions about the origin and spread of the virus. His slim page-turner about this global quest ends with the conclusion that researchers at a Wuhan lab get infected and die and the virus spreads into the rest of the world. “The governments and health systems around the world did not know what had hit them and there are so many conspiracy theories surrounding the origin and spread of the virus. l thought all of this made for a novel. I used many real incidents to connect the dots, ” says Dr Shyam, a general surgeon, who owns a 100-bed hospital in Hapur.“Being a doctor helped me write about virology with authenticity,” says the doctor, who wrote the book every night in his personal library that boasts 3,000 books. Rahul Bhardwaj, managing director at Yash Publications, which published The Pandemic Plot, says the book is a hit, having sold over 3,000 copies in hardback and paperback since its release last month. “We have got 30 proposals for books on Corona and have already published three. Four more will be published next month,” Bhardwaj adds. Notion Press, one of the country’s biggest self- publishing companies has brought out as many as 40 titles on the coronavirus, both fiction and non-fiction in English, Hindi and Tamil. Some of the titles published by it include Born in Lockdown, Pandemic Spell, Murder in the Time of Corona, Why and How China developed the Coronavirus. Interestingly, Naveen Valsakumar, co-founder and CEO of Notion Press, says that one of the reasons why there are so many coronavirus-related books on his company’s platform is that a lot of the writers are young and tech-savvy, who studied Google Trends and realised that there was a lot of curiosity about the pandemic. “So, they decided to write books based on those trending searches. We made it clear to all writers that we will not publish any book offering unvalidated medical advice on Corona. For many people, writing about the pandemic has been a cathartic experience,” says Valsakumar. Love and romance are among the most popular genres among those writing on the coronavirus. Sample some of the titles in the category: Corona Kiss, Cupid Covid; Love in the Time of Corona Virus, A Second Chance with Love in Corona. In fact, there are dozens of books titled Love in the Time of Corona. A lot of these stories involve young doctors whose lives are torn apart as they fight the virus. “Lockdown had a deep impact on relationships and that is the subject of my two Corona books” says Kawalpreet Kaur, a 26-year-old teacher. Her first book, Love in the Time of Corona Virus, and its sequel, The Dark 21 Days, feature the stories of two youngsters who battle not just caste, and but also Covid-19 in a hospital in Italy. Sayed Arshad, founder of Blue Rose Publishers says the reason why most books have been published by self- publishing companies is their ability to bring out a book fast, something many of the writers want. “Normally it takes about seven months to bring out a book, most self- publishing companies take three weeks flat,” he said. After English, the maximum number of books on the coronavirus are in Hindi, and with some curious tiles: Namaste Corona ; Corona se Atmagyan ( Enlightenment through Corona) ; Akash Me Corona Ghana Hai ( The Sky is eclipsed by dense Corona) ; Corona Ek Safar ( Corona, a journey) . Rounak Rai, an art teacher and author of Corona se Atmagyan, a collection of 33 poems accompanied by his drawings, says he wrote the book during the lockdown. “Corona brought out the best and the worst in human beings. My book captures the pain, the suffering and what this pandemic taught us about ourselves and about others,” said Rai. “ But one of the unintended benefits of the pandemic is the fact that it encouraged people to look within and become writers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-warriors-survivors-wield-pen-as-pandemic-inspires-fiction/story-Ry8ArMSlW0Eypv6FJMhEkP.html

They have also refused to visit any government office to interact with the administration. “This time our delegation will not go anywhere to hold talks with the government. If the government wants to talk, they can come and meet us here on the railway track,” a protestor was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.A large number of Gujjars in the Peelupura village of the district had on Sunday launched their agitation by blocking railway tracks. Officials said the protest turned violent after some agitators damaged the Mumbai-Delhi railway tracks passing through Peelupura. They later uprooted the fish plate of the Mumbai-Delhi tracks and some blocked the Bayana-Hindaun route, the officials added. The tracks were cleared after some time.Bharatpur district collector Nathmal Deedal said that state minister Ashok Chandna met Gujjar leader Kirorilal Bainsla in Peelupura where they held a round of “positive talks.” “Yesterday also we had a meeting with one faction of the Gujjar community who were satisfied with the assurances of the state government,” Deedal said on Sunday.Gujjar leader Vijay Bainsla, however, said that they had not spoken with anyone. “The youth are not getting employment. There is anger among them. Our movement will continue. We have spoken to Gehlot Ji, but nothing has happened so far,” he told ANI. “We have not spoken to anyone. Youth is unemployed, 25,000 jobs are stuck and nobody is talking about it. This protest will continue until our demands are not fulfilled,” Bainsla added.“We have spoken to Gehlot Ji four times in the past but nothing materialised. It’s been two years, how much patience do they demand from us?” Bainsla asked.Due to the protest, railway traffic was also halted on the Delhi-Mumbai line passing through the Kota division following which at least 450 personnel of the railway police force (RPF) and government railway police were deployed in Kota railway division, officials said. Alert was also sounded across all the stations of the division.Officials have said that an extra police force will be also sent to the Gujjar-dominated areas in districts across eastern Rajasthan, especially in Bharatpur and Karauli. “We are monitoring the situation from the headquarters,” Saurabh Srivastava, additional director general of police, law and order, had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-can-meet-us-on-rail-tracks-gujjars-continue-quota-protest-in-rajasthan/story-ihkiqKiVT5rOm9ih7xpAFN.html

The accused identified as Sudip Syama Chakrabarty hails from Jharkhand. The complainant said he could not recollect the country Chakrabarty claimed he is based in.According to the police, a Raigad -based government servant’s 18-year-old daughter wanted to take admission in a medical college for MBBS studies. Though she had appeared for the NEET exam but was unable to secure a seat due to low marks.“Meanwhile her father came in a contact with the accused who promised him that he has good contacts in reputed colleges and asked him to meet him at Vile Parle. The complainant reached the meeting place where Sudip demanded that he pay him Rs 30 lakh as a token amount so that the process could be initiated,” an officer from Airport police station said. “The accused on many occasions took money from him by giving him various reasons and by the end of September he had taken Rs 61.25 lakh from him but kept on delaying the work,” the officer said. The officer said the girl’s father finally discovered on the internet that the person was a conman and had been arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir police in December 2019.“The complainant later searched his name on the internet where he found one article in which a similar name was shown as a fraud. He found a Jammu and Kashmir police case on the internet where the J & K crime branch arrested him for cheating many students to the tune of Rs 1 crore in the name of admission in medical college. After he found himself cheated, he approached the Airport police station and filed a complaint against him,” officer added. Following his complaint police registered a case under section 419 (Punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120 (B) [Punishment of criminal conspiracy], and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 66 (C) [punishment for identity theft], and 66 (D) [Punishment for cheating by personation by using computer resource] of Information Technology act. During investigation police found Sudip’s location in Versova and a team from Airport police laid a trap and arrested him. He was produced before the court which remanded him in police custody till November 2. Police are looking for two accomplices of the accused. “Sudip is a history sheeter and there are more than eight cases of cheating registered against him at Goregaon, Oshiwara, Bangurnagar, Kothrud (Pune), Hanehalli (Karnataka), Jammu and Kashmir crime branch,” a police officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-claiming-to-be-nri-cons-mbbs-aspirant-s-father-of-rs-61-lakh-nabbed-in-mumbai/story-S85Z3JidWmjldNJdlobV1O.html
02-11-2020||India||Maharashtra: 19 new species, records discovered in 2019; 2 from Aarey Forest||One new species and a record has been documented from Mumbai’s recently designated forest area at Aarey Colony in Goregaon, while 17 new species and records have been identified from Maharashtra last year, according to Animal Discoveries 2019 annual report, which has been compiled by the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) under the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. On an average, Maharashtra has been recording 20 new species and records annually, according to ZSI, mostly from the Western Ghats range or across isolated forest patches along the Konkan coast, including Mumbai.In October, new floral and faunal species were discovered, including damselflies, colourful freshwater fish (Schistura), new record of a golden-backed frog from Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, and a plant species, Echinops sahyadricus, from the Western Ghats.New species of geckos, frogs, spiders, and new records of insects and crabs were the highlights for Maharashtra last year. “Researchers from Maharashtra have been working hard and the state has been annually recording over 15 new species or records, which shows the abundant biodiversity in the state,” said Kailash Chandra, director, ZSI.Overall, 368 faunal species were discovered and 116 new records from India. Of these 155 species alone were recorded from the Western Ghats in 2019.From Aarey Colony, where 328.9 hectares (ha) was declared as reserved forest by the Maharashtra government in October, a new species of jumping spider was discovered last year identified as Jerzego sunillimaye. This was the first ever species of this genus Jerzego, whose taxonomic details, mating behaviour, and egg development were documented. However, this was the fourth species under this genus in the world and second from India. The species was named to honour Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife east), Maharashtra. The ZSI report also showed a new record from Aarey of an insect species (heptacarus neotropicus) originally described from France and recorded in the area last year.“The recent designation of Aarey as a forest is important as the commitment made to ensure the natural vegetation of any area remains protected automatically. It develops a network for the safety of the area’s biodiversity and livelihood. We expect more discoveries from these green lungs in the coming years,” said Chandra.State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said, “It is undoubtedly exciting that even this year, as we think we know everything about our environment, and we deal with a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, we have so many species being newly described. These findings only tell us how less we still know about our own planet and nature. The good news is that the present Maharashtra government is pro-environment, working on sustainable development and we are committed to the cause.”Thackery’s brother Tejas along with researchers, A Khandekar and Ishan Agarwal, discovered the Amba dwarf gecko (Cnemaspis amba) from Kolhapur district last year.The same researchers also discovered a Koyna dwarf gecko (Cnemaspis koynaensis) in Satara district.Other geckos discovered last year include Chikhaldara brookiish gecko (Hemidactylus chikhaldaraensis) near Gawligarh Fort in Amravati district and the Giri’s brookiish gecko or the Amboli brookiish gecko (Hemidactylus varadgirii) from Amboli in Sindhudurg district named after veteran herpetologist Varad Giri.“The trend shows many new species are getting described every year and this indicates we still have to discover the diversity. New species described from Maharashtra and Mumbai highlights the importance of this landscape as many of these species are only known from a few localities and nowhere else in the world. The protection of these species means conservation of these landscapes and vital resources which we humans need,” said Giri.The information about the species and their habitats are essential to design a strong conservation management plan, he added.Striking discoveries from Maharashtra Western Ghats in 2019Some striking discoveries from the Western Ghats last year included a new species of cricket frog from the northern Western Ghats in Maharashtra called Fejervarya Marathi, or the Marathi Fejervarya frog, named after the official language of the state, where the frog is found. The research was conducted by Savitribai Phule Pune University and ZSI. Other species discovered included Channa rara -- a new species of snakehead fish --- from the Jagbudi river near Khopi village in Khed taluka in Ratnagiri district. A new species of damselfly, Sindhudurg marsh dart (Ceriagrion chromothorax), was discovered as an endemic species of Western Ghats by Mumbai-based researchers. Damselflies are similar to dragonflies. They are small soft-bodied insects and have three pairs of long legs, and very large eyes. “These discoveries are testimony to the fact that it is essential to protect the Western Ghats not only for its rich biodiversity but as a critical source of water. The government should not give away more areas in the Western Ghats to industries and mining,” said Romulus Whitaker, veteran herpetologist and wildlife conservationist.New records from the state in 2019Several new records included insect species originally recorded from different parts of the world and new records identified in various districts of Maharashtra.These included:* An insect species (gymnodamaeus glaber) was recorded from Majiwara Thane, Ratnagiri Fort, Sinhagad Fort in Pune, and Tumsar village in Bhandara district. It was earlier known from Europe.* A crab species (pea crab) Arcotheres pernicola was reported for the first time from India based on a collection from Alibag in Raigad district. It was earlier known from the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Djibouti.* A fish species (notopthiracarus pavidus pavidus) recorded from Aurangabad district in Maharashtra. Originally, it was known from Greece(Source: Zoological Survey of India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-19-new-species-records-discovered-in-2019-2-from-aarey-forest/story-W7G7MdpKoaPCIAvnTfeIOI.html

The FIR was lodged on a complaint submitted to the state’s director general of police, Vivek Johri by director (security), MP state assembly JK Sharma after the alleged threat to the protem Speaker on his social media account when he posted a text on Sunday opposing the protest held in Bhopal on Thursday against French President Emmanuel Macron’s stand on a row over cartoons of Prophet Mohammed in that country.The accused include A Khan, Muhammed Kaleem and Javed Akhtar whose addresses are not known and one unidentified person, the police said.The complaint lodged by JK Sharma states, “Recently there was a demonstration by certain people in Bhopal against France in respect with which the protem Speaker wrote in social media that instead of creating an atmosphere of fear here while showing fundamentalism the protesters should have organised their protest in France as the issue is related to France. On this, some people threatened the protem Speaker with dire consequences while commenting that he would meet the same fate that Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Kamlesh Tiwari had met.” The state assembly officer demanded action against the accused and adequate security to the protem Speaker in view of threat to his life. DGP Johri could not be reached for his comments. He did not respond to phone calls and text messages in this regard. Rameshwar Sharma said, “I received the threat on social media and the state assembly staff has submitted a complaint to the director general of police.” Additional superintendent of police, crime branch, Gopal Dhakad said, “An FIR has been lodged. Now, we will look into the IP addresses of the accused who posted the comments and track them down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-protem-speaker-threatened-online-for-opposing-protest-on-french-cartoons/story-EdBP1xJ2wSsLxDS16QyFML.html

November also started with very low minimum temperature suggesting colder days ahead.“The western disturbance didn’t impact the plains. But it brought snowfall to Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) and higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh. So, there are cold winds. Also, the sky is cloud free and at night winds are calm so the heat radiates back at night making the mornings cold,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.North-east India is likely to receive heavy rainfall. A low-pressure area was lying over north-east and adjoining east central Bay of Bengal on Sunday. The system is likely to move towards the Bangladesh coast during the next 48 hours. Under its influence, fairly widespread rainfall activity is very likely over Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Meghalaya; scattered rainfall activity is likely over Assam during the next two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-mercury-again-dips-to-5-degree-c-below-normal/story-qKc2f4NROuKHFlIYBOc2ZJ.html

02-11-2020||India||Govt working on another stimulus package: Finance secretary||Finance secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey on Sunday hinted that the government is working on another stimulus package but he refrained from giving a timeframe.“We keep monitoring the situation on the ground to assess which sector of the economy or segment of the population needs what kind of help at which time and respond accordingly. We keep taking suggestions from industry bodies, trade associations, various ministries and after going through their suggestions and requirements of the economy, we come out with timely measures,” Ajay Bhushan Pandey said in an exclusive interview to ANI.Pandey said that he could not give a timeframe for the stimulus package, but yes the government was on it and deliberations on further interventions were on.Talking about the current state of the economy, Pandey said that the economy was recovering and moving towards sustained growth.The October GST collection has been Rs 105,155 crore which is 10 per cent higher year-on-year for the corresponding month last year. This September, the economy had also shown 4 per cent growth at Rs 95,480 crore in GST collections y-o-y. Further, the country has seen a growth in electricity consumption, exports, and imports, he said.“September and October data shows that we have reached Pre-COVID-19 level and gone into positive territory. If we compare with the last year, the E-Way bill in September has seen year on year growth of 10 per cent and in October it has seen a growth of 21 per cent,” he said.“If we are able to maintain this growth for the next five months, then we can say that we can transition from deep negative zone to near-zero growth zone by March 2021. International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected India’s GDP to contract 10.3 per cent this fiscal year, revised from its forecast of a 4.5 per cent decline in June,” he added.The Reserve Bank of India had last month said that the economy is likely to contract by 9.5 per cent in the current fiscal. GDP contracted 23.9 per cent in the first quarter of the fiscal, as per the estimates of the Central Statistics Office (CSO).The Finance Secretary said the government has started electronic invoices from October 1. On an average 8 lakh invoices were being generated daily. It picked up quickly and on October 30, in a single day 29 lakh electronic invoices were generated. “If we see the growth of the FMCG, auto sectors, it shows that we are going in the direction of sustained growth,” he said.Pandey said, “We are analysing every sector and this is a continuous process. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, we have been continuously monitoring every sector. Whatever was required for helping migrants, vulnerable sections of the rural or urban populations, we did. When the nation was in lockdown, we gave cash to women Jan Dhan account holders in their bank accounts through DBT. We provided early instalments to farmers under PM Kisan Yojana.”“We helped employees and employers in their EPF contribution. We earmarked Rs 3 lakh crore for enhanced working capital to MSMEs, out of which Rs 2 lakh crore has been sanctioned and amounts are being disbursed. MSMEs were also given the benefits of loan moratorium. We have given income tax refunds of Rs 1.27 lakh crores in last seven months. We have given GST refunds of Rs 70,000 crore,” he added.He said that a total refund of Rs 2 lakh crore has been given in the last seven months. During this period, revenue collections were impacted but the government did not stop or slow down the refunds.Ruling out the possibility of any cut in GST rates in near future during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said that there is the wrong impression that rate cut boosts sales and growth.“One may see the example of mobile phones. Mobile phones are attracting an 18 per cent GST rate from April 1, 2020, up from the earlier rate of 12 per cent, after the GST Council corrected the inverted duty structure. Now see the current sales figures for mobile phones. Despite the increased tax rate, their sales are up,” he said.“Frequent tinkering with the tax rates is not good for the economy. It also sends wrong signals to domestic industry and international investors. We have to provide stability and predictability in our tax systems,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-working-on-another-stimulus-package-finance-secretary/story-QAyRp1Bn6LH7Sk7xrXw9YP.html

I hope that the court will consider my demands as mentioned in the affidavit. Our demand is that the chief minister promised a job to one family member but nothing has been done so far. The other is that the family should be provided with a permanent accommodation in Delhi as Hathras is influenced by upper caste and the family is Dalit,” Kushwaha told ANI.She said that the demand for protection to the family has been fulfilled while adding that officials related to the case should be terminated.Kushwaha said that post-mortem has confirmed that the victim was raped. The 19-year-old had succumbed to her injuries at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on September 29 after being assaulted and allegedly gang-raped in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras on September 14.On October 12, the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court has said that the decision of cremating the Hathras victim’s body in the night is an “infringement” of her human rights.The Supreme Court, on October 27, directed that the Allahabad High Court will monitor the probe, being conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), into the case related to the alleged gang-rape and subsequent death of a Dalit girl in Hathras.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, which was hearing a plea seeking to transfer the trial in the case from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi, said that the same will be decided at a later stage.The bench said that all aspects of the Hathras case, including security to the victim’s family and witnesses, will be looked after by the Allahabad High Court.

02-11-2020||India||Green piece: States need to fight bad air menace together||Are relations among different state governments in India failing? We’re behaving as if we are a territorial union, not a country where every citizen matters. State governments are not treating air pollution as India’s top enemy. We haven’t heard from West Bengal, or Bihar and Delhi can’t find common ground with Punjab and Haryana. As a consequence, India’s economy will suffer even more. We know Covid-19 is worsened on account of air pollution. I was reading a piece where an Assistant Professor at the Georgia State University is quoted as saying if air pollution was low, then it’s possible to re-open and help the economy recover. But in places like Delhi, we can’t imagine this. The pollution might have contributed to a spike in Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, using 17 years’ data, Harvard and other medical schools found a link between air pollution and dementia. Are people from the Indo-Gangetic plain-the world’s most polluted region- in danger of Alzheimer’s? Finally, the State of the Air 2020 report says strokes can be triggered by exposure to PM 2.5.Commissions aside, policy makers must put into place tougher policies. From private vehicles to public transport, to improved standards for coal-based thermal power plants, to construction and waste-the possible solutions are on the table. India’s GDP has shrunk after Covid-19. We can’t afford to lose our human resources next. But we don’t have much time --even the best policies will take time to bear results. India can’t afford a brain drain but not acting on air pollution is going to do just that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-piece-states-need-to-fight-bad-air-menace-together/story-3LDW5Di1bouSxKYdPCUPkN.html
02-11-2020||India||Lockdown govt’s self-goal: Subhash Chandra Garg||A premature hard lockdown imposed across the country to curb the Covid-19 pandemic was responsible for India’s economic plunge, according to former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg, who claimed that he opted for voluntary retirement after being shunted out by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman because of a personality clash.“There is a lot of cynicism presently about India’s ability to become even a $5 trillion economy anytime soon. This is largely because of government taking the eye off the ball of economic growth and making a big self-goal by imposing the world’s most stringent lockdown in the entire country at a time when the virus was not present in more than 1% of India,” Garg wrote in his latest blog. The Indian economy shrank by a record 23.9% in the three months ended June mainly because of a 68-day hard lockdown enforced on March 25 that shut down factories and business establishments, closed down public transport, caused an exodus of millions of migrant workers.from the cities back to their homes in the countryside and confined citizens indoors.Garg wrote in the blog he was transferred from the finance ministry because of Sitharaman. “It became quite apparent very early that working with her [Sitharaman] was going to be quite difficult and it might not be conducive to undertaking necessary reforms for the attainment of the objective of building a $10 trillion economy of India,” he wrote. He said that the new finance minister who took the charge of the ministry after the 2019 general elections had a “very different personality, knowledge endowment, skill-set and approach for economic policy issues and also for the officers working with her” in comparison to former finance minister Arun Jaitley.Garg was shifted out of the finance ministry less than a month after the first budget presented by Sitharaman in July 2019 after the re-election of the Narendra Modi government. He alleged that the new finance minister got him transferred out of North Block to the power ministry that compelled him to opt for voluntary retirement.Explaining the reason for taking voluntary retirement , Garg wrote: “...quite frankly... I did not share a good and productive working relationship with the new Finance Minister [Sitharaman] and I did not want to work anywhere outside the Ministry of Finance”.“It was the best of the time personally and professionally to work with Shri Arun Jaitley,” Garg wrote.Drawing a comparison between his two bosses, he wrote: “Shri Arun Jaitley, with whom I spent most of my time in the Ministry of Finance, was a mastermind with an uncanny ability to sift through massive amounts of information and government files to discover the pith and substance of the public policy issue involved. He also had right temperament and ability to forge consensus.”“By devising the most acceptable solutions and then engendering wider acceptance for the same, Shri Jaitley was able to get solutions for most divisive and intractable solutions accepted by all. The GST [Goods and Services tax] reforms are a case in point,” he wrote, pointing to the recent disagreement over between the Centre and some states ruled by opposition parties over the issue of compensation for a shortfall in revenue from the indirect tax this financial year. The former civil servant said the late former finance minister was not a micro-manager. “Shri Jaitley focused on broader policy issues. He left the running of the departments and implementation of policies to the Secretaries.... He made the Secretaries present the policy proposals to the Prime Minister’s Office as well as to the media and the public. He was a very magnanimous and broadminded person,” he wrote. Garg said he did not share a productive working relationship with Sitharaman, who had “some pre-conceived notions” about him. The ministry of finance did not respond to Garg’s blog, but two officials working under Sitharaman said, requesting anonymity, that secretaries had been transferred in a routine exercise, which is a prerogative of the government. “More than a dozen of secretaries have worked under Sitharaman in various ministries, including ministries of defence, commerce and corporate affairs. Even in the finance ministry, there are five secretaries. It, therefore, appears it was mainly Garg’s own personality issue,” one of them said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-govt-s-self-goal-subhash-chandra-garg/story-XFMSocw5k2MRbPYZzix0PK.html
02-11-2020||India||Haryana planning law on interfaith marriages||Haryana is exploring the need for a law against interfaith relationships involving Hindu women and Muslim men in the wake of a stalker shooting dead a 21-year-old woman outside her college in Faridabad last week, the state’s home minister said on Sunday. The comment by Anil Vij, also a senior member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came a day after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath promised to bring a law to regulate such relationships. “Haryana is thinking of bringing a law against love jihad,” tweeted Vij. Love jihad is a term used by Hindu activists to describe relationships between Hindu women and Muslim men. Vij said the state government was very concerned after a 20-year-old final-year-commerce student, Nikita Tomar, was shot dead last Monday by her stalker, Touseef Ahmad, after a botched abduction attempt outside her college in Ballabhgarh. Images of the two suspects — Ahmad and his friend Rehaan -- were caught in CCTV footage and the duo was arrested from Nuh a day later amid widespread protests. Ahmad and Rehaan arrived in a Hyundai i20 and tried to force Tomar into the car as she came out of Aggarwal College after writing an exam, police said. “In the Faridabad case also the family members of the deceased have alleged that the accused had mounted pressure for religious conversion. This is not acceptable and therefore we will have to think about it,” Vij said in a tweet. Vij said “love jihad attempts” were being made across the country. “We will discuss this issue with all the political parties as well as people as the issue requires a detailed discussion on various points after which a decision will be taken,” he said. Vij said a special investigation team set up to investigate the murder will also probe if there were attempts at religious conversion and if a conspiracy was afoot on “love jihad” in Haryana. Interfaith relationships have become a hot-button issue in several states, where Hindu activists allege that Muslim men “lure” gullible women for conversion. Many experts reject these allegations and say that adult men and women are free to convert under the constitutional right to freedom of religion. In February, the central government told Parliament that there was no definition of the term and no such cases were reported by agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-planning-law-on-interfaith-marriages/story-hmuMeFG8vlZRZkTzYLBdkL.html
02-11-2020||India||J&K govt move: Land deals under Roshni Act void||The Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to annul all land dealings under the Roshni Act, three weeks after the Jammu and Kashmir high court declared it unconstitutional and unsustainable. The principal secretary, revenue, was on Saturday asked to retrieve all such land and remove encroachments within six months. The Jammu and Kashmir State Lands (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act was enacted in 2001 with the twin objective of generating resources for financing power projects and conferment of proprietary rights to the occupants of the state land. The scheme initially envisaged conferment of proprietary rights of about 20.55 lakh kanals to the occupants of which only 15.85% land was approved for vesting of ownership rights. Against the anticipated revenue from such occupants, the revenue actually generated was meagre. Besides, there were allegations of the legislation being misused by influential persons, leading to its being challenged before the high court. “It is hereby ordered that the principal secretary to government, revenue department, shall pass an order declaring all actions taken under the Jammu and Kashmir State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001, as amended from time to time, and rules made there under as void ab-initio,” stated an order issued by the Jammu and Kashmir department of law, justice and parliamentary affairs, with the lieutenant governor’s approval. “The principal secretary, revenue, shall work out a plan to retrieve large tracts of state land in a time-bound manner and work out modalities to evict encroachers from such state land within six months besides planning the handling of money received for these lands after annulment,” an official spokesman said in the statement. The spokesman said that the principal secretary, revenue, shall ensure information regarding district-wise state land as on January 1, 2001, are compiled and posted on the official website and the NIC website with details of the state land that was in illegal and unauthorised occupation of person(s)/entities with full identity of encroachers and particulars of the land. He said that complete identities of all influential persons, including ministers, legislators, bureaucrats, government officials, police officers, businessmen, their relatives or persons holding benami for them, who have derived benefit under the Roshni Act, 2001, or Roshni Rules, 2007, will be revealed. “The action shall be completed within a month,” the spokesman said.The Jammu and Kashmir State Lands (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, popularly known as the Roshni Act, was implemented in 2001 by the then J&K chief minister and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-govt-move-land-deals-under-roshni-act-void/story-Xt0aFrQzVHxU1dSNTMDajO.html
02-11-2020||India||India rejects Pak’s province status for Gilgit-Baltistan||India on Sunday rejected the Pakistan government’s decision to give “provisional provincial status” to Gilgit-Baltistan, saying Islamabad has no locus standi on Indian territory under its illegal and forcible occupation. New Delhi’s response came hours after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced the decision during a visit to Gilgit-Baltistan, giving another twist to the controversy over the region claimed by India as part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. While addressing a gathering in Gilgit to mark the so-called “independence day” of Gilgit-Baltistan, Khan also accused the Indian government of trying to foment unrest in Pakistan and creating a divide between the Shia and Sunni communities. “I want to greet the people of Gilgit-Baltistan today because we have decided that Gilgit-Baltistan will be given provisional provincial status, which was their demand for long,” Khan said, speaking in Urdu. “We have made this decision while keeping in mind the UN Security Council resolutions. We made the decision in between the UN Security Council resolutions,” he said. He did not give further details or say when Gilgit-Baltistan would become Pakistan’s fifth province. Khan also said his government had a development package in mind for the region but that he couldn’t announce details because of polls to be held on November 15. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava responded to the announcement by saying: “The government of India firmly rejects the attempt by Pakistan to bring material changes to a part of Indian territory under its illegal and forcible occupation.”The union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, “including the area of so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’, are an integral part of India by virtue of the legal, complete and irrevocable accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Union of India in 1947”, Srivastava said. “The government of Pakistan has no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it,” he said. Srivastava further said attempts by Pakistan to “camouflage its illegal occupation cannot hide the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom for over seven decades to the people residing in these Pakistan-occupied territories”. He added, “Instead of seeking to alter the status of these Indian territories, we call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation.” The Pakistan government intends to make Gilgit-Baltistan a full-fledged province with constitutional rights such as representation in both houses of Parliament. The plan has the backing of Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, and Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party is banking on the move to boost its chances in the elections in the region.Two years ago, the powers of the Islamabad-controlled council for Gilgit-Baltistan were transferred to a local assembly. In 2009, the Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order renamed the Northern Areas as Gilgit-Baltistan and the region was given province-like status but without representation in Parliament. During his speech, Khan highlighted the importance of a strong military in the face of what he described as a campaign by the Indian government to foment unrest across Pakistan and to create a split between the Sunni majority and Shia minority. He also said it was necessary for Pakistan to have a strong military in view of the oppression of the Kashmiri people by the Indian government following the scrapping of J&K’s special status on August 5 last year. He praised Pakistan’s intelligence agencies for foiling what he said were India’s moves to create unrest at a time when opposition parties were making plans to discredit the military and judiciary. Khan particularly defended army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed from attacks by the opposition parties. Referring to PML-N leader Ayaz Sadiq’s remarks that Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman – shot down in a dogfight during the military standoff triggered by the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019 – was freed by Pakistan because of fears of an impending attack by India, Khan said the opposition leaders were “speaking like [Indian Prime Minister] Narendra Modi”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-pak-s-province-status-for-gilgit-baltistan/story-L5VG1Vf2NcY0wcZBJPXX5J.html
02-11-2020||India||Hindu Sena defaces Islamic Centre signage, case lodged||Alleged members of the Hindu Sena defaced the signage outside the India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC) at Lodhi Road on Sunday, police said, adding an FIR has been registered suo-motu. Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said an FIR was registered at the Tughlaq Road police station against unknown persons under Section 3 of the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 2007. “A police team spotted the defaced signage while patrolling the neighbourhood on Sunday morning. There is no CCTV camera installed around the board. The name of a right-wing organisation is mentioned on the objectionable poster pasted on the signage. We will probe the involvement of its members,” said the officer.Earlier in the day, Hindu Sena released a statement owning up the responsibility for the act. Photographs of the defaced board went viral on social media on Sunday. Hindu Sena chief Vishnu Gupta said that in the morning he learnt that some members of their organisation had defaced the signage during a protest at the India Islamic Cultural Centre on Sunday morning. “Muslims in cities like Bhopal and Mumbai have been protesting against the France government’s response to Islamic terrorism. This has been happening despite our Prime Minister and our people extending support to France at this hour. We believe that members of the IICC should have come out with a statement condemning the protests in India. Since they did not, it is clear that they too were supporting the protest,” he said. Referring to the defacement, SM Khan, vice president of IICC, said the incident was unfortunate. “It was an unfortunate incident and we brought it to the notice of local authorities. Our board will meet to decide on the course of legal action. IICC is a place which believes in inter-faith dialogue, deliberation and promotes national integrity. To say we support any act of terror is ridiculous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindu-sena-defaces-islamic-centre-signage-case-lodged/story-jRbSxqA91bRJdcpG9CjwQP.html
02-11-2020||India||Covid-19: Public participation a must to contain infection spread||Improvements in the clinical management of hospitalised patients with new drugs, oxygen therapy and other treatments have substantially improved the survival rate for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which is killing fewer people infected with the pandemic virus than it was doing six months ago.India’s case fatality rate — the percentage of deaths in an infected population — has steadily declined from a high of 3.23% on March 22 to 1.49% on October 31. This is significant because the reduction in deaths has occurred despite the majority of people infected with Covid-19 being treated in home isolation, unlike in March when everyone who tested positive was being admitted for treatment in designated hospitals.More people are getting tested today than ever before, with states like Kerala conducting 3,258 tests per million people per day, followed by Delhi with 3,225, which is well above the minimum of 140 tests per million people per day recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).Where India must focus its energy next is containing the spread of infection, which can be done only with active public participation.Respiratory viruses are transmitted when people inhale infected droplets expelled by infected persons coughing, sneezing, speaking or breathing. This means infection occurs through direct contact with an infected person, from touching a surface contaminated with droplets, through inhalation of respiratory droplets that contain the virus around a sick person, and through the airborne transmission of small droplets with the virus that remain suspended in the air for longer and travel further than heavy droplets.New research has found that virus transmission through contaminated surfaces is rare even though the Covid-19 virus survives on surfaces for days. “Attempts to culture the positive swabs on Vero E6 cells were unsuccessful, suggesting that patient fomites and surfaces are not contaminated with viable virus. Our findings suggest that environmental contamination leading to SARS-CoV-2 transmission is unlikely to occur in real-life conditions, provided that standard cleaning procedures and precautions are enforced,” reported scientists in the journal, The Lancet, on September 29.It was initially thought that droplet transmission was the main method of transmission, but now there is conclusive evidence of that the virus can stay suspended in tiny droplets called aerosols, which can disperse beyond 2 metres from an infected person under certain conditions.Several outbreak investigation reports have confirmed cases of transmission from people more than 2m apart in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. The chances of infection are higher in cases of extended exposure to an infected person for more than 30 minutes.Covid-19 virus transmission is particularly efficient in crowded, confined indoor spaces such as workplaces, restaurants, parties, shopping centres, dorms, cruise ships and transport, according to the European Centre of Disease Control (ECDC) guidance on ventilation of indoor spaces. In a study of 318 outbreaks in China, transmission in all cases except one occurred in indoor spaces, with the only case of outdoor transmission identified in this study involving two people.On July 9, WHO said airborne transmission of the coronavirus is possible indoors, especially when people spend extended periods in crowded and poorly ventilated rooms. On October 5, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines to say Covid-19 can occur from airborne transmission under certain circumstances, but it is not the primary route of spread of the disease.With lockdown fatigue setting in and people stepping out to work, socialise and celebrate their renewed freedom, new waves of infection are inundating several countries in Europe and Americas. In India, too, Covid-19 is surging in pockets. Delhi, for example, has registered a steady increase in new cases.How protected we are as we navigate public spaces over the next couple of weeks will decide whether Covid-19 will wax or wane by December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-participation-a-mustto-contain-infection-spread/story-lgwvE1M3BuTAw5CmusnDZP.html

The situation is very worrying. So, it is necessary that an all-party meeting should be called and the government should tell what preparations it has made to prevent the spread of the disease.”He also suggested that the government should use the existing sports facilities to meet the requirement for beds for patients. “The government should construct temporary hospitals at Chhatrasal Stadium, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Shivaji Stadium, Ambedkar Stadium, Indira Gandhi Stadium and the vacant land at Burari where Nirankari Sant Samagam is held without any delay. This way a large number of Covid patients can be treated,” he wrote.

02-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Is the coronavirus disease seasonal? I remember suggesting earlier this year that it may be and that the Indian summer would prove the country’s most powerful weapon against the virus — I was wrong, of course — but it’s a question I was reminded of when, in response to a discussion on Twitter about Europe’s ongoing and India’s imminent second wave, a doctor mentioned the Hope-Simpson curve.Robert Edgar Hope-Simpson — his father served in India till 1916 and he was born in 1908, so it is likely there’s an India connection there, although I can’t find any documentation of it — is the author of a book called The Transmission of Epidemic Influenza, published in 1992 after nearly six decades spent studying the disease. The book builds on an earlier paper by him in the Journal of Hygiene in 1981, The Role of Season in the Epidemiology of Influenza. Hope-Simpson was convinced that human or community transmission alone couldn’t explain the trajectory of influenza infections.He was able to show, using years of data, that there was a correlation between influenza and season. He initially put this down to an unknown seasonal variable but later narrowed down on the identify of the variable — Vitamin D.Covid-19 isn’t influenza — indeed, the two viruses aren’t even from the same family — but for some time earlier this year, it definitely looked as if the pandemic’s trajectory was following the famous Hope-Simpson curve — “a sinuous curve that runs parallel to the midsummer curve of vertical solar radiation, but lags about six months behind it”. (This is from the 1981 paper).It is likely some of you have seen the same posts I have online — showing a perfect match between the coronavirus pandemic’s trajectory in some countries from the northern hemisphere, others from the southern hemisphere and their respective Hope-Simpson curves. Some experts even used this to criticise lockdowns — these didn’t matter, was the argument; season was the primary driving force behind infections.IS COVID-19 SEASONAL?Robert Edgar Hope-Simpson, after studying years of data, was able to show that there was a correlation between influenza and season. But Covid-19 isn’t influenza and this pandemic has been unpredictable. Sure, its trajectory in some countries matched Hope-Simpson’s sinusoidal curve, but that in some other countries did not.But Covid-19 has been unpredictable. Sure, its trajectory in some countries matched Hope-Simpson’s sinusoidal curve, but that in some other countries did not.India is a case in point. Infections in the country rose through the summer months. As in the US. Infections there rose through late winter, dipped a bit in spring, then gathered momentum again in one part of summer before dipping again in another, and are now rising again through autumn. Both India and the US are in the northern hemisphere.But across most European countries (all in the northern hemisphere), the fall in cases coincided with the coming of warmer weather, and the current rise comes even as winter sets in.And in South Africa, Argentina and Chile (all three countries in the southern hemisphere), Covid-19 did peak in the winter months.It is likely that there are other factors at play as well.TOO SOON TO KNOWApart from seasonality, other factors are likely to be at play. One factor could be size and population, given that the two countries that are both exhibits in the case against seasonality (India and the US) are both large and populous. Another factor could be exposure to other viruses and lower levels of hygiene. I believe it is too soon to decide and this is something that can be established after years of study. One factor could be size and population, given that the two countries that are both exhibits in the case against seasonality (India and the US) are both large and populous, and many that are exhibits in the case for, (European countries) are neither large nor populous.The Covid-19 numbers of Brazil (another large country and third in overall number of cases after the US and India) presents a challenge, although cases there did peak during the colder months.Another factor could be exposure to other viruses, and lower levels of hygiene — things that some experts believe can explain Africa’s numbers (and perhaps that of some Indian states). Countries on the continent (with the exception of South Africa) have surprisingly few cases, and not many deaths.I believe it is too soon to decide one way or the other. It’s possible that seasonality emerges as one factor driving Covid-19 infections, but this is something that can be established after years (perhaps even decades) of study. Remember Hope-Simpson and his obsession with influenza for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-rTk7VOXzuK7dCYqb3iD1IO.html
02-11-2020||India||In Bihar, contradictions of aspiration, representation||More than two-thirds of the assembly constituencies (ACs) in Bihar are still to vote after the first phase of voting on October 28. If the first-phase figures are any indication, the pandemic has not had much of an impact on voter turnout except in urban constituencies. The voter turnout in the first phase was 55.69%, higher than the turnout in the corresponding constituencies in the 2015 assembly elections at 54.94%.The broad political narrative of the campaign has fallen into place by now. The main opposition, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led alliance, is targeting the Nitish Kumar government primarily on the question of jobs and economic well-being. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which has been in power in the state from 2005 to 2013 and from 2017 until now, is evoking memories of the RJD’s past stint in power to seek support for itself. This, in a way, suggests that it is advancing a lesser evil theory. To be sure, the NDA, especially Nitish Kumar himself, is also harping on its own past record. That the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) has not been thrown out of the NDA at the Centre despite making vicious attacks on Nitish Kumar, suggests that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would like the chief minister and his party, the Janata Dal (United), or JD (U), to face a bulk of the anti-incumbency flack. The centrality of the development narrative notwithstanding, identity-based contradictions, especially around caste, will continue to matter in the elections. It is the intersection of these two processes, which makes Bihar an interesting contest from a political economy perspective.How is Tejashwi Yadav being able to sell an aspirational agenda?Bihar reversed its economic decline after Nitish Kumar assumed officeThat Bihar went from bad to worse during the decade and a half long regime of Lalu Prasad Yadav is an objective fact. This is borne out by a comparison of Bihar’s per capita income with all-India figures. The ratio of Bihar’s per capita Gross State Domestic Product and India’s per capita GDP fell from around 0.4 to 0.3 during the period when Lalu Yadav or his wife Rabri Debi held power in the state. This trend reversed almost immediately after the JD(U)-BJP alliance got power in 2005. While this ratio has been improving continuously, Bihar continues to be among the worst performing states in terms of per capita GSDP. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();It is this persisting backwardness inter-state backwardness, which is giving the RJD led opposition an opportunity to undermine the NDA’s claim of having brought historical improvement from where the state was a decade and a half ago. The prolonged economic slowdown in the Indian economy and Covid-19’s economic disruption, especially due to reverse migration, might have increased the economic pain, and helped the opposition in targeting the current NDA government. Whether or not the RJD’s aspiration plank under Tejashwi Yadav’s leadership can overcome NDA’s attempts to evoke memories of poor governance during his father’s term, will be an important factor in these elections.The BJP has a problem in launching a full-scale attack on the RJD’s Yadav baseThe RJD did not win even one Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 elections in Bihar. Yet, it has managed to forge a coalition with majority of ACs for itself and is claiming to be the natural challenger to the incumbent NDA. One of the biggest reasons for this is the fact that the RJD is seen as the primary beneficiary of the more than 30% Muslim and Yadav voters in the state. The Muslim support comes from the fact that it has never done business with the BJP. While the BJP, as of now, is not interested in courting Muslim voters, it does want to attract the Yadavs in the state, who are perhaps the single largest caste group in Bihar. Narendra Modi in his Hoonkar Rally (at 2:02 hours) before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections evoked his Dwarka (a Hindu pilgrimage spot in Gujarat associated with Lord Krishna, who Modi described as the king of Yaduvansh; or the Yadav clan) credentials to express affinity with Lalu Prasad Yadav’s social roots and portray himself as a well wisher of the Yadavs. The BJP has been successfully fielding Ram Kripal Yadav, against Lalu Prasad Yadav’s daughter Misa Bharti from the Pataliputra constituency in both 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP’s aggressive pursuit of the RJD’s Yadav base hurt the latter, which, according to the CSDS-Lokniti post-poll survey, could only manage 55% of Yadav votes, its worst performance, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();According to an Indian Express report, both the BJP and the JD(U) have given around 15% of their tickets to Yadav candidates. This, although significantly lower than the share of Yadav candidates fielded by the RJD (40%), is not an insignificant number. It is entirely possible that a large number of Yadav voters who supported the NDA might be willing to vote for the RJD in these elections. At the state level, it is the RJD which promises them greater share in exploits of power. There is not much the BJP can do to prevent this political promiscuity by the Yadavs, lest they are antagonised during the Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, portraying a Yadav as its main leader in Bihar, which could help it attract an even bigger chunk of RJD’s Yadav votes, could trigger a backlash from the upper caste voters for the BJP, who although overwhelmingly behind the BJP, have had an antagonistic outlook vis-a-vis Yadavs. That the RJD is keeping its attack focused on Nitish Kumar rather than the BJP or Narendra Modi, suggests that it has understood the merits of exploiting a split-ticket behaviour among the Yadavs in the assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-contradictions-of-aspiration-representation/story-fZgKjoFxEst37c9qVBE92K.html

Most experimental Covid-19 vaccines require two doses.The figures are second only to the US, which has pre-ordered 810 million confirmed doses and has another 1.6 billion under negotiation.It will likely take three to four years to manufacture enough vaccines to cover the world’s population, but high-income countries and a few middle-income countries with manufacturing capacity such as India, have already purchased nearly 3.8 billion doses, with options for another five billion, showed an analysis of purchasing agreements for Covid-19 vaccines by the US-based Duke Global Health Innovation Center.“In terms of numbers of confirmed doses, the USA has pre-ordered the largest number (810 million confirmed, another 1.6 billion doses under negotiation), followed by India (600 million doses confirmed, with another 1 billion doses under negotiation), and the EU (400 million doses confirmed, another 1.565 billion doses under negotiation). But in terms of percent of population covered by confirmed purchases, Canada has pre-purchased enough vaccine to cover 527% of their population, followed by the UK at 277% of their population,” said Andrea D Taylor, assistant director of programmes at the Duke Global Health Innovation Center, who led the analysis. “Of course, it is important to remember that most likely only some of the vaccine purchases will come through, depending on regulatory approval,” said Taylor.Also read | Covid-19 vaccine predictions of pharma companies that didn’t come true“India is producing vaccines to protect the world against Covid-19, why shouldn’t it ensure its own citizens are protected as well? The government is committed to protecting the health of its citizens, so all measures have been taken to ensure we get adequate doses of the vaccines when they are available,” said a senior Union health ministry official, requesting anonymity. Since none of the experimental vaccines yet have regulatory approval, countries are hedging bets by purchasing multiple candidates and some part of these doses may never materialise. The UK, for example, has made AMCs with five different vaccine candidates, using four different vaccine technologies. Future agreements under discussion by the EU raise that number of vaccine doses to almost two billion, while the US, which has pre-ordered doses to cover 230% of its population, could eventually control 1.8 billion doses — about a quarter of the world’s near-term supply — according to the analysis. This “vaccinationalism” will lead to some countries being able to vaccinate their entire populations — and some many times over — which is likely to deny low-resource regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, access to Covid-19 protection until 2024.Only enough doses to cover 250 million people have been confirmed as purchased thus far by Covax, a global effort involving both wealthy and poor countries that has promised equal access to Covid-19 vaccines globally. To meet its goal of vaccinating at least 20% of member countries, COVAX would need at least 1.14 billion doses of a single-dose vaccine and twice that amount for a two-dose regimen.Covax signatories, which include the UK, the EU and Canada but not the US, are effectively undermining the pact by negotiating “side deals” for vaccines that will affect equitable access, said the study.“An ambitious effort to create a global system of vaccine equity is being undermined as a handful of countries, including those who made a commitment to equality, secure as many doses as they possibly can,” said Elina Urli Hodges, MSPH, who leads the Launch and Scale Speedometer, an initiative that identifies impediments to delivering health innovations to low-income countries. No low-income country has made a direct agreement to purchase, suggesting that they will be limited to the Covax pact to secure vaccines. AMCs are being secured by countries through investment of large amounts of public funds into research and development of Covid-19 vaccines, national public and private vaccine development capacity, both public and private, and purchasing power and volume to make large-scale deals.Other countries such as Brazil are also using their manufacturing capability to negotiate large AMCs with leading experimental vaccine candidates, while countries such as Peru are participating in phase 3 clinical trials to get leverage to negotiate AMCs, found the analysis, which used available evidence from public sources until October 8 combined with interviews with global and regional vaccine experts, as well as ministry of health officials in select countries.“It is understandable that countries are acting in their national interest; they are incentivised to focus first on the safety of their populations. But globally, this will deepen existing inequities, and prolong the pandemic. Our research points to the need for countries and multilateral funders to unlock additional manufacturing capacity (particularly in the Global South) and invest in preparing countries for effective distribution of vaccines. High-income countries should also work with COVAX, as a global coordinator, to ensure that, once their populations are covered, excess doses are redeployed where they are needed most around the world,” said Taylor, in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-study-sees-india-having-edge-in-covid-19-vaccines/story-3Hh2hC3SGaadpX3LVG9hDL.html
02-11-2020||India||TN fishermen driven away, attacked by Lankan Navy, alleges association leader||Around 4,000 fishermen from here returned without catch after being allegedly driven away by Sri Lankan Navy personnel and also attacked with stones and bottles, damaging their gear and over 50 boats off Dhanushkodi near here, a fishermen association leader claimed on Sunday.They were fishing in 528 mechanised boats between Dhanushkodi and Katchatheevu when the Lankan Naval personnel, who came on board eight patrol boats started chasing them away on Saturday, throwing bottles and stones as missiles, local fishermen association president P Sesuraja told reporters here.While around 20 boats returned on Saturday evening itself, others also came without fish catch later in the night and early Sunday, he said, quoting the affected fishermen.Fishing nets of around 50 boats were snapped and dumped into the sea and as many craft suffered damage in the hurling of stones and bottles, he alleged.This is the third such mid-sea incident in the last fortnight.On October 18, the Lankan naval personnel drove away the fishermen.On Tuesday, the fishermen were attacked using bottles and stones, resulting in injuries to some fishermen and damage to their gear.The October 27 incident, which marked a break in a long lull in such attacks, drew widespread condemnation from political parties in Tamil Nadu and state Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar said any attack on fishermen was not acceptable and it would be taken up with the Centre.Ramanathapuram Lok Sabha member K Navas Kani said he has appealed to the Centre and External Affairs Ministry to put an end to such ‘attacks’ on fishermen from the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sri-lankan-navy-attacks-tamil-nadu-fishermen-near-dhanushkodi/story-PhCdYLuJX8R3haTpqkoeLN.html
