Friday’s announcements identified six states where “localised” pockets are causing concern: Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Manipur.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe six states together accounted for, on average, 36% of the daily cases seen across the country over the seven days to Thursday, with Kerala alone accounting for 26%, or 11,815 new infections a day. The seven-day daily case numbers of the other five states are: Arunachal (279 cases a day), Tripura (389), Odisha (3,184), Chhattisgarh (357), and Manipur (590). As of Thursday night, these six states also accounted for 29% of the 516,378 active cases in the country.“There are 71 districts that are showing a test positivity rate of over 10%... The second wave is still not over,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, at the government’s press briefing on Covid-19 on Friday.The official added that states have been asked to identify locations where the test positivity rate is above 10% or hospital occupancy is higher than 60%, and implement strict restrictions which should be in place for at least two weeks.Aggarwal’s caution was echoed by Niti Aayog member (Health) VK Paul, who said that outbreaks must now be nipped as soon as possible. “There still are certain problematic districts that are being closely monitored. Expert teams of the health ministry have been deployed in some of these states such as Kerala, Odisha, Manipur, Chhattisgarh, etc. The pockets of outbreak that are currently visible, those need to be nipped right there as these are in localised pockets at the moment. We do not allow it to spread further,” he said.The teams sent to each state comprise two members – a clinician and a public health expert. They will assess the overall management of Covid-19, particularly testing, surveillance and containment operations, and monitor the enforcement of Covid-safe behaviour among the public.The teams will also take stock of availability of hospital beds, and of logistics such as ambulances, ventilators, and medical oxygen. They will assess the Covid-19 vaccination speed and as a whole, suggest remedial actions, the health ministry said in a statement.An analysis of case numbers from the six states identified by the government suggest that as a whole, most of these regions are not particularly logging a resurgence, but that the problem may be in particular districts.According to the University of Michigan-led COV-IND-19 Study Group, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland (not identified as one of the six states), have an effective reproduction number (R) of more than 1 – which suggests the outbreak in these regions is growing.No other state reported an R number above 1. Kerala and Maharashtra have an effective R number of 0.97 and 0.96, but the latter has recorded a consistently high test positivity rate of around 10% -- this proportion should be below 5% for an outbreak to be considered under control.Officials said that of particular concern were some pockets in the northeastern states. “Certain north-eastern states are showing increase in case load and containment is important in these states as there are many hard to reach areas in these states where health care delivery system is not as strong. Therefore, it is important to stop the spread before it grows beyond control,” said a senior central government official, who asked not to be named.Paul said close monitoring is crucial at this stage and the country “cannot lower its guard”. “As we are seeing in Europe right now, the disease transmission has started growing again, with cases having dropped to 50 per million at one point, which is now almost double,” he said.“It is in our control to ensure India doesn’t see the third wave. Even though we are fully prepared for the third wave— in rural areas, for children, overall facilities such as beds, ICUs, ventilators, oxygen, medicines, containment strategies, testing, all these preparations are in place -- our disciplined behavior will eventually decide whether a third wave will come or not,” said Paul.Experts said that along with vaccination, the behavior of people will be the key to stop the virus in its tracks. “Covid appropriate behavioural changes are required to be made in a big way; it will be crucial. Vaccination is important but since vaccinating everyone will take a lot of time, people will need to strictly adhere to Covid appropriate behavior to stop the outbreak,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-centre-rushes-teams-to-6-states-with-36-cases-101625250135419.html

02-07-2021||India||Sunanda Pushkar death: Court defers framing of charges against Tharoor for third time||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Friday deferred for the third time its order on the framing of charges against Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in the Sunanda Pushkar death case.Additional session judge Geetanjali Goel adjourned passing of the order which is now likely to be pronounced on July 27.The Delhi high court on April 18 had notified that it would hear only extremely urgent matters in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic.Pushkar was found dead in the suite of a luxury hotel in the city on the night of January 17, 2014, following which the police had charged Tharoor with abetment to suicide, among other charges. Tharoor has consistently denied all charges, calling them “preposterous and motivated”.On May 14, 2018, Tharoor had tweeted: “I have taken note of the filing of this preposterous charge sheet & intend to contest it vigorously. No one who knew Sunanda believes she would ever have committed suicide, let alone abetment on my part... If this is conclusion arrived at after 4+ yrs of investigation it does not speak well of the methods or motivations of the Delhi Police.”Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Tharoor, had argued that no case of abetment to suicide is made out against his client. Pahwa had told the court that doctors have not been able to ascertain the cause of death or establish whether Pushkar had indeed died by suicide and, hence, the case of abetment to suicide against Tharoor was nothing but “a figment of imagination of the police”.He had earlier said the post-mortem examination and other medical reports have allegedly established that it was neither a suicide nor homicide. He had also said that during the course of the investigation, there have been many reports by experts before the investigating officer (IO), but there was “no definite opinion on the cause of death” in any of them.Tharoor, a former union minister who is currently on bail in the case, was chargesheeted by Delhi Police under Sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava claimed that Pushkar has undergone mental cruelty which led to her bad health. He also argued that it was not an accidental death and relied on the post-mortem report which suggests that the cause of death is poisoning which could be oral or injected.The prosecutor further added that Pushkar was not facing any health issue earlier but problems began due to “stress and betrayal”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunanda-pushkar-death-court-defers-framing-of-charges-against-tharoor-for-third-time-101625249150382.html

The accident took place after a private passenger vehicle collided with another vehicle on National Highway 44. It then plunged into a deep gorge.Taking to Twitter to condole the lives lost in the accident, PM Modi wrote, "pained by the loss of lives due to an accident in Ramban, Jammu and Kashmir." He also wished for a speedy recovery of the injured people.The vehicle was on its way to Neel village from Ramban, according to PD Nitya, senior superintendent of police in the area.The injured have been taken to a local hospital and were undergoing treatment. Meanwhile, police were trying to ascertain the identities of the deceased.This is the second reported accident in the district over the past one week. On June 30, four people, including a child and two women, were killed and four others were injured when a vehicle carrying labourers from Chhattisgarh to Srinagar from Jammu plunged into a gorge near Khooni Nallah.Police said the labourers were going to Srinagar to work in brick kilns.In May last, three separate mishaps killed at least three persons and four others were injured in the Ramban district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-condoles-death-of-five-people-in-road-accident-in-j-k-s-ramban-101625246590667.html

Last week’s WMCC meeting saw a “frank exchange of views” on the situation along the LAC in the western sector.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing that the two countries had agreed at the 22nd meeting of WMCC to “maintain dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military mechanisms to reach a mutually acceptable solution for complete disengagement from all friction points” in the Ladakh sector.Complete disengagement alone will “enable full restoration of peace and tranquillity” and progress in bilateral relations, he added.“The two sides also agreed to hold the 12th round of senior commanders meeting at an early date. I don’t have any update on the date for this meeting, which is yet to be fixed,” Bagchi said.India and China also agreed during the last WMCC meeting that the two sides will continue to ensure stability on the ground and prevent any untoward incident, he said.Following a drawdown of troops and armoured units from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February, India and China haven’t made any headway on disengagement and de-escalation at other friction points such as Depsang, Gogra and Hot Springs.The two sides also recently engaged in a war of words, blaming each other for the year-long standoff on the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/date-yet-to-be-fixed-for-next-india-china-military-commanders-meeting-101625245972807.html
02-07-2021||India||Tirath Singh Rawat’s missing request to EC on bypoll fuels buzz in Uttarakhand||New Delhi: Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat or the state government have not petitioned the election commission to hold by-elections to allow the chief minister who is not a member of the state legislature to become a member of the house, said people aware of the developments.A chief minister who is not a member of the legislative assembly or the legislative council has to be elected to either House within six months of assuming office. Since Uttarakhand does not have a legislative council, Rawat who was appointed in March, has till September to get elected to the assembly.Since the term of the assembly ends in March 2022, a person familiar with the election commission’s working said the poll panel may not ordinarily hold by-elections unless there is a special request.“The election commission can hold by-elections even if general elections are less than a year away. There is no rule barring it. But in case there is a situation like in Uttarakhand where the CM’s continuation in office depends on the bypoll, they have to petition the EC, which will then take a call when to hold elections,” said a person aware of the details.A second person said this request can be made by either the state government or the chief minister on the grounds that it is necessary for them to meet the constitutional requirements.No such petition has been received so far, the person cited above said.The EC will need a month’s time to notify and conduct the elections, said the person.A similar situation had arisen in 2020 when Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had to be elected to either the assembly or the legislative council. Since elections were put on hold owing to the coronavirus pandemic, there was pressure from the state government to relax the restrictions to allow the elections.Thackeray who was eventually elected unopposed even called Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek his intervention. Earlier, Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari had not acted on the state cabinet’s recommendation that Thackeray be nominated to the legislative council.BJP functionaries did not respond to requests for their response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirath-singh-rawat-s-missing-request-to-ec-on-bypoll-fuels-buzz-in-uttarakhand-101625245790727.html
02-07-2021||India||Maldives says false news reports could affect ties with India||The Maldives on Friday said articles in the local media levelling false accusations against the Indian mission and its staff could affect long-standing friendly relations between the two sides, and that it is responsible for providing security to all foreign diplomats.The ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) too expressed deep concern over what it described as “disparaging and ill-founded remarks about Indian diplomats” in recent reports by Dhiyares, an online news outlet. The reaction from the ruling party and the foreign ministry followed the Indian high commission sending a letter to the Maldivian foreign ministry last Thursday to complain about malicious local media reports targeting the mission and its personnel. The Indian side sought an investigation into the media reports and additional protection for diplomats and the high commission.Asked about the matter at a regular news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi noted that both the Maldivian foreign ministry and the ruling party had issued statements on the issue.Without naming India, the Maldivian foreign ministry said in a statement in Dhivehi that it had taken note of articles “published repeatedly on local media, levelling false accusations at foreign ambassadors, missions and diplomats in the Maldives”. “These actions affect the decades-long friendly relations the Maldives has maintained with friendly nations, and create hatred among the local population towards these friendly nations. This also puts the diplomats’ lives in danger and hinders their diplomatic work,” the statement said. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 stipulates immunities and privileges bestowed on diplomats, and the Maldives government is responsible for providing security to diplomats, their residences and missions. The foreign ministry asked the local media to respect international conventions and to “report in a manner that does not affect the relations between the Maldives and other countries”.The MDP was more direct in its criticism of recent reports in Dhiyares, and urged the website and its co-founder Ahmed Azaan to “refrain from dragging in the Maldives’ diplomatic partners and allies into their own political petty vendettas”. The website’s “continuous barrage of anti-India vitriol appears to be a well-funded, well-orchestrated and premeditated political campaign with the express purpose of whipping up hatred against the Maldives’ closest ally, India”, MDP said in a statement.“Such campaigns of hatred carry real security concerns for the safety and security of diplomats in our country,” MDP added.The Maldives’ Speaker Mohamed Nasheed on Friday called for an end to the spreading of hostility against India by those opposed to the government and MDP. He tweeted that “hostile” and “disrespectful” rhetoric was being spread against India in the Maldives.Dhiyares and its sister news outlet, The Maldives Journal, have carried articles with unsubstantiated allegations against Indian diplomats in recent days. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that there had been a concerted anti-India campaign in the Indian Ocean archipelago since the two sides signed an agreement in February to develop, support and maintain the Coast Guard harbour in Uthuru Thila Falhu, a key naval facility.The Maldives doesn’t have a navy and the Coast Guard functions as the armed maritime component of the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF). There is strong maritime cooperation between the two countries, and in the past, New Delhi has provided patrol vessels and surveillance aircraft to the MNDF. India will support the development of the harbour, dockyard, other infrastructure, communications resources and radar services at Uthuru Thila Falhu and train Maldivian personnel. However, MNDF officials have made it clear that no foreign military personnel would be stationed at the facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maldives-says-false-news-reports-could-affect-ties-with-india-101625243992757.html

02-07-2021||India||‘False, mischievous': India on reports claiming Jaishankar met Taliban leaders||The Indian government on Friday denied the claims that suggested Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar met Taliban leaders during his stopover in Doha. In a weekly briefing, external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said such reports are "false and mischievous.""We categorically deny reports based on tweets by some journalists that EAM has met any Taliban leader," Bagchi also said.Earlier this month, the foreign minister travelled to Kenya. During the trip, Jaishankar made a surprise stopover in Doha, where he met some officials, including the Qatari National Security Adviser.The meeting was held in the backdrop of the US pulling out its troops from Afghanistan amid the peace deal between the south Asian country's government and the Taliban insurgents.There was no prior announcement about the foreign minister’s transit halt in Qatar, which has played a crucial role in US-Taliban negotiations in recent years, and no official word from both countries on the meeting between Jaishankar and Qatari NSA Mohamed Bin Ahmed Al Mesned.Following the meeting, many speculated that Jaishankar also met Taliban leaders who assured the foreign minister that the outfit's future relations with India will not be based on Pakistan's wishes. The speculations were further fuelled after senior Qatari officials held separate meetings with Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, and a team of Taliban negotiators.In the UNSC Debate on the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan last week, Jaishankar had called for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to ensure reduction in violence in Afghanistan and said that terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries must be dismantled immediately for enduring peace in the war-torn country.Jaishankar had also said there needs to be zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including cross-border terror acts.He had said it is equally important to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country and those providing material and financial support to terrorist entities must be held accountable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/false-and-mischievous-india-on-reports-claiming-jaishankar-met-taliban-leader-101625239310508.html
02-07-2021||India||'Treat vaccinated Indians on par with those inoculated in EU states': India||India on Friday said it expects its vaccinated citizens to be treated on par with those inoculated in the European Union (EU) states, and the recognition of its digital Covid-19 vaccination certificates by the 27-member bloc on a reciprocal basis.The remarks by external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi at a weekly news briefing came against the backdrop of 10 European countries, including eight EU members, recognising the Covishield vaccine for proof of Covid-19 vaccination for travel.Referring to the EU Digital Covid Certificate or “green pass” introduced on July 1 for exempting vaccinated people from restrictions on movement, Bagchi said, “Our expectation is that Indians who have been vaccinated through our domestic vaccination programme would be treated at par with those vaccinated in the EU and the CoWIN vaccination certificate would be recognised by the EU on a reciprocal basis.”Bagchi said India’s digital vaccination certificates can be authenticated on the CoWIN website. “We are in touch with EU member states in this regard for reciprocal acceptance. I understand that a number of EU countries have already taken positive steps in this direction,” he added.A large number of Indian students who have gained admission to educational institutions in Europe, as well as professionals, are keen to travel so that they can join classes or resume work. Questions have arisen about their ability to travel as Covishield hasn’t been approved as yet by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Covaxin is yet to be approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).EU member states, however, have the option of accepting vaccines that have been approved by the WHO or national authorities.Currently, EU members Austria, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain, Iceland and Switzerland, which aren’t in the bloc but are part of the Schengen visa regime, recognise Covishield for travel purposes.Of the EU members, only Estonia recognises both Covishield and Covaxin, the two main jabs used for India’s vaccination programme.The Indian side has informed EU member states it will follow a policy of reciprocity in recognising Covid-19 vaccines for travel, and exempt EU nationals possessing the green pass from mandatory quarantine only if the bloc recognises Covishield and Covaxin.Travel between India and Europe continues to be tightly restricted. For example, India is on the Netherlands’ list of “very high risk” areas from where travel is barred. Of the 10 European countries that recognise Covishield, India has an air bubble arrangement only with Germany, which has emerged as a key transit hub for Indian nationals.In response to other questions at the briefing, Bagchi said the government is making all efforts to augment the availability of vaccines across the country through domestic production and imports. The status of imports of specific vaccines depends on the regulatory authorities, he added.Bagchi also ruled out any immediate resumption of vaccine exports, saying, “Let me reiterate that currently, our priority remains on purposing domestic production to our domestic vaccination programme, which as you know, is progressing rapidly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccinated-citizens-be-treated-at-par-with-those-inoculated-in-eu-states-mea-101625238263920.html
02-07-2021||India||Lakshadweep admin orders education dept officials in Kochi to shift to islands||The Lakshadweep administration on Friday ordered the officials of the education department in Kochi to shift to the islands. The Directorate of Education of Lakshadweep administration also asked its education officer in Kochi to shift all the office materials like electronic equipment, furniture and files dealt by five of its staff from Kochi to the islands. The Lakshadweep administration has an office in Kochi from which several departments operate.Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal PP criticised the decision saying that it will adversely impact around 4,000 students from the islands who are studying at various educational institutions in Kerala and also said that the order will be challenged in the court. The order asked the officials which include accountant, a stenographer, two clerical staff and a MSE to shift ‘consequent upon the decision to rationalise the staff of the Education Office, Kochi.’ The education officer in Kochi has been asked to relieve the officials with direction to report before director of education Rakesh Singhal Danics in seven days.“With the new decision, the students studying in Thiruvananthapuram or other parts of India now need to travel to Lakshadweep to solve their problems. Otherwise, they would only need to travel to Kochi to meet their education and resolve their issues and go back,” Mohammed Faizal PP was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Faizal said that the administration’s education office has been functioning from Kochi since the last three years and was set up for easy access for the needs of students studying in the mainland.Faizal also termed the move as an ‘unwanted action’. He also alleged that the island administrator Praful Khoda Patel took the decision unilaterally without any discussion with representatives of the people in the islands or even the standing committee on education of the Lakshadweep district panchayat.The island continues to witness protests by residents from the past month against Praful Khoda Patel’s reforms. The residents claim that measures are being implemented without taking the people of the islands into consideration. The Save Lakshadweep Forum (SLF) said that the protests will continue until the administration withdraws the measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-admin-orders-education-dept-officials-in-kochi-to-shift-to-islands-101625237742758.html

Speaking at the daily briefing of the Union health ministry over the Covid-19 situation in the country, Paul said, "We are not safe until the entire nation is safe."He also said that the central teams have been sent to several states that are still reporting an alarming surge in cases. The Centre on Friday sent multi-disciplinary teams to six states - Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Manipur - that are reporting a high number of cases. The two-member team comprised a clinician and a public health expert.On the threat of a possible third wave, Paul said, "it is not in our hands." "We must have all the preparation regarding infrastructure in rural areas, arrangement for children, ICU beds, medicines etc," he added.He further said that the government is attempting to "stall any new outbreak" and if people act responsibly and follow all the Covid-19 norms, "then this wave will not come."Speaking on the vaccination drive and the future supply of the jabs, Paul said, "The projection that 216 crore doses would be available from August-December was an optimistic, aspirational projection based on what our manufacturers had told us."Paul also informed that the number of total cases of Delta plus mutation in the country have risen to 56 across the 12 states.India saw a single-day rise of 46,617 new coronavirus infections, taking the tally of Covid-19 cases to 3,04,58,251, while the national recovery rate has crossed 97%, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-wave-of-covid-19-not-over-yet-cautions-niti-aayog-s-vk-paul-101625237521834.html
02-07-2021||India||'Over 30 mn takedowns, most for violent content': FB's first report under new rules||From violent and graphic content, followed by adult nudity and sexual activity to suicide and self-injury content, Facebook removed nearly 30.1 million URLs, including posts, profiles and pages, according to its first monthly interim compliance report (from May 15-June 15) published by the social media giant under the new social media and intermediary rules on July 2.Also Read: Facebook to release its first compliance report in JulyAccording to the interim report published by the company on its transparency platform, Facebook’s automated and removal of such posts was pegged at over 95% for all the 10 categories. The detailed report regarding action taken for public grievances, mandated under the contentious new guidelines challenged by Facebook-owned WhatsApp for its traceability clause, is expected to get published on July 15.The social media firm removed 2.5 million counts of violent and graphic content, at a 99.9% proactive rate, which means that the content that had to be reported by users was less than 0.1%. Proactive removal translates into the automated removal of content.As for adult nudity and sexual activity, a point stressed under the new rules with a 24-hour takedown requirement, the company actioned 1.8 million counts at a 99.6% proactive rate. According to people familiar with the matter, the number of counts of actioned content includes pages, profiles and posts. Actioned content includes pages, posts, profiles, posts, et cetera, against which an action is taken.“Facebook’s India specific numbers are more detailed than offered to other countries,” a person familiar with the matter said. "The list of categories is not exhaustiveAccording to the social media firm’s last quarter transparency report, from January 2021 to March 2021, it actioned 31.8 million URLs for adult nudity, while in India the number stood at 1.8 million for the month. In terms of graphic and violent content, the company took down 34.3 million posts, pages and profiles, with India’s number for May 15 to June 15 being 2.5 million.The other actioned content includes spam, 25 million counts of which were removed, dangerous organizations and individuals, organized hate wherein 75,000 such URLs were taken down.Nearly 106,000 profiles, pages and posts were actioned for being terrorist propaganda, while nearly 311,000 hate speech URLs were also taken down.Instagram, on the other hand, removed nearly 2,031,300 URLs.

We use a combination of Artificial Intelligence, reports from our community and review by our teams to identify and review content against our policies. We’ll continue to add more information and build on these efforts towards transparency as we evolve this report,” a Facebook spokesperson said.Facebook is the second global tech giant after Google to publish a monthly report in keeping with the new rules. The new guidelines also seek additional safeguards from significant social media intermediaries, which have 5 million users or more, to expedite their automated removal process in order to action violative content more promptly. At Facebook, the removal process is three-tier, it can involve a user complaint, automated removal, which is followed by a human review to ensure that content actioned is for the right reasons, people familiar with the matter said.Meanwhile, Google on June 30 said it actioned nearly 60,000 pieces of content in April, mostly for copyright infringement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-30-mn-takedowns-most-for-violent-content-fb-s-first-report-under-new-rules-101625237156254.html
02-07-2021||India||Theaterisation of Armed Forces: Decoding the new approach to defence||Theaterisation of the Indian armed forces could involve a significant departure from the current arrangement, a change that experts say is crucial to fighting future wars.What is theaterisation?It is a concept that seeks to integrate the capabilities of the three services -- army, air force and navy -- and optimally utilise their resources for wars and operations. Specific theatre commands – or units – will be placed under the Theatre Commander. Such commands are expected to come under the operational control of an officer from any of the three services, depending on the function assigned.What will it entail?The current theaterisation model under consideration seeks to set up at least six new integrated commands.The first phase involves the creation of Air Defence Command and Maritime Theatre Command.Air Defence Command: This will control air defence resources of all three services and will be tasked with protecting military assets from airborne enemies. It will be headed by a top three-star Indian Air Force officer based in Prayagraj.Maritime Theatre Command: This will be responsible for securing India from seaborne threats and will have army and air force elements. It will be headed by a top three-star Indian Navy officer and will be based in Karwar, Karnataka.Ultimately, India is expected to have three other integrated commands to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts. Additionally, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources.How many commands does the military currently have?The armed forces currently have 17 single-service commands spread across the country’s geography. The Army has 7 commands, IAF has 7 commands and the Navy, 3 commands.Creating theatres would involve merging existing commands. The Port Blair-based Andaman and Nicobar Command is the only tri-service command.Who is responsible for theaterisation?India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat has been given the mandate to steer the theaterisation drive. The government expects Rawat, who took charge as CDS on January 1, 2020, to bring about an integration of the three services in a three-year time frame (by January 2023). One of the steps to do it involves theaterisation in not just operations and logistics but also transport, training, support services and repairs and maintenance.What is the current status?A lack of consensus on the military’s theaterisation model emerged earlier this month during a key meeting of top government officials reviewing a draft cabinet note on the new joint structures. This led to the government setting up an expert committee last week for consultations and to remove differences before the reform plan is sent to the Cabinet Committee on Security for approval. The panel has members of the armed forces, defence ministry and other ministries (finance and home).Who has reservations about the current model?While the army and navy are in favour of theatre commands, the IAF has concerns about the model over the division of its air assets, the nomenclature of commands, the leadership of theatre commands and dilution of powers of chiefs. The IAF’s traditional resistance to theaterisation is well-known and has been articulated by its top leadership. The expert committee is expected to hold more discussions to iron out the details of the theaterisation plan and bring all stakeholders, especially the IAF, on board. Deliberations on the proposal are likely to take more time and previous timelines may have to be revised.How will the role of service chiefs change?The operational control of the theatre commands will eventually come under the CDS, with the service chiefs being responsible for raising, training and sustaining their forces. CDS Bipin Rawat wears three hats — he is the permanent chairman of chiefs of staff committee (COSC), heads the department of military affairs (DMA), and is the single-point military adviser to the defence minister. CDS is expected to have operational control over all integrated commands when they are fully functional -- this will be in his role as CDS, and not as permanent chairman, COSC.Which other militaries have theatre commands?Most leading militaries, including those of the United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom and France, function as per the theatre command concept with the idea of seamless integration among the land, sea and air forces for better coordination and response. The US military, the world’s most powerful, has 11 combatant commands, each with a geographic or functional mission. Similarly, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands -- eastern, southern, western, northern and central, with its western theatre handling the entire border with India. Pakistan has sought Beijing’s help to reorganise its forces under the same military concept.What is CDS’s assessment of progress made on theaterisation?CDS Bipin Rawat on June 22 said new reforms do face hurdles, but the three services are in agreement on taking theaterisation forward. He said hurdles are necessary as they underscore the need for holding more discussions to fine-tune plans. According to him, the creation of theatre commands is progressing in line with the prescribed timelines for bringing about jointness among the three services. In March, he said “service parochialism” will have to make way for “a combined services outlook” to take theaterisation forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/theaterisation-of-armed-forces-decoding-the-new-approach-to-defence-101625236673690.html

Their vaccine is being produced outside,” Paul said.The NITI Aayog member also informed reporters that the vaccine will be produced at Indian biopharmaceutical company Biological E (Bio E), based out of Hyderabad. “As per the plan, this vaccine will also be produced in Hyderabad's Biological E.”Johnson and Johnson recently announced that their vaccine generates a strong and persistent response activity against the new Delta coronavirus variant and also against other highly prevalent SARS-CoV-2 viral strains. Adding that the vaccine was far more effective in neutralising Delta variants than it was in fighting Beta variants.Also Read: Covid in India: 100 million doses of J&J vaccine likely to be procured from EU"We believe that our vaccine offers durable protection against Covid-19 and elicits neutralizing activity against the Delta variant. This adds to the robust body of clinical data supporting our single-shot vaccine's ability to protect against multiple variants of concern," said Paul Stoffels, managing director, at Johnson and Johnson.As per the latest data collected so far on the shot, the immune response induced by the J&J vaccine has lasted for eight months "Current data for the eight months studied so far show that the single-shot Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine generates a strong neutralizing antibody response that does not wane; rather, we observe an improvement over time. In addition, we observe a persistent and particularly robust, durable cellular immune response."India has approved four vaccines so far, including two foreign made vaccines-Moderna and Sputnik V. The newly emerging Delta plus variant has been a cause of concern for experts around the world. India has so far recorded 56 cases in 12 states, the government said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-in-talks-with-johnson-johnson-for-its-single-dose-vaccine-101625231367335.html

Centre clarifies number of vaccine doses to be available in 2021||The Union health ministry earlier estimated that there will be 216 crore vaccine doses available in the country between August and December this year. But in the affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the government reduced the estimate and brought it to 135 crore vaccine doses."When we proposed the estimate of 216 crore vaccines between August and December this year, we clearly said that we collated the figures that our vaccine makers gave us according to their responsible, optimistic and aspirational roadmap. The private sector is very influential in India; they have such a major contribution to the GDP. They are reputed vaccine-maker conglomerates. We collated what they showed," Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said.Took back charge of vaccine drive on states’ request: CentreThe government is responsible for the procurement of vaccines which has been fixed as 75 per cent of the monthly production of vaccines.In its earlier estimate of 216 crore vaccine doses, the government took into account the future availability of Biological E, Zydus Cadila's vaccine, Novavax and Bharat Biotech's nasal vaccines. But as far as the main vaccine makers - Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech -- are concerned, at present 90 crore vaccine doses are estimated from each, Dr Paul said. This can also go up."The situation is dynamic but satisfactory," Dr Paul said.Following the reduction in the number of projected availability of vaccines, it was alleged that the two vaccine makers may not have met their monthly production target. Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla said his company is producing 90 million doses a month which may see a 10 per cent increase in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/216-crore-or-135-crore-centre-clarifies-number-of-vaccine-doses-to-be-available-101625229916900.html
02-07-2021||India||Heat spell amid sowing a ‘worry’ but rains will revive: Met chief||New Delhi: The June-September monsoon, which is currently stalled as part of its natural stop-and-start cycles, is taking longer to revive, a delay that is “something to worry about”, said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, the chief of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The top meteorologist said he expected the showers to be active again by the third week of this month.The monsoon is the lifeblood of Asia’s third-largest economy, as nearly 60% of the country’s net-sown area doesn’t have irrigation access and half of all Indians depend on a farm-based livelihood.“The delay (in the revival of the monsoon) is something to worry [about] because crops like paddy, which are at the transplantation stage, at this time need to be soaking in water,” said Mohapatra. He said the lull in monsoon activity stretched longer than expected.The rain-bearing system also replenishes more than 80 nationally important reservoirs, critical for drinking, power supply, and irrigation.Also Read: Capturing Delhi’s unusual weather patterns this summerThe country is counting on farm output to cushion some of the economic impacts of a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections. In 2020-21, when India faced a recession due to the pandemic, agriculture was the only sector to record positive growth of about 3.1%. This helped to prop up the rural economy.“In the first week of July, monsoon will remain weak, it will pick up in the second week of July and return to normal by the third week of July,” Mohapatra said. The rains started on a promising note, arriving in Kerala, their first port of call in the Indian mainland, on June 3.From an agriculture point of view, July rainfall is the most critical, said Jeet Singh Sandhu, vice-chancellor of the SKN Agricultural University, Jaipur. “This is the prime time of sowing. Most Kharif crops have to be sown by July 15-20. We have another 15 days. So, at present, I don’t think there’s worry. But in areas where irrigation is not available, there will be an impact,” Sandhu added.The Met department has forecast a normal monsoon for the country as a whole for the third straight year, saying rainfall would be 98% of the 50-year average. According to the IMD’s classification, rains are considered normal if they are between 96% and 104%.Also Read: The monsoon is on a break. What it really meansThe Met chief said the Madden-Julian Oscillation, a global weather pattern that influences India’s monsoon, had not been favourable for a while. He added there were strong westerlies, or winds blowing in from the west, and a decrease in low-pressure formations, factors that lengthened the monsoon pause.An agriculture ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was no reason for any concern at this stage. “Pre-monsoon showers were good, so moisture levels (in soil) are good. Rains will revive soon. There is nothing to worry about,” the official said.Farmers in the food bowl states of Punjab and Haryana have come under pressure due to a lack of rain. Electricity demand has soared, resulting in long outages, forcing farmers to depend on costlier diesel to irrigate lands. “The main impact so far has been that farmers’ cost of cultivation has gone up,” said Balwinder Singh Sandhu, Punjab’s agriculture commissioner.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday ordered government officials to curtail office timings and curb supply to certain industries with high power consumption to save crops, an official statement said.Millions of farmers rely on the monsoon to plant crops such as rice, cane, corn, soybeans, cotton, nuts, and lentils.The dry spell has triggered a heatwave across much of north India, with Punjab facing a power crisis.Nearly 32 farm unions protesting three new farm laws have asked the Punjab government to ensure farms get at least eight hours of supply by July 5, said Balbir Singh Rajewal, a farm union leader.According to official data, power demand shot up to a new high on June 30, touching 191.24 gigawatts (GW), higher than the previous peak demand of 189.64 GW on January 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heat-spell-amid-sowing-a-worry-but-rains-will-revive-met-chief-101625230069328.html
02-07-2021||India||Health ministry allows Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant women||The Union health and family welfare ministry on Friday extended the vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to pregnant women. Acting on the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation's (NTAGI) recommendations, the health ministry said that pregnant women can register themselves for the jab on government-run CoWin portal. They are also eligible for walk-ins to the nearest Covid-19 Vaccination Centre (CVC).This comes days after Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary of the health ministry said that the NTAGI has recommended that the vaccination is safe for pregnant women.Meanwhile, the cumulative number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country crossed 34-crore on Friday, the Centre announced in a daily bulletin.As per the release, a total of 9,41,03,985 people in the age group of 18-44 across all states and Union territories have received their first dose and 22,73,477 received the second dose.The data showed that 34,00,76,232 vaccine doses were administered as per the provisional report till 7am, with over 42 lakh (42,64,123) doses being given in a span of 24 hours.Earlier on June 29, the health ministry issued guidelines for administering the Covid-19 vaccine to pregnant women. In the advisory, the ministry said, "after getting the vaccine injection, she can get a mild fever, pain at the injection site or feel unwell for 1-3 days. As per the advisory, they get the jab at any time during their pregnancy.The Union health ministry also said, "most pregnant women will be asymptomatic or have a mild disease, but their health may deteriorate rapidly and that might affect the foetus too." "It is important that they take all precautions to protect themselves from acquiring Covid-19, including taking vaccination against Covid-19. It is therefore advised that a pregnant woman should take Covid-19 vaccines," it added in the advisory.On side effects post vaccination, the ministry said that they can experience mild discomfort in their body. One may also experience soreness at the vaccinated spot accompanied with chills and slight fever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-allows-covid-19-vaccination-for-pregnant-women-101625228783485.html
02-07-2021||India||Hot and humid days ahead in NW India||Swathes of northwest India are facing a heatwave with most places in West Rajasthan, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab recording maximum temperatures of over 40 degrees C (°C). On Thursday, Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 43.1°C, 6.3°C above normal. Heatwave conditions are likely to abate gradually from Saturday. But heat-related discomfort will stay, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The wind direction was westerly and south-westerly. It was blowing mainly from the dry regions of Pakistan. The wind will blow from further south-westerly direction bringing moisture from the Arabian Sea.“Heatwave intensity and spatial coverage will reduce due to southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea. However, due to an increase in humidity in association with these winds, the human discomfort will continue during the next seven days,” M Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, said on Thursday.Also Read | Capturing Delhi’s unusual weather patterns this summerK Sathi Devi, who heads the National Weather Forecasting Centre, said the wind direction has started changing in lower levels as per their models. “Moisture incursion has started. There is a lot of heat in this region and when moisture-laden winds start blowing, there will be thunderstorm activity. We can expect some thunder and rain but that is not the monsoon. When humidity increases with heat obviously moist air will make it uncomfortable, but heat intensity will also reduce.”Mahesh Palawat, vice president, Skymet Weather, said the winds from the Arabian Sea will bring moisture and cause thunderstorms and some light pre-monsoon showers for five to six days. “The monsoon trough will move southwards from the foothills after a week or so. We can expect monsoon to set in over this region after that. There will be some relief from extreme heat due to the change in wind direction.”The northern limit of the southwest monsoon continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala, and Amritsar. It has been there since June 19.“Prevailing meteorological conditions, large scale atmospheric features and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, West Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab during next five to six days,” IMD said in its Friday bulletin. It added subdued rainfall activity was very likely to continue to prevail over the northwest, central, and western parts of Peninsular India during the next five to six days.IMD said isolated/scattered thunderstorm activity accompanied with lightning and rainfall is also likely over these regions during this period. Under the influence of strong moist southwesterly winds at lower tropospheric levels from the Bay of Bengal to the northeast and adjoining east India and a trough (area of low pressure) at mean sea level from northwest Rajasthan to east Assam, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall is very likely in Bihar, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya during the next five days.IMD said moderate to severe thunderstorms accompanied by frequent cloud to ground lightning are very likely in Bihar, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal, and Chhattisgarh during the next 24 hours.Dilip Malvankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar, said there are two important things happening this time. “This is not the heatwave season. Heatwaves normally end by mid-June. It is very late this time. Secondly, if the humidity goes up, the heat index (an index that combines air temperature and humidity) also goes up which is a huge risk for old and co-morbid people. Desert coolers will not work. It is best if people working outdoors have staggered work hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hot-and-humid-days-ahead-in-nw-india-101625228809297.html

Gogoi said the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court’s verdict will serve as a milestone for all those arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the NIA Act."My case proves the gross misuse of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the NIA Act. The verdict will be a milestone for those arrested through the misuse of the two legislations," the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act activist was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Gogoi, who has served 567 days in prison for his role in the anti-CAA agitation in Assam, said the investigative agency wanted to connect him to a 2013 case but were unable to because the court verdict was already out. "Even on Thursday, the NIA wanted to slap a fresh case but by the time they reached the court with the appeal, the verdict was already out," he said.Also Read: Offered bail by NIA for joining RSS, BJP, says jailed Assam activist Akhil Gogoi"When they took me into custody, their only question was whether I would join the RSS. Not once had they asked anything about my alleged links with Maoists. My CIO D R Singh never spoke about red rebels before me. He said that if I joined the RSS, I would be released in 10 days,” Gogoi stated"When I replied in negative, he offered me to join the BJP and become a minister. I refused that too. He then said that I would be jailed for 10 years," he added.The Raijor Dal chief was arrested on December 12, 2019, from Jorhat, at the height of the anti-CAA protests in Assam, as a "preventive measure" keeping in view the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. His three associates Jagajit Gohain, Bhupen Gogoi, and Bhaskarjit Phukan were also arrested the next day. Their cases were later handed over to NIA and they were booked under the stringent UAPA for their alleged role in the violent protests and possible Maoists links.Special NIA judge Pranjal Das ruled that his speeches did not abet violent activities and dismissed all charges against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhil-gogoi-on-his-release-pressure-of-executive-is-not-permanent-101625227306043.html

A real-life study has been conducted on police personnel of the state."The study is very simple. 4,868 police personnel were not vaccinated and out of them, 15 died of Covid-19, which translates to 3.08 per thousand," Dr Paul said.Out of 35,856 police personnel who received one dose of the vaccine, nine died, which translates to 0.25 per thousand.A total of 42,720 police personnel received both doses of the vaccine and 2 among them died, which translates to 0.05 per thousand."When we interpret these numbers, we find that one dose offers 92 protection from death while both doses offer a protection of 98 per cent," Dr Paul said adding that the study was done on police personnel as they belong to the high-risk group.As the Centre is claiming to have accelerated the pace of vaccination starting from June 21, experts are studying the real-life efficacy of the vaccines."CMC Vellore's study on healthcare workers too revealed similar efficacy. It is now scientifically established that vaccines are effective in protecting against death. There can be minor illnesses after vaccination, but vaccines eliminate the possibility of serious illness and death. This instils faith in our vaccine. We always talk about other vaccines but these studies reveal that our vaccines in real life are effective against Covid death," Dr Paul said.The study does not include the number of police personnel who got a breakthrough infection after getting vaccinated, Dr Paul said.Commenting on the third wave of Covid-19, Dr Paul said, "That is not in our hand. We must have all the preparation regarding infrastructure in rural areas, arrangement for children, IC beds, medicines etc. But our attempt would be to stall any new outbreak. And if we are disciplined, then this wave will not come."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-doses-of-covid-vaccine-provide-98-per-cent-protection-from-death-says-govt-citing-study-101625225685101.html

Researchers have linked this increase with the pandemic and termed this as 'antibiotic misuse'.Antibiotics are not at all effective for a viral infection like that of Covid-19 as they are only meant to fight bacterial infection, but such antibiotic misuse can actually increase the risk for drug-resistant infections, researchers have said.In the same period of time, 38 million more doses of azithromycin, sometimes prescribed for throat, nose infections, were sold in India, the study revealed.All US-authorised Covid-19 vaccines effective against Delta, Fauci explains whyThe study, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, analysed monthly sales of all antibiotics in India's private health sector from January 2018 through December 2020. The data came from an Indian branch of IQVIA, a US-based health information technology company, news agency PTI reported.What is antibiotic misuse?Antibiotic misuse/overuse is the administration of antibiotics when they are not needed. This makes bacteria harder to treat. "Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to global public health," said the study's senior author, Sumanth Gandra, an associate hospital epidemiologist at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in the US."Overuse of antibiotics lessens their ability to effectively treat minor injuries and common infections such as pneumonia, which means that these conditions can become serious and deadly," Gandra said, as quoted by PTI.What has the study revealed?According to the study, a total of 16.29 billion doses of antibiotics were sold in India in 2020, which is slightly less than the amounts sold in 2018 and in 2019. But when researchers focused on adult doses, usage increased from 72.6 per cent in 2018 and 72.5 per cent in 2019 to 76.8 per cent in 2020.The sales of azithromycin for adults in India increased from 4 per cent in 2018 and 4.5 per cent in 2019 to 5.9 per cent in 2020. Apart from azithromycin, the sales of doxycycline and faropenem, two antibiotics commonly used to treat respiratory infections, went up.The researchers noted that India also had restrictions and experienced dramatic decreases in malaria, dengue, chikungunya and other infections typically treated with antibiotics, which should have decreased the use of antibiotics.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-witnessed-increase-in-antibiotic-misuse-during-covid-1st-wave-study-101625223365704.html
02-07-2021||India||SC dismisses PIL seeking VK Singh’s removal for comments on China border row||The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking removal of Union minister General (retired) VK Singh over his 'controversial' comments from earlier in the year on the border standoff between India and China.Also Read | ‘Let’s hurt them economically’: General VK Singh on India-China border row"Somebody does not approve of comments made by a minister and so the solution is to file a petition in the Supreme Court to remove them? If he has done something, it is for the Prime Minister to act if it is inappropriate. The court cannot pass any orders," Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, who headed the three-judge bench which heard the case, was quoted as saying by Live Law. Justice AS Bopanna and Justice Hrishikesh Roy were the other two members of the bench.Singh, a former chief of staff of the Indian Army, made the contentious remark in February when he said, "None of you come to know how many times we have transgressed as per our perception. Chinese media does not cover it. Let me assure you, if China has transgressed 10 times, we must have done so at least 50 times."The PIL against Singh was filed by Tamil Nadu resident Chandrasekaran Ramasamy, who describes himself as a "scientist." On this, the bench said, "It looks like you are a scientist. You should use your abilities to do something for the country. We are dismissing the petition."Pointing to Singh's remark in his petition, Ramasamy alleged that the minister's statement was contradictory to the official stand taken by the Government of India and, in doing so, Singh, the minister of state for transport and highways, "committed a breach of his oath."Reacting to Singh's statement, China, which accuses India of being the "aggressor," had called it an "unwitting confession by the Indian side." India has always maintained that Chinese troops initiated the skirmishes in Ladakh and Sikkim in May last year, which later turned into a protracted standoff between the nuclear armed neighbours across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, which separates the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-pil-seeking-vk-singh-s-removal-for-comments-on-china-border-row-101625216045339.html
02-07-2021||India||SC refuses to stay TN law giving quota to Vanniyar community||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay the Tamil Nadu law passed in February 2021 granting 10.5% quota to Vanniyar community among the Most Backward Classes (MBC) even as it agreed to issue a notice to the Tamil Nadu government and tagged it along with similar petitions challenging the same law.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat noticed that petitions challenging the 2021 Act are pending in the top court as well as the Madras high court. In Tamil Nadu, by way of a 1994 law, 20% reservation in jobs and admissions is being provided to MBCs.In February 2021, then AIADMK government passed a law providing for internal reservation within this 20% quota. Among MBCs, this law benefited the Vanniyakula Kshatriya community most as the law allocated 10.5% quota to them. The remaining share of 9.5% was apportioned between Denotified Communities and other MBCs.Senior advocate S Nagamuthu appeared for the petition filed by S Sandeep Kumar questioning the validity of the law. He sought a stay of the law alleging that it was passed for political considerations in a hurried manner without any discussion. Moreover, he pointed out that on December 21, 2020, the state government appointed a one-man judicial committed headed by retired high court judge, justice (Retd) A Kulasekaran, to gather quantifiable data on the identified castes and tribes in the state. This committee is yet to submit its report.The petition filed through advocate P Sriram said, “The impugned Act has been passed without there being any quantifiable data relating to social and educational backwardness of the Vanniyakula Kshatriyas so as to classify the said community as a separate sub-clause within the most backward classes.”Nagamuthu told the court that due to such a law, despite the state having 122 MBCs, all reservation benefits have been cornered by one community. He said that the law was passed on the assumption that the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes Commission made recommendation for separate quota for Vanniyakula Kshatriya community.This was disputed by the petitioner saying, “TN Backward Classes Commission never recommended for separate quota for Vanniyakula Kshatriyas. It was a letter written to the government by justice (Retd) MS Janardhanan, the chairman of the Commission in his individual capacity. The commission had seven other members.The petition also questioned the timing of bringing the law. The then AIADMK government introduced the 2021 Bill on February 26 and passed it hours before the Election Commission announced the schedule for assembly elections in the state. “The Bill is politically motivated and to please Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), which is a splinter group of Vanniyakula Kshatriya community.” The PMK fought the TN state elections this year in alliance with AIADMK.The apex court gave the petitioner the option to approach the high court where the issue is already under consideration. Nagamuthu insisted the court to issue notice and keep it pending in the apex court along with similar other petitions.In addition to the MBC reservation of 20%, the Tamil Nadu law of 1994 has allocated quota benefits to 30% among other backward classes (OBC), 18% to Scheduled Castes and 1% to Scheduled Tribes. The 1994 law is under challenge before a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court for having exceeded the 50% cap fixed by Supreme Court in the 1992 Indira Sahwney judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/screfuses-to-stay-tn-law-giving-quota-to-vanniyar-community-101625222808615.html

He added Gandhi has an “innate hatred against Prime Minister Narendra Modi”, India’s people and that he is blinded by the “falsehood.”Also Read | From Tripura and the Nilgiris, a lesson for India“We all know that since 21 June vaccination drive witnessed a boost in India… and it has already given a protective shield to its 340 million citizens,” he said. Bhatia added India vaccinated over 8.1 million people on July 1.“... 6.2 million people have been vaccinated every 24 hours,” Bhatia said. He asked Gandhi to do some “homework” and see if there is any other nation in the world vaccinating people at such a rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-attacks-rahul-gandhi-over-his-tweet-on-covid-vaccine-101625220648367.html
02-07-2021||India||Solicitor General Tushar Mehta says did not meet BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari||Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Friday dismissed reports that he met Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari, saying that though Adhikari came to his residence to meet him, the meeting could not take place.Also Read: Trinamool wants PM Modi to fire Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. Here's why“Shri Suvendhu Adhikari did come to my residence cum office yesterday at around 3pm, unannounced. Since I was already in a pre-scheduled meeting in my chamber, my staff requested him to sit in the waiting room of my office building and offered him a cup of tea. When my meeting was over and my staff informed me about his arrival, I requested my staff to convey to Mr Adhikari my inability to meet him and apologise as he had to wait,” Mehta noted in a statement to Hindustan Times.“Mr Adhikari thanked my staff and left without insisting on meeting me. The question of my meeting Mr Adhikari, therefore, does not arise,” the statement further stated.Also Read: Mamata, Ghatak file new request in Calcutta high court ahead of Narada hearingEarlier in the day, the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking “immediate” removal of Mehta from the post of Solicitor General of India. “We strongly condemn Shri Tushar Mehta’s meeting with Shri Suvendu Adhikari, who has been accused of various offences that are currently being investigated. This raises some serious concerns about the integrity of the post held by the Learned Solicitor General,” the official TMC Twitter handle posted.The TMC letter, too, stated that Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the West Bengal assembly, is also an accused in various offences being investigated by agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Two such cases are the infamous Narada sting operation case and the Sarada chit fund case, the letter said. “Therefore, the various news reports containing videos of the alleged meeting between Adhikari and Mehta, who is advising such investigating agencies, shows that there is a direct conflict of interest with the statutory duties of the Solicitor General of India,” it noted further.Mehta is representing the CBI in the two cases.The development marks yet another faceoff between the TMC and the BJP in the wake of the bitterly contested West Bengal assembly elections in April-May. The BJP alleges that several of its workers were targeted by TMC after the Banerjee-led party won a third consecutive term. TMC, on the other hand, has dismissed the charge. On May 17, the CBI arrested three TMC leaders, including two cabinet ministers, as well as a former party leader in connection with the Narada case. On May 28, he four were later granted interim bail by the Calcutta high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/solicitor-general-tushar-mehta-says-did-not-meet-bjp-s-suvendu-adhikari-101625219856600.html

So far, we knew that owing to some injury, she could not stand and walk properly," Congress leader Narendra Saluja wrote posting the video. "May God keep her healthy always," he added.भोपाल की भाजपा सांसद साध्वी ठाकुर को अभी तक व्हील चेयर पर ही देखा था लेकिन आज उन्हें भोपाल में स्टेडीयम में बास्केट बॉल पर हाथ आज़माते देखा तो बड़ी ख़ुशी हुई…अभी तक यही पता था कि किसी चोट के कारण वो ठीक से खड़ी और चल फिर भी नही सकती है…?ईश्वर उन्हें हमेशा स्वस्थ रखे.. pic.twitter.com/UQrmsXkimeIn the video, the Bhopal MP could be seen dribbling a basketball and then in a perfect shot she sends the ball in the basket amid applause from people surrounding her.

Officials seen in the video were all wearing masks.Watch: BJP's Sadhvi Pragya plays basketball, Congress wonders about wheelchairIn March this year, Sadhvi Pragya was airlifted from Bhopal to Mumbai for treatment after she complained of breathing difficulty.

02-07-2021||India||TMC MPs write to PM Modi, seek removal of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta||Trinamool Congress lawmakers have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, seeking the removal of Tushar Mehta as the Solicitor General (SG) of India. This comes in the wake of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari’s reported meeting with Mehta in the national Capital, a claim that Mehta has denied. The letter, signed by party MPs Derek O’Brien, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy and Mahua Moitra, points out that Adhikari is an accused in the 2016 Narada sting operation case and Mehta is representing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the Supreme Court and Calcutta high court.Also Read | Post-poll violence: Calcutta HC orders Bengal govt to register all casesIt also says that the mastermind of the multi-crore chit Sarada chit fund scam, Sudipta Sen, had written to the authorities levelling “grave allegations” against Adhikari. Mehta has advised and appeared for the CBI in the case. “Such a meeting between an accused in grave offences with the SG, who is advising such agencies by whom the said accused is being investigated, is in direct conflict of interest with the statutory duties of the SG of India,” stated the letter. It also alleged that the meeting was organised to influence the outcome of the matters where Adhikari is an accused, by using high offices of the SG. “In order to avoid any doubt in the mind of the public at large, as to the integrity and neutrality of the office of the SG, we approach you to initiate necessary steps for removal of Tushar Mehta from the post of the SG of India,” the TMC MPs wrote in the letter to PM Modi. The SG later issued a statement denying that said meeting ever took place yesterday. He said, “Shri Suvendu Adhikari did come to my residence cum office yesterday at around 3pm, unannounced. Since I was already in a pre-scheduled meeting in my chamber, my staff requested him to sit in the waiting room of my office building and offered him a cup of tea. When my meeting was over and thereafter my PPS informed me about his arrival, I requested my PPS to convey Mr Adhikari my inability to meet him and apologise as he had to wait. Mr Adhikari thanked my PPS and left without insisting to meet me. The question of my meeting with Mr Adhikari therefore did not arise.”Even though Adhikari could not be contacted, the BJP said that Mehta’s statement should make it clear that the meeting never happened. “There is no proof that Adhikari met the Solicitor General. Mehta has clarified that Adhikari came to meet him but he could not meet the leader as he was busy. Those who are saying that the meeting took place should now substantiate their claims. Adhikari has also said the same thing. The question is how many persons the TMC would like to be removed from posts? They want the Governor to be removed because he is vociferous about the government. Now, they want the SG to be removed. In future, they may want the PM, home minister and even the President to be removed to survive,” said party chief in the state, Dilip GhoshReacting to Mehta’s statement, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who also happens to be the CM’s nephew, said only CCTV footage would reveal whether the meeting happened. “Reports state that Mr Adhikari entered Hon’ble SG’s residence in the presence of a cavalcade of officers and stayed there for nearly 30 minutes. Does that imply that a meeting was indeed due? As the episode gets murkier, one can only hope that the truth shall surface. Mr Mehta’s efforts to dismiss speculations regarding his clandestine meeting with @SuvenduWB can only be valuable if he makes all CCTV footage public until Mr Adhikari was in his residence. Moreover, was Mr Adhikari present in the SG’s residence without prior appointment ?” Banerjee tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mps-write-to-pm-modi-seek-removal-of-solicitor-general-tushar-mehta-101625218608027.html
02-07-2021||India||Odisha halts Covid vaccination amid dose shortage||The Odisha government on Friday halted Covid-19 vaccination in 17 of 30 districts amid a shortage of doses, even as 100,000 doses of Covishield arrived in the state.Additional chief secretary of health and family welfare department PK Mohapatra said with just 114,000 doses of Covishield vaccines left, the state government has to curtail the vaccination programme. “Odisha needs at least 9 million doses in July to achieve its daily vaccination targets of 300,000 doses. However, the supply has been erratic,” he said.Among the 17 districts where vaccination is being halted are four districts with high positivity rate - Balasore, Bhadrak, Cuttack and Kendrapara. On Thursday, vaccination was conducted in only 16 districts due to lack of doses.Also Read | Centre rushes expert teams to 6 states with rising Covid case loadThe state is targeting completion the vaccination ahead of the imminent Covid-19 third wave.Health and Family Welfare department officials said a consignment of 1 million Covishield vaccines are scheduled to reach the state by Saturday.

02-07-2021||India||No case: CCI closes case against Goa taxi unions over anti-competitive practices||The Competition Commission of India, which in 2018 took up a case on its own against Goa’s taxi unions for allegedly resorting to anti-competitive practices and cartelisation to deny entry to app-based aggregators, closed it on June 22. It cited lack of evidence and said no case was made out for violation of Section 3 of the Competition Act, 2002 (abuse of dominant position).The regulator took up the case based on newspaper reports. It also cited a change.org petition addressed to the Goa chief minister in 2017 for allowing the app-based taxi aggregator services in the state because of the “dismal state of affairs of public transport”.The Commission in 2018 directed its director-general to investigate the matter and submit a report. In its interim order, the regulator said the “conduct of taxi unions in not allowing any app-based service providers in the State of Goa, was putting a restraint on services based on technology and limiting the competition”.Also Read | Goa moves HC against Tejpal orderThe director-general submitted a report in January 2020, saying there were no fare meters and organised groups of taxi operators in Goa control the rates as well as the routes”. The report added tourists in Goa were being overcharged. It said the government introduced GoaMiles, a taxi smartphone app, “subsidising the taxi fares by almost half of what one would pay to a taxi driver off the street.”The report said the unions not only organised demonstrations and strikes but also physically intimidated various other stakeholders. It added anti-competitive practices reports were correct.The North Goa Tourist Taxi Owners Association contested the report saying it was solely based on selective newspaper reports and that “not even an attempt was made to consider and to investigate equally.” It pointed to the exclusion of “‘relevant material” in the form of news articles, studies, which reflected “poorly on the conduct of these app-based taxi aggregators”.The operators maintained they cannot be faulted for democratically and peacefully voicing their opposition against the entry of players, which directly impacted their livelihood. They pointed out that despite their so-called anti-competitive lobbying with the government, the latter formulated a policy for the aggregators. The policy allows the aggregators to operate and to have dynamic pricing.The Commission then ruled the actions of the taxi operators do not amount to an anti-competitive practice as defined in the Competition Act, 2002. It cited the government’s decision to allow the aggregators in Goa. “It is clear that despite the opposition, the State of Goa does not appear to have acceded to or conceded to the demands of the Ops (taxi operators), and the policy allowing entry of app-based taxi aggregators was eventually notified.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-case-cci-closes-case-against-goa-taxi-unions-over-anti-competitive-practices-101625216387866.html
02-07-2021||India||Trinamool wants PM Modi to fire Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. Here's why||Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress on Friday demanded the removal of Tushar Mehta as the Solicitor General of India on account of his meeting with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition leader in the West Bengal assembly. To this end, the Trinamool penned a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the immediate removal of Mehta from his post.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta's meeting with BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari raises "some serious questions about the integrity of the post", said Trinamool on this day.

(1/2) pic.twitter.com/PQTKtNR7LaThe letter said that Suvendu Adhikari, in addition to being a BJP leader, is also accused of various offences being investigated by the CBI and the ED. One of such cases is the Narada sting operation case, in which Adhikari was seen taking bribes in videos once publicly circulated by the BJP. The other is the Sarada chit fund case, where the key accused Sudipta Sen had raised grave allegations against Adhikari. In both these cases, the TMC noted, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta is representing the CBI and has appeared before the judiciary in that regard.Also Read | HC allows Mamata Banerjee to file affidavit in Narada caseAs such, the "various news reports containing videos" about the alleged meeting between Adhikari and Mehta, who is advising such investigative agencies, show that there is a "direct conflict of interest" with the statutory duties of the Solicitor General of India.In addition to news reports, the TMC in its letter also cited tweets by prominent personalities, who have questioned such a meeting. The letter also observed that the meeting, "curiously", took place right after Suvendu Adhikari met Union home minister Amit Shah."We have, therefore, reasons to believe that such a meeting has been organised to influence the outcome of matters where Suvendu Adhikari is an accused, using the high offices of the Learned Solicitor General," the TMC letter mentioned.

Punjab’s over-dependence on 3 private thermal plants at Rs. 5-8 per unit makes Punjab pay more than other states,” tweeted Sidhu.Also Read: Amid power tussle in Punjab, CM Amarinder meets leaders“Power purchase agreements (PPAs) - Badal Govt signed PPAs with 3 private thermal power plants in Punjab. Till 2020, Punjab has already paid 5400 crore due to faulty clauses in these agreements and is expected to pay 65,000 Crore of Punjab People’s Money just as fixed charges,” he added.Punjab has been witnessing power outages imposed by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), lasting up to six to eight hours in rural areas and for up to three hours in all major cities, as it is unable to meet the rising demand for electricity amid a paddy sowing season and soaring temperatures due to reduced generation.Farmers who were promised a power supply for eight hours are being supplied sufficient electricity for only six hours, which is marred by frequent interruptions. The gap between supply and demand reached 1,550 megawatts (MW) on Monday after the power demand reached 14,225 MW against a supply of 12,695 MW, Hindustan Times had reported.A PSPCL official told Hindustan Times that the current shortage is due to private power plants failure to supply the committed amount of electricity during a peak season, and even though the state has purchased 500 lakh units from the national grid it hasn’t been able to make up for the shortfall.Sidhu also suggested that the way forward for Punjab is to bring in new legislation in the assembly, to help cap purchase costs in accordance with the national power exchange, insisting it would be a better alternative to re-negotiating the PPAs signed by the SAD government, as it affords the state government no space for price negotiations.“Punjab can purchase power from national grid at much cheaper rates, but these Badal-signed PPAs are acting against Punjab’s Public Interest. Punjab may not be able to re-negotiate these PPAs due to them having legal protection from Hon’ble Courts, But there is a way forward,” the Congress MLA tweeted.“Punjab Vidhan Sabha can bring in New Legislation with retrospective effect to Cap power purchase costs to prices available on the National Power Exchange at any given time ... Thus, By amending the Law, these Agreements will become Null & Void, saving People of Punjab’s Money,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-need-for-power-cuts-if-navjot-singh-sidhu-tweets-solutions-for-punjab-s-crisis-101625213863341.html

According to the Delhi Police, the chief accused in the matter is Pushkar's husband, veteran Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, who is currently on bail in the case.Sunanda Pushkar, the wife of the then UN diplomat Shashi Tharoor, was found dead in a suite of a luxury hotel in New Delhi on the night of January 17, 2014. The preliminary probe indicated that Pushkar had committed suicide, but later reports revealed that the cause of her death was unnatural. The autopsy report indicated that at the time of her death, Pushkar was under drug overdose -- "most likely a combination of sedatives, other strong medicines, and probably alcohol." Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, her husband, was later charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including abetment to suicide and cruelty.At the Delhi court hearing on Friday, the public prosecutor insisted that Sunanda Pushkar had undergone mental cruelty, resulting in her bad health. It was also argued that the death was not accidental, according to the post-mortem report. The prosecutor stressed that Pushkar's death could have been a result of oral or injected poisoning.The Rouse Avenue court in Delhi is supposed to pass its order on the issue of framing of charges. Notably, Tharoor has been charged-sheeted by the Delhi Police under Sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, the Congress leader, represented by his legal counsel Vikas Pahwa, has argued that there is no admissible evidence against him and the theory of injecting poison. Special Judge Geetanjali Goyal recently had kept the order reserved after prosecution and defense counsel concluded their arguments on the issue of framing of charges.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunanda-pushkar-death-case-delhi-court-adjourns-order-on-framing-of-charges-against-shashi-tharoor-101625210960579.html

The quadcopter retreated after it was fired at by the BSF personnel, officials said."Alert BSF troops fired at small quadcopter belonging to Pakistan on Friday morning at about 0425 hrs (4:25am) as it was trying to cross IB in Arnia sector. Due to this firing, it returned back immediately," BSF said in a statement.NS Jamwal, BSF's Jammu frontier inspector general, said they searched the area and but did not find any arms or ammunition.Security measures have been tightened and forces are on high alert after the unprecedented unmanned drone attack on Indian Air Force (IAF) station on Sunday in Jammu.

Petrol is currently being sold at ₹100.13 per litre in the city.With this, all districts in Tamil Nadu have crossed the ₹100 mark, said KP Murali, president, Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers Association. “It crossed the ₹100 mark due to oil companies increasing prices everyday as per the administration’s price mechanism and depending on the daily crude market rate,” said Murali.This mark was breached in several parts of the city, while in a few outlets, petrol was being sold at ₹99.80 per litre. “The price isn’t uniform due to transport costs incurred from bulk fuel supply terminals to fuel stations,” said Murali.Also Read | Petrol jumps 35 paise/litre, but diesel price remains unchangedThe price of diesel, however, remained the same for a third consecutive day at ₹93.72 per litre.

02-07-2021||India||Shashi Tharoor learns a new word, takes a dig at PM Modi's beard||Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has made a comeback with his witty word usage on Twitter and this time it is a subtle dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Tharoor dropped the new word, pogonthropy, and explained its meaning on the microblogging platform on Thursday night after a Twitter user asked him to share a new "out of the box" word to learn. "My friend Rathin Roy, the economist, taught me a new word today: pogonotrophy, which means "the cultivation of a beard". As in, the PM's pogonotrophy has been a pandemic preoccupation...," Tharoor responded to the Twitter user.Pogonthropy refers to the act of cultivating, or growing and grooming, a mustache, beard, sideburns, or other facial hair. Pogonthropy, Greek in origin, finds its advent in mid 19th century with its earliest usage in The Westminster Review, according to the Lexico dictionary.Tharoor keeps dropping new words and creates a buzz around them on social media. The member of Parliament, who represents Thiruvananathapuram in the Lok Sabha, shared his word of the day on Twitter in January this year to respond to former players from Down Under. Tharoor shared the word epicaricacy along with an image of former cricketers who had predicted India’s defeat.“#WordIfTheDay: epicaricacy! I am not the gloating kind but there’s a special pleasure in reading these comments today... When everything else has been said,what remains but “wow”?! #IndvsAus,” Tharoor tweeted.In 2018, Tharoor used this fancy habit to take a dig at his trolls when he said they suffered from lalochezia. “Every day, I encounter on @Twitter people suffering from lalochezia! All too often they direct their suffering at me & others who support my beliefs,” Tharoor said in a tweet.Tharoor's fascination with big words, which often make readers look for dictionaries, has also humorously backfired.In May this year, Telangana minister K Taraka Rama Rao, known as KTR, made his discomfort with names of Covid-19 medicine public. On a 'lighter note', the minister listed out the names of the medicines, which include Posaconazole, Cresemba, Tocilizumab, Remdesivir, Liposomal Amphotericin, Flavipiravir, Molnupiravir, Baricitinib etc. The list is long the minister said jokingly hinting that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor may have something to do with these names.Responding to the comical allegation, Tharoor said he is not guilty of naming these medicines. Had it been left to him, the Congress leader would have happily called them 'CoroNil', 'CoroZero' and even 'GoCoronaGo'. "But these pharmacists are more procrustean..." Tharoor said. He also accused KTR of floccinaucinihilipilification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shashi-tharoor-learns-a-new-word-takes-a-dig-at-pm-modi-s-beard-101625202176030.html

A similar projected investment from such proposals is also expected to employ 50,000 people in Kashmir as per the government, therefore giving a potential employment impetus to UT with 84,000 jobs.Anoo Malhotra, director, industries and commerce, Jammu, who is also the member secretary of the high-level land allotment committee said that the decision ushers a “new era of growth, industrialisation, and employment generation in J&K besides promoting a culture of entrepreneurship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-govt-approves-land-allotment-for-15-projects-in-jammu-101625208886921.html

Union health minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan asked why the Congress leader keeps repeatedly raising accusations of vaccine shortage, especially when the government has publicly released facts on vaccine availability for the month of July. On the other hand, Union minister Piyush Goyal clarified that 120 milliOn vaccine doses will be made available in July, of which states have already been informed in advance.Questioning the government on vaccine availability, Rahul Gandhi had said earlier this day, "It's July already, yet there are no vaccines." The Congress leader asked, "Where are vaccines?"जुलाई आ गया है, वैक्सीन नहीं आयीं।#WhereAreVaccinesResponding to Gandhi's question, Union health minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan, in turn, asked, "What is Rahul Gandhi's problem? Does he not read? Does he not understand?" The minister added that he had a day ago put out "facts" regarding vaccine availability for the month of July. "There is no vaccine for the virus of arrogance and ignorance," he remarked, adding that Congress must think about a "leadership overhaul".Just yesterday, I put out facts on vaccine availability for the month of July.

He further clarified that 120 million Covid-19 vaccine doses will be available in July, which is separate from the supply of private hospitals.वैक्सीन की 12 करोड़ डोज़ जुलाई महीने में उपलब्ध होंगी, जो प्राइवेट हॉस्पिटल्स की आपूर्ति से अलग है। राज्यों को 15 दिन पहले ही आपूर्ति के बारे में सूचना दी जा चुकी है। राहुल गांधी को समझना चाहिये कि कोरोना से लड़ाई में गंभीरता के बजाय इस समय ओछी राजनीति का प्रदर्शन उचित नही है। https://t.co/xmDqtrLcLINotably, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been a harsh critic of the central government's vaccination policy for months. He has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on numerous counts, to end the 'shortage' of vaccine doses in the country, a claim that the BJP-led government has debunked as a lie.Meanwhile, an acute vaccine shortage has been reported from various parts of the country. the Odisha government halted the vaccination drive in 16 districts due to a "shortage" of Covishield doses. Meanwhile, Assam on Thursday said it could vaccinate only 16.63 lakh people in the last 10 days, almost 45% less than the target set by state chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, due to a massive shortage of Covid-19 vaccines.In Maharashtra, the administration suspended the vaccination drive across 281 civic-run centers and 20 government-run centers in Mumbai due to a shortage of stocks.

02-07-2021||India||Petrol jumps 35 paise/litre, but diesel price remains unchanged||State-run fuel retailers on Friday raised petrol prices by 35 paise per litre after a gap of two days, but spared a diesel price hike, thus decoupling the synchronous movements of the two fuels rates for the first time in last 60 days. The 33rd price hike in about two months has made petrol costlier by ₹8.76 per litre since May 4, a day after results of five assembly polls were declared. Although, diesel rates remained unchanged on Friday, it rose by ₹8.45 per litre in the previous 32 rounds. With the latest hike, petrol rates in Delhi and Kolkata have come close to the ₹100 mark. Petrol in Delhi is priced at ₹99.16 per litre, and ₹99.04 in Kolkata. While fuel rates in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies. Petrol has, however, crossed the ₹100 mark in Chennai for the first time and currently being sold at ₹100.13 a litre in the southern city. Petrol is priced at ₹105.24 per litre in Mumbai and ₹102.48 in Bengaluru. Highest fuel rates have been recorded in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar, where new rate of petrol is ₹110.40 per litre, while diesel is sold at ₹102.42 a litre. Also Read | Delhi airport sees increase in passengers but rising fuel costs may impact faresThe unidirectional upward movement Since May 4 already saw petrol already crossing ₹100 mark in various cities across the country, particularly in states and UTs of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Manipur, Jammu & Kashmir, Laddakh, Punjab, Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Some of the cities selling petrol for over ₹100 per litre are Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar, Banswara, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Guntur, Kakinada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga, Hyderabad, Leh, Imphal, Kalahandi, Sopore, Baramulla, Patna, Salem, Thiruvananthapuram, Mohali and Darjeeling. Surging international oil rates and exorbitant domestic tax structure are two key reasons for high rates of petrol and diesel in pumps. Domestic fuel retailers align pump prices of petrol and diesel with respective international benchmarks of previous day, which often move in tandem with crude oil rates. International oil prices rally continued on Friday after producers’ cartel – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+) – on Thursday decided to restore less than expected supply even as global oil demand is growing. Benchmark Brent crude, which surged 1.6% at $75.84 a barrel on Thursday, was trading 0.09% up at $75.91 on early Friday -- highest since October 2018. In Delhi, central levies account for 34.03% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23.08%, according to an official data of June 16. On diesel, central taxes are over 36.38% while state taxes are about 14.63%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenues hit on account of the pandemic. Even as international oil prices saw volatility since May 4, pump rates of auto fuels in India moved only in the upward direction. For instance, despite Brent crude had plunged to $65.11 on May 20, the lowest in these 46 days; petrol and diesel rates went up the next day by 19 paise per litre and 29 paise a litre, respectively. According to executives working in state-run oil marketing companies, pump prices are also high because companies were recovering their past revenue losses like the one suffered for 66 days since February 27 when rates were not raised because of assembly elections in four states and one Union territory. During the 66-day pause on rate hike, state-run retailers had also reduced politically sensitive petrol and diesel rates by 77 paise and 74 paise a litre, respectively in four small steps. But, the entire gains to the consumers were quickly reversed in the first four consecutive rounds of rate hikes starting from May 4. The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)— controls almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-jumps-35-paise-litre-but-diesel-price-remains-unchanged-101625205707143.html
02-07-2021||India||Delta: List of vaccines that are claimed to be effective against this Covid variant||As the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is emerging as the new threat across the world, vaccine makers are releasing data on whether their product is effective against this variant. Among all the variants, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, Delta has proved to be the most virulent. First reported from India in October 2020, this variant is now present in 96 countries and is on its way to replace Alpha, first reported from the United Kingdom, as the dominant strain.Here is how effective the present vaccines are against Delta strain.Studies have revealed that Covid variants reduce the neutralising antibody levels created by vaccines. Based on these reduction figures, data on how effective these vaccines are against various variants, are available internationally.Pfizer: Delta variant results in a 7 to 10 fold reduction in the neutralising antibody levels of Pfizer.Moderna: Dela variant causes a 7 to 10 fold reduction in neutralising antibody levels of Moderna.Covaxin: Bharat Biotech's Covaxin sees a three-fold reduction in neutralising antibody levels against the Delta variant.Covishield: Covishield or Oxford- Astrazeneca vaccine's effect gets reduced two fold against Delta.While these are based on laboratory findings, Johnson and Johnson has carried out a sample study on 28 people vaccinated with J&J and claimed that its vaccine can neutralise the Delta variant.Russia-made Sputnik has also claimed that its vaccine is effective against the Delta variant, though Russia at present is witnessing a third wave of the pandemic.ZyCov-D, another Indian vaccine after Covaxin, which will be the world's first three-dose, needle-free, DNA vaccine has also claimed that the vaccine in the clinical trial proved to be effective against the Delta variant. The phase 3 clinical trial of the vaccine was conducted during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 in the country and hence the vaccine is believed to be effective against the Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-list-of-vaccines-that-are-claimed-to-be-effective-against-this-covid-variant-101625204722242.html

02-07-2021||India||Pakistan quadcopter spotted entering India, flies back after BSF fires at it||A quadcopter from Pakistan tried to enter Indian territory along the international border from Jammu's Arnia sector early on Friday but retreated after it was fired at by the personnel of the Border Security Force or BSF. According to an intelligence official, the movement of the drone was noticed near the border outpost Jabowal.BSF said that the spy quadcopter was trying to get into the Indian territory for "surveillance of the area". "Alert BSF troops fired at small quadcopter belonging to Pakistan on Friday morning at about 0425 hrs (4.25 am) as it was trying to cross IB in Arnia sector. Due to this firing, it returned back immediately," the force said in a statement."The quadcopter was flying between Zero Line and the border fence. It was fired upon by the alert BSF personnel... We have searched the area and have found no arms and ammunition," NS Jamwal, BSF's Jammu frontier inspector general, said.Also read: Drones a clear, present threat, says army chiefThe sighting of the quadcopter comes five days after the drone attack was carried out on the Indian Air Force station in Jammu on Sunday. At least two personnel were injured in the attack. The attack was the first-ever offensive use of drones to target an Indian military facility. The technology used in the aerial attack in Jammu indicated “state support and the possible involvement of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba terror groups,” Lieutenant General DP Pandey, who heads the Srinagar-based 15 Corps, said on Wednesday.Drones, the latest threat in the security affairs of the country, have been sighted for four consecutive days over military stations in Kaluchak, Ratnuchak, Sunjuwan and Kunjwani.Spotlighting the threat posed by such incidents, Indian Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Thursday that the easy availability of drones allowed both state and non-state actors to use them, increasing the complexity of challenges faced by the security forces.Highlighting the easy availability of devices such as the ones used in Jammu on June 27 -- and several other drones seen and repelled in the region’s Kaluchak area over the past week -- he said that building drones was akin to a “DIY project that could be tackled at home”.Also read: Army jawan killed in encounter with terrorists at Jammu and Kashmir's PulwamaPakistan Rangers have been regularly violating the international boundary through drone intrusions and trying to drop arms and ammunition in the Indian territory but have been successfully repulsed by BSF troops on the border, BSF officials have said.

02-07-2021||India||Can you mix and match Covid-19 vaccines? Here’s what studies say||Several studies conducted to test the efficacy of switching Covid-19 vaccines are underway and the latest research last month said that mix-and-match inoculation, where a shot of Pfizer's vaccine was given after an AstraZeneca shot, produced more antibodies than two AstraZeneca jabs. Several countries like the UK, Canada, Italy and the UAE are among those that have allowed mix-and-match inoculation, which scientists hope will have benefits. The decision to allow the mix and match combinations of the two different Covid-19 vaccines has come amid supply delays and safety concerns.Also read | Scientifically Speaking | Considering a mix and match approach to Covid vaccinesIn June, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi took the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine different from his first—as the 73-year-old switched to Pfizer-BioNTech jab for his second dose. Draghi previously received an AstraZeneca vaccine. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also received a Moderna vaccine after getting AstraZeneca for her first dose.What do scientists say about the benefits of mix-and-match of vaccines?Researchers in the past have experimented with mixing vaccines in fighting a handful of other diseases, like Ebola. Combinations of rotavirus vaccines have also been used and tested in India. Scientists say that giving people two different vaccines might generate a stronger immune response, perhaps because the shots stimulate slightly different parts of the immune system or teach it to recognise different parts of an invading pathogen.Also read | Mixing different Covid-19 vaccines theoretically possible, says Centre“The argument is that one and one makes three. How well that argument holds up in practice in the Covid area is going to need to be judged by the actual data,” John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine, told the New York Times.Zhou Xing, an immunologist at McMaster University in Canada said mixing and matching also “offers much-needed flexibility when vaccine supplies are uneven or limited,” according to the New York Times.What do the data say about mix-and-match of vaccines?A University of Oxford study, called Com-COV, has said alternating vaccines where a shot of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine is given four weeks after an AstraZeneca shot will produce better immune responses than giving another dose of AstraZeneca. Researchers compared mixed two-dose schedules of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines and found that they produced high concentrations of antibodies against the coronavirus spike protein in any combination. Matthew Snape, the lead investigator behind the trial, said that the findings could be used to give flexibility to vaccine rollouts, but was not large enough to recommend a broader shift away from clinically approved schedules on its own.Also read | Vaccine dose mix-up may not be a problem, says Centre as 20 in UP get 2 different shots"It's certainly encouraging that these antibody and T-cell responses look good with the mixed schedules. But I think your default has to stay, unless there's a very good reason otherwise, to what is proven to work," Snape told reporters referring to the same-shot vaccine schedules assessed in clinical trials.The US National Institutes of Health recently launched a trial of mixed booster doses. Russian researchers have said they are testing a combination of their Sputnik V vaccine and the AstraZeneca shot. Sputnik is based on a mix-and-match approach as its first and second shots have different formulations.Spanish researchers announced in June that people who received a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, followed by a dose of the Pfizer vaccine, showed a robust immune response.Is it safe?The preliminary data from Oxford’s Com-COV study suggests that mixing and matching vaccines may increase the odds of mild and moderate side effects, including fever, fatigue and headache. Most side effects faded within 48 hours, researchers found. They said that this suggests that a mismatched regimen “might have some short-term disadvantages”. It could also be possible that the side effects may be a sign of a strong immune response.What has been India’s response?In May, Dr NK Arora, the chairperson of Covid-19 working group under the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) said that India may soon start testing the mix and match approach to Covid-19 vaccines. “We will be looking at the feasibility of testing the two-dose Covid-19 vaccine regimen but with different vaccines, for which testing may start in few weeks. Dosing interval will also be examined, that includes whether a single dose or a dose followed by a booster shot or so on works better,” Arora said.At least 20 people in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharthnagar district in May were administered Covishield as their first dose and Covaxin as their second one. After that, the Centre said that administering two different doses of vaccines is not a cause for concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-you-mix-and-match-covid-19-vaccines-here-s-what-studies-say-101625197032542.html
02-07-2021||India||Uttarakhand chief minister stays back in Delhi amid much speculation||Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Thursday stayed back in New Delhi after meeting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah. Rawat rushed to New Delhi on Wednesday after he was summoned there following the conclusion of a state BJP meeting in Nainital. Since then, there has been much speculation as Rawat needs to get elected to the state assembly by September 10 to continue as the chief minister. Rawat took over as the chief minister in March. There are two assembly seats vacant in the state. The notification for the by-polls has to be issued before August 5. Normally by-polls are not held if the remaining tenure of a legislature is less than a year.The state BJP leaders remained tight-lipped about the developments in New Delhi claiming Rawat was there to discuss the 2022 assembly elections. Also Read | ‘CM, Sidhu will have a working arrangement’: Harish RawatDushyant Kumar Gautam, the BJP’s state in-charge, said coordination between the state and the Centre is important and that is why Rawat has gone to Delhi. “Also, with the next assembly elections ahead, there ought to be many issues which need to be discussed. All those would be discussed during the visit. As far as speculation is concerned, they are always there around any political personality.”Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is trying to make inroads into Uttarakhand, has announced Ajay Kothiyal, a retired army officer, will contest against Rawat from the Gangotri seat. Rawat is expected to seek his election from Gandotri. But no final call has been taken yet.AAP leader Naveen, who uses only one name, accused the BJP of “gross injustice” to the state’s people by imposing two “rubber stamp” chief ministers on them. “First Trivendra Singh Rawat and now Tirath Singh Rawat.”AAP has announced it will contest all 70 seats assembly seats next year. It is banking on Kothiyal’s background and his popularity in the state for his significant contribution to the reconstruction work of the Kedarnath shrine post-2013 floods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-chief-minister-stays-back-in-delhi-amid-much-speculation-101625198925738.html

The fresh Covid-19 cases have taken India's cumulative tally of infections to 30,458,251.In the last 24 hours, India also recorded 853 deaths. So far, 400,312 people have succumbed to Covid-19 in the country.Active cases of Covid-19 in the country continued to decline and were logged at 509,637 on Friday. The cumulative recoveries in the country have also continued to outnumber the daily new infections for 50 days in a row. On Friday, at least 59,384 people recovered, taking the national recovery rate to 96.97%.Follow HT's full coverage of Covid-19 hereDeclining cases, the health ministry said, are a result of sustained and collaborative efforts by the Centre and the states and Union territories.According to the data reviewed by HT, the death toll from the country’s brutal second wave appears to be significantly higher than what official numbers suggest. Even as the pandemic has been in the country for over a year, more than 60% of all reported deaths have been recorded in just the last four months – or during the second wave of infections, data showed.All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) chief Dr Randeep Guleria said on Thursday the country may be able to avoid the next wave of Covid-19 if people follow Covid-19 safety protocols and if a large chunk of the population is vaccinated against the disease. "That depends on how we behave, if we are careful and we have a good vaccination coverage, then the third wave may not come, or it will be very little," Dr Guleria said.The senior doctor that at this stage, there is not much data available on the Delta plus variant to suggest that it is more infective or has a higher rate of mortality. "There isn't much data on Delta plus variant to suggest it's more infectious, causing more deaths, or has developed significant immune escape mechanism. But if we follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated, we'll be safe against any of emerging variants," Dr Guleria said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-46-617-fresh-covid-19-cases-daily-infections-under-50k-for-5-days-101625192713169.html

02-07-2021||India||‘Break’ monsoon likely to disrupt sowing of crops, says IMD||The country will receive “normal” rain in July, between 94% and 106% of long period average, but monsoon will revive only during the second week, India Meteorological Department said in its forecast for the month on Thursday. It also cautioned that subdued monsoon conditions during the next seven days are likely to impact agricultural activities like sowing and transplantation of crops, irrigation scheduling, etc, and also affect power requirements. Crops sown early will require protective irrigation to stop soil moisture from evaporating. But the sowing of other major crops like rice in northwest and central India may not be affected. During July, when most of monsoon rain happens normally, "below normal" (<94%) to "normal" (94% to 106%) rain is likely over most areas of northwest India, parts of south peninsular, central, east and northeast India, IMD said in its forecast. Also Read | Delhi, reeling under scorching heatwave, looks to thunderstorm alert for respite"Normal" to "above normal" (>105%) rainfall is likely over parts of central India and adjacent areas of peninsular India and Gangetic plains in July. The latest global model forecasts indicate that the prevailing neutral El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions are likely to continue over the equatorial Pacific Ocean and that there is an enhanced possibility of development of negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions over the Indian Ocean during the July to September period. “While neutral ENSO conditions don’t affect the monsoon, negative IOD conditions are not favourable to Indian monsoon. This is because the sea surface temperatures are higher in the eastern equatorial Indian ocean while cooler sea temperatures are found near the Somalia coast, so it doesn’t support the monsoon progress. There is, however, still a high probability of normal monsoon over the country during July,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD. As sea surface temperature (SST) conditions over the Pacific and the Indian oceans are known to have strong influence on Indian monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring them, IMD said in its statement. ENSO is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rain, flood, and drought. Like ENSO, the change in temperature gradients across the Indian Ocean results in changes in the preferred regions of rising and descending moisture and air which is called the IOD according to Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Mohapatra said monsoon covered most parts of the country except parts of northwest India, including Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, parts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan by June 19 but monsoon flow started weakening from June 26 onwards. This was mainly because of strengthening of mid-latitude westerly winds which weakened the flow of easterly monsoon winds; unfavourable Madden Julian Oscillation location; and absence of formation of any low-pressure system over North Bay of Bengal which could bring rain. Spatially, monsoon coverage reduced significantly in the past two days and the monsoon is unlikely to revive in the next seven to 10 days, Mohapatra said. “There is a chance that a low-pressure area will form over the Bay of Bengal around July 11 or 12. There is no chance of monsoon picking up very much before that,” added Mohapatra. “Break monsoon phases occur during monsoon. There have been some break monsoon phases which have lasted for 10 days. This is not a record of a situation but cannot be called normal either,” Mohapatra said during the briefing. June last week to July first week is the most critical period for farming. For south India most of the sowing happens around June 15. Those sowing late will not be able to do so and those who have sown crops those crops may not germinate when there is such a large gap in rain. The yield will be significantly affected and farmers will have to depend on contingency crops. They may choose short duration crops like millets, green gram etc but those are also difficult to source. In northwest India there is no rain till now so only those supported by irrigation will go ahead. This is a significant setback,” said G V Ramanjaneyulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Hyderabad.Humidity likely to increase over NW IndiaHeat wave conditions are very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and some parts of Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan, and northwest Madhya Pradesh during the next couple of days. But it is likely to decrease in intensity and coverage due to south-westerly winds from the Arabian Sea. Scientists are expecting south-westerly winds from Arabian Sea to affect the northwest region, including Delhi, for a week which will help abate heat wave conditions, but humidity will increase and may lead to very uncomfortable conditions as the impact of heat will be accentuated with high humidity. Flooding likely in NE Under the influence of strong, moist south-westerly winds from Bay of Bengal blowing to the northeastern states and parts adjoining east India, widespread and very heavy to occasionally extremely heavy (over 20 cm) rain is very likely over Bihar, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim and northeastern states during the next five days. Continuous rain is very likely to increase the inflow to rivers and reservoirs originating in the Himalayas, leading to flood like situation in some catchments, IMD has warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/break-monsoon-likely-to-disrupt-sowing-of-crops-says-imd-101625196645041.html

Upon learning that I am the Afghan ambassador to India, the doctor refused to accept any payment...,” the envoy tweeted in Hindi. “When I asked the reason, he told me that I can do very little for Afghanistan and that is why I won’t charge a brother... This is India – love, respect, values and compassion. Because of you my friend, Afghans cry a little less, smile a little more...” On seeing Mamundzay’s tweet, a resident of Haripura village in Rajasthan asked him to visit the area. Mamundzay asked whether this was Haripura village in Gujarat.Modi said Mamundzay’s remarks reflected the special India-Afghanistan ties.“What you have shared about your experience with a doctor from India gives the scent of the fragrance of India-Afghanistan relations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmlauds-afghan-envoy-s-tweets-on-indian-doctor-101625190243541.html

One of the marquee programmes for the first as well as the second term of the government, Digital India is a set of initiatives meant to encourage the uptake of services and commerce over the internet.On Thursday, Modi said gains from such initiatives will further emerge as India bridges the gap between government services and people’s access to them. “This presents a massive opportunity for India, together we will be successful in making this decade India’s techade,” Modi said.“The digital India mission has enabled the implementation of the one nation, on ration card scheme and helped ease access to services for millions of people during the Covid-19 pandemic.”The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed all states and Union territories to implement the ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ scheme by July 31. The singular ration card system has been looked at as a crucial technology-driven solution at a time when rural migrants were stranded at their places of work due to Covid-19 lockdown.Interacting with the beneficiaries of Digital India schemes, Modi said direct benefit transfer helped send money to crores of people. “At a time when developed countries were unable to send aid to their citizens due to the lockdown, India was sending thousands of crores of rupees directly to the bank accounts of the people...”“Under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, ₹1.35 lakh crore have been deposited directly into the bank account of more than 10 crore farmer families. Digital India has also realized the spirit of One Nation, One MSP...”Experts have seen Digital India as having played crucial role in advancing India’s fintech sector and inclusion of more people into the financial system. “The government’s focus on trying to get so much of India digitised is laudable... they need to focus on protecting Indians data rights as well...,” Raman Chima, Asia-Pacific policy director at Access Now, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-make-this-decade-india-s-techade-modi-101625188718574.html

Joint security forces, including the personnel of the army, the Pulwama Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), cornered the terrorists in the Hanjin Rajpora area of Pulwama, according to officials.#Encounter has started at Hanjin Rajpora area of #Pulwama. Police and security forces are on the job. Further details shall follow. @JmuKmrPoliceJammu and Kashmir: An encounter is underway between terrorists and security forces in Hanjin Rajpora area of Pulwama(Visuals deferred by unspecified time) pic.twitter.com/W9VeTbFN2CThe Pulwama encounter saw heavy firing from both sides. One soldier was injured in the initial exchange of firing with militants, an official was quoted as saying by PTI. He added that the jawan succumbed to injuries at a hospital in Kashmir.A search operation, reportedly launched in the area by joint security forces, triggered the gunfight. The said search and cordon operation was conducted based on inputs suggesting a number of terrorists had taken shelter at the Hanjin village in the Rajpora area of Pulwama district.As soon as the security forces reached the suspected hideout in the course of the search operation, the terrorists opened fire on them, according to the report. The security forces then took the lead and retaliated with heavy gunfire.There has been no report of casualties yet; however, as many as three to four terrorists are believed to be trapped in the encounter.On a related note, security forces gunned down two terrorists yesterday at another encounter in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam district.

02-07-2021||India||Recovered pistol not used in Dabholkar murder: Officials||Almost 17 months after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) recovered a pistol from Kharegaon creek in the Arabian Sea with the help of Norwegian deep-sea divers, ballistics experts have said it is not the weapon used in the murder of rationalist and anti-superstition crusader Narendra Dabholkar in August 2013, as was originally hypothesised, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.The development is a major setback for CBI, which, along with anti-terror units from Maharashtra and Karnataka, spent at least ₹7.5 crore to recover the weapon from the seabed; the recovery was also seen as a major breakthrough in the case.HT reported on March 5 last year that to find the weapon, the agency hired a Dubai-based firm, Envitech Marine Consultants, which, in turn, brought in deep-sea explorers and machinery from Norway and scoured the creek at Thane for months.One of the shooters, Sharad Kalaskar, also an accused in the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh in Bengaluru in 2017, dismantled four country-made pistols by taking out their barrels and sliders and threw them from a bridge in Kharegaon creek in Thane on his way from Pune to Nallasopara on July 23, 2018, according to a previous claim by CBI. The agency suspected the pistol fished out by the Norwegian divers was one of the four thrown by Kalaskar.The people cited above said ballistics experts at Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), after a thorough examination, have said the pistol recovered from the seabed doesn’t match with the markings on the fired bullets (of 7.65mm) and three spent cartridges, recovered from crime scene at Omkareshwar bridge in Shaniwar Peth, Pune. Dabholkar was on a walk on August 20, 2013 when Sachin Andure and Kalaskar shot him at this spot, according to the agency.A senior official familiar with the expert opinion said: “It’s a known fact that no two firearms, even of same make and model, will produce the same markings on a bullet or a cartridge. But bullets fired from same weapon and its cartridges can be easily matched and that’s what the forensic experts were trying by cleaning and firing the pistol recovered by us. Unfortunately, it didn’t match.”“We will continue looking for the murder weapon,” he added.CBI didn’t comment on the development officially.Advocate Virendra Ichalkaranjikar, one of the defence lawyers, said: “It could not have matched. What was alleged to be thrown in the creek were parts of a pistol. So, there was no way that a complete pistol will come out of it.”Dabholkar’s murder, CBI believes, is linked to the killing of Lankesh, the February 16, 2015 killing of activist Govind Pansare in Kolhapur, and the August 2015 murder of Kannada scholar MM Kalburgi. CBI, which is probing the Dabholkar murder since 2014, has already filed three chargesheets in the case, naming seven people, including the alleged mastermind Virendra Tawade (an ENT surgeon), advocate Sanjeev Punalekar, Vikram Bhave, Sharad Kalaskar and Sachin Andure.CBI has claimed that Kalaskar visited Punalekar in June 2018 and revealed his role in the killing of Dabholkar. In response, according to the agency, Punalekar told Kalaskar to destroy the firearms used in the killings.Punalekar is out on bail since 2019 while Vikram Bhave was granted bail by the Bombay high court in May. CBI and Maharashtra police recently informed the HC that trial in both Dabholkar and Pansare murders can begin, but their probe will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recovered-pistol-not-used-in-dabholkar-murder-officials-101625187108851.html
02-07-2021||India||SC strikes down cops’ appeal in ‘assault’ case||The Delhi Police must abide with the duty of being fair, said the Supreme Court on Thursday as it dismissed an appeal by the police against supplying a statement of a witness to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in a case of alleged assault against former chief secretary Anshu Prakash.“You (police), as an investigating agency, cannot pick and choose what to show and what not to... It may be a politically hot potato but there is nothing in it legally. You must have a robust sense when it comes to principles of natural justice. The views of the high court support liberty and we will also support it,” said the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah.“The investigating agency must abide with the duty of being fair. You (police) have to be fair to the accused. It is not that just because something is in favour of the accused, it can be withheld,” the bench added.Prakash alleged he was assaulted during a meeting at the CM’s residence on February 19, 2018, following which a first information report (FIR) was lodged against Kejriwal, Sisodia and 11 other MLAs of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).In October 2020, the Delhi high court said that the accused should get the copy of the statement made on February 21, 2018 by Kejriwal’s former advisor VK Jain, who was present at the 2018 meeting pertaining to the case. The high court also directed the trial court to consider Jain’s statement at the time of considering the charges against the AAP leaders.On Thursday, the bench took up the Delhi Police’s petition challenging the high court order. Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, appearing for the police, contended that since Jain’s statement was not made under Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code (examination of witnesses by police), it could not be supplied to the AAP leaders. Lekhi added that Jain’s statement was recorded in the Case Diary, and that it was a settled law that not everything in the case diary could be given to the accused unless the prosecution sought to depend on it.But the bench asked why Delhi Police should vehemently oppose sharing statement of a witness when the same person’s previous statement was recorded under Section 161 of CrPC. “Records show that this statement dated February 21, 2018 was in continuation of the previous statement of the same witness. You (police) cannot as an investigating agency pick and choose what to show and what to not. This is an absolutely correct order of the high court,” observed the court.The bench emphasised that an investigating agency was duty-bound to be fair also to the accused and was obligated to share everything that was crucial for a fair trial.The law officer tried to persuade the top court that Jain’s statement on February 21, 2018 could not be categorised as evidence under the law and was only a statement recorded in the Case Diary which did not have to be given to the accused. Lekhi complained that the high court judgment will have ramifications in other cases too.But the court remained firm that the high court order was correct. “Please understand that the criminal justice system is not only for convicting accused but to make sure that the justice dispensation system runs its full course,” the bench told Lekhi.It told the ASG that if the said statement was going to help the accused, “all the more reason why they should get it”.“Your arguments are too technical. This is not worth it. It may be a politically hot potato but there is nothing in it legally...If a statement favours the accused, they must still get it. High Court’s is a view that supports liberty and we will support it. It is a correct view,” said the bench, dismissing the appeal.Kejriwal and Sisodia, in their plea before the high court, accused the prosecution of withholding Jain’s statement since it did not suit their case and helped in falsely implicating them.Jain, in the 2018 statement that was reproduced in the high court judgment, stated that on the night of February 19, there was a meeting that took place between the AAP leaders and Anshu Prakash on the issue of ‘Doorstep Delivery of Ration’, ‘Advertisement Funds Release’, and slow processing of files. During the meeting, Jain stated, he went to the washroom, and upon returning, saw Prakash leaving. Jain added that he could not say anything about what transpired outside while he was in the washroom.Delhi Police and state government spokespersons did not respond to queries seeking comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-strikes-down-cops-appeal-in-assault-case-101625174769970.html
02-07-2021||India||‘Total nonsense’: Dominican PM skewers Mehul Choksi claim on conspiracy||New Delhi: Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit on Thursday rejected fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi’s claims that he was brought to the island as part of a plot between Dominica, India and Antigua and Barbuda, calling such allegations “total nonsense”, according to a report in Dominica News Online.This is the first time that Skerrit has responded to accusations by Mehul Choksi and his family that the three governments colluded to send the businessman to India to stand trial in a ₹13,500 crore bank fraud case.Choksi’s legal team has alleged that he was abducted by police officers from Antigua and India on May 23 and brought to Dominica on a boat the next day, where he was received by senior police officers of Dominica. It is alleged that the plan was to quietly deport him to India.Skerrit said it was absurd.“To say that the government of Dominica and the government of Antigua along with India colluded in any way, give me a break, that’s total nonsense. We don’t get involved ourselves in those kinds of activities, those practices, not at all. I mean that is absurd and we reject it and it is unfortunate that anybody would want to propagate this unsubstantiated claim by a gentleman who is before the courts,” Skerrit said in course of weekly interaction with a journalists.Skerrit also urged the opposition parties in Dominica not to make what he described as “irresponsible statements” on the matter. Dominica’s leader of opposition Lennox Linton last month alleged the government had a role in Choksi’s abduction.The prime minister underlined that his government will evenly apply the law irrespective of who is accused of committing any crimes.Skerrit said his government will allow the court to carry out its process regarding Choksi and stressed that his rights and obligations will be respected by Dominica.He also expressed support for the government of Antigua’s move to revoke Choksi’s citizenship. Choksi, who took citizenship of Antigua via its Citizenship by Investment Scheme in November 2017, is currently contesting a move by the Antiguan government to revoke his citizenship and a second case relating to his extradition to India.Since Choksi is an illegal citizen in Dominica, Indian government has sought his deportation from there on the grounds that he needs to face the courts in India and that he continues to be an Indian citizen. In a brief statement issued in early June, Skerrit referred to Choksi as an “Indian citizen” that reflected New Delhi’s position on the businessman. India has argued that Choksi’s request to revoke his Indian citizenship was rejected and the decision conveyed to him when he filed the application.Choksi’s lawyers, however, argue that the moment Choksi took Antiguan citizenship in November 2017, the businessman ceased to be an Indian citizen as per law.The 62-year-old businessman, accused of fraud along with his nephew Nirav Modi, is currently in judicial custody in Dominica after being charged by police there for “illegal entry”.He has sought bail from the Dominica courts and requested that he be sent back to Antigua, of which he is a citizen. People familiar with the developments told HT that Choksi also rented a house in Dominica last week for $6000 ( ₹4.4 lakh) per month and has informed the high court in an attempt to convince the court that he is not a flight risk. Choksi has requested that he should be placed under house arrest rather than being kept in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/total-nonsense-dominican-pm-skewers-mehul-choksi-claim-on-conspiracy-101625173839986.html

The zoo authorities have announced a probe into the death.P Harshad was found lying near the enclosure and was rushed to hospital where he died later.The zoo has three king cobras. Two of them were in an enclosure and the third, in a separate one, a zoo official said on condition of anonymity. It is the third snake that is believed to have bitten Harshad.Harshad had moved the snake to a smaller cage while cleaning the main enclosure. When he went back to the smaller cage, he noticed it was dirty and proceeded to clean it without shifting the serpent back and was bitten, news agency PTI said, quoting the police.Harshad initially used to work with a circus but was accommodated at the zoo after the government strictly barred use of wild animals by circuses. He was taken on the zoo’s rolls as a permanent employee in 2019, two years after he locked himself in the cobra’s enclosure to protest the delay in hiring him as a permanent employee, his colleague said on condition of anonymity.Another colleague said two workers used to be deployed for cleaning the enclosures earlier but due to the lockdown, only one person was around. As a result, no one really saw what happened and it took time to get him help.King cobras are the longest of all venomous snakes. Their venom is not the most potent but the amount of neurotoxin they can deliver in a single bite can kill upto 20 people.Wildlife experts said king cobra bites are rare and they usually prey on other snakes, especially rat snakes and lizards.“King cobra is very gentle among snakes and it bites only after grave provocation. Even after provocation it gives enough warning by hissing repeatedly,” said famous snake handler Vava Suresh who is credited with having rescued over 200 king cobras and often calls snakes the most misunderstood creatures in the world.“It seems to be an accidental bite. A clear picture will emerge only after examining CCTV visuals,” said Vava Suresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thiruvananthapuram-zoo-keeper-found-dead-in-king-cobra-s-enclosure-101625167358699.html

The Trust also offered to produce all documents pertaining to the deals before any “competent person or authority” who approaches them for scrutiny.“A team of lawyers and chartered accountants went through all documents related with all land purchase deals made by the Trust. After scrutinising all documents for more than three days, they have come to the conclusion that there is no irregularity in the land purchase deals made by the Trust,” Giri said.The controversy over the land deals broke out on June 13 after former Samajwadi Party MLA from Ayodhya, Tej Pratap Pandey, and Aam Aadmi Party Rajya Sabha MP, Sanjay Singh, accused the trust of purchasing land worth ₹2 crore for ₹18.5 crore.The politicians alleged that on March 18 this year, Kusum Pathak sold a 12,080sqm plot for ₹2 crore to Sultan Ansari and Ravi Tewari, who then sold the land to the Trust for ₹18.5 crore, 10 minutes later.The Trust rejected the charges and said the land was bought at lower-than-market rates. Giri called the charges politically motivated. “People who have levelled allegations of irregularity are political persons. They do not want the Ram temple to come up in Ayodhya.”“A misinformation campaign has been launched to create confusion among devotees of Lord Ram. We want to assure all Ram bhakts there is no irregularity in any of the land deals,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-fraud-in-temple-land-purchase-claims-trust-101625167058050.html
02-07-2021||India||Tamil Nadu logs 4,481 new Covid-19 cases, 102 deaths in 24 hours||Tamil Nadu recorded 4,481 fresh coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, pushing the overall caseload to 24.84 lakh, while the toll mounted to 32,721 with 102 deaths. As many as 5,044 people recovered and got discharged today, aggregating to 24,13,930 leaving 37,526 active infections, a medical bulletin said. As many as 23 districts reported new infections in double digits while there were no fresh deaths in 12 districts, the bulletin said. Chennai saw 249 people contracting the contagion aggregating to 5,32,759 till date. The number of Covid-19 related fatalities in the State capital also reached 8,191. The testing of RT-PCR samples stood at 1,63,654 in the last 24 hours, pushing the cumulative number of specimens examined so far to 3.30 crore. Among the 102 deaths, 17 were patients without any co- morbidity or pre-existing illness which include a 19 year old girl from Sivagangai. The girl who tested positive on June 29, succumbed to the virus due to the Covid-19 pneumonia on Thursday(July 1). A private lab in Madurai was recently accorded approval to hold Covid-19 testing pushing the number of facilities operating in the State to 272. Earlier in the day, Minister for medical and family welfare Ma Subramanian told reporters that the Centre in its recent letter to the state government had suggested that those interested in joining the proposed AIIMS in the state be accommodated in JIPMER, Puducherry, or the government medical college in Madurai. "All the three recommendations made by the Centre have challenges in their own way as the existing medical college in Madurai already has 250 students and if we are going to add another 150 as per the suggestion made by the Centre, a need arises to upgrade the medical infrastructure there. Similarly, admitting new students in JIPMER is also another issue as whether the students will be relatively studying in a different state (Puducherry)", he said. The Minister said the government was contemplating the idea of admitting 50 students each in the existing medical colleges in Madurai, Theni and Sivagangai districts. To a query, he said the idea was that the students after getting admitted to a different college would be studying there till the construction for new AIIMS gets over in Madurai. "Once the construction work is over they would be shifted to AIIMS in Madurai, a suggestion that was made by the Centre," he said. Noting that several months have passed since the foundation stone laying ceremony was held in Madurai district for AIIMS, he said a fresh agreement was expected to be signed between the Centre and JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) with revised project estimates. "Earlier, it was decided to set up AIIMS in Madurai at an outlay of ₹1,264 crore. However, we need to revise the estimates due to the delay in the project and the Centre was expected to sign another agreement with JICA who will be funding the project", he said. Subramanian recalled that Chief Minister M K Stalin had already taken up the matter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June. He blamed the erstwhile AIADMK government for the project moving at a snail's pace. On the vaccination drive, the Minister said people in Tamil Nadu were keen to get the jabs. "We have been requesting the Centre for additional doses. In June they had allotted 41 lakh doses but it was enhanced by adding another 5 lakh doses. For July, they said that 71 lakh doses will be sent to the state. This morning we received over one lakh doses," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-logs-4-481-new-covid-19-cases-102-deaths-in-24-hours-101625165988955.html

The adult male elephant Baahubali (nicknamed by locals after a Telegu movie character) was found in Mettupalayam, in the foothills of the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore district a year back. It had become routine for the locals to expect the tusker to roam around in residential localities, cross highways and enter their agricultural fields. The forest officials formally identified him as MP20T1 after they found him in Mettupalayam in 2020. The radio collaring operation, aimed to study the pachyderm’s habitat and movements so it can be restricted to the forest regions, started on Sunday, after residents complained that the elephant destroyed their crops and property. “He never troubled anybody and locals knew his whereabouts and timings. But recently, he began entering agricultural fields to eat and damage crops besides damaging pipelines and compound walls,” a forest officer of the Mettupalayam- Sirumugai forest range, who did not wish to be named, said. No person has been injured so far because of the animal. Three kumkis (trained elephants) were brought from Anamalai Tiger Reserve to assist them with encircling Baahubali so he can be tranquillised and radio-collared. Four teams, which included veterinary officers and surgeons, were posted in different locations, ready to fire dart guns. The operation went on for two days. “We came close once but the elephant mock-charged us,” the officer quoted above said. “He understood that we have been tracking him so he has remained inside the forest. About 70 of us are involved in the operation and we don’t want to agitate the animal.” The elephant is currently in Sirumugai. Coimbatore district has a floating population of about 300-350 elephants who move to Ooty and Kerala. “If we continue the operation, the same situation will persist, so we have pushed it by another 10 days,” district forest officer D Venkatesh told reporters earlier. He added that they will wait for the tusker to venture out of the forest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/operation-baahubali-pushed-as-elephant-eludes-forest-officials-101625165497990.html
02-07-2021||India||A year on, key players in gold smuggling case still at large||Thiruvananthapuram: The infamous and politically charged gold smuggling case of Kerala has completed almost a year, but several opposition leaders and observers feel the investigation into the case lost its initial speed and steam. The incident came to light on July 5 last year when the customs department seized 30 kg gold hidden in bathroom fittings in one of the consignments, camouflaged as diplomatic baggage, came in the name of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. Though four central agencies including, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Enforcement Directorate (ED), Customs and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, have been roped into the case, the investigation so far has failed to make much headway since the initial arrests, officials of one of the central agencies said on the condition of anonymity. While main beneficiaries and dispatchers of the consignment are still at large, some politicians whose names came up in the course of investigation also remain untouched. So far, 32 people have been arrested in the high-profile case, which also led to major embarrassment for Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who removed his principal secretary M Sivasankar on July 7 last year. Sivasankar also had to spend some time in jail after ED named him as an accused in the case. The case also saw the Union government and state locking horns several times with the latter even constituting a judicial commission against ED, a first of its sort, alleging the agency’s bid to implicate many senior leaders of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), including CM Pinarayi Vijayan in the case. The ED later moved the Kerala high court against the judicial commission. The smuggling case was one of the main issues raised by the opposition parties during the recently- concluded assembly elections, but it failed to outsmart the ruling CPI(M), which played the victim card well, said political observers. The CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front came back to power in the state, winning 99 out of 140 seats in the state assembly polls, results of which were announced on May 2. The NIA’s attempt to link smuggling with terror activities also failed to make an impact in the case. The NIA court in Kochi granted bail to 10 accused in the case in October last year, saying there was no prima facie material evidence to show that some of the accused in smuggling had any terror links. During the probe, differences among various central agencies also came to light, political observers added. “It is wrong to say investigation is slow. We have managed to detain main accused under Cofeposa (The Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974) and brought some of the elusive accused from Gulf countries. We have served notices to the former acting consular general through UAE embassy last week,” a senior customs officer told HT on Thursday. The officer added that some of the politicians whose names cropped up during investigation, including former minister KT Jaleel and former assembly speaker Sreeramakrishnan, were not given clean chits. After gold was seized, three senior officials of the UAE consulate had left the country in hurry and probe agency had served notices to them through the UAE embassy, an officer aware of the developments in the case said on the condition of anonymity. As the case drags on, the opposition Congress has alleged a secret understanding between the Union and state governments. “We seriously feel there is a give and take between the two. The case was slowed down after the ED summoned the CM’s additional private secretary CM Raveendran, the CM’s right-hand man. Now all agencies are mum on the role of leaders,” Kerala Congress chief K Sudhakaran said in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday. However, the ruling CPI(M) rejected Congress’s claim, saying it was coming out with new theories after its earlier charges fell flat. “The party made many grave charges against us, but all fell flat with the poll. It is busy searching for new ones,” said CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, said the investigation in all cases was progressing well. “The central agencies are doing their work silently,” said party’s state president K Surendran. Amid tall claims and counterclaims, many independent observers maintained that the probe has lost its steam. “It seems after the elections nobody is interested in it. The initial speed and publicity is lacking now,” said political analyst Sunnykutty Abraham.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-on-key-players-in-gold-smuggling-case-still-at-large-101625165317939.html
02-07-2021||India||Key accused in 2020 DJ Halli violence held: NIA||Bengaluru: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested an alleged key conspirator of the 2020 Bengaluru riots that left four persons dead. Syed Abbas (38), a resident of Govindapura, was later produced before a special court of the agency and remanded to six-day custody, the investigating agency said in a statement. Abbas is the ward president of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in Nagawara ward in Bengaluru.“Investigation has revealed that accused Abbas is the president of SDPI Nagawara, Bengaluru Ward. He along with his co-conspirators...were actively involved in burning vehicles and attacking police officers on duty at KG Halli Police Station,” the NIA statement read. It added that further investigation into the case is underway.The riots in Bengaluru on August 11 last year were triggered by an alleged derogatory Facebook post by Naveen P, nephew of Congress MLA from Pulakeshinagar constituency R Akhanda Srinivas Murthy.As per a police complaint filed on the same day, a mob had gathered in DJ Halli and KG Halli areas after police sought time to initiate action against Naveen over his social media post. The attacks on public and private properties and vehicles and police stations began at 9.30 pm and continued till the early hours of August 12, according to the FIR registered atKG Halli policestation.The NIA release said the accused had set fire to KG Halli police station using petrol bombs.To control the mob, police had opened fire, killing three persons on the spot. Another person succumbed to injuries in the hospital.Abbas have been accused of rioting and being part of a mob armed with weapons, and attacking and injuring many police officers, the NIA release said. The NIA took over the probe into the riots in September last year. While Bengaluru Police had booked more than 400 people under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), the NIA, in its charge sheet filed almost six months later, reduced the number of people booked and added sections of the Indian Penal Code against most of the others.Lawyers claim that several innocent people are in prison on false charges. “In the charge sheet filed by the NIA, only 47 people have been booked under UAPA. At least 370 people have been booked under various sections of IPC. Initially, when the case was filed, most of them were booked under UAPA by Bengaluru Police, which the NIA changed. Most of them were denied bail for six months because of the UAPA charges,” Mohammad Azhar, a lawyer representing some of the accused in the case, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-accused-in-2020-dj-halli-violence-held-nia-101625164958521.html
02-07-2021||India||Students face digital divide as online classes resume||Bengaluru Online classes for students in all private schools across Karnataka commenced on Thursday, after several months of closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, digital classes for students enrolled in government schools are yet to begin, officials from the department of secondary education said, adding that mapping of children to determine if they have access to electronic devices and internet is yet to be completed. According to primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar, around 40% of students in the state do not have access to the internet or a mobile device, which denies them an opportunity to avail online classes. According to the state education department data, around 9.3 million out of the total 10.05 million students across private and public schools in Karnataka have been accounted for in terms of access to devices, internet, television, radio and even email. Of the 9.3 million students, 5.8 million have access to smartphones or tablets and around 3.1 million are without any access to such devices. Further, around 5.1 million students have access to the internet while 3.7 million do not have access to the internet, rendering the exercise of online classes as a redundant practice for these children, mostly from rural and backward regions of the state, according to data. “Classes or material on television will commence from July 5. For online classes, we have asked at the school level to do mapping, which was delayed due to lockdown,” a senior official at the secondary education department of Karnataka told Hindustan Times on Thursday, requesting not to be named. In Bengaluru (rural, south and north), around 1.7 million out of the total over 1.9 million students have been accounted for in terms of access to devices, internet, television, radio and even email. Of these, 1.3 million students have access to a mobile number they can be contacted on while 1.4 million students have access to smartphones or tablets. In terms of internet accessibility, 1.3 million students have the access to the internet while 401,269 are without the access, data from the education department suggests. The government-appointed technical advisory committee (TAC), in its recommendations, argued that education is the fundamental right of the child and stated that reopening physical schools would optimise learning, physical and mental health and will improve nutritional aspects of children. “Any further delay in school reopening may push children into malnutrition, child labour, child marriage, trafficking, begging etc., making their condition worse,” according to the report, submitted to the chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led government on June 22. The poor access to online classes comes weeks before the state government’s proposed dates for exams for Class 10. Karnataka has decided to hold board exams for 10th graders on July 19 and July 22, in which all six subjects will be compressed into two papers, which will carry 120 marks each. Officials in the department said that in total, from class 1-10, there are only 61% students with access to online classes while another 10-15% have mobiles at home, which their parents use during the day and can be used by the student to watch and learn downloaded videos and classes at a time of their choosing. The state government has also decided to bring reforms in periodical reviews of students, like CBSE and ICSE boards, but the plan is nowhere near completion and is still on the drawing board, people aware of the developments said. The state government has begun teaching classes on TV and has created over 300,000 videos, classes and other content. However, data shows that 865,259 students across the state do not have access to radio or television in their homes. Kumar said they are now opening android banks in all taluka headquarters, where people could donate their smartphones, which would be distributed among students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-face-digital-divide-as-online-classes-resume-101625164957883.html
02-07-2021||India||MSC Bank case: ED attaches properties in case linked to Ajit Pawar||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday said it has attached assets worth ₹65.75 crore belonging to a sugar mill in Satara district in connection with the money laundering case involving Maharashtra State Co-operative (MSC) Bank, while adding that a firm linked to state deputy chief minister and senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar and his wife Sunetra was involved in the case.ED said it has attached properties of Jarandeshwar Sahkari Sugar Karkhana (SSK) situated at Chimangaon-Koregaon in Satara, worth ₹65.75 crore (as per the purchase price of 2010) under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, (PMLA) 2002 in the alleged MSC Bank scam.“These assets are currently held in the name of Guru Commodity Services Pvt. Ltd. and leased to Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt. Ltd. Majority shares of Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt. Ltd. are held by Sparkling Soil Pvt. Ltd, which is related to Ajit Pawar, Deputy Chief Minister of State of Maharashtra and Sunetra Ajit Pawar,” ED said in a statement on Thursday.The action comes days after ED raided the Nagpur residence of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh in connection with the alleged money laundering linked to the extortion racket involving dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze.NCP chief Sharad Pawar had termed it ED’s bid to “harass” Deshmukh out of “frustration”.ED’s probe has revealed that MSCB conducted an auction of Jarandeshwar SSK in 2010 at undervalued price and without “following due procedure”. Ajit Pawar was one of the prominent and influential members of the board of directors of MSCB at the relevant time, ED said.The case is based on the August 2019 FIR of Mumbai police’s Economic Offence Wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msc-bank-case-ed-attaches-properties-worth-rs-66-75-cr-linked-to-ajit-pawar-wife-101625164297794.html
02-07-2021||India||Amid power tussle in Punjab, CM Amarinder meets leaders||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh met around 35 leaders from urban areas of the state on Thursday amid a tussle for control of the party, a day after his rival and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu met senior Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi VadraSingh’s meeting with the leaders, most of whom were Hindus, was aimed at calming nerves in the faction-ridden party and discussions focused on development plans and giving more representation to the Hindu community, said two people aware of developments. Punjab goes to the polls in early 2022.“Had a fruitful discussion with senior Congress colleagues from urban areas of Punjab. We have taken their feedback to strengthen the party at the grassroots level,’’ Singh tweeted after the three-hour lunch meeting at his residence.In attendance were current lawmakers, former MLAs, present and former chairpersons of boards and other government bodies, and four MPs. Current state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar was not present.On Wednesday, Sidhu’s back-to-back meetings suggested that the cricketer-turned-politician – a trenchant critic of Singh – had the ear of the Gandhis, though one party insider described the meeting as a “balancing act”. In June, Singh came to Delhi twice to meet a three-member panel set up to resolve differences but didn’t meet the Gandhis.The developments came amid reports that Sidhu may be given a key role -- including deputy CM or state unit chief -- but a member of the panel said the final decision will be taken by party chief Sonia Gandhi. “There will be a working arrangement here too between Sidhu and Captain Amarinder,” said Harish Rawat, general secretary in-charge of Punjab.Sidhu wants to be made Punjab Congress chief, a post that will give him significant power ahead of the elections. Singh is averse to giving him such an important role and has backed a Hindu or Dalit face for the post.A key leader present at Thursday’s meeting said that lawmakers told the CM that any changes in the leadership should have adequate representation of Hindus, who form roughly 39% of the state’s population and reside mostly in urban centres.“The message from this key community is that both the Congress state head and the CM. cannot be Sikhs. That position has to go to a Hindu,’’ said the leader quoted. “So Navjot Sidhu as Pradesh Congress Committee chief is unacceptable to them.”A second leader said several present at the meeting sought better representation in the Punjab Congress and upcoming elections. A third leader, a senior minister, said the ongoing rift was not discussed explicitly but some did raise the issue of delay in development works and complained about the bureaucracy ignoring party leaders. The chief minister assured them of quick action, said the minister.Tensions between Singh and Sidhu have simmered since 2019, when the latter quit the cabinet after his portfolio was changed. But the bitterness mounted in May after the government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 case of police firing on a crowd protesting the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book.Sidhu and some leaders publicly accused Singh of corruption, prompting the Congress to set up a three-member panel. The panel met around 150 functionaries – including Singh twice -- and submitted its report to party chief Sonia Gandhi on June 10. The panel recommended that Singh retain charge but Sidhu be accommodated in a key role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-power-tussle-in-punjab-cm-amarinder-meets-leaders-101625163277780.html
02-07-2021||India||‘CM, Sidhu will have a working arrangement’: Harish Rawat||Over the last month, the Congress has been trying to tackle a leadership crisis in Punjab as chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh faces a rebellion from some sections within his party led by cricketer turned politician Navjot Sidhu. Sunetra Choudhury spoke to Harish Rawat, general secretary in charge of the state and one of the members of the panel appointed to sort out the crisis, on the way forward. Edited excerpts:We recently heard Navjot Sidhu’s angry words against the chief minister. How are you all dealing with this?Sidhu ji has spoken on issues and the chief minister, and we are also addressing the same issues. They have spoken about “bargari” issues, drug menace and transport mafia; CM is also trying to address these issues. It is not a matter of any differences; it is just a matter of certain issues, which he feels should be addressed early.So, is Sidhu being made the deputy CM or head of the state Congress?It is for the Congress president to decide...Why is it that Rahul and Priyanka met Sidhu but didn’t meet the CM?The CM came to meet the committee, and there was no programme to meet the Congress president or the others... As far as Sidhu ji is concerned, he came to Priyanka ji’s house to talk about certain issues... and gave his suggestion...But will you manage to have both CM and Sidhu on board?In politics, we always talk about a working arrangement. There will be a working arrangement here, too, between Sidhu and Captain Amarinder.Don’t you think it’s bad for the party that it’s gone from a good shot at victory to factionalism?In cases where a party has a good chance of victory, there are always these pressures... I don’t think this will hamper the prospect of the party winning elections. It will be resolved soon.Finally, what’s happening in your state Uttarakhand?I think the BJP may be contemplating changing the CM. As per the provisions of the people’s representative act, it is not possible for anyone to hold an election within a year of elections being due... So there are only three options before the BJP -- changing the CM, Governor’s Rule, or early resolution of the house. All three will be the deep embarrassment for the party ruling the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-sidhu-will-have-a-working-arrangement-harish-rawat-101625163217662.html
02-07-2021||India||Covid-19 toll goes past 400k mark||The death toll from Covid-19 in India surpassed the 400,000 mark on Sunday, a grim milestone that comes at a time when several reports have emerged in recent weeks showing that the death toll from the country’s brutal second wave appears to be significantly higher than what official numbers suggest.While the pandemic has been in the country for a year and four months, data shows that more than 60% of all officially reported deaths have come in just the past four months (from March this year), or during India’s second wave of infections.Also Read | ‘Efficacy 67%’: Zydus seeks nod for vaccineOn Friday, 857 new deaths were reported across the country, taking the total number of fatalities from the viral disease to 400,364, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.The past month-and-a-half has also been marked by a series of states such as Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Bihar, etc, adding old fatalities that had gone unreported, pushing up daily death numbers in the country.This reconciliation exercise is reflected in the country’s rate of daily deaths. The seven-day average of daily infections in the country has dropped to 1,000 fatalities a day in the past week, from a peak of 4,191 for the week ending May 23 – a drop of 76%. This reconciliation, in fact, also started giving the Covid-19 death wave a sharp (and artificial) push for a seven-day period between June 9 and June 15 (see chart).The corresponding drop in daily cases, meanwhile, has been more prominent – seven-day average of daily cases has fallen 88% (from a May 9 peak of 391,819 to 46,937 in the past week).Meanwhile, in the past few weeks, a series of news reports published have used data from the Civil Registration System (CRS) – a national system of recording all births and deaths, under the Office of the Registrar General of India – to calculate the “excess mortality” reported across several states such as Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh.The analysis by three news organisations – Scroll, The Hindu and The News Minute – showed that the number of excess deaths in these states was as high as 42 times and as low as 4.8 times that of the officially reported Covid-19 fatalities during the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-toll-goes-past-400k-mark-101625162917697.html
02-07-2021||India||Northern Command kept out of theaterisation ambit||The Indian Army’s Northern Command is the only single-service command that will stay outside the scope of the military’s theaterisation drive aimed at integrating the capabilities of the three services and optimally utilising their resources for future wars and operations, people aware of the matter said on Thursday. And a final call on the headquarters of the new Air Defence Command, one of the five new integrated commands being created , is yet to be taken, the people added.The Udhampur-based Northern Command is responsible for guarding the country’s borders with Pakistan and China in the north, and is the nerve centre of counterterrorism operations in Jammu & Kashmir.“The Northern Command will stay intact. We can’t take things lightly in that sector. As far as theaterisation is concerned, we are fine-tuning issues like command and control structures, leadership roles, distribution of assets to keep forces operationally ready and cross-service staffing at different levels,” a top official , one of the people cited above, said on condition of anonymity.The headquarters of the new theatre commands have been finalised, except for the Air Defence Command. The locations being considered for the headquarters of the Air Defence Command include Prayagraj, Jodhpur and Gandhinagar, HT learns.The Western Theatre Command will be based at Jaipur, the Eastern Theatre Command at Lucknow, and the Maritime Theatre Command at Karwar in Karnataka. The logistics command is likely to be based in Nagpur, where the Indian Air Force’s Maintenance Command is currently located. The logistics command seeks to avoid duplication of efforts and resources.Jaipur and Lucknow are the current headquarters of the army’s South Western and Central Commands. Though it does not house any of the Indian Navy’s existing commands, Karwar has adequate infrastructure to accommodate the Maritime Theatre Command.The initial plan was to base the Air Defence Command at Prayagraj — the existing headquarters of IAF’s Central Air Command — but a final call has not been taken, said a second official. “The Indian Air Force is keen to make it Jodhpur. Some have proposed Gandhinagar as an alternative as IAF’s South Western Air Command is based there. Creating new structures at existing command headquarters has advantages --- operational, minimum disruption during transition phase, cost benefits and better logistics,” the official added.The armed forces currently have 17 single-service commands spread across the country. The Indian Army and the Indian Air Force have seven commands each, while the Indian Navy has three. Creating theatres would involve merging the existing commands (except the Northern Command).“It appears that Northern Command will largely retain its current geographical area of responsibility. In case of Ladakh which has borders both with China and Pakistan, for operational and logistics reasons it is not possible to divide this sector between two commands,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).He added that it was perhaps felt that it would be preferable not to make changes in the current command arrangement due to the ongoing counter terrorism operations in J&K. “However, operations would be better coordinated if the western borders are under one theatre.”Theaterisation refers to merging specific commands of the army, navy and air force, and placing them under a theatre commander. Such theatre commands are to be led by an officer from any of the three services.After they are initially rolled out, the Western and Eastern Theatres will be headed by army generals with senior three-star Air Component commanders under them, the Air Defence Command will be led by a top three-star IAF officer and the Maritime Theatre Command by a top Vice Admiral, officials said.The theaterisation model will have the inbuilt flexibility to fall back on current command and control structures to eliminate the possibility of the country getting caught off guard by its adversaries during the crucial transition phase, HT reported on Thursday.The government expects chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat to bring about jointness among the three services by January 2023.The government has formed an eight-member panel under Rawat to fine-tune the plans and bring all stakeholders on board, especially the IAF, for speedy roll-out of new joint structures. The panel was set up last month after some differences on the theaterisation model emerged during a key meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northern-command-kept-out-of-theaterisation-ambit-101625162857686.html
02-07-2021||India||Guv, TMC row escalates ahead of House session||Relations between West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankar and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) touched a new low over a fake vaccination scam in Kolkata amid speculation on whether the governor will follow convention and read out a speech prepared by the state government to open the assembly’s budget session on Friday.TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy alleged links between Dhankhar and Debanjan Deb, accused of running fake vaccine camps and inoculating hundreds of people, including an MP, with antibiotics. He released photographs that purportedly showed Dhankhar standing near a man who Roy alleged was Deb’s security guard. The governor didn’t respond to requests for a comment. This is the second major allegation levelled by the TMC on Dhankhar in four days.On June 28, chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged Dhankhar was an accused in the 1996 Jain hawala case and branded him a “corrupt man”. While dismissing the allegation later that day, Dhankhar told the media that he was not bound to read out the speech prepared by the state government while inaugurating the budget session. “Am I supposed to read out everything that is written?” he said.This triggered speculation because in February last year Dhankhar wanted to edit the speech prepared by the state. The government rejected his suggestion. Dhankhar finally followed convention and read out the speech that was critical of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. On Wednesday, the governor shot a letter to assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, saying he was “more saddened than anguished” at the allegation Biman Banerjee made against him at the June 21 national speakers’ conference chaired by Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla.Biman Banerjee complained to Om Birla that Dhankhar was interfering in the functioning of the assembly and sitting on bills – charges rejected by the governor. “According to the intimation sent to me, the governor will address the inauguration of the budget session tomorrow. As far his letter is concerned, I will reply to it later,” the speaker said on Thursday evening.Earlier in the day, Roy released two photographs – one showing a man who allegedly worked as Deb’s security guard standing near Dhankhar, his wife and two other women, and another showing the same man standing behind Deb. “The man in the photograph is Arabinda Baidya, who worked as the security guard of Deb. In one photo, he can be seen standing behind Deb while in the other he can be seen standing near the governor and his family,” Roy said.Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit chief Dilip Ghosh said: “If the TMC government has any proof against the governor then it should make it public instead of bringing wild allegations against him every other day.”SC notice to state, CentreThe Supreme Court has sought responses from the Centre and West Bengal government within four weeks on a petition demanding the deployment of Army or paramilitary forces in view of the deteriorating law and order situation following the post-poll violence in the state. The petition sought orders to the Centre and state to ensure the safety of the citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guv-tmc-row-escalates-ahead-of-house-session-101625162798944.html
02-07-2021||India||‘Efficacy 67%’: Zydus seeks nod for vaccine||Drugmaker Zydus Cadila said on Thursday it has applied for emergency use approval of its three-dose Covid-19 vaccine candidate, which has shown an efficacy rate of 66.6% in an interim analysis of its phase 3 trials.The company said that this is the first coronavirus vaccine using a DNA plasmid in advanced trials, and the first in India to be tested in a large group of adolescents. If approved, it will be India’s second home-grown vaccine, and the fifth overall to be cleared for use in the country after Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V and Moderna.Also Read: Zydus Cadila seeks DCGI nod for emergency use of its DNA vaccine for 12+ age“As the first ever plasmid DNA vaccine for human use, ZyCoV-D has proven its safety and efficacy profile in our fight against COVID-19. The vaccine when approved will help not only adults but also adolescents in the 12 to 18 years age group,” said Sharvil Patel, managing director of Cadila Healthcare, in a statement by the company.The clinical trials included 28,000 people who were split into two groups that either received the vaccine or a placebo. Among them were 1,000 volunteers in the 12-18 age group. The company has not yet released data from its previous phases.It also announced that the vaccine worked as well as a two-dose regimen as it did in the three-dose formulation that it was tested in, and data pertaining to that has been submitted to the regulator for scrutiny.Zydus, which aims to produce up to 120 million doses annually, said its study coincided with the peak of India’s second wave of infections and affirmed its efficacy against mutations, especially the Delta variant. It did not, however, disclose its efficacy against those variants.According to the company, the tolerability profile among the adolescents was similar to what was seen in the adult population. Primary efficacy of 66.6% was attained for symptomatic RT-PCR positive cases in the interim analysis.The company said there were no moderate cases of Covid-19 in the vaccine arm, though it did not disclose how many cases the interim analysis was based on.“We are making constructs for variants for future upgrade, if needed. Interim data has been submitted, and we will submit more data as it gets analysed to the regulator in due course. We haven’t reported any major side-effects for the vaccine. In fact, side-effects are similar to the placebo arm,” said Patel.Patel added that the vaccine candidate has exhibited robust immunogenicity, and tolerability and safety profile in the adaptive phase 1/2 clinical trials carried out earlier.On pricing, the executive said no discussions had taken place but added that this will be discussed once regulatory approvals are in place and will depend on doses, technology, etc.ZyCoV-D is an intradermal vaccine that can be applied using a needle-free applicator, which could help significantly reduce side effects.The vaccine is stored at 2-8°C but has shown good stability at temperatures of 25°C for at least three months, the company said.Experts say an efficacy rate of 66.6% is “decent”. “As per WHO threshold, 50% and above efficacy is approved for a respiratory vaccine,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.The company has not begun stockpiling the vaccine, as it is currently in the process of putting together a new production facility that is likely to be up and running by July end.“We are currently in the scale-up phase. We could produce 5 crore (50 million) doses by December, with production likely to start by mid August or early September. Afterwards we plan to have a sustained production of 1-1.2 crore (10-12 million) vaccine doses per month,” said Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/efficacy-67-zydus-seeks-nod-for-vaccine-101625162677713.html
02-07-2021||India||What is ZyCov-D, world’s first DNA vaccine for Covid?||Ahmedabad-based pharmaceutical firm Zydus Cadila on Thursday said it has applied for emergency use authorisation (EUA) with the Indian drug regulator for its two- or three-shot Plasmid DNA Covid-19 vaccine, and plans to manufacture 100-120 million doses annually.If approved, it will be the fifth vaccine against coronavirus to be approved in India, after Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V and the Moderna shot. Here’s more about the jab.What is it called?Zycov-DHow does it work?It is a plasmid DNA vaccine. A plasmid, a small circular piece of DNA, is used to instruct cells for to make the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2. This helps teach the body to recognise a crucial part of the virus, to which it can then build defences. The shot is administered intradermally, which resembles a pinprick.How many doses is it given as?The vaccine was tested in a three-dose regimen, with the second and third given 21 and 56 days after the first. But the company said it has also evaluated a two-dose regimen and found similar results, hinting at plans to make it a two-dose regimen.How has it performed?The company said efficacy of its clinical trials in over 28,000 people came to 66.6%. However, the company has not disclosed its early phase trial data. Zydus said its study coincided with the peak of the second wave of infections and affirmed efficacy against variants such as Delta.The company added that the trial also included 1,000 adolescent volunteers in the 12-18 age group.How does it compare to others?The DNA plasmid vaccine works in a manner similar to the mRNA vaccine, in which the body is instructed to code for the antigen (the spike protein, in this case). The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (or Covishield) and Sputnik V deliver similar codes via viral vectors. Novavax’s vaccine delivers the proteins itself, while Covaxin uses an inactivated virus as an antigen.When can we expect it?Zydus Cadila managing director Sharvil Patel said the company hoped to be producing 10 million doses a month by mid-August. The roll-out will depend on the approval process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-zycov-d-world-s-first-dna-vaccine-for-covid-101625162617692.html
02-07-2021||India||Three decades of liberalisation: Banking highs and lows||The liberalisation of India’s banking sector started soon after the opening up of the economy, with the release of the first Narasimham Committee report in December 1991. Then finance minister Manmohan Singh appointed the committee on 14 August 1991, chaired by M Narasimham, the 13th governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Yet another committee, headed by Narasimham, was appointed by another finance minister, P Chidambaram, in December 1997.These two seminal reports laid the road map for the Indian banking industry — still work in progress.Let’s first take a look at how banking numbers stack up since 1991.In March I991, there were 272 scheduled commercial banks in India. By March 2021, the number was 121. There were 60,220 bank branches across India in 1991 – 35,206 rural, 11,334 semi-urban, 8,046 urban and 5,624 metropolitan. By 2021, the branch network has expanded to 158,373. The growth in the rural branches has been the least (to 52,773) but the branches in other segments have grown substantially. In semi-urban areas, the number grew almost four times to 43,683; in urban pockets too, by close to four times to 30,638; and metropolitan India now has 31,279 branches. One branch now covers roughly 9,500 people, down from 14,000 in 1991.In 1991, the deposit portfolio of the banking system was ₹2.38 trillion; and credit portfolio ₹1.32 trillion. By March 2021, the deposit portfolio was over ₹151 trillion and credit portfolio, close to ₹110 trillion.The first Narasimham report was the springboard for the initial banking reforms – deregulation of interest rates, end of directed credit, reduction of statutory pre-emptions and the entry of new banks. The so-called cash reserve ratio (CRR) or the portion of deposits that commercial banks keep with the central bank (on which they don’t earn any interest) was 15% in 1991. Now, it is 4%. Similarly, the banks needed to buy government bonds and maintain a statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of 38.5% in 1991. Both sucked out 53.5% of their deposits. Now, the comparable figure is 22% (4% CRR plus 18% SLR). For these reasons, the credit-deposit ratio was just 60.8% in 1991. This has risen to 72.46% after 30 years.The minimum loan rate, prescribed by the regulator, was 16% in 1991.In a free market, the current marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR), the floor rate for bank loans, ranges between 6.65% and 7.30% for State Bank of India (SBI), depending on the tenure of loans. For HDFC Bank Ltd, it ranges between 6.85% and 7.4%.The key to the business of banking is the quality of loan assets. The definition of non-performing assets and loan restructuring are dynamic phenomena. Following the Narasimham Committee recommendations, a structured framework was put in place in the early 1990s, after the introduction of income recognition and asset classification norms. Initially, this framework was meant only for restructuring industrial accounts. In 2008, its scope widened to deal with stressed non-industrial accounts. By 1994, the gross NPAs of all scheduled banks were estimated to be 19.07% of all assets; for public sector banks it was even worse with 24.8%. It took more than a decade to reduce those NPAs. Falling interest rates in 21st century allowed banks to book huge treasury profits; they used surpluses to provide for bad loans.RBI started tightening definitions of bad assets — classified sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets — early this century but the prudential norms were held hostage by government policies. PSBs held the bulk of the NPAs but since the government did not have the money to recapitalise them, the thrust was on forbearance. Infrastructure was the holy cow in the first decade of the century. There were many incentives, including a regulatory cushion, to lend to infrastructure. These loans were also continuously restructured, and enjoyed the standard tag.Sensing that too long a rope had been given to the banks for managing their loan books, Raghuram Rajan, who took over as RBI governor in September 2013, decided to tighten the screws. Instead of cleaning up their balance sheets, many banks indulged in what Rajan described as “pretend and extend”. They pretended that everything was fine and extended fresh loans to keep the books clean.To address this, the Central Repository of Information on Large Credits was set up in 2014. Once the banks started supplying data in real time for all loans of ₹5 crore and above, RBI found how growth-hungry banks were giving loans to large corporations even though their balance sheets did not justify such risk-taking. No bank wanted to miss out on the credit growth story. Between 2006 and 2008, bank credit grew at a scorching pace. It dipped after the global financial crisis but picked up again in 2011.Once RBI was convinced that the banks were camouflaging NPAs through fresh loans and other innovations, it launched the asset quality review or AQR, a first-of-its-kind health check of Indian banking, in 2015. The banks were given six quarters from October–December 2015 to January–March 2017 to clean up the mess.Before the exercise ended, there was a change of guard at RBI but the new boss Urjit Patel carried on the clean-up exercise with greater zeal. The gross NPAs of the banking sector, which rose to 11.2% in financial year 2018, dropped to 6.8% by December 2020. It is set to rise again because of the Covid pandemic, but that’s a separate story. The Narasimham Committee made certain other critical recommendations. For instance, it said the number of public sector banks should be reduced. There could be three to four big banks; eight to ten banks with nationwide presence; and smaller regional banks. PSBs should enjoy autonomy and the era of dual control, between RBI and the banking division of the finance ministry, should give up to the ghost.Following the consolidation drive by the government, the number of PSBs has shrunk from 27 in 2017 to 12 now. Seven of them are fairly large and at least one, SBI, is among the top 50 banks by assets, globally. The industry also welcomed new private banks in three phases – in early 1990s, early this century and in 2015. They are universal banks. While the concept of local area banks hasn’t worked out, two sets of new banks have made entry into the turf -- small finance banks and payments banks. Banking licences are now available on tap.Autonomy for public sector banks is still a far cry even though the government has taken many steps to make them independent. Shortly after a unique offsite of the CEOs of PSBs and financial institutions, Gyan Sangyam, presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then finance minister Arun Jaitley in January 2015, the finance ministry assured all PSBs freedom from interference by the government on commercial decisions, transfers, and postings, etc.It has also set made the selection process of CEOs of government-owned banks transparent by setting up the Banks Board Bureau -- an offshoot of the Indradhanush framework for transforming PSBs announced in August 2015. Describing this as “the most comprehensive reform effort undertaken since banking nationalization in 1970”, a government note says, “Our PSBs are now ready to compete and flourish in a fast-evolving financial services landscape.”However, there aren’t too many takers for this optimism. At the 2015 Gyan Sangam, Modi said banks would be run professionally and there would be no interference. He added that he was against political interference but not political intervention in the interest of the people. Such political intervention, according to him, would enable the voice of the common man to reach such institutions. This has been the story of India’s public sector banking industry all along.PSBs are political animals – the government’s milch cow, used for everything from funding infrastructure to supporting MSMEs; opening millions of zero-balance accounts for financial inclusion; buying government bonds to bridging the fiscal deficit; and subscribing to electoral bonds to help political parties.As we complete three decades of economic liberalisation, many are crystal ball gazing on the future of PSBs: In what form and shape should they be allowed to function? How many of them should exist? The government wants to privatise at least two of them. Let’s wait and watch. Their presence is a must to address market failures and for financial inclusion and MSME- and infrastructure-financing but we don’t need all of them.Indeed, consolidation has reduced the number of PSBs but not the government’s share in the banking industry. The problem is not with the ownership but with how the owner behaves.This is why even before any PSB is privatised, privatisation by stealth has already started. In the 1990s, before RBI gave licences to the first set of private banks to open shop, PSBs held 90% share of the banking market. In 2000, their share was a little over 80%. Now, they are much less than 60%. PSBs’ share in incremental banking business is far lower -- even in collection of deposits, despite the sovereign backing.That tells the story of Indian banking since economic liberalisation.Both the body and the soul of the industry have changed. The sellers’ market of the 1990s has become a buyers’ market. From addressing the cycle of life, the lifestyle of the customers is on banks’ radar now. Beyond meeting the financial needs, they are becoming a marketplace for everything one wants.Those banks which are changing in sync with time will survive and flourish. Others that cannot change may survive with the government’s largesse (read: recapitalisation) but the customers won’t care for them.(The writer is an author and consulting editor Business Standard.

02-07-2021||India||10 European nations recognise Covishield||Ten European countries, including key European Union (EU) members such as Germany and the Netherlands and non-EU states such as Switzerland and Iceland, currently recognise Covishield for proof of Covid-19 vaccination for travel.Questions about travel to Europe by Indians who have received the Covishield jab, which is the version of the AstraZeneca vaccine made by Serum Institute of India, have arisen since the vaccine has not yet been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).So far, EU members Austria, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Slovenia and Spain, and Iceland and Switzerland, which aren’t in the bloc but are part of the Schengen visa regime, recognise Covishield for Covid-19 vaccination for travel purposes, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Thursday.However, travel between India and Europe remains tightly restricted. Of the 10 countries, India has an air bubble arrangement only with Germany, which has emerged as a key transit hub for Indian nationals travelling to Europe.Some of these countries, such as Switzerland, are accepting visa applications from fully vaccinated people who have been inoculated with doses approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) or EU or their national authority.Estonia has said in a statement that it recognises both Covishield and Covaxin for full vaccination of Indian travellers but officials have pointed out that travel between the two countries remains highly restricted. A statement issued by the Netherlands government listed Covishield among eight approved vaccines. However, Dutch authorities have listed India among countries and areas considered “very high risk areas where there is a virus variant of concern”.Also Read | Can Indians now travel to European countries? All you need to knowOn Tuesday, German ambassador Walter Lindner tweeted his country recognises a double shot of Covishield as “valid proof of anti-Covid vaccination”, but added that this does not “modify existing travel or visa restrictions for travellers from areas of concern/virus variants areas”.The Indian side has informed the 27 EU member states that it will follow a policy of reciprocity in recognising Covid-19 vaccines for travel, and exempt EU nationals possessing the “green pass” from mandatory quarantine only if the bloc recognises vaccines being administered in India, such as Covishield and Covaxin.India also asked EU states to accept Covishield and Covaxin, as the vaccines have been authorised by WHO or the national authority, for Indian nationals travelling to Europe. Indian vaccination certificates can be authenticated by European authorities on the Co-WIN portal, the people said.The EU has said the EU Digital Covid Certificate or green pass is not a precondition to travel and individual member states have the option to accept vaccines approved by WHO such as Covishield.Covaxin is yet to be given an emergency use listing by WHO, and its manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, hasn’t approached EMA for regulatory approval. Apart from India, Covaxin has been approved by Guyana, Iran, Mauritius, Mexico, Nepal, Paraguay, the Philippines and Zimbabwe.The green pass framework, being implemented from July 1, is meant to facilitate free movement within the EU during the pandemic. Under this framework, persons vaccinated with four vaccines approved by the EMA will be exempted from travel restrictions within the EU.These four vaccines are Comirnaty, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen, Spikevax or the Moderna dose, and Vaxzevria or the European version of the AstraZeneca jab. Serum Institute of India has approached EMA for approving Covishield.External affairs minister S Jaishankar took up the issue of approving the Covishield for travel to Europe during a meeting on Tuesday with Josep Borell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. The two leaders met on the margins of a meeting of the G20 foreign ministers in Italy.The 27 EU states have agreed on easing travel restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers from outside the bloc to give a boost to the tourism sector, which has been hit hard by the pandemic.India has linked the issue of so-called vaccine passports to vaccine equity, especially in developing countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-european-countries-currently-recognise-covishield-for-travel-101625126545695.html
