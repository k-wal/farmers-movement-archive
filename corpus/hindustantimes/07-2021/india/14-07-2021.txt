Replying to a question by Asom Gana Parishad MLA Prodip Hazarika during zero hour of the ongoing budget session of the assembly, the CM cited the example of a popular Hindi movie to stress the point. “We had seen a movie called ‘Udta Punjab’ where we got a glimpse of the situation in that state due to the menace of drugs. The rate at which illicit drugs were being traded in our state we were going towards becoming Udta Assam,” Sarma said. Reacting to the accusations of state police becoming trigger-happy, the CM said tough action against criminals who try to escape from custody or attack policemen will continue till he was in charge. The CM said that though Assam was earlier a transit route for drugs originating from other parts of the northeast and areas bordering a neighbouring country to other parts of India, the situation has changed in recent years with the use of the contraband increasing in the state. “Accounts of recovered drug addicts have revealed that the contraband is easily available in prisons, hospitals and is even delivered at home through a network. This continued even during the [Covid-19] lockdown. It made us decide to take action,” said Sarma. Though, police had been acting against drug trafficking in past, it intensified after the new government took office in May this year. In 2016, 10 kg of heroin was recovered, 5 kg in 2017, 7 kg in 2018, 23 kg in 2019 and 27 kg in 2020. “This shows that availability of drugs is increasing since police are able to seize only around 10% of the illicit commodity. After I took charge, Union home minister Amit Shah asked me to take action against drugs, human trafficking and cattle smuggling. We then decided to adopt a policy of zero-tolerance on these issues,” the CM said. In the past two months, 1,021 cases have been registered and 1,897 persons arrested for involvement in trafficking of illegal drugs. During the same period, over 27 kg of heroin, 12,823 kg marijuana, 41 kg opium, 78,000 bottles of cough syrup, over 1.3 million psychotropic tablets called Yaba, 3 kg morphine, 3 kg crystal methamphetamine, 33 kg poppy straw and ₹1.80 crore in cash were seized. Sarma said that the seized drugs would be publicly burnt at four locations on July 17 and July 18 to send a message of zero-tolerance against drugs. He said all states in the northeast are working in a coordinated manner against illicit drugs. The CM said that drugs were being used by criminals as payment to smuggle arms, fake currency and other contraband. He said the menace was also responsible for a lot of social problems and crimes. Without taking names, the CM said several terror outfits of the region were involved in use and trade of illegal drugs. He, however, added that the banned United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) had no role in it. “When such a massive operation is underway, some people will try to divert attention and even blame the police by calling it trigger happy,” he said while reacting to accusations by opposition parties and human rights activists. Sarma cited instance of an alleged drug kingpin, who was arrested in a kidnapping case, killed in police firing while trying to escape from custody after arrest. He informed that since his government assumed office, seven alleged drug traffickers have been injured in firing while trying to escape from custody. “Police action will continue on anyone who tries to escape from custody or attempts to attack policemen. I am not going to compromise on it. If criminals attack policemen, they have to shoot in self-defense,” he said. A complaint has been filed in National Human Rights Commission by a Delhi-based lawyer Arif Jwadder accusing Assam police of targeting criminals in fake encounters. The Assam Humam Rights Commission has also issued notice to the police on shootings and encounters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-could-have-become-another-udta-punjab-himanta-sarma-on-drugs-menace-101626284700945.html

14-07-2021||India||Taliban current reality, can gain legitimacy by ending terror: Russian diplomat||The Taliban movement is a “current reality” in Afghanistan as it will shape the formation of the next government in Kabul but the group will gain legitimacy only when it effectively deals with the problem of terrorism, a senior Russian diplomat said on Wednesday.Russia is closely coordinating with India on the situation in Afghanistan because India is a “big player” in the region and has supported the economic and social development of the war-torn country with investments of more than $3 billion, Russian deputy chief of mission Roman Babushkin told an online news briefing.Against the backdrop of the Afghan government looking to countries such as India, the US and Russia for air support, especially helicopters and logistics, to bolster its fight against the Taliban, Babushkin ruled out any military intervention. He, however, said Russia is keeping open the option of helping Central Asian states bordering Afghanistan under the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) if instability spills over the frontiers.“The Taliban is a current reality in Afghanistan. It’s a party [to the] intra-Afghan talks, which we believe should be the solution for normalisation and establishment of an inclusive government which should be involving all major ethnic groups,” he said.“Let us realise that there is a common approach supported by everyone – that Taliban should deal with the problem of terrorism and other related issues in order to become legitimate, in order to [get] delisted [at the UN Security Council], in order to go ahead with the future Afghanistan and creation of the inclusive government,” he added.Noting that the Taliban and al-Qaeda are both banned by Russia, Babushkin said his country believes all terrorist organisations are illegal and should be eliminated. “We are quite committed to tackle the threat of terrorism in Afghanistan...The Russian position is consistent when it comes to international terrorism,” he said.Babushkin said it was for India to decide on the role it intends to play in Afghanistan, while the world community should motivate all Afghan stakeholders to start the intra-Afghan talks as envisaged in the 2020 deal between the US and the Taliban. “Everyone welcomed the understanding between the US and Taliban, and Russia is in favour of implementation of these commitments,” he said.Any inclusive government formed through talks should ensure Afghanistan remains independent, sovereign, united, peaceful and democratic, he added.Babushkin evaded a direct reply to a question on India establishing contacts with some elements of the Taliban and said, “Taliban is present in Afghanistan...and certainly it would be useful to deal with everyone in the region so that the national interests would be better ensured.”Asked about the possibility of India and Russia working together to help the Afghan forces with air support and servicing of Russian-origin military hardware, Babushkin said there was no military solution and ruled out any military intervention.Babushkin acknowledged that Russia is concerned about the instability in Afghanistan spilling over into Central Asian states and is keeping open the option of cooperation under the CSTO, which includes Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.“We will be acting through the CSTO, a collective security organisation, by supporting our allies to fortify their borders with Afghanistan if it would be required...We are watching the situation so that we could support our allies by providing necessary military equipment as well as by intensifying joint exercises,” he said.Babushkin also said India and Russia are set to hold their first 2+2 meeting of foreign and defence ministers this year, ahead of the annual summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-current-reality-in-afghanistan-can-gain-legitimacy-by-tackling-terror-russian-diplomat-101626283140886.html
14-07-2021||India||Railways’ 1st redeveloped station to be inaugurated by PM Modi||Gandhinagar Capital railway station, the country’s first redeveloped station in line with the Narendra Modi government’s plan to modernise railway stations through Public Private Partnerships, will be inaugurated by the Prime Minister on July 16.“The Station has been provided with world class amenities, at par with modern airports. Special care has been taken to make it a Divyang friendly station... with a special ticket booking counter, ramps, lifts, dedicated parking space etc. The complete building is designed and provided with Green Building rating features. The state-of-the-art external façade will have daily theme based lighting with 32 themes. The station will also house a five star hotel,” the PMO said in a statement on Wednesday.Station redevelopment is planned by leveraging real estate potential of separable land and air space in and around the stations, through private participation. These redeveloped hubs will be called Railopolis.For the Gandhinagar Capital station, a joint venture special purpose vehicle (SPV) namely Gandhinagar Railway and Urban Development (GARUD) was formed with equity contribution of government of Gujarat (GoG) and Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC) in the ratio of 74:26 respectively.The station facilities include segregated entry and exit through landscaped area, Divyang friendly special ticket-booking counter, ramps, lifts, dedicated parking space, inter-faith prayer hall – a first for Indian Railways, dedicated exclusive art gallery with live LED wall display lounge.It also has a state of the art external façade with daily theme-based lighting, separate baby feeding room, centralised AC waiting lounge with variable control.In October 2019, the government had decided to set up a committee to draft a blueprint for transferring operations of 150 trains and 50 railway stations to private players. Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant in a letter to then railway board chairman VK Yadav, chairman, Railway Board had stated that an empowered group be formed to drive the process in a time-bound manner.HT in March reported that Centre may first lease out 90 railway stations on Public Private Partnership basis through IRSDC, the Indian Railways’ nodal agency for station redevelopment. The Railway Board is also mulling whether the provision of security infrastructure should be excluded or whether the railways should replicate the airport model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-1st-redeveloped-station-to-be-inaugurated-by-pm-modi-101626281161883.html
14-07-2021||India||India surpasses the US in sending legal requests for info, says Twitter report||NEW DELHI: India has surpassed the United States as the country that sent the most number of legal requests seeking information about accounts from Twitter, the social media company’s latest transparency report covering the period from July to December 2020 said on Wednesday.The number of legal information requests from India accounted for 25% of the global volume and 15% of the global accounts specified, up from 21% and 25% respectively in the January-June, 2020 period.Twitter’s global legal policy head Vijaya Gadde, in a Spaces conversation on the platform, said that it does not always cede to a government’s information requests. “Sometimes the requests are incomplete, broad in scope or the accounts have been deleted, in such a situation Twitter can challenge the requests,” she said.The report said that Twitter produced some or all of the requested information in response to 30% of the information requests globally, which came to 4,367 in all.India also emerged as the country that sent the second-highest number of takedown requests after Japan. Hindustan Times in June first reported that the number of blocking orders issued under section 69(A) of the IT Act had risen from 3,600 in 2019, to over 9,800 in 2020. In the first five months of 2021 (until May), the number increased to 6,000.Section 69(A) of the IT Act allows the government to act against social media posts and accounts that may pose a threat to public order or India’s sovereignty and integrity, defence of India, security of the State, and friendly relations with foreign states.Twitter’s latest transparency report also added that accounts of 199 verified journalists and news outlets from around the world were subject to 361 legal demands, a 26% increase in such requests since the previous reporting period. “And, 94% of the total global volume of legal demands originated from only five countries (in decreasing order): Japan, India, Russia, Turkey, and South Korea,” it added, without giving country-wise data.The company has recently been locked in a conflict with the Indian government over compliance with the new social media and intermediary guidelines, for which the deadline ended on May 25. It recently appointed a resident grievance redressal officer and released an India-specific grievance redressal report, prompting one of its foremost critics, former union minister for electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad to say it was “assuring to see that Twitter was making an effort to comply”.The confrontation between the Union government and Twitter began in January when protests by farmers escalated in Delhi and its surrounding regions. Twitter refused to take down content relating to the protests. These included accounts of journalists and activists. In the second round, Twitter restricted access to posts instead of accounts. The actions prompted the government to serve the platform with two non-compliance notices, threatening penal action if it did not accede to them.Speaking about takedown requests in general, Gadde said Twitter challenges such requests if they fall under certain categories identified in its policies, including political speech. “They can be challenged if they are consistent with local values, or even local laws. Understanding the context of these requests and taking a call is challenging task,” she said.Twitter also added a new category called “impressions”, under which it captures how many times a tweet was viewed before it was removed. “In total, impressions on violative Tweets accounted for less than 0.1% of all impressions for all Tweets globally, from July 1 through December 31. During this time period, Twitter removed 3.8 million Tweets that violated the Twitter Rules; 77% of which received fewer than 100 impressions prior to removal, with an additional 17% receiving between 100 and 1,000 impressions. Only 6% of removed Tweets had more than 1,000 impressions,” the report stated.Raman Chima, Asia-Pacific policy director at Access now said India’s rise to number one when it comes to information requests is an alarming trend. “US has always been number 1 on the index, being the country that others have pointed to when it comes to justifying requests,” he said. “Moreover, a vast number of requests sent by US are court orders. India being number one represents an alarming increase in requests being sent, even worse there is no judicial oversight when it comes to such orders. This is also happening at a time when significant concerns are being raised around those who dissent in India by the government. The Indian government must justify and explain how the orders are being sent. It also becomes even more critical for an independent oversight, under the new data protection law to be installed in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-surpasses-the-us-in-sending-legal-requests-for-info-says-twitter-report-101626279781282.html
14-07-2021||India||OBC sub-categorisation commission’s term extended by 6 months||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday extended the term of the commission examining the possibility of sub-categorisation within the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the Central list by six months beyond July 31 this year to January 31 next year, a government statement said.“The proposed extension of tenure and addition in its terms of reference shall enable the Commission to submit a comprehensive report on the issue of sub-categorization of OBCs, after consultation with various stakeholders,” the statement issued after the Cabinet committee meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said.The commission, which took charge on October 11, 2017, is headed by retired Delhi high court chief justice G Rohini. The commission is constituted of Centre for Policy Studies director Dr J K Bajaj as a member and two other ex-officio members. It was set up to examine the possibility of creating categories within OBCs for the reservation to ensure “equitable distribution” of representation among all OBC communities.Its objectives include working out a mechanism, criteria, norm and parameters through a scientific approach for sub-categorisation within the OBCs and identifying the respective castes or communities or sub-castes or synonyms in the Central List of OBCs and classifying them into their respective sub-categories.Currently, OBCs are granted 27% reservation in government jobs and educational institutes. The demand for sub-categorization comes from the notion that only a few affluent communities among the castes included in the Centre list of OBCs enjoy a major part of this 27% reservation.There are 2,633 Other Backward Castes in the Central List and earlier this year the commission proposed to divide them into four subcategories numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4 and split the 27% into 2, 6, 9 and 10%, respectively. If accepted, the recommendations are also likely to have a major impact on politics, especially in north India where the rise of powerful OBC groups such as Yadavs defined the 1990s.The commission, commonly known as Rohini Commission, had also recommended complete digitisation of all OBC records and a standardised system of issuing OBC certificates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/obc-sub-categorisation-commission-s-term-extended-by-6-months-101626279420499.html
14-07-2021||India||PM Modi to inaugurate Rudraksh, the symbol of Indo-Japan friendship in Varanasi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Thursday inaugurate the Varanasi International Cooperation and Convention Centre, built by financial assistance from Japan, by planting a Rudraksh plant on its premises, a senior official of Varanasi Nagar Nigam said. The VICCC has been named Rudraksh in recognition of the ancient city’s connection with Lord Shiva.On the eve of its inauguration, the centre has been decorated keeping both the Japanese and Indian cultures in mind. Bamboo, pebbles, small bonsai trees, mats, lanterns, ceramic pots, rice paper, straw have been used for decoration in addition to ornamental lights and flowers of different sorts. Over a tonne of marigold flowers have also been used.During his Varanasi visit in December 2015, the then Japan prime minister Shinzo Abe gifted the VICCC project to the city. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) funded around ₹186 crore, the cost of the project. Besides, a Japanese company Fujita Corporation was given the contract to construct the convention centre.Japan’s ambassador Suzuki Satoshi, his wife Chikaga Suzuki, counsellor Kiyose Kazuhiro, secretary Oda Akari and a three-member-team of JICA, led by its chief representative Matsumoto Katsuo, will also be present on the occasion.As many as 108 Rudraksh have been installed at the convention centre and its roof is shaped like a Shiva Linga, officials said, adding that the entire building will glow with LED lights at night.The two-storey convention centre has come up in the posh Sigra area on 2.87 hectares of land and has a seating capacity of 1,200 people.The official said the Rudraksh centre will further boost the city’s tourism potential as it ideal for holding international conferences, exhibitions and music concerts among other events and the gallery is done up with murals depicting Varanasi’s art, culture and music, they added.Built with assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the VICCC is an environment friendly building, fit for obtaining level 3 Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA).The CEO of Varanasi Smart City project, Gaurang Rathi, said the centre was equipped with a state-of-the-art building management system and boasted a gallery, meeting rooms, and parking for 120 four-wheelers. Its main hall can be partitioned into smaller chambers or spaces as and when required, he said.Professor Kaushal Kishore Mishra, dean, faculty of social sciences at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), said, “The VICCC is a symbol of India-Japan friendship in Varanasi.”In September 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi named Varanasi Convention Centre as Rudraksh during the India-Japan annual summit at Ahmedabad, where the centre’s design was launched.“I have named it Rudraksh – the symbol of love, and a Prasad of Lord Shiva to humanity. This Rudraksh will be a garland of love of Japan for Varanasi. It will also be a tribute to our shared Buddhist heritage present at Sarnath,” Modi had then said.Thereafter, its construction began in 2018 and it was completed in April 2021 before it was handed over to Varanasi Smart City Limited on May 31.During his visit to Varanasi, Modi will also inaugurate and lay the foundation stones of multiple development projects worth over ₹1,500 crore, an official aware of PM’s schedule said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-inaugurate-rudraksh-the-symbol-of-indo-japan-friendship-101626277200567.html

14-07-2021||India||India and China agree to hold early meeting of military commanders||India and China agreed on Wednesday to hold an early meeting of military commanders to resolve outstanding issues along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) even as foreign minister S Jaishankar bluntly told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that normalisation of bilateral ties depended on restoring peace in the border areas.While conveying India’s position to Wang during their first in-person meeting since last September, Jaishankar made it clear that any unilateral change of status quo on the LAC was unacceptable. The two ministers met for an hour on the margins of a meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe.The discussions “focused on the outstanding issues along the LAC in the Western Sector”, Jaishankar tweeted.“Highlighted that unilateral change of status quo is not acceptable. Full restoration and maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas is essential for development of our ties,” he said in another tweet.In an indication of some forward movement on the military standoff that began in May last year, Jaishankar tweeted that he and Wang had agreed on “convening an early meeting of the Senior Military Commanders”.The external affairs ministry said in a statement that the ministers referred to the agreement reached at the last meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on June 25 to hold another round of talks between military commanders, and “agreed that this should be convened at the earliest”.The statement added, “They also agreed that in this meeting, the two sides should discuss all the remaining issues and seek a mutually acceptable solution.” There was an understanding the two sides would “continue to ensure stability on the ground and neither side will take any unilateral action that could increase tension”.Jaishankar recalled both countries had agreed that prolonging the existing situation on the LAC was not in the interest of either side, and said it was “visibly impacting the relationship in a negative manner”.The meeting was held against the backdrop of reports of fresh tensions on the LAC, including a protest by Chinese troops and civilians against celebrations at Demchok on the Indian side to mark the birthday of the Dalai Lama on July 6.Last month, India again blamed China’s actions of amassing troops in border areas and attempting to change the status quo on the LAC for the military standoff, and dismissed Beijing’s contention that New Delhi’s policies were to blame for the tensions. China has also called for the border issue to be delinked from other aspects of the bilateral relationship, such as trade and investment.There has been lack of progress in disengagement and de-escalation of frontline troops following a limited drawdown on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February.Jaishankar and Wang had a detailed exchange of views on the current situation on the LAC and other issues related to the overall bilateral relations during their meeting, the external affairs ministry said.Recalling their last meeting in Moscow, Jaishankar “emphasised the need to follow through on the agreement reached then and complete the disengagement, resolving the remaining issues along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh at the earliest”.The two ministers had agreed on a five-point roadmap at the Moscow meeting, including quick disengagement of border troops, maintaining proper distance and easing tensions, and abiding by all agreements on boundary affairs.Jaishankar pointed out to Wang the successful disengagement at Pangong Lake this year had “created conditions for resolving the remaining issues”, the statement said. “It was expected that the Chinese side would work with us towards this objective,” the statement said, adding that Jaishankar had noted the situation in the remaining areas was “still unresolved”.Assessing the overall relationship, Jaishankar said maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas was the foundation for developing ties since 1988. “The attempts to change status quo last year that also disregarded commitments under the 1993 and 1996 agreements have inevitably affected ties,” he said.He said it was in the mutual interest of the two sides to work towards an early resolution of the remaining issues on the LAC, while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols.Jaishankar and Wang have also spoken on the phone in February and April this year and there have been further rounds of diplomatic and military talks, but these contacts have not resulted in forward movement on disengagement at friction points such as Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.China’s People’s Liberation Army has continued the deployment of troops and heavy equipment on the LAC and inducted the army’s air defence units in its air force command chain, establishing a joint air defence system for the first time. It has also ramped up the construction and refurbishment of airports, helipads, missile bases and air defence facilities all along the LAC.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the fact that the two foreign ministers met not because of a bilateral initiative but on sidelines of a regional gathering would indicate this was “more like a symbolic meeting than anything substantial that would contribute to the lessening of tensions”.He added, “The goodwill generated through this meeting can only be sustained when the military commanders meet, which would reveal the true intentions of the Chinese side.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peace-at-border-required-for-normal-bilateral-ties-jaishankar-tells-chinese-fm-101626274800375.html
14-07-2021||India||Al-Qaeda terror module: 3 more, suspects nabbed in Lucknow||Three more terror suspects linked to the alleged al-Qaeda module busted in Lucknow on Sunday were arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) from different areas of state capital on Wednesday, said Prashant Kumar, additional director general (ADG) of police.The three, identified as Shakeel Hussain, 35, Mohammad Mustakeem, 44 and Mohammad Mueed are accused of helping Minhaz Ahmad and Maseerudeen in their plan to carry out serial blasts, said the ADG. Minhaz and Maseerudeen were arrested on Sunday for plotting to carry out terror strikes in the state including using “human bombs” before Independence DayUP ATS stated that the names of the trio surfaced during interrogation of the terror suspects arrested earlier, following which, the three were brought to the ATS police station for verification and later arrested after their active involvement in the conspiracy was established during questioning.Mustakeem helped Minhaz and Maseerudeen in arranging terrorism-related material while Mueed provided a pistol to Minhaz and Shakeel also helped in arranging pistol from a firearms dealer, said the ADG.Shakeel’s family members alleged that the UP ATS framed him as they had not found anything objectionable from his possession. They said he was earning a livelihood by driving an e-rickshaw.“He has a clean record and never got involved in criminal activity in the past.

The petition will be heard on Thursday.The top court is already hearing a petition and a clutch of applications challenging the constitutional validity of Section 124A IPC. But what sets this petition apart is its prayer to quash all complaints lodged under this law and to stop police from further investigating case to the extent that the offence relates to sedition.The petition filed by SG Vombatkere, a former army officer, was argued by advocate PB Suresh. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana directed a copy of the petition to be given to attorney general KK Venugopal and posted the matter for hearing on Thursday.Section 124A of the IPC makes any speech or expression that “brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India” a criminal offence punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The offence is not bailable. The Supreme Court in 1962 had upheld the validity of this provision in Kedar Nath Yadav v State of Bihar.Also Read | Minority schemes do not defy Hindus’ rights, Centre tells SCThe petition said, “A statute criminalising expression based on unconstitutionally vague definitions of ‘disaffection towards Government’ is an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right to free expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and causes constitutionally impermissible ‘chilling effect’ on speech.”Vombatkere further stated that in 1962, when this law was upheld, there was a restricted definition of fundamental rights which now needs a relook. He sought a declaration that “all subsisting criminal proceedings before any court” under Section 124A of IPC should be closed and all complaints and investigation reports relating to the offence under Section 124A be quashed.The petition filed through advocate S Prasanna said, “No authority including any state or central police must take any step in furtherance of investigation or prosecution of any cases in respect of and to the extent that the accusation is of an offence under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code.”The other petition challenging Section 124A before the apex court is being heard by a bench headed by justice UU Lalit. It has been filed by two journalists – Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha and Kanhaiya Lal Shukla working in Manipur and Chhattisgarh respectively. The court has already issued notice to the Centre and sought assistance of the attorney general. In this matter, the Foundation of Media Professionals, journalist Shashi Kumar and law professor Sanjay S Jain have filed applications to declare Section 124A IPC unconstitutional. This matter is expected to come up for hearing on July 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-army-veteran-s-pil-on-closure-of-all-sedition-cases-101626260819459.html

14-07-2021||India||'If Covid appropriate behaviour not maintained...': MHA sends advisory to states||The Union home ministry on Wednesday issued advisory to states and union territories over "blatant violation" of Covid-19 norms, saying there is a need to "guard ourselves against complacency and laxity, which has crept in as positivity has declined".It also asked states to make officers personally responsible for any laxity in strict enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour.“If the norms of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour are not maintained at any establishment/premises/markets etc, such places shall be liable for the re-imposition of restrictions, for containing the spread of Covid-19 and the defaulters shall also be liable for action under the relevant laws,” the advisory sent by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said.It said that people have been found violating the Covid-19 norms in several parts of the country, especially in public transport and at hill stations. "Massive crowds are also thronging the market places, violating the norms of social distancing," the ministry said.It also said that the increase in R-Factor (reproduction number which indicates the speed at which infection is spreading) in some of the states, is a matter of concern."You may be aware that any increase in ‘R’ factor above 1.0 is an indicator of spread of Covid-19," the advisory said."It is emphasised that the second wave of Covid is not yet over. We ought to remember that while the reach of vaccination is increasing considerably, there is no room for complacency and hence COVID appropriate behaviour must continue in line with our philosophy of ‘dawai bhi kadai bhi'. Testing needs to be continued with the same vigor, as adequate testing is extremely essential in terms of checking the virus and early identification of cases," it further said.The home ministry advisory came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with chief ministers of northeastern states, where he expressed concern about the rush of tourists at popular destinations.“We often hear the argument that we must enjoy before a third wave hits. People must understand that the third wave will not arrive on its own,” Modi said.At a press briefing on Tuesday, a health ministry official said that people are violating Covid protocols across the country.Photos have surfaced in recent weeks of people rushing to Musoorie and Nanital in Uttarakhand and roaming around with little regard to social distancing norms or wearing of masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-covid-appropriate-behaviour-not-maintained-mha-sends-advisory-to-states-101626251909317.html

The amount, which was a little less than the higher bid limit of ₹40 crore, includes buyer’s premium.The work broke multiple records; besides being the second-highest sum for any Indian artwork sold at an auction, it is also the highest sum fetched by the any of Sher-gil’s works at an auction till date.Also Read | Palaeolithic cave paintings found in corner of NCR could be among oldestAccording to Saffronart’s website, the provenance of the canvas was traced back to the Majithia family collection. It was acquired by the present owner (unnamed, who put it up for auction) in 2005 from the Vadehra Art Gallery in New Delhi. A 1961 Gaitonde oil on canvas sold for ₹39.98 crore at a Saffronart auction held earlier this year in March; Arvind Vijaymohan, chief executive officer of art market intelligence and advisory firm Artery India confirmed that this record has not been challenged as yet in auction sales.Sher-gil’s work, which depicts women and a girl performing different chores, was made after the artist returned to India after studying and practising art in Paris. Her emphasis on domesticity and the quotidian, particularly of the women inhabitants of a home, revitalised Indian art. The modern Indian artist is deemed a national treasure, which implies that her artworks cannot be taken out of the country.“It is a rare work of the artist from that particular period to emerge in the art market and we are honoured to have played a part in creating a new benchmark with this auction,” Saffronart co-founder and chief executive officer Dinesh Vazirani said in a post-auction press release issued on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amrita-sher-gil-s-painting-second-highest-priced-indian-artwork-to-be-auctioned-101626251818815.html
14-07-2021||India||When will central govt employees get their DA dues? Decision soon||Central government employees get a dearness allowance of 17 per cent at present, the rate which has been continuing since 2019, as the consecutive revisions of the DA were stalled owing to the Coronavirus pandemic. Reports said a decision in this regard may be taken soon, while the Cabinet may announce a 3 per cent hike in the DA which cumulatively will take the figure from 17 to over 30 per cent. The Union Cabinet met on Wednesday afternoon, making it the second meeting of the cabinet in less than a week. The first meeting was held a day after new ministers took their oath.Dearness allowance is revised twice a year -- in January and July. Since 2020, three increments are due as of now, as the July 2021 increment has not yet been announced. Four increments are likely to take to DA from 17 per cent to around 31 or 32 per cent. The last time the DA was hiked was in 2020. A 4% hike was announced following which central government employees are entitled to get 21% DA. But the increment was not implemented and the rate was not revised in 2020 and 20201. If the government includes all these hikes and if the DA increases 3% thrice, then the amount might go over 30%. In March, then finance minister of state Anurag Thakur had told the Rajya Sabha that the three pending installments of DA (January 2020, July 2020, and January 2021) will be restored from July 2020. In June, a meeting was held between finance ministry officials, the National Council of Joint Consultative Machinery, and the department of personnel and training in June. Reports said that it was decided in the meeting that DA dues will be resumed from September. Central government employees were expecting their DA dues from this month as a fake order claiming the same was doing the rounds on social media. But the ministry later busted this as fake order.Central government employees are looking forward to two announcements: the DA hike announcement and the timeline in which it will be disbursed. It has been reported that the dues might be given in three installments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-will-central-govt-employees-get-their-da-dues-decision-soon-101626250948802.html

For July, the availability of doses has been increased to 135 million," a rough translation of Mandaviya's tweet, posted in Hindi, read.

The central government did this so that state governments can carry out vaccination at district-level without any inconvenience to the people," the minister posted further.जुलाई में राज्यों में वैक्सीन के कितने डोज उपलब्ध कराई जाएगी, इसकी जानकारी केंद्र सरकार ने राज्यों को 19 जून, 2021 को ही दे दी थी। इसके बाद 27 जून व 13 जुलाई को केंद्र की ओर से राज्यों को जुलाई के पहले व दूसरे पखवाड़े के लिए उन्हें हर दिन की वैक्सीन उपलब्धता की जानकारी..(3/6)Indirectly blaming states for "mismanagement" of vaccination drive, if there is one, Mandaviya remarked that it is "very clear" what is the problem and who is responsible for it, despite being informed in advance by the government.मीडिया में भ्रम व चिंता पैदा करने वाले बयान देने वाले नेताओ को इस बात पर आत्मनिरीक्षण करने की जरूरत है क्या उन्होने शासन प्रक्रिया व इससे सबंधित जानकारियों से इतनी दूरी बना ली है कि वैक्सीन आपूर्ति के संदर्भ में पहले से ही दी जा रही जानकारियों का उन्हें कोई अता-पता नहीं है ( 6/6)"Politicians making misleading comments in the media need to introspect if they have distanced themselves so much from administrative process and information related to it that they are not aware of information being provided in advance with regards to the supply of vaccine," Mandaviya concluded.Also Read | Jumla hai, vaccine nahi: Rahul Gandhi slams centre over vaccine shortageWith the devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic declining, experts have expressed concerns over a possible third wave, and called for ramping up of the vaccination drive.

We'll pay the fare. We'll sit outside Parliament while proceedings will continue in the House. It'll be a peaceful protest. Today we'll have a meeting and we'll plan a strategy,” Tikait told news agency ANI.The Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions, said in a press release that farmers and leaders from Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, and Karnataka who have been protesting at Delhi borders will be taking part in “methodical and peaceful protest” outside Parliament.Calling on non-NDA MPs to take up the farmers' call, SKM said letters will be issued on July 17 to their offices or official residences to ensure they take up the farmers' cause inside the House. "If opposition parties are serious about their support to the farmers, they must take on the Union Govt. in the same spirit of resolve that the farmers are showing by the seven-month-long protest on the streets and borders of Delhi," the SKM said.Also Read: Will farmer leaders contest upcoming assembly polls?

Unfortunately, the opposition is not doing its job, so the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has emerged as the opposition.

14-07-2021||India||Man arrested for raising money for 19 ‘orphaned’ kids from MP in Raipur||A man has been arrested for allegedly bringing 19 tribal children from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh to Chhattisgarh’s Raipur, passing them as orphans, who lost their parents to Covid-19, and seeking donations for them, police said. The poor families of the children were allegedly promised good money for letting them accompany the man to Raipur, they added.Additional police superintendent (Raipur) Tarkeshwar Patel said the accused Naresh Mahanand claims to be an evangelist. He added they were probing whether the children were brought to Raipur for conversion.Patel said Mahanand is the director of an NGO. He added they have arrested him under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 420 B (fraud) and the Juvenile Justice Act for bringing the children illegally to Raipur. Patel said as most of the children have parents and were brought to Raipur on the pretext of providing them with a good life.Police said Mahanand ran a campaign on social media and also distributed pamphlets requesting financial support for his orphanage. Mahanand claimed his organisation was taking care of the orphaned children, they added.Chhattisgarh and Madhya Police were investigating whether Mahanand is part of a bigger and organised network.Investigators said prima facie parents of the children are believed to have been under the impression that Mahanand’s organisation was working on behalf of the government. The mother of one of the 19 said last month they came to know that the organisation is working with the government for Covid 19-affected people. “They promised us that the kids will get a good education, so we handed our children to a manager of the organisation,” said the mother of the 11-year-old.Some of the 19 lost their parents to Covid 19 and their guardians sent them to Raipur. The children were brought back to Mandla in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday. A 10-year-old boy among them said they were locked in a house and not allowed to go anywhere. “There were two employees in the house, and they would provide us very poor-quality food. We mainly got boiled pulses to eat and poor-quality rice.”Patel said they received a complaint from a woman and child development officer two days ago that an unregistered organisation brought the 19 children from Madhya Pradesh and was seeking donations in their name, saying they were orphaned during the pandemic. “We found the children living in a very poor condition. We rescued them.” He added the children were produced before a Child Welfare Committee, which recommended the charges to be invoked in the case.According to the 2019 National Crime Records Bureau report, 30 children went missing daily in Madhya Pradesh. Most of such missing cases were reported from the state’s tribal areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-arrested-for-raising-money-for-19-orphaned-kids-from-mp-in-raipur-101626248698654.html

14-07-2021||India||Will offer free electricity if we win: Kejriwal in Goa||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday promised up to 300 units of free electricity per household in Goa and free power to farmers if his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is voted to power in the 2022 assembly elections in the state.“I have come to give a guarantee that if our party comes to power, each family, each month will get 300 free units (of electricity). Just like in Delhi, the bill will come to your home but the amount to be paid will be zero. No tax, no surcharge,” said Kejriwal, who is on a two-day visit to the poll-bound state.He said in Delhi, 73% of the people were availing free electricity. “In Goa, 87% of the state will have to pay zero electricity bills,” he said. “These are real promises not like other parties who give chunavi jumla (poll rhetoric). This is my guarantee.” Kejriwal promised to fix Goa’s power distribution infrastructure to ensure a 24-hour power supply.Kejriwal has made similar promises in poll-bound states of Uttarakhand and Punjab. His pledge in Uttarakhand came after the hill state’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised to provide the first 100 units of electricity for free and the next 100 at a 50% discount.In Goa, Kejriwal said before AAP came to power in Delhi, the city experienced seven to eight hours of power cuts even in the summers. “There are problems in the Goa distribution network, just like in Delhi. We changed the transformers, cables. It took 2-1/2 years, but today we get 24-hour electricity.”Kejriwal said his party wants clean politics in Goa. “Your politics is corrupt. Two years back on July 10, 10 Congress MLAs (members of legislative assembly) defected to the BJP. The people gave the mandate to Congress (in 2017), but the government was formed by the BJP. The party (BJP) that had 13 MLAs has 27 today. Then why have elections at all? There is no meaning to the elections. This is cheating. It is not right,” he said.The Congress emerged as the single largest party in the state in 2017 with 17 lawmakers in the 40-member House. But BJP formed the government with the help of the Goa Forward Party, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and Independents taking nine MLAs on board. In 2019, 10 Congress lawmakers defected to the BJP and two in 2018 and one is 2017 itself.Kejriwal called for “new politics” and a new political party for it in Goa. He said AAP is strengthening its organisation in Goa and represented a real alternative to the two major political parties--BJP and Congress.The defections are emerging as a major issue ahead of the polls in Goa. Congress has decided to move a resolution in the assembly for strengthening the anti-defection law.Also Read | Amid poll push, Kejriwal meets MGP chief in Goa“He can spend the next six months in Goa along with his whole cabinet and even run the Delhi government from here while simultananeously campainging but it will be to no avail. It will not make a difference to us,” state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said. “We will win the upcoming elections on our own strength and with the blessings of the people,” he added.Congress senior spokesperson and national media panelist Trajano D’Mello said that since the AAP would not be coming to power in Goa they are free to make any promises no matter how unrealistic.“Since he has said that if AAP is coming to power they will give free electricity, he is already conceding that he will not be coming to power. Besides, if he is serious about his promise why doesn’t he start paying people’s electricity bills already like they have begun distributing ration already? D’Mello asked.Independent commentator Prabhakar Timble said that the party’s announcement would not cut much ice with Goa’s electorate especially the segment that AAP is targeting since the problem of exhorbitant power bills is not something that is an issue in Goa.“In Delhi the average electricity bill is above ₹5,000 in the non summer months so power bills were a genuine complaint. Here the rates are reasonable,” Timble said. “Besides the very constituency that AAP is targeting and who are cheering him on will not stand to benefit from the measure,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-promises-free-24x7-power-to-goa-if-elected-101626246358540.html

External affairs minister S Jaishankar raised these issues when he joined his counterparts from the SCO states – China, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan – for the meeting in Dushanbe. The meeting is also being attended by representatives from countries with observer status with SCO, including Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar. Also Read | Jaishankar, Wang Yi likely to meet today on margins of SCO meeting in Dushanbe“Afghanistan, public health and economic recovery are pressing issues. Combating terrorism and extremism is the key purpose of SCO. Must stop terror financing and deter digital facilitation,” Jaishankar tweeted after addressing the meeting. Jaishankar also welcomed the meeting of the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan later in the day, and urged the need for early universal vaccination against Covid-19. He also spoke on reformed multilateralism. The meeting in the 20th year of the existence of SCO is “an opportune time to reflect on achievements & deliberate on challenges”, he said in a tweet before the meet. Before the meeting, the foreign ministers of SCO states called on Tajik President Emomali Rahmon. Shortly after arriving in Dushanbe on Tuesday, Jaishankar met Atmar and discussed the latest developments in Afghanistan and cooperation in the fight against terrorism and for establishing peace and stability in the region. The meeting provided an opportunity for the two sides to compare notes on developments in Afghanistan, especially the security situation, amid the rapid drawdown of US and foreign forces and the Taliban’s violent campaign to capture territory. The Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement that Atmar and Jaishankar discussed the political and security situation, the peace process, and “India’s cooperation with Afghanistan in various fields, including the joint fight against terrorism and the establishment of lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan and the region”. Atmar referred to the escalation of Taliban attacks on civilians and Afghan forces in “collusion with foreign fighters and regional and international terrorist networks”, and said that “overcoming this common threat was of vital importance to regional security”. He underscored India’s constructive role in strengthening regional consensus on the Afghan peace process and preserving the achievements of the past two decades. Jaishankar expressed concern at the escalation of violence and stressed the need to end bloodshed in Afghanistan, the statement said. He assured Atmar of India’s continued cooperation in “strengthening regional and global consensus to achieve a political settlement in Afghanistan”. In a separate meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Atmar described the “presence of foreign fighters and regional and international terrorist networks alongside the Taliban” as a major threat to the region. Atmar emphasised the need for “practical cooperation between regional countries, particularly Pakistan, in closing shelters and ceasing funding sources of the Taliban, and encouraging the group to resume meaningful talks and find a political solution”. The Taliban have stepped up attacks on rural areas of numerous provinces, especially in northern Afghanistan, and taken control of key border crossings and regions bordering Iran, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. The violence has coincided with the US saying it has completed 90% of the withdrawal of its troops and that the process will be completed by August 31. India has repeatedly expressed concern at the spike in violence across Afghanistan and called for a comprehensive ceasefire while efforts continue to find a political settlement. Jaishankar has also asserted the need for having a legitimate government in Kabul amid fears that the Taliban will try to capture power by force. New Delhi pulled out all its diplomats, staffers and security personnel from its consulate in Kandahar over the weekend after fierce clashes erupted between the Taliban and security forces in and around the southern Afghan city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistans-security-situation-to-dominate-sco-meeting-in-dushanbe-101626245218741.html

It has issued notices to both the central government as well as the Uttar Pradesh government, and scheduled the hearing of the matter for July 16.The development comes amid the UP government’s decision to go ahead with the Kanwar Yatra, even when Uttarakhand has scrapped the annual pilgrimage this year. Senior officials of the UP administration indicated that they could make a negative Covid-19 test report mandatory.“It’s status quo in UP. We are talking to kanwar sanghs and everything will be done within the Covid-19 protocol. Even if devotees come from other states to UP, they will have to follow those protocols,” additional chief secretary (home), Awanish Kumar Awasthi said on Tuesday.Kanwar Yatra is an annual pilgirmmage wherein Lord Shiva devotees travel either on foot or bicycle to fetch the holy water of the Ganga from Uttarakhand’s Haridwar to their village shrines. This year the yatra is scheduled to start from July 25 onwards.Meanwhile, the Uttarakhand government cancelled the Kanwar Yatra this year in view of the Covid-19 crisis, with chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami saying that people’s lives are their “first priority”. “We don’t want to make Haridwar the centre of Covid-19,” he added. The decision came after Dhami chaired a meeting on Tuesday evening.The Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) state secretary Dr Amit Khanna, in a letter to Dhami, requested the newly-appointed chief minister to refrain from holding the Kanwar Yatra. “After the first wave, we became off-guard and could not follow the guidelines of the central government…which was a gross negligence on our part…and consequently lost several of our kind in…the second wave of Covid pandemic,” he stated, as reported by Livemint.Khanna further pointed out that keeping in mind the previous failures, the Kanwar Yatra should not be allowed to keep Uttarakhand “safe from third Covid wave”.On July 6, Uttarakhand had decided to stop all Kanwar Yatra devotees from entering the state, but took the decision to review the move two days later after UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath called Dhami. Notably, both the states go into Assembly polls next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-allowing-kanwar-yatra-supreme-court-issues-notice-to-centre-up-government-101626244301871.html

14-07-2021||India||First-ever study to check human anthrax cases underway in Odisha’s Koraput||Bhubaneswar’s Regional Medical Research Centre has started a study across 14 blocks in Odisha’s Koraput for coordinated interventions to check animal-to-human transmission of anthrax. The study is likely to be completed by end of next year. It will test the effectiveness of public health interventions to check the disease transmission in Koraput, the epicentre of anthrax in Odisha. Of the 30 districts of Odisha, 19 are reported as endemic for human anthrax. In all 19 districts, anthrax was diagnosed among livestock. In four districts—Koraput, Rayagada, Malkangiri, and Sundergarh—human anthrax cases were reported. Among the three types of anthrax, the cutaneous form was most common across the state.Koraput has accounted for 300 human anthrax cases and 10 deaths over the last six years. Around 1,208 cases and 436 deaths were reported during the period.Anthrax is a zoonotic disease that affects the lungs, intestines, and skin. It is considered fatal if patients are not diagnosed early and treated promptly with antibiotics. The disease can transmit from animals to humans.“In the study, we will use a package of interventions to show which one works better to eliminate human anthrax cases as elimination of animal anthrax cases is difficult as it is difficult to control animals. Human anthrax can be eliminated through behavioural change, awareness, regular vaccination of animals. We will see if we vaccinate animals properly and cut down the cases,” said Debadutta Bhattacharya, one of the scientists involved in the study.Bhattacharya said anthrax is endemic in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh and that this is the first such study.Conventional butchering practices, unsafe handling and disposal of the contaminated carcasses, and poor vaccination coverage are seen among the main reasons behind anthrax outbreaks in Odisha’s tribal districts. In the Kashipur block of Rayagada district, dead-cattle meat is also consumed, which is also among the causes of the infections.Bhattacharya said they plan to enrol 2,640 adults across 112 villages in Koraput for the study and provide capacity building training on awareness. “We would establish a state-level laboratory for timely diagnosis and management of human anthrax cases. Surveillance network will be strengthened to track the cases in early-stage and risk zoning will be done for focused surveillance in endemic areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/firstever-study-to-check-human-anthrax-cases-underway-in-odisha-s-koraput-101626242038208.html

He tagged a media report claiming that Delhi, along with many other states, was facing a shortage of vaccines, which the Centre has denied.Congress leader P Chidambaram, too, hit out at the government regarding the vaccination programme on Tuesday, citing shortages reported by Delhi and Odisha.“Vaccine shortage is a fact. Vaccine production is exaggerated. Vaccine import is a mystery. Vaccinating the entire adult population by December 2021 is an empty boast,” the former Union minister said.Also Read | India’s daily Covid-19 case count up to 38,792; 624 deaths reported“Will the new health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tell the nation the truth about the vaccination programme?” Chidambaram asked.Chidambaram said the numbers of ministers is increasing (in the new Union Cabinet) but not the Covid-19 vaccine stock in the country.Communist Party of India (Marxist) Sitaram Yechury on Sunday also hit out at the Centre, saying that a “bulky Cabinet” was not going to be useful if public investments were not increased.The Opposition’s constant attack comes amid the weekly pace of vaccination declining to nearly 60% of what it was in the week after June 21, when the Centre entirely took over vaccine procurement from the states. The slackening has resulted in several states complaining of a shortage and an inability to cater to demand.On Tuesday, at least three states-- New Delhi, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu-- reported shortage of vaccines, with some saying they had to shut down vaccination centres, even as the Union government denied there were constraints in supplies.“We are running a marathon, not a sprint; and need to understand its challenges. We are regularly hand-holding states and vaccine manufacturers . The production of vaccines is being augmented gradually. In some time, there will be more doses available,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, while replying during a press briefing on states facing vaccine shortage last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jumla-hai-vaccine-nahi-rahul-gandhi-slams-centre-over-vaccine-shortage-101626241438096.html

Tagging a media report that claimed that Delhi and many other states were facing a shortage of vaccines though the Centre had denied it, Gandhi tweeted “there are ‘jumlas’ (rhetoric) but not vaccines,”.Congress has been a staunch critic of the Centre's vaccine policy since the vaccination drive was rolled out.

Jaishankar and Wang are in Dushanbe to attend meetings of the SCO foreign ministers and the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan. Besides the India-China standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that has dragged on for more than a year, they are expected to discuss the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan. There was no official word from both countries on a meeting between the two foreign ministers. This will be their first in-person bilateral meeting since last September, when they held talks on the margins of another SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in Moscow.Also Read | Ahead of SCO meeting, Jaishankar meets Afghan counterpart The meeting in Moscow had resulted in a five-point roadmap for resolving the standoff on the LAC, which is yet to be fully implemented. Under that roadmap, the two sides had agreed not to let differences to become disputes, and to quickly disengage on the LAC and maintain proper distance between their troops and ease tensions. The two ministers further agreed that both countries would abide by all existing agreements and protocols on boundary affairs, maintain peace and tranquillity in border areas and “avoid any action that could escalate matters”. They also agreed to continue talks through diplomatic and military channels, and to work towards new confidence building measures for the border areas once the situation eases. After a limited drawdown on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February, the two sides have been unable to make headway on disengagement of troops at other friction points in the Ladakh sector despite more rounds of diplomatic and military talks. The Indian side has sought to play down the prospect of a meeting between the two foreign ministers in Dushanbe because it is unlikely to result in any significant forward movement in addressing the situation on the LAC, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Jaishankar has repeatedly said China’s unilateral actions, including massing troops on the LAC, attempting to alter the status quo and the clash at Galwan Valley last year that resulted in the first fatalities since 1975, have disturbed overall bilateral relations. He has also said a normal relationship can be restored only if there is peace and tranquillity on the border. China, on the other hand, has called for the border issue to be set aside while the two countries take forward relations in other areas such as trade and investment. This has been taken as a sign in New Delhi that Beijing isn’t interested in speedily resolving the LAC standoff. The situation in Afghanistan too is expected to figure in the meeting between the two foreign ministers. China has sought to play a role in the war-torn country by holding meetings with the Taliban and other players but its efforts have not led to any success. Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi too is in Dushanbe for the SCO meeting, but the people cited above ruled out any possibility of a meeting between him and Jaishankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-wang-yi-likely-to-meet-today-on-margins-of-sco-meeting-in-dushanbe-101626239217907.html

It said that the article has been published with uncorroborated facts.This comes on the day when external affairs minister S Jaishankar is scheduled to meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Dushanbe where the two leaders are expected to discuss the ways to fast track de-escalation and disengagement in East Ladakh.The army said that the article falsely claims that there have been clashes in the Galwan Valley near the Line of Actual Control (LAC), calling the intention of the reporter "malafide". It said that ever since the disengagement agreement in February this year, there has been no attempt by either side to occupy the areas from where the disengagement had been undertaken.The article claimed that clashes took place closer to the place of skirmish in June last year.The army further said that both India and China are continuing the negotiations to resolve the border issues, and regular patrolling in respective areas is on. It said that activities of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is being continuously monitored by the Indian Army.The situation on ground continues to be as hithertofore, said the army.The Galwan Valley clash of June 15, 2020, was the first deadly skirmish between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in more than five decades, and pushed the bilateral relationship to breaking point. It left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead.Since then, the two armies have held 11 rounds of talks between corps commander-rank officers, but the negotiations have only had limited success in hammering out an agreement for disengagement of rival soldiers from friction points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misinformation-govt-on-reports-of-collapse-of-border-talks-with-china-101626238226440.html

The finance ministry issued a statement clarifying its stand and said that the process will be kept on hold as of now.The row erupted as former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah took to Twitter and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of betraying Kannadigas. "Latest notification by IBPS is an example of BJP's anti-Kannada stand. Central government should immediately address this and ensure justice to Kannadigas," he tweeted.Being elected to Rajya Sabha from Karnataka, @nsitharaman has constantly betrayed Kannadigas and Kannada.She has continued the same with respect to IBPS exams. She is unfit to represent people of Karnataka in Rajya Sabha. She should resign if she has any shame.#IBPSExamTaking finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman's name specifically, Siddaramaiah said that though the minister represents Karnataka in the Rajya Sabha, she has "constantly betrayed Kannadigas and Kannada". "Karnataka has elected 25 MPs to Lok Sabha. What are these MPs doing? Though slavery is abolished, BJP Karnataka MPS are behaving like slaves of Narendra Modi," Siddaramaiah wrote."IBPS had called for applications to fill more than 3000 vacant clerk positions in about 11 nationalised banks. Out of these, 407 posts are in Karnataka. Injustice to Kannada will result in huge unemployment by leaving out Kannadigas in the competition. Candidates were able to write IBPS exams in regional languages before 2014. After BJP came to power, rules were changed to allow English and Hindi only," Siddaramaiah wrote.Reports said in 2019 Sitharaman had assured that banking exams will be held in local languages. Rejecting the claim, the finance ministry said that the finance ministry's assurance was made in the context of exams for Regional Rural Banks, not IBPS. "With a view to provide a level playing field to the local youths for availing employment opportunities, the Government in 2019 decided that for recruitment of Office Assistant and Officer Scale I in RRBs, examination will be held in 13 regional languages including Konakani and Kannada, besides Hindi and English. Since then, examination for these recruitments are being conducted in regional languages also," the ministry said."In order to look into the demand for holding examination for clerical cadre in Public Sector Banks (PSBs) in local/regional languages, a Committee has been constituted to look into the matter in its entirety. The Committee will give its recommendations within 15 days. The ongoing process of holding the examination initiated by IBPS will be kept on hold until the recommendations of the Committee are made available," it said.This year, IBPS will select clerks for Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Canara Bank, Central Bank of India, Indian Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Punjab National Bank, Punjab and Sind Bank, UCO Bank and Union Bank of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ibps-exam-process-to-be-stopped-for-now-says-ministry-amid-language-row-101626234586639.html

India has a two-year tenure till end of 2022 as a non-permanent member of UNSC.Foreign secretary Shringla flew to New York this morning for a two-day meetings with the officials at the UN and finalising the Indian plans after discussion with the UN Permanent Representative TS Tirumurti in New York. During his official meetings on July 15-16, Shringla is expected to meet visiting French foreign minister Jean Yves Le Drian, UK minister of state and all the top dignitaries of the UN. He returns to India next Monday after attending two important UNSC sessions. Currently, India’s close ally France is the president of the UNSC.Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has decided to take its UNSC tenure very seriously with both Jaishankar and Shringla expected to visit UN quite often during the two-year period. Subject to the state of global pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be addressing the UNGA and other important meetings on the side-lines in September.While topics like Afghanistan have now taken a priority over Libyan and Syrian crisis, the UNSC will be discussing the unfolding security situation in Kabul with the fundamentalist Taliban putting the Islamic nation to sword through military conquest. “Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq and Syria catch the attention of UNSC frequently and hence discussions on these burning topics will take place during Indian presidency,” said a UN diplomat from New York.High level discussion on maritime security will be very important for the UNSC in the context of Indo-Pacific and freedom of navigation for unhindered global trade. Cooperation in counter-terrorism will also take priority as Afghanistan could emerge as a new epicentre of terrorism as Pakistan based terrorists groups will use the depth areas for training and targeting countries like India, US, UK and Israel, which had happened when Taliban seized Kabul in 1996. India, incidentally, currently heads the 1267 committee of the UN which designates global terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-jaishankar-to-chair-unsc-meetings-during-indian-presidency-next-month-101626229194175.html

"Our task is to ensure that the wave does not come in India," VK Paul said during the official briefing of the Union health ministry.Citing global data, the Union health ministry said that the United Kingdom, Russia, Bangladesh, Indonesia are seeing a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, which is indicating at a new wave of the Coronavirus pandemic.Here are 5 things that you must know1. In India, there is no sign of any fresh wave overall, as the country is registering a decline in the number of daily cases. On Tuesday, India recorded 31,443 new cases, which was the lowest in 118 days.2. But in some states, the situation is not improving, the ministry has said. According to the health ministry's data, Kerala is now reporting 30.3 per cent of India's total caseload. In April, this share was 6.2 per cent. In May and June, these shares were 10.6 per cent and 17.1 per cent, respectively.66 districts, over 10% Covid positivity rate: What these 2 maps tell about India's present situation3.

According to Union health ministry data, some states have recorded a decline in the number of cases, but the decline has stopped and the situation has moved towards a plateau.The health ministry on Tuesday cited four reasons why people avoid masks and said that all these reasons are baseless and wearing a mask is one of the ways to stay off the infection. Among the reasons, cited by the ministry, people refuse to wear masks complaining of breathing problems, discomfort, while many believe that masks do not help in the prevention of Covid-19 and also mask is not required if social distancing is maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/390-lakh-global-covid-cases-in-3rd-wave-what-government-s-chief-advisor-says-101626227647821.html

"We are ready to ship those vaccines expeditiously when we have a green light from the Government of India,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said, as reported by news agency PTI. US vaccines have reached Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. But for India, it is taking time as there are some legal hurdles for emergency import, Ned Price said.The US earlier announced to share 80 million doses from its domestic stock with countries around the world. Under India's share, it is supposed to get 3-4 million doses of Moderna and Pfizer from the United States. While Moderna has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India, Pfizer has not yet applied for an emergency approval in India yet.When will Moderna and Pfizer Covid vaccines reach India? Latest updatesWhat are the legal hurdles?"Before we can ship those doses, however, each country must complete its own domestic set of operational, of regulatory, and legal processes that are specific to each country. Now, India has determined that it needs further time to review legal provisions related to accepting vaccine donations," Price said."Once India works through its legal processes, our donations of vaccines to India will proceed expeditiously. We would need to refer you to the Government of India on the status of its discussions with COVAX, which, in this case, is helping to facilitate that delivery,” he said."More broadly in the region, throughout South Asia, we're donating millions of vaccines to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Roughly 40 million doses have been delivered worldwide so far,” he added.Legal indemnityThe vaccine doses that will be available to India now are part of US donation and no agreement on commercial supplies of these vaccines in India has been made yet. As DCGI approved Moderna, Cipla will import the vaccines from the US. But there has been no decision on legal indemnity as yet. Moderna and Pfizer have wanted legal protection in India which will shield them from legal cases in the country.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-says-it-s-waiting-for-india-s-nod-to-dispatch-pfizer-moderna-vaccines-101626221374276.html

14-07-2021||India||Covid-19: Modi flags crowding in hills as 3rd wave trigger||The crowds at hill stations and markets where people are not wearing masks or following Covid-19 protocols are a matter of concern, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday, calling the scenes that have played out in several parts of the country as “not right”.Modi made the remark during a meeting with the chief ministers of the North-East states, where cases have increased in recent weeks while most other parts of the country have shown a drop in new infections.“I would like to emphasise strongly that the crowds that are emerging at hill stations and markets without masks or without following protocols are a matter of concern. It’s not right,” he said, according to a transcript of his speech shared by the government.“We often hear the argument that we must enjoy before a third wave hits. People must understand that the third wave will not arrive on its own,” Modi said, adding that questions must be asked on how we can together stop the next wave of infections.The Prime Minister’s remarks came at a time when tourist hot spots have recorded large crowds, forcing some to cap the number of guests permitted at hotels and guest houses.At a press briefing later on Tuesday, a health ministry official said people are violating Covid protocols across the country. “Be it Chennai, Delhi, Chandigarh, or the state of Maharashtra, there is a section that does not observe Covid safe behaviour. The third wave may be caused because of this behaviour,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry.“We talk about the third wave as if it’s a weather update. What we fail to understand is that adhering to Covid appropriate behaviour or lack of it is what will prevent or cause any future waves,” he added.Overall, India’s headline Covid numbers have fallen roughly 16% in the last fortnight. The seven-day average of new cases was around 49,000 on June 27, coming down to around 41,000 on July 11. But six states — five in the North-East and Kerala — have bucked this trend, with cases as well as positivity rate being high.Modi raised this concern when he met the chief ministers of Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Assam via video conferencing. All of these regions are reporting a rise in new cases.The PM said it was important to catch signs of an outbreak early. “We need to keep a watch on coronavirus variants. It’s a virus that keeps evolving and because of that, our challenges become harder – which is why, we must keep a close watch.”Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the state was following a micro-containment strategy, an approach the PM endorsed. Sarma, officials in Guwahati said, told Modi that he was confident that Assam’s positivity rate would be brought down to below 1% soon. Assam has been recording around 2,500 new cases and around 25-30 deaths daily for more than two weeks now.Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma said at the meeting that the state did not record a wave when the nation was going through one, and it used the opportunity to augment infrastructure. “We got to prepare the required infra, augment oxygen generation capacity and others in advance,” the CM said, while expressing concern over growing numbers in rural areas.Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh thanked the PM for the support and cooperation to the states. Manipur has been recording around 800 new cases daily and 10-15 deaths. The state has around 7,500 active cases.Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb briefed Modi about the Covid vaccination progress and steps taken to control Covid. Tripura, with a positivity rate of over 5%, will take the required steps to reduce the positivity rate as well as number of cases, he said, according to officials.Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu informed the PM that during the past week the state recorded case fatality ratio of 0.57%, which is lowest among all north-eastern states.Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio highlighted pandemic control measures by citing the total lockdown that began in May, and said the state has now begun its first phase of “unlock”.The situation in the North-East was also flagged by government officials, who were speaking at the routine health briefing on Tuesday. “It is important that there must be no slacking of efforts if cases remain at high level in any geography, no matter how limited,” said Aggarwal.He added that 55 districts in the country currently have more than 10% positivity rate.“The only way to stop the pandemic in its tracks is by ensuring that people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour that includes wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing and observing good hygiene, along with vaccination,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine, Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-modi-flags-crowding-in-hills-as-3rd-wave-trigger-101626212345425.html
14-07-2021||India||Uttar Pradesh govt insists Kanwar yatra will go on||Uttar Pradesh will continue with the kanwar yatra despite Uttarakhand cancelling the pilgrimage this year, senior officials said on Tuesday, indicating that the state government could make negative Covid reports mandatory for devotees.The fortnight-long yatra, in which Shiva devotees travel to Haridwar and carry Ganga water back to local shrines, is set to begin from July 25.On Tuesday, Uttarakhand scrapped the event over fears of a Covid surge.“It’s status quo in UP. We are talking to kanwar sanghs and everything will be done within the Covid protocol. Even if devotees come from other state to UP, they will have to follow those protocols,” said additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi.Uttar Pradesh, where assembly polls are scheduled early next year, had asked Uttarakhand to allow the yatra but the request was turned down.A senior government official said the yatra was likely to be limited within the state. “Traditionally, UP devotees also do yatra within the state. They go to places like Varanasi, Barabanki, Ghazipur, Unnao, Ayodhya, Bijnor etc,” said the official on condition of anonymity. Uttarakhand is also likely to allow tankers from UP to carry back water from the Ganga.“The state is also going to introduce Covid-19 RT-PCR negative test report mandatory for the pilgrims,” added the official quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-govt-insists-kanwar-yatra-will-go-on-101626208794541.html
14-07-2021||India||Siddaramaiah attacks BSY, PM over banking exam row||Siddaramaiah, the Congress’ leader of the opposition in Karnataka, on Tuesday, lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister BS Yediyurappa over The Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS) exams.“@BSYBJP’s followers call him Huli (Tiger) but in reality, he is ili (Mouse). He hides in burrows when he has to stand up in front of @narendramodi . Let him resign if he cannot ensure justice to Kannadigas,” Siddaramaiah on Tuesday said in a post on Twitter.He put in a hashtag #IBPSMosa (IBPS cheat) in his post.The tirade by Siddaramaiah continued on an emotive issue in Karnataka where the language of the state, Kannada, has been sidelined in favour of Hindi, which has been resisted by groups and political parties.In a recent notification the IBPS had stated that except for the English language test, other papers will be available in only one other language: Hindi.“@narendramodi is betraying Kannadigas by not allowing candidates to take IBPS exams in Kannada. The latest notification by IBPS is an example of @BJP4India’s anti-Kannada stand.Central govt should immediately address this & ensure justice to Kannadigas,” Siddaramaiah said in his post. The former Karnataka chief minister also lashed out at union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, a member of the upper house of parliament nominated from Karnataka and other Lok Sabha members from the state for continuing to put up with the imposition of Hindi.“Being elected to Rajya Sabha from Karnataka, @nsitharaman has constantly betrayed Kannadigas and Kannada. She has continued the same with respect to IBPS exams. She is unfit to represent the people of Karnataka in Rajya Sabha. She should resign if she has any shame,” Siddaramaiah said.He even said that the MPs from Karnataka were “behaving like slaves” of the prime minister.In a statement on Tuesday, the Press Information Bureau said that reports indicated that only two languages (English and Hindi) would be used for IBPS exams “despite the fact that 22 languages were recognized by the Constitution of India”.“In the above context, it may be clarified that the Finance Minister’s statement referred to above was made in the context of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) only. With a view to providing a level playing field to the local youths for availing employment opportunities, the Government in 2019 decided that for recruitment of Office Assistant and Officer Scale I in RRBs, the examination will be held in 13 regional languages including Konakani and Kannada, besides Hindi and English. Since then, examination for these recruitments is being conducted in regional languages also,” according to the PIB statement.It added that a committee has been constituted to look into demands for other languages to be used in holding examinations for public sector banks.“The Committee will give its recommendations within 15 days. The ongoing process of holding the examination initiated by IBPS will be kept on hold until the recommendations of the Committee are made available,” the PIB said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-attacks-bsy-pm-over-banking-exam-row-101626203214772.html
14-07-2021||India||Behavioural intervention can influence households to save water: IIM-B study||Bengaluru : At a time when large urban centres like Bengaluru are facing acute water shortage issues due to growing population and rapid concretization, a new research by the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (IIMB) states that behavioural interventions alone can influence household water conservation that persists over the long term. In the research, the authors conducted a field experiment that implemented a habit change in an affluent community in Bengaluru.“Humans are creatures of habit. When people act in a particular way repeatedly, such as taking a shower every day, they do it in an automatic mode without much conscious thought. That is why attempts to persuade people to conserve water by appealing to their better senses have had limited success. People may get influenced by these messages temporarily, but the force of habit eventually takes over and behaviour change is short-lived,” said Kanchan Mukherjee, one of the authors of the research, on Tuesday. The research was conducted by Vivek, a recent PhD graduate, Deepak Malghan, Associate Professor of Public Policy, and Mukherjee, Professor of Organizational Behaviour, according to the statement. The multi-year study implemented a framework for habit change, where automatic, unconscious behaviour, like taking a shower or brushing one’s teeth while leaving the tap on, were first brought into one’s conscious awareness through appropriate messaging. “The intervention, which lasted for only five weeks, yielded 15-25% reduction in household water consumption. More importantly, the effect lasted for the entire observation period of two years after the intervention was stopped, establishing the potential of using behavioural methods to achieve significant long-term reduction in water consumption,” according to the statement. The authors said that the results can serve as a powerful tool to address growing freshwater scarcities in cities. “These findings also expand the scope of behavioural interventions to numerous other settings, such as in the larger environment and resource sectors, without the political and social difficulties associated with price-based policies,” said Malghan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behavioural-intervention-can-influence-households-to-save-water-iim-b-study-101626203154784.html
14-07-2021||India||Karnataka HC defers order in Twitter India case||Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court on Tuesday deferred the pronouncement of its judgment in the petition filed by Twitter India MD Manish Maheshwari against the notice issued to him by the Uttar Pradesh Police in relation to the Ghaziabad assault video. The judgement has now been posted for July 20. The UP Police had insisted that Maheshwari appear before them in person while he had offered to give a statement over video conferencing with regards to a video that alleged an elderly Muslim man in Ghaziabad was a victim of hate crime. Police said that their investigation later revealed that the incident was over a personal dispute and booked nine people, including Twitter India, for allegedly circulating false information to fan communal tension. Justice G Narendar said that the judgement will be pronounced after he has gone through the precedents cited in the case. He said the bench wanted to go through them again to ensure there are no errors in the verdict. “I want to take more time to go through the citations. Regarding the question of jurisdiction, I would like to go through the judgments in detail. I don’t want to make an error. I will dictate order next Tuesday,” the bench said. The UP government had contested the jurisdiction of the Karnataka high court in hearing the case and deciding on the matter. The alleged offence was committed in Uttar Pradesh, the prosecution pointed out, questioning the grounds under which the court is hearing out the case. Twitter last month was also issued a second notice by the Ghaziabad police to seek “account details” of the suspects accused by cops of posting and promoting the alleged Loni assault video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-hc-defers-order-in-twitter-india-case-101626203094791.html
14-07-2021||India||K’taka police to get special investigators to collect forensic evidence||Bengaluru: In a first in the country, Karnataka Police is set to have its own unit of specialised investigators trained in forensic sciences to collect evidence from and protect any crime scene. According to senior police officers familiar with the development, chief minister B S Yediyurappa has already given permission for the project and an official order to recruit 206 Scene of Crime Officers (SCOs) is likely to be issued anytime soon.“So far, the local police were doing this job. To make investigations more effective, there was a need for experts to gather evidence from crime scenes. The government has sanctioned 206 posts. Initially, the officers will be used only for cases of serious nature,” home minister Basavaraj Bommai said. Speaking on the new initiative, additional director-general of police (crime and technical services) R Hitendra said a similar system exists in police departments across the world but not in India. He added that police officers who have been trained in evidence collection and securing crime scenes are often engaged in other duties such as maintaining law and order.“The police constables or other officers have a duty of securing crimes scenes as it is not possible for forensic science labs (FSL) to come to the crime scene for all cases. So, we are creating a dedicated unit of people who are trained in forensic sciences,” he said. Sharing the police’s plans for the separate unit, Hitendra said it will comprise candidates who are trained in forensic sciences and will not be part of the police force. “Our current plans are to have one SCO for every police circle (a group of two to three police stations in rural areas). We are not planning a SCO for every police station since there are not enough major crimes taking place in the rural parts of the state. So, having one officer for each circle should take care of the requirement. Also, the government is also open to providing more officers, if need be,” he said. “Crime scene management is a crucial part of any investigation. How the evidence is searched, catalogued and transferred can have a big impact on the investigation. There is a big difference between a trained forensic officer searching for evidence and police constables doing the same. This project provides the police force with more trained forensic experts for investigations,” an FSL officer said, wishing not to be named. “At the same time, since experts in the firearms and physics section are available only at the FSL in Bengaluru, they have to travel to crime scenes across Karnataka, and many times, may not be able to visit the scene immediately. Having more people trained in the collection of ballistic evidence would help in quicker investigations,” the officer added. In 2015, the state police had tried to reorganise the FSL and create a crime scene management section. As part of this, 33 district scientific aid units (DSAUs) were to be set up and some selected police personnel were to be trained at evidence collection. The plan, however, never took off. “Poor handling of evidence by investigating officers has many a time resulted in destruction of crucial evidence before they are taken up for analysis. Crucial evidence may be missed or collected evidence may be degraded owing to improper handling and packing,” an internal document of Karnataka police on evidence collection read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-police-to-get-special-investigators-to-collect-forensic-evidence-101626203034788.html
14-07-2021||India||Shekhawat vows ‘justice’ to K’taka in Mekedatu project||Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the Union jalshakti minister on Tuesday said that justice will be done to the state of Karnataka in all irrigation projects, including the construction of the Mekedatu balancing reservoir and drinking water project.“We will look deep into the issues of the state of Karnataka, and we will organise a meeting in Delhi for that after having studied all these things, and I assure you that justice will be given to the state of Karnataka,” Shekhawat said.The Union minister was speaking to reporters in Bengaluru after a meeting with Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa and other senior members of his cabinet.Shekhawat said that all irrigation projects in the state were discussed in the meeting and that he had asked the state government to look into all the pending projects, including Mekedatu, Kalasa-Banduri and all other projects.The statement comes as a shot in the arm for the Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government which has been on a collision course with the newly elected Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin and his demands that the Mekedatu project not be approved.“We have discussed in detail almost all the irrigation projects, including Mekedatu. So, definitely in the coming days, we are going to complete all the things, and he is going help us from the Centre and (is) ready to help us in all respects,” Yediyurappa said.Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for generations have fought over the Cauvery river water, and have now locked horns over the project, which the upper riparian state is adamant to construct at the earliest as a way to satiate its drinking water needs, including that of its biggest city, Bengaluru.The Mekedatu issue has evoked emotions on both sides of the border as it is an extension of the century-old Cauvery river water dispute that has defined generations in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, two of India’s most industrious and progressive states.Karnataka has maintained that the Mekedatu balancing reservoir and drinking water project is to generate 400 MW of power and additionally utilise 4.75 tmcft of water for drinking and domestic needs in the state and particularly Bengaluru.Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s minister for home, law and parliamentary affairs added that the chief minister has appraised the Union minister of the Mekedatu issue and has urged for clearances, which are pending before the Centre.“DPR (detailed project report) has been submitted to CWC (central water commission) and details have been referred to (the) Cauvery monitoring board. So, honourable minister (Shekhawat) is aware of the whole issue, and he has promised to look into the whole issue and give justice to Karnataka,” he said.The contentious issue of constructing a Mekedatu project has even blurred the ongoing tussle between the ruling BJP and the opposition with the latter, assuring full support to take up the infrastructure project despite Tamil Nadu’s stand.DK Shivakumar, the president of the Congress party in Karnataka, on Tuesday, said that the Union minister should help the state like has done for others in the country.“On this auspicious occasion, we should fix a good time and do the Bhoomi Puja,” Shivakumar said on Tuesday.He added that all tenders can be called post that and get all necessary clearances.Though Shekhawat said that the party is different from the state, Shivakumar took a jibe at the BJP and its promise of speedy development due to the “double-engine” government (BJP at the Centre and the state).Shivakumar also added that the members of Parliament from Karnataka have a lock on their mouths as none of them has raised the issue with the Centre that benefits the state.Shekhawat also reviewed the project that proposes to provide tap water connections to all households in Karnataka. Under the Jal Jeevan mission, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union government has proposed to provide functional household tap water connections to 157 million rural households by 2024.“Government aims to provide 9.1 million rural households, 55 LPCD potable water through FHTC. Under this scheme, during 2021-22 it is intended to provide FHTCs to 2.5 million households and 2.7 million households in 2022-23 and to cover (the) remaining 1.72 million households by the end of December 2023,” according to a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO), attributing it to Yediyurappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shekhawat-vows-justice-to-k-taka-in-mekedatu-project-101626202974703.html

We have sought the intervention of the Governor in this regard...,” said Adhikari.Roy was made chairman of the PAC on July 9.Soon after the meeting, Dhankhar tweeted: “A Delegation of opposition MLAs led by the Leader of Opposition #WBLA Shri @SuvenduWB called on WB Governor Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar at Raj Bhawan Kolkata today at 4 PM. Leader of Opposition submitted a representation as regards irregularities relatable to PAC Chairman #WBLA.”Adhikari added that the copies of the memorandum would also be sent to the President of India and Lok Sabha Speaker.The TMC, however, hit back saying that appointment of PAC chairman is the domain of the Speaker. “Adhikari should know that appointing the PAC chairman is the speaker’s domain and prerogative.

After the meeting, Sudin told reporters that it was just a “courtesy” visit.“There is nothing about an alliance. We discussed the good work he has done and the good work I have done with regard to water supply in Goa,” Sudin said.“For a long time we had not met each other... He had even come to Goa once (recently) but we couldn’t meet. I was supposed to go to Delhi but I didn’t get the time,” he added.The MGP was part of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led ruling alliance in the state, but it broke the alliance after two of its MLAs “defected” to the BJP in a midnight move ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.During his visit, Kejriwal will review the AAP organisation in the coastal state and also meet several leaders of the party, a senior AAP functionary said.“There were a series of meetings lined up with the local leadership of the AAP including one-on-one meetings,” AAP state convener Rahul Mhambre told HT.Kejriwal is scheduled to address a press conference in Panaji on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-poll-push-kejriwal-meets-mgp-chief-in-goa-101626202314667.html
14-07-2021||India||Centre set to appoint National Maritime Security Coordinator||Two decades after the recommendation by the Kargil Group of Ministers (GoM), the Union government is set to appoint a National Maritime Security Coordinator (NMSC) to interface between the civilian and military maritime domains with the objective of enhancing India’s security architecture and energy security. The maritime security coordinator will work under the National Security Adviser (NSA), and be the principal advisor to the government on maritime security domain, people familiar with the matter said.According to officials in South Block who asked not to be named, the ministry of defence and military affairs has sought the Union Cabinet’s approval to create post of NMSC, and a serving or recently retired Vice Admiral of the Indian Navy is likely to be appointed to the role. NMSC has been a long-pending requirement since the Kargil GoM recommended it, and its need was most felt during the 2008 Mumbai attack, when maritime security agencies were unable to thwart the intrusion by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) gunmen from Pakistan.Also read| Covid-19: Modi flags crowding in hills as 3rd wave triggerThe appointment of NMSC will fill the need of the hour as the Navy, Coast Guard, and state maritime boards tend to work in silos with overlapping jurisdictions and are constantly at odds with each other, experts said.While India has suffered from sea blindness over the years with land-based security doctrines, historically and geostrategically, it has 7,000km of coastline and over 2 million km of exclusive economic zone. Over 70% of Indian trade, including vital crude oil, is transported through sea, and the protection of sea shipping lanes is vital to India’s security with the Narendra Modi government on June 16 clearing the Deep Ocean Mission for blue water economy.With China moving towards a sea-based security doctrine and penetrating into the Indian Ocean through Pakistan and Myanmar, the post of NMSC will be vital for maritime and energy security as Beijing plans to reach to eastern sea board of Africa through Indian maritime domain, security experts said.The creation of NMSC is part of PM Modi’s Act East Policy vision, that also includes SAGAR (Security and Growth of All in the Region), the Deep Ocean Mission, and the Sagarmala project to make India’s 12 major ports world class.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-set-to-appoint-national-maritime-security-coordinator-101626202194603.html

The state government order came even though Odisha reported 1930 cases in the last 24 hours with daily positivity rate slipping to 3.09 per cent. However, on Tuesday the state reported 68 Covid deaths, its highest single-day Covid death taking the total deaths to 4730.The state has banned all kinds of social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious functions and closed all religious places till July 16 and was apprehensive that congregation of Bol Bum devotees at Shiva temples across the state could lead to a possible rise in infection.“On further assessment of the situation and in the interest of the health of general public, the state government do hereby order that congregations by Bol Bom would remain prohibited and they are not allowed to carry water from religious places or any other sources and also not allowed to walk on public roads and pour water in temples during the Odia month of Shravan (July/August), 2021,” said the order by special relief commissioner Pradip Jena.PM Modi has convened a review meeting on July 16 of several states including Odisha, where the Covid situation in several coastal districts including Khordha, Cuttack and Puri remains a matter of concern.The total positivity rate hasn’t stablised yet in Bhubaneswar where it rises to 8% on some days, and slips below the 5% mark on others. Experts have attributed some of these differences of the positivity rate to inconsistent testing.“TPR is not coming down and deaths are going up. In Maharashtra and Kerala, a third wave has started without announcement and if the TPR remains like this in Odisha, there is every possibility of the Covid virus undergoing another mutation and triggering a third wave,” said noted microbiologist Dr TM Mohapatra. “The government should clarify the inconsistency in test figures, deaths and TPR.”Though the lockdown is currently operational in 10 districts till July 16, public health director Niranjan Mishra said any decision on further extension would be taken considering the case load and positivity rate. “People need to avoid gathering, especially indoor gatherings. If the guidelines are not followed, the possibilities of the third wave will increase,” he said.Meanwhile, director of Medical Education & Training Dr CBK Mohanty said the state government should impose stricter measures to monitor the flow of people through interstate mobility to keep the infection rate under control in Odisha. “There has been a dip in the infection rate in Odisha for the last few days. But we shouldn’t be complacent, rather keep track of the people entering the State from other Covid-affected states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-bol-bam-yatra-this-time-too-orders-odisha-government-amid-covid-concerns-101626202136015.html
14-07-2021||India||Population policy chorus grows in BJP-ruled states||Karnataka may emulate Uttar Pradesh and Assam, two other states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, by bringing in a population control law, and two BJP MPs Ravi Kishan and Rakesh Sinha are expected to move private member’s bills on the same subject in the coming session of Parliament as more states and lawmakers warm up to the concept of such a law.“It is high time Karnataka brings in a new population policy on the lines of Assam and Uttar Pradesh to control its growing population,” the BJP’s general secretary CT Ravi, who is also a lawmaker from Karnataka’s Chikkamagaluru, said in a tweet. “With the limited natural resources, it will be difficult to meet the needs of every citizen if there is a population explosion.”Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, has announced a draft population control bill built around incentivising those with up to two children (and penalising those with more) through preference in government jobs and extra benefits (such as ration from the public distribution system). Assam, too, is considering a two-child policy with similar incentives.Amid allegations that such laws target Muslims, both states have been at pains to clarify that the idea is not to target any community but to address a larger issue (population). Still, such a law has been a longstanding demand of the BJP’s ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and feeds off the perception that the Muslim population is increasing at a much faster rate than the Hindu population. While India’s population growth rate peaked a long time ago — it has been declining since the 1970s — it will take another four decades before the absolute population starts declining. There are differences in the fertility rate among Indian women. Poverty and poor educational status of women are the most important drivers of desiring or having more children. The preference for a son is another important reason why couples tend to have more children. While it is true that fertility rates among Muslim women are higher, Muslims account for only 13% of couples with more than two children India. Also, the total fertility rate has been falling for both Hindus and Muslims overtime.A bigger challenge, as far as India’s demographic burden (actually dividend) is considered, analysts say, is to provide gainful employment to half of population which is less than 30 years old.In Bihar, differences have appeared between the BJP and Janata Dal (United), partners in the National Democratic Alliance government in Bihar, on the issue.Chief minister Nitish Kumar told reporters on Sunday: “I clearly believe that it is not possible to ensure population control with a law” and it can happen only “when women are aware and educated”.However, the junior Union home minister, Nityanand Rai, who is from Bihar, said the state should consider the population control policy as benefits of welfare measures have not resulted in desired economic results due to the population explosion.The policies (and the proposed ones) have triggered outrage from sections of civil society and the opposition.Congress leader Salman Khurshid said: “Politicians should declare how many children they have. I will also declare how many I have and then it should be discussed.”Samajwadi Party MP Shaqfiqur Rahman Barq termed it “election propaganda” before next year’s assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh.In Karnataka, state law minister, Basavaraj Bommai said a decision will be taken after discussion and deliberation. “We would look at the UP policy,” he said.In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court in December 2020, the Centre said it was “unequivocally against coercion in family planning” and data showed that “couples, on average, do not want more than two children”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/population-policy-chorus-grows-in-bjp-ruled-states-101626202134642.html
14-07-2021||India||SC refuses to set aside bail given to 12 accused in gold smuggling case||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to set aside the bail granted to 12 accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case but agreed to examine whether smuggling of gold amounts to a terrorist act under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967.The Union of India represented through the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had challenged a February 18, 2021 order of the Kerala High Court which released the 12 accused on bail while holding that “gold smuggling with a mere illegal profit motive” could not fall within the definition of a terrorist act as defined under Section 15(1)(a)(iiia) of the UA(P) Act .The above section of the 1967 act defines smuggling of high-quality counterfeit Indian paper currency, coin or of any other material with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the economic security of the country as a “terrorist act”, which is not bailable.The Kerala high court held that the expression “any other material” will not include gold. At the same time, the high court allowed NIA to seek cancellation of bail if it succeeds in digging out material to show complicity of the accused in a terrorist act.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana issued notice on Centre’s appeal stating that the only question to be considered is the question of law arising out of the HC order. The bench was not inclined to interfere with the bail granted to the 12 accused.Additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj appearing for NIA submitted that the Kerala HC’s conclusion that smuggling of gold does not amount to terrorist act will seriously impact pending cases probed by NIA and other central agencies.He pointed out a judgment given on February 1 this year by the Rajasthan high court which upheld charges under UA(P) Act against a man caught for smuggling more than 18 kilograms of gold. This order was later challenged by the accused before the Supreme Court and is still pending consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-set-aside-bail-given-to-12-accused-in-gold-smuggling-case-101626202016399.html

Article 19 (2) allows reasonable restrictions to be imposed on all fundamental rights, including that of freedom to speech and expressionThe Centre has clarified that the changes proposed in the draft bill only empower the Centre to refer a film for re-examination to the CBFC chairman and not pass any order on its own.In 2000, the Supreme Court upheld a 1990 ruling of the Karnataka high court that struck down the Centre’s revisional powers over CBFC-approved films but gave the government the option to appeal to the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT). But FCAT was one of the eight tribunals scrapped in April under the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021.Prasanth Sugathan from the Software Freedom Law Centre, said: “The problem is that the government is planning to open a route wherein the certificate will be revoked if certain sections are unhappy with the film. What is the purpose of having an independent body...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/benegal-panel-on-cinematograph-act-proposed-mha-review-of-films-101626202014615.html
14-07-2021||India||Two more infected with zika in Kerala, tally climbs to 21||Thiruvananthapuram: Two more persons tested positive for vector-borne Zika virus on Tuesday in Kerala taking the total number of infected to 21, said the state health ministry. Both cases were reported from Thiruvananthapuram. State health minister Veena George has asked people to be vigilant and take part in the ongoing vector-control measures. The central team camping in the state also visited some of the affected areas. “We have already started a campaign to clean water-logging areas and all will have to chip in to contain it. We will do everything possible to check its spread,” the minister said, adding that samples are being tested at three medical college hospitals in the state. A special Zika ward has also been set up in Thiruvananthapuram medical college. Earlier, the state was sending samples to National Institute of Virology in Pune. The first case was reported from Parasala in Thiruvananthapuram district on July 7 wherein a 24-year-old pregnant woman tested positive. Later, she gave birth to a baby and both are stable now. In one week, cases went up to 21. Later, the Union health ministry had rushed a team of experts and they are right now camping in the state. Grappling with high caseload of Covid-19, the latest outbreak has got the health machinery concerned. But medical experts said unlike Covid-19, Zika is not a major threat and it can be controlled with effective vector control programmes. The virus is spread mostly through mosquitoes but it can also be transmitted through sex and fatality rate among patients is very low and only one in five develops symptoms, they said. e main symptoms of the disease, first identified in monkeys in Uganda in 1947 and among humans in Nigeria in 1954, include joint pain, fever and headache. In May 2015, it was reported in Brazil, where it spread rapidly. The virus can cause shrunken brain in children and a rare auto-immune disease called Guillain-Barre syndrome, experts said, adding it was first reported in the country in Gujarat in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-more-infected-with-zika-in-kerala-tally-climbs-to-21-101626201954656.html
14-07-2021||India||PM Modi pledged support for key projects: Vijayan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shown keen interest and pledged support to some of the key infrastructural projects of Kerala, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who descended on the national capital with a big wish list, his first trip after assuming power for the second time.Talking to newsmen in Delhi, the CM said the prime minister heard all issues sympathetically and the meeting was cordial and fruitful. He said he talked to the PM about the state’s ambitious high-speed rail project, connecting one end of the state to the other in four hours, proposed Sabarimala airport and rail projects and long-pending demand for a new centre of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the state. “The PM congratulated the state government for completing the GAIL pipeline which was hanging fire. He heard details of the proposed silver line high-speed rail project and promised all support. He also suggested the state to make use of the long coastline for travelling and freight movement,” he said, adding, he took up some of the pending projects like the petrochemical unit in Kochi and sought his help to complete it. “Our demand for the AIIMS is decades old. It is more justified now with growing incidences of viruses and other cases,” he said, adding, he apprised the PM about the Covid-19 situation and sought more vaccines to tide over the crisis. “Despite a high caseload, the situation is well under control. Our fatality rate is 0.47%, the lowest in the country. We need at least 2.5 million more vaccines to complete the second dose,” he said. The CM also PM Modi that the state’s zero wastage of vaccine will have to be factored in. The CM also met railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri and PM’s principal secretary S K Misra. He also sought permission to launch the second phase of Kochi Metro. Later, replying to a question, he said he was shocked over razing of a portion of the church in south Delhi. “Some of the members of the church met me and I shared their pain and grief. We have limitations in this, but I promised them all possible help,” he said. A major portion of the Syro-Malabar church in Chattarpur was demolished by civic authorities alleging encroachment and many believers protested it vehemently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-pledged-support-for-key-projectsvijayan-101626201894570.html
14-07-2021||India||Tokyo Olympics: Country will cheer for you, PM tells Indian contingent||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country’s athletes reflected the “New India” as he interacted with Tokyo Olympics-bound athletes for an hour on Tuesday, inquiring about their journeys and delivering a message of encouragement to the contingent, which will leave in batches for the Japan from July 17.India will have its biggest Olympics contingent ever in Tokyo with 126 participating athletes. “Don’t take the pressure of winning; just tell your heart and mind that you want to give your best. Play freely. The whole of India will cheer for you,” the PM said. He spoke to 15 athletes and their families during the televised virtual meeting.Among those present were Deepika Kumari, the current No 1 woman archer in the world, javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, tennis star Sania Mirza, reigning badminton world champion PV Sindhu, London Olympics bronze medallist MC Mary Kom, Vinesh Phogat, who is the No 1 ranked wrestler in her weight class in the world, shooters Saurabh Chaudhary and Elavenil Valarivan, sprinter Dutee Chand, swimmer Sajan Prakash, table tennis players Manika Batra and Sharath Kamal, and boxer Ashish Kumar.“You have come so far with your discipline, commitment and dedication. The commitment and competitiveness you have shown are the qualities of a new India and all of you are a reflection of a new India. Very soon, winning will become a habit,” said Modi.Beginning his conversation with Deepika, who recently became world No 1 after winning gold at the Archery World Cup stage 3 in Paris, the Modi asked about the journey of the Ranchi girl, who will be playing in her second Olympics. “I heard that you started archery by taking aim at mangoes,” Modi quipped.“After you won the gold medal in Paris, the whole nation is talking about you, you are now World no 1. Can you recall your journey?”Deepika responded: “I like mangoes, and that’s how it started.”“I started with a bamboo bow and then switched to a modern bow. The starting years were a struggle because there were no facilities, but then I got good training and good coaches,” said the 27-year-old.The Tokyo Olympics, in which on-site spectators will not be allowed owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, is scheduled to be held from July 23 to August 8.Modi then spoke to recurve archer Pravin Jadhav, who belongs to a family of daily wage labourers from Amravati, and called him an inspiration. Jadhav was part of the team that won the men’s recurve team silver at the world championships in 2019.To javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, Modi said: “I have been told that you got injured, but still you created a new record. You don’t need to get bogged down by expectations, don’t take the burden of expectations, just focus on your goal.”Replying to the PM, Neeraj said: “I am focusing on my game, anything I want, the government is helping me in that. We have a limited career, because of injury, I lost some time but I was fully focused on the Olympics.” The event was initially scheduled for 2020 but was pushed because of the raging Covid-19 pandemic.While speaking to boxer Ashish Kumar, who lost his father just days before the Olympic qualifiers in March 2020, Modi said it required great mental strength to overcome personal loss and represent the country and reminded him of Sachin Tendulkar. “I recall that Sachin Tendulkar’s father passed away when he was playing in an important tournament for India. He chose to play and through his game he paid tribute to his father. You have done the same thing. You are a winner,” he said.Dutee Chand shared her struggles in her professional and personal life. “I come from a weavers’ family. I have three sisters and one brother and people used to criticise my mother for giving birth to so many girls. We had little food to eat. I was thinking, if I play well I can get a good job in the government.”Modi called Mary Kom an inspiration for the entire contingent. To Sania Mirza, he said: “You are a champion and a fighter. I am sure you will play very well at the Olympics.”Sports minister Anurag Thakur, former sports minister Kiren Rijiju, and the president of the Indian Olympic Association, Narinder Batra, also attended the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/country-will-cheer-for-you-pm-tells-indian-contingent-101626201535189.html
14-07-2021||India||Experts caution as govt intervenes in food markets||The Union government has virtually rolled back its policy of not intervening in food markets except under “extraordinary circumstances” as it invoked the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) 1955 on July 2 to cool prices of lentils (pulses aka dals). This lays bare the challenges of keeping food prices low and farm incomes high in a country where much of the agricultural trade is opaque, experts say.The government, using a measure known as stock-holding limits, has set restrictions on the quantity of pulses, excluding moong (green gram) that sellers, including importers, wholesalers and retailers, can store. This goes against the provisions of one of the three farm laws passed by the government last year but put on hold on account of protests by farmers.The stock-holding limits mean that grocers can stock no more five tonnes of pulses, while wholesalers can at any point have only 200 tonnes in their warehouses. The government hopes to get traders to release more stocks in the market to soften prices.The government passed the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 to minimize regulatory interventions in trading of food items, such as pulses, potato, onion and edible oil.The Act is one of the three contentious agricultural laws that have been put on hold due to farmers’ protests. The amended ECA set fixed criteria on when to clamp stock limits. It states such measures are to be used “only under extraordinary circumstances”.The amended law also stipulates that stock limits can be imposed only if there is a 100% increase in retail prices of perishable food commodities compared to the average retail price in the last one year or last five years. For non-perishable items, stock limits can be imposed if inflation in a commodity is more than 50%.The recent rise in prices of pulses does not meet the criteria set out in the amended ECA. For instance, official data show that average chana or chickpea retail prices in June were ₹75 a kilo.The average retail price in the year-ago period was about ₹74 and the average five-year retail price was about ₹84.Thus, the increase in prices does not meet the more liberal criteria of a 50% inflation for imposing stock limits that the government wanted to pursue.The government, however, said its decision to invoke the ECA now was driven by larger goals. “We can’t wait for prices to rise. We have to anticipate the price trend and take proactive action to protect consumers, especially the poor. The policy takes into account the entire ecosystem and not just one dimension,” said Leena Nandan, secretary of consumer affairs.Some economists have argued that these measures imposed at the slightest uptick in prices ultimately hurt farm incomes.They argue that if sellers aren’t allowed to freely import or store sufficient quantities of a commodity, investments to create modern storage capacities don’t take place.Farmers are often forced to dump produce during gluts due to lack of storage facilities, stoking price spirals during lean seasons.A landmark 2018 study by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development and the Indian think-tank ICRIER, led by noted farm economist Ashok Gulati, blamed frequent government interventions as one of the reasons for poor farm incomes. Gulati cited a pro-consumer bias in India’s food policy. “Farmers in India are impacted by a combination of complex domestic market regulations and by import and export trade restrictions, which together often lead to producer prices that are below comparable international market levels,” the study said.The government’s Economic Survey 2019-20, which devoted a full chapter to the issue, said such measures distorts agricultural trade. The survey also provided evidence that stock limits were totally ineffective in curbing inflation.“I think the government had no choice or option because the amended EC Act now lies frozen. The government needs more accurate estimates of stocks to pursue these changes,” said economist PK Joshi, president of the Agricultural Economics Research Association, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-caution-as-govt-intervenes-in-food-markets-101626201355212.html
14-07-2021||India||Palaeolithic cave paintings found in corner of NCR could be among oldest||Archaeologists have discovered cave paintings in a rocky and forested corner of Haryana, not far from the national capital, that they believe belong to the Upper Palaeolithic age, which could potentially make them one of the oldest cave arts in the country.The caves are nestled amid a maze of quartzite rocks in the Aravalli mountain ranges, just outside the national capital, and a stone’s throw from the region’s only surviving patch of primary forest, a holy grove called Mangar Bani.While the residents of Manger village, and adjoining villages such as Selakhari, say generations have been aware of the paintings, it is only recently that the Haryana government’s museum and archaeology department took note of them. It sent a fact-finding team to the area in the last week of June.“So far, cave paintings in Delhi-NCR have only been found here. Most pre-historic sites have been traced in the Aravalli region. The paintings are yet to be dated but at least some of them belong to the Upper Palaeolithic period in all likelihood. We are viewing the paintings in continuation with the Soanian culture which has been found in Shivalik hills, Narmada and Aravallis,” said Banani Bhattacharyya, deputy director of the department of archaeology and museums.The team encountered cave paintings comprising images of human figurines, animals, foliage, and geometric, some that have paled over time, but others that are still very visible. It also encountered rock art and open-air ceremonial sites. While some could be spotted in the open air, a majority of them are on the ceilings of the rock shelters.The findings may well change the history of Haryana. The Upper Paleolithic Age began around 40,000 years ago and lasted till around 10,000 years ago.Bhattacharyya, who was part of the team, said the discovery is extremely significant. “Though tools from the Palaeolithic Age have been identified earlier in parts of the Aravallis, it is for the first time that cave paintings and rock art of a large magnitude have been found in Haryana.”To be sure, the findings have to be validated, dated, reviewed, and published.The department plans to undertake further explorations in the area.The caves and the paintings themselves are reminiscent of Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh, which is home to the oldest known cave art in India, dating back to the Mesolithic Age (around 10,000 years ago).The Mangar cave art is 20,000-40,000 years old, according to Bhattacharyya, but this is something that can be established through archaeological dating. Experts also use qualitative techniques, by comparing the cave art to other cave art, and that found in other excavations.While explorations and excavations in the Aravallis have been undertaken in the past, it is for the first time that cave paintings at the current site have caught the attention of researchers. Bhattacharyya believes the site may have possibly remained relatively undiscovered over the years due to thick vegetation.“Stone age tools and technology dates to a particular time period. We explore what tool belongs to which time period. In sites such as these, we can conduct dating by studying the pigment. The pigment contains proteins (mainly organic material) which can be dated. At present, we are dependent on typo-technological dating. Tools such as hand cleaver, blade, evolve with types. Starting from the Lower Palaeolithic to Middle Palaeolithic then Upper Palaeolithic, we see the evolution here. We have found significant remains from Lower Palaeolithic till Middle and Upper Palaeolithic period too,” she explained.Most of the paintings are ochre, but some are white. Experts say cave paintings in white are usually from a later stage (early contemporary era), while Stone Age paintings are more often than not, ochre. “Stone age paintings generally use red and ochre colours. Stones of these colour used to be available locally and inhabitants crushed the stones for preparing the colour for paintings,” said Bhattacharyya.Palaeolithic artefacts have been reported earlier from various parts of Delhi and Haryana. In 1985-86, Dilip Kumar Chakrabarty and Nayanjot Lahiri surveyed and mapped prehistoric sites in Delhi and Haryana. They traced 43 sites. In 1986, AK Sharma discovered the Palaeolithic site of Anangpur in Faridabad. ASI later undertook excavation at the site. Sharma was accompanied by former joint director general of ASI SB Ota and other experts from ASI’s prehistoric branch.Ota said that while the Aravallis are known for prehistoric remains starting from the Lower Palaeolithic period, unlike Central India and other places that are rich in rock paintings, no rock paintings have been found in Aravallis until now.“That engravings formed part of Aravallis was known through earlier publications but what was not known so far was the presence of paintings in rock shelters. The paintings never got washed away due to these rock shelters. We do not know the date at the moment but this is a clear indication that there must have been many more paintings which might have been destroyed over time,” he said.Ota emphasized the need for conservation after investigations and assessment of the importance of the paintings. “The Aravallis demonstrate the earliest evidence of the stone age which we call the Lower Palaeolithic Acheulean culture. The area can be easily protected since the Aravalli hills also derive protection from various Supreme Court orders. This can be done after experts assess the cultural and archaeological value of the site.”The Aravalli’s are India’s and the world’s oldest mountain range, and have been ravaged by time, the elements, and increasingly over the past few decades, man.Ashok Khemka, principal secretary to government, archaeology and museums department, Haryana, said that while a team from the department has conducted a preliminary study, further investigations will be undertaken since the site requires extensive documentation. He said the department will grant protection status to Mangar forest. “We will definitely be giving the Mangar Bani forest state protection under the archaeological act because of the presence of a large number of stone age cave paintings that have been found there. The paintings date back roughly 20-30,000 years. We will be issuing orders for protecting the entire Mangar Bani forest under section 4 of Punjab Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1964.”Khemka said his department plans to hire scholars from the region for an extensive survey. “We will be hiring a team of research scholars who are experts in prehistoric cave paintings. Locals and a few research scholars from the nearby universities will also be involved in the extensive survey.”Shalaish Baisla, an archaeology student and independent researcher, said he had spotted tools and cave paintings from the prehistoric age in Mangar. He added that the area needed immediate protection. “There are individuals who have commercial interests in the area. It is crucial that the site is granted protection, even before any research is undertaken.”Residents of Mangar and other villages in the area say they know of the paintings, but that their historical importance eluded them. Hamid, a resident of Selakheri, said: “We know that these paintings must be quite old. It’s evident if you look at them. However, one can’t understand or make sense of symbols or the writing. They have gathered dust over the years.” He uses only one name.Shaukat Ali, a septuagenarian, said that he has seen the paintings over years. “People go there regularly, particularly women -- for grazing goats or routine walks. The caves are a part of our lives...”Sunil Harsana, an activist from Mangar village, said that while the forest needed protection, it was crucial to ensure that protection did not remain on paper alone. “A heritage site has been found here. It is crucial that experts conduct the necessary investigations and ensure that people are made aware of the significance of the site. These sites need to be protected so that future generations are able to understand the history of the region,” said Harsana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/palaeolithic-cave-paintings-found-in-corner-of-ncr-could-be-among-oldest-in-the-country-101626201354624.html

The state government challenged the order before the apex court.“I am submitting on behalf of the state that no coercive action will be taken. We are also willing to have the investigation supervised by a retired judge,” senior counsel Rajeev Dhavan, representing the YS Jaganmohan Reddy government, told the bench of justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari.Dhavan urged the bench to release the matter and send it back to the high court where it could be heard fully. “Let the case go back to the high court and let the investigations continue...,” said Dhavan.The senior lawyer called the petition by former advocate general Dammalapati Srinivas before the Andhra Pradesh high court “a vengeance petition for a lost election” by a political party (Telugu Desam Party).Asked to respond, senior advocate Harish Salve, who was appearing for Srinivas, opposed the proposal by the state government, saying the Supreme Court should rather go into all the issues and decide finally. “My client has been a former advocate general of the state. There is a phrase called ‘regime revenge’. It is just that. Besides, the case has been pending before this court for almost a year. It can go up and down but I would prefer a decision on all issues by this court,” he said.The bench fixed the matter on July 22 to decide if the state government’s prayer for revival of the investigation subject to certain conditions can be entertained. The FIR registered by state’s Anti-Corruption Bureau named 13 persons, including two daughters of a SC judge and Srinivas, on the ground that they purchased land in Amaravati area. In October 2020, Jagan had written to then CJI SA Bobde, complaining that justice NV Ramana (present CJI) was trying to influence cases in the high court to destabilise his government and stall investigations. In March this year, the inquiry exonerated justice Ramana and dismissed Jagan’s complaint, clearing the decks for his appointment as the CJI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-wants-probe-to-resume-says-won-t-take-coercive-action-101626201236000.html
14-07-2021||India||3rd wave will be inevitable if people continue to flout norms, warns Centre||People are treating the Covid-19 outbreak as if it is a natural weather phenomenon and a third wave will be inevitable, but they fail to realise that future resurgence of the virus will purely depend on their behaviour, a top government official warned on Tuesday.Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Aggarwal made the remark during the routine briefing on Covid-19, and cited similar observations made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who earlier in the day described recent reports of crowding at hill stations and markets as worrying.“As restrictions are being relaxed, reports of gross violations in terms of Covid safe behavior such as use of mask or observing physical distancing are also being noted; be it from Chennai, Delhi, Chandigarh, or the state of Maharashtra, there is a section of people that does not observe Covid safe behaviour. The third wave may be caused because of this behaviour,” said Aggarwal.He likened the conversation around a third wave of infections – India has had two waves with the latest in April-May being particularly devastating – as conversations about the weather. “We talk about the third wave as a weather update. What we fail to understand is that adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour or lack of it is what will prevent or cause any future waves,” he added.Aggarwal cited some survey results where people provided weak excuses for not following Covid appropriate behaviour, especially using masks. Some said it was making it difficult for them to breathe; some said masks were uncomfortable when they were anyway maintaining distancing, and some others still claimed that masks provided no benefit at all.“We have been seeing this kind of misconception even after one and a half years of fighting the pandemic. We need to work on the preventive aspects by use of simple tools such as masks, physical distancing, and hand hygiene to ensure the spread of infection is curbed, strain on the health care infrastructure is reduced and overall quality of care is improved,” said Aggarwal.VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, who was also present at the press briefing, also said that globally, a third wave of Covid-19 was being seen and urged people to make efforts to ensure that it did not happen in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3rd-wave-will-be-inevitable-if-people-continue-to-flout-norms-warns-centre-101626201234619.html
14-07-2021||India||Monsoon is here, at last||The southwest monsoon finally arrived in Delhi on Tuesday, 16 days behind schedule, as it also covered the rest of the country, five days later than usual, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Beginning with a short spell in the morning, the showers brought not just respite from muggy heat, but also an end to a cycle of incorrect predictions for IMD. The weather office was on what seemed to be an unending streak of getting the arrival date wrong: after early estimates proved off the mark all through June, it forecast the arrival of the rains “in the next 24 hours” on July 9, and then made the same prediction every day after that.On July 13, the ordeal was over.Tuesday’s onset over Delhi is the most delayed arrival of monsoon in the Capital since 2002 -- that year, the first of the showers was on July 19. The usual date, IMD says, for monsoon onset in Delhi is June 27. The rains,which sweep in from India’s south-west, beginning from Kerala, typically cover the country by July 8.The onset over Delhi this year has been fraught with delays.An initial rapid advance raised hopes that monsoon will hit the Capital by June 15, which would have been one of the earliest arrivals. Instead, unfavourable weather conditions and an unusual “break” spell slowed the progression, prompting the Met department to shift the forecast to a June 29 arrival, which again was missed, and then July started on a dry note that extended till almost half the month.The delays have meant a long period of hot and humid weather, which experts say can feel as bad, if not worse, than high degrees of dry heat. High humidity impairs the body’s ability to cool itself by sweating.The delayed monsoon also meant that farmers in much of northwest India had to halt sowing their summer crops, raising the possibility of some impact on yields in a year when the economy has, for the second time, suffered due to the pandemic.In the initial weeks, as the monsoon rains touched down on the Indian coast on June 3 (three days later than usual), it gathered pace and stayed ahead of schedule (by June 18, monsoon had covered all of Maharashtra, central India, east India and even parts of UP, a week ahead of its usual pace). It appeared set to break several previous coverage records, particularly at the pace it was barrelling towards Delhi.However, just before it was to cover Delhi (along with Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Punjab), it entered what IMD described as a “break spell” from June 29 to July 8. This “break spell”, which is not unusual for monsoon weather systems, ended up eventually causing it to drop behind schedule.DS Pai, who heads IMD’s climate research and services, said that monsoon has now “completely revived”, and that their models are showing normal to above normal monsoon conditions till the end of July. “As we forecasted earlier, the monsoon started reviving from July 8, and many parts of north and north-west India started getting good rains, including Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. A small area however did not get rain. Today, even that area is covered,” he said.IMD recordings show that the rain in Delhi occurred intermittently through the day with some regions even receiving three spells of showers on Tuesday. Safadarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker of the city, received 52.9mm of rains through the day, while Palam received 32.6mm and Lodi Road received 57.2mm rainfall.The rains also paved way for lower temperatures on Tuesday. At Safdarjung, the maximum temperature on Tuesday was 30.9 degrees Celsius, five degrees below the season’s normal. The minimum temperature was 23.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees below what is considered normal for this time of the year. This was the lowest daytime temperature since May 21 this year.Kuldeep Srivastava, head, IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said Delhi is likely to get “light to moderate” rain on Wednesday as well. “After July 14, the rain activity may slow down. It is expected to intensify again from July 17-19,” he said.Forecasters said that Delhi is expected to receive patchy and intermittent showers till July 16, after which the intensity of rains will increase. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather, a private weather forecaster said, “We will see patchy rains, on and off for the next three days, after which the intensity will increase.”(With inputs from Jayashree Nandi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-is-here-at-last-101626201235265.html
14-07-2021||India||Ahead of SCO meeting, Jaishankar meets Afghan counterpart||: External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Afghan counterpart Haneef Atmar on Tuesday discussed the latest developments in Afghanistan against the backdrop of a violent campaign by the Taliban to take control of territory. Jaishankar and Atmar met in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on the margins of a meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). The two ministers will also participate in a meeting of the SCO Contract Group on Afghanistan on Wednesday. The meeting provided an opportunity for the two sides to compare notes on developments in Afghanistan, especially the security situation, amid the rapid drawdown of US and foreign forces, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The Taliban have stepped up attacks on rural areas of numerous provinces, especially in northern Afghanistan, and taken control of key border crossings and regions bordering Iran, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. The violence has coincided with the US saying it has completed 90% of the withdrawal of its troops and that the process will be completed by August 31. After his meeting with Atmar, Jaishankar tweeted: “Began my Dushanbe visit by meeting with Afghan FM @MHaneefAtmar. Appreciate his update on recent developments. Looking forward to the meeting of the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan tomorrow.” There were no other details on the meeting from the Indian side. While India is a member of the SCO, Afghanistan has observer status with the grouping. Atmar said in a tweet that he would address the meeting of the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan. “Also look forward to bilateral engagements with FMs of #SCO countries to discuss our cooperation on peace, security & economic development,” he added. The Afghan foreign minister also held a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who tweeted: “Pakistan and Afghanistan’s destinies are intertwined. We believe working together will help us realise stronger regional connectivity and greater people-centric linkages. I look forward to receiving @MHaneefAtmar in Islamabad to continue our collective efforts.” Jaishankar is expected to hold more meetings with counterparts from SCO member states, including Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. This will be the first in-person meeting between the two ministers since they held talks on the margins of another SCO meeting in Moscow in September last year. India has repeatedly expressed concern at the spike in violence across Afghanistan and called for a comprehensive ceasefire while efforts continue to find a political settlement. Jaishankar has also asserted the need for having a legitimate government in Kabul amid fears that the Taliban will try to capture power by force. New Delhi pulled out all its diplomats, staffers and security personnel from its consulate in Kandahar over the weekend after fierce clashes erupted between the Taliban and security forces in and around the southern Afghan city. In a separate development, an 11-member team of Afghan politicians is expected to travel to Qatar by the end of this week for talks with the Taliban, Tolo News channel reported. Abdullah Abdullah, the chief Afghan peace negotiator, former president Hamid Karzai, former vice president Yunus Qanooni, Mohammad Mohaqiq, Abdul Rashid Dostum, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and Fatima Gailani will be part of the team. It is not clear who would represent the Taliban in the talks in Doha. Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, and Karzai said on Tuesday they expected important steps in the peace process within the next few days. The US special envoy for reconciliation in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, is also visiting the region and has met negotiators in Doha this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-sco-meeting-jaishankar-meets-afghan-counterpart-101626201174572.html
14-07-2021||India||Covid-19: States say jab crunch hitting vaccine drive||At least three states reported shortages of vaccines on Tuesday, with some saying they had to shut down vaccination centres, even as the Union government denied there were constraints in supplies.The reports come at a time when the country’s coronavirus vaccination drive has slowed down –— in the seven days till Tuesday, there were an average 3.4 million doses administered to people every day. Less than a month ago, in the seven days after June 21, this number was at 5.8 million.“We have the capability to administer 3 to 4 lakh doses a day... We have received a small stock of 1.5 lakh Covishield doses on Monday night; we have at max around 1.68 lakh doses which will not last beyond Tuesday or one half of Wednesday...,” Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday.In Tamil Nadu, chief minister MK Stalin wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a reallocation of vaccines since, he said, the state was not getting supplies proportionate to its population.“As the allocation of vaccines is very inadequate, we are finding it extremely difficult to meet the huge demand for vaccination throughout the State,” he said.Similar shortages appeared to beset the drive in Maharashtra, where many centres were close this week due lack of doses. The state received 700,000 doses four days back, most of which were used up on Monday. The state has asked the central government for 30 million doses per month.The Union health ministry said it was making strong efforts. “We are running a marathon not a sprint race; and need to understand its challenges. We are doing regular hand holding of states and vaccine manufacturers in production of vaccines that is being augmented gradually. In some time there will be more doses available,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, while replying during a press briefing on states facing vaccine shortage.Congress leader P Chidambaram, too, hit out at the government for the vaccination programme, citing shortages reported by Delhi and Odisha.“Vaccine shortage is a fact. Vaccine production is exaggerated. Vaccine import is a mystery. Vaccinating the entire adult population by December 2021 is an empty boast,” the former Union minister said.“Will the new health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tell the nation the truth about the vaccination programme,” Chidambaram asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-say-vaccine-crunch-hitting-vaccine-drive-centre-denies-charges-101626201115245.html
14-07-2021||India||Remove tweets on Lakshmi Puri, HC tells Gokhale||The Delhi high court on Tuesday directed activist Saket Gokhale to immediately remove all “scandalous” tweets against Lakshmi Puri, saying that one thoughtless barb is sufficient to crumble the reputations — nourished and nurtured over years of selfless service and toil.In an interim order, justice C Hari Shankar restrained Gokhale from posting any tweets in the future against Lakshmi Puri and her husband Union minister Hardeep Puri and said that the “desecration of the reputation of a public figure has become child’s play in the age of social media”.The court also directed Twitter to remove the tweets if Gokhale does not delete them in 24 hours.The court said that before posting the tweets, he should have carried out “due diligence” by seeking clarifications from Puri or from some official sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remove-tweets-on-lakshmi-puri-hc-tells-gokhale-101626200995230.html
14-07-2021||India||Anti-terror law not to be used to quell dissent: Justice Chandrachud||Supreme Court judge Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud has emphasised that criminal laws, including anti-terror legislation, should not be used for muzzling dissent and that courts must act as the “first line of defence” against deprivation of liberty.Justice Chandrachud was speaking at the Indo-US Joint Summer Conference on Indo-US legal ties on Monday evening when he underscored that no law can be employed to harass citizens and take away their freedom. “Criminal law, including anti-terror legislation, should not be misused for quelling dissent or harassment to citizens. As I noted in my judgement in Arnab Goswami Vs the State, our courts must ensure that they continue to remain the first line of defence against the deprivation of liberty of citizens,” said the judge.Justice Chandrachud added that deprivation of liberty for even a single day is “one too many” and that judges must always be mindful of the deeper systemic issues of their decisions. “Today, the world’s oldest and largest democracy represents these ideals of a multicultural, pluralist society where their constitutions are focused on a deep commitment and respect for human rights,” said the judge.Justice Chandrachud’s remarks have come amid outrage over the death of 84-year-old activist Stan Swamy, who was arrested under the anti-terror law in the Elgar Parishad case last year. Swamy died last week in Mumbai while his bail plea on health grounds remained pending before the high court there. Several other cases where the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act has been invoked have also courted controversies recently. Only a few days ago, Assam leader Akhil Gogoi walked out of jail after spending 18 months behind bars in connection with a case under UAPA over violent protests against the contentious amendment to the citizenship law.Last month, while granting bail to student activists Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha, the Delhi high court made some sharp observations on indiscriminate use of UAPA. It said that foisting extremely grave and serious penal provisions engrafted in UAPA frivolously upon people will undermine the intent and purpose of the Parliament in enacting a law that is meant to address threats to the very existence of our nation.Sharing his views at the online conference hosted by the American Bar Association and Society of Indian Law Firms, justice Chandrachud also highlighted that the Supreme Court of India, the last court of appeal, has a wide reach over its population, executive and lower courts.The Supreme Court, he said, provides greater access to individuals by exercising not just its appellate jurisdiction but also its rich jurisdiction to protect the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.About the role of the Supreme Court in ensuring jails are decongested, justice Chandrachud pointed out that during the first wave of the pandemic in March 2020, the top court ordered all states to set up high-level committees to consider releasing on bail or parole those who had been jailed for up to seven years. “... In view of the second wave in May 2021, the Supreme Court on May 7, ordered that those who were released in the first wave of the pandemic were eligible for immediate release...,” said the judge.Justice Chandrachud further said that the Supreme Court has often relied on comparative jurisprudence emanating from the US, indulging often in a transnational judicial dialogue.“For instance in my judgement in Navtej Johar Vs Union of India, where the Indian Supreme Court decriminalized same-sex relations between adults, I relied on comparative law developments from the United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights and the celebrated decision in Lawrence Vs Texas of the US Supreme Court to hold that there was the growing liberal consensus towards the equal treatment of LGBTQ rights and that India could not be left behind in this transformational revision,” noted the judge in his address.Dr Lalit Bhasin, President, SILF and Joseph L Raia, Chair ABA International thanked justice Chandrachud for addressing the conference as its chief guest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antiterror-law-not-to-be-used-to-quell-dissent-justice-chandrachud-101626200934586.html
14-07-2021||India||Minority schemes do not defy Hindus’ rights, Centre tells SC||The Union government on Tuesday defended in the Supreme Court welfare schemes meant exclusively for religious minorities, stating that these schemes do not violate rights of the Hindus and are not against the principle of equality.Submitting its affidavit in response to a petition filed jointly by six members of the Hindu community, the Centre maintained that the schemes framed by it are “legally valid” and aim at “inclusive growth” for the minority communities at various levels.“The schemes being implemented by the ministry are to reduce the inequalities among the minority communities and to improve the level of education, participation in employment, skill and entrepreneurship development, reducing deficiencies in civic amenities or infrastructure,” said the affidavit filed by the Union ministry of minority affairs.“The schemes are not in contradiction to the principles of equality as enshrined in the Constitution, and do not violate the rights of members of other communities. These schemes are legally valid as they are only enabling provisions so as to achieve inclusiveness and do not suffer from any infirmity,” said the affidavit, supporting 13 welfare schemes for the minorities that the Centre pays for.According to the Centre, the support given to the disadvantaged candidates of minority communities cannot be faulted also because the schemes are meant for the underprivileged sections and women in the minority groups and not for everyone. “In addition, the scholarship scheme, coaching schemes, etc. have academic merit, as well as earmarking for girl students,” it submitted in court.The petition, filed through advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, contended that the petitioners are being unconstitutionally deprived of benefits available to similarly situated members of religious minorities in violation of their fundamental right to equality (Article 14), right against discrimination on grounds of religion (Article 15) and the right against paying taxes for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination (Article 27). “The petitioners and other members of [the] Hindu community are suffering because they have been born in [the] majority community... The State cannot promote or give any benefit to any religious community whether minority or majority keeping in view the secular ethos embedded in the Constitution of India,” stated the petition.The petition, filed by Neeraj Shankar Saxena and five others, has also made specific submissions against the welfare schemes for Waqf properties, contending that by giving such “undue advantage”, the Centre is treating the Muslim community above law and the Constitution since no such benefits are given to the institutions of Hindu community such as trusts, mutts and akhadas.It has also sought the scrapping of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, as there is already a Backward Classes Commission to find out the conditions of the backward classes that need aid. The petition has objected to the allocation of ₹4,800 crore in the Centre’s 2019-2020 budget for the implementation of such schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minority-schemes-do-not-defy-hindus-rights-centre-tells-sc-101626200514662.html
14-07-2021||India||Uttarakhand scraps Kanwar yatra amid warnings over 3rd Covid wave||Uttarakhand scrapped the kanwar yatra on Tuesday, heeding warnings from health experts who cautioned that millions of devotees thronging the banks of the Ganga in Haridwar could spark a devastating third wave of Covid-19 infections and seed clusters of cases across north India.The hill state also turned down a request from Uttar Pradesh, which allowed the pilgrimage — where Shiva devotees travel on foot or cycle to fetch water from the Ganga to their village shrines — to begin from July 25.“We don’t want to make Haridwar the centre of Covid. People’s lives are our first priority,” said chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. The crucial move, which was welcomed by experts, came at a meeting chaired by Dhami on Tuesday evening.On July 6, the hill state had decided to stop all kanwar devotees from entering the state, but decided to review its decision two days later after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath called Dhami. Both the states go to the polls in early 2022.“We held meetings with officials of the neighbouring states. And it was concluded that at a time when we are battling the Covid epidemic and delta plus variant has been reported in the state, we don’t want the yatra held. We can’t play with the lives of people…even God won’t feel good if someone loses a life,” said Dhami.Despite the cancellation, however, Uttar Pradesh said it will go ahead with the mega religious pilgrimage. “It’s status quo in UP. We are talking to Kanwar sanghs and everything will be done within Covid protocol,” said additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi.The decision came after sharp opposition by doctors who warned that the impact of the kanwar yatra – which attracted 36 million pilgrims in 2019, the last year it was held – could be worse than the Mahakumbh, which was also held in Haridwar this year and sparked infections in many parts of northern India.They said that implementing testing and masking protocol will be challenging at the kanwar yatra where pilgrims walk or cycle hundreds of kilometers through several states and hail from 10 separate states. They also held up the example of the Mahakumbh, which was visited by 9.1 million devotees and saw widespread violation of Covid norms and a failure of health infrastructure, leading to 100,000 fake rapid antigen tests conducted during the event.“It could have been very dangerous if the pilgrimage of this magnitude had been allowed at this crucial juncture between slowing down of the second wave and the country being on the brink of the third wave,” said Dr Sanjay Shah, vice-president of the Association of Physicians of India, Uttarakhand chapter.Ashok Kumar, Uttarakhand’s director general of police, who was present in Dhami’s meeting, said the police will now secure Haridwar from Wednesday to stop any devotee from entering the district. “However, as it was decided earlier in a meeting with the officers of police departments of neighbouring states, water tankers would be allowed to come to Haridwar to fetch the holy water at police station level to take it back for the devotees in villages in neighbouring states,” he said. These tankers are likely to be used in UP and other states to complete the yatra.Experts said Uttarakhand’s decision was partly due to the sharp criticism from the Uttarakhand high court on the move to allow the Mahakumbh and Char Dham Yatra. On June 23, the high court called holding the kumbh a mistake, and on June 28, cancelled the Char Dham yatra, a pilgrimage of the holy sites of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath that attracted 3.2 million devotees in 2019.Dushyant Mainali, one of the lawyers who raised Covid violations in the high court, said the judges on June 23 made their opposition to mega events clear when they said “large gathering invariably leads to a spike in the Covid-19 pandemic”. “This Court is of the firm opinion that a catastrophe like Covid-19 pandemic should not be re-invited by holding and permitting large gathering at religious shrines,” the court held, indicating that it would come down heavily on future religious events as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cancels-kanwar-yatra-amid-fears-of-3rd-wave-delta-plus-variant-101626193554733.html
14-07-2021||India||Chorus grows on population control policy among BJP-ruled states||Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader CT Ravi on Tuesday called for a population control policy in Karnataka on the lines of two other states ruled by his party--Assam and Uttar Pradesh--even as differences on the issue surfaced between ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners in Bihar.“It is high time Karnataka brings in a new population policy on the lines of Assam and Uttar Pradesh to control its growing population,” tweeted Ravi, a BJP national general Secretary and Karnataka assembly member. “With the limited natural resources available, it will be difficult to meet the needs of every citizen if there is a population explosion.”State law minister Basavaraj Bommai said a decision will be taken after discussion and deliberation. “We would look into the (population control) bill proposed by Uttar Pradesh,” he said.Also Read | Two-child policy: Experiments, legal jurisprudence on population check in IndiaYogi Adityanath, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, on Sunday introduced a policy to stabilise the state’s population. This came days after the draft of the Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill was put up on the website of the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission inviting suggestions from the public by July 19.The bill proposes to bar people with more than two children from contesting local polls, applying for government jobs or receiving any subsidy. It also seeks to bar government employees having more than two children from promotions. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma earlier said large families were likely to lose certain state benefits.Congress leader Salman Khurshid said politicians should declare how many children they have. “I will also declare how many I have and then it should be discussed.”Samajwadi Party (SP) Member of Parliament Shaqfiqur Rahman Barq called the proposed legislation in Uttar Pradesh “election propaganda” before next year’s assembly polls in the state. SP lawmaker Iqbal Mehmood described it as a “conspiracy” against Muslims.Janata Dal (United), an ally of the BJP in Bihar, has expressed reservations over the proposed legislation. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said he believes it is not possible to ensure population control with a law. He insisted population control can happen only “when women are aware and educated.”Union minister Nityanand Rai, who is from Bihar, said the state government should consider a population control policy as benefits of welfare measures have not resulted in desired economic results due to “population explosion”.Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress supported Kumar on the issue saying the BJP wants to target minority communities through such a policy.The Centre told the Supreme Court in December 2020 that it was “unequivocally against coercion in family planning” and data showed that “couples, on average, do not want more than two children”.“Family Welfare Programme in India is voluntary in nature, which enables couples to decide the size of their family and adopt family planning methods... without any compulsion,” it said in an affidavit in response to a Public Interest Litigation filed by BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyaya seeking introduction of a two-child norm or framing a new law to control births.As per National Family Health Survey, the total fertility rate (TFR) is higher among the poor and that it decreases as incomes increase. TFR is the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime.The Centre’s affidavit also said TFR was on the decline. It added 25 of 36 states and Union Territories have achieved the target TFR of 2.1.According to the UN projections, India’s population will increase by a multiple of 1.09 between 2021 and 2031. This number was 1.25 between 1981 and 1991. From 2060 onwards, India’s population will start falling, which happens when the fertility rate falls below replacement levels. By 2100, which is as far as UN population projections go, India’s population will be 1.45 billion after having peaked at 1.65 billion in 2059.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-seeks-population-control-policy-for-karnataka-101626179273816.html
14-07-2021||India||India’s 1st Covid patient tests positive again||A woman from Kerala who was studying in Wuhan and was infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus in the early days of the pandemic in 2020 has tested positive for Covid-19 again, a health official said on Tuesday, but with no symptoms.The woman, officially recognised as India’s first Covid-19 infected person, took an RT-PCR test in order to travel to Delhi. She tested negative on a rapid antigen test, widely regarded as reflective of contagiousness, and none of her family members appear to have been infected.“She has tested positive and is under quarantine at her home. None of the family members has tested positive so far,” said Thrissur district medical officer KJ Reena. She said re-infection is nothing new, and some of the health workers have been infected twice.The Thrissur woman is 22 years old and is waiting to resume her studies at a medical college in Wuhan. She has taken one shot of a vaccine.The woman has been unable to return to China as Beijing is yet to allow Indian students back into the country because of the pandemic.In 2020, she spent almost a month in hospital while undergoing treatment for Covid-19.Two of her friends, who travelled with her from Wuhan, the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic in China, also tested positive later.Recent assessments of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, now believed to be dominant in India, have shown that it can lead to more repeat infections than its predecessors. Clinicians and experts largely believe that re-infections are not a cause for concern if a person has no symptoms, especially since RT-PCR tests can also throw up a positive test due to viral remnants.“There are several factors at play here. If the person had a mild infection, the antibody titres are usually low and they do not last very long. Plus, if they had an infection 18 months ago, it is likely they have lost the protection by now. Also, the variant is likely to be different. A person getting a second infection is not unheard of,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious diseases department at ICMR.An Indian Council of Medical Research study from January to October last year estimated 4.5% reinfection cases among symptomatic people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-first-covid-patient-tests-positive-again-for-coronavirus-101626167651886.html

The committee is tasked with identifying key projects required to be implemented on a time-bound basis. It also oversees investments of ₹1,000 crore or more, or any other critical projects, as may be specified, in sectors such as infrastructure and manufacturing. The committee also prescribes time limits for requisite approvals and clearances by the concerned ministries or departments.Three other new ministers, Bhupender Yadav, Sarbananda Sonowal, and Mansukh Mandaviya, apart from Cabinet ministers Smriti Irani and Giriraj Singh, were included in the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs. Former ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad, Harsh Vardhan, and the late Ram Vilas Paswan were in the panel that has a role in addressing Centre-state issues. The panel also examines economic and political issues with no internal or external security implications.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inducted 36 new faces into the council and promoted seven junior ministers to independent or Cabinet roles. He dropped 12 ministers, including the ministers of health, education, information technology, law, environment and, information and broadcasting in the biggest reshuffle in the council since 2014, when he first took over as the Prime Minister.Vaishnaw and Yadav have also been included in the committee on employment and skill development. Four other ministers Kiren Rijiju, Anurag Singh Thakur, Virendra Kumar (all three named Cabinet ministers last week) and Arjun Munda (already a Cabinet minister) have been included in the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs with the mandate to draw the schedule of Parliament sessions. The panel also scrutinises non-government businesses and takes decisions on the bills and resolutions to be presented.The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet includes Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. It has a role in appointments such as that of the three service chiefs, director-general of military operations, chiefs of all air and army commands among others. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) comprises Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, road, transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari, commerce minister Piyush Goyal, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and agriculture minister NS Tomar.CCEA has been trimmed with no replacements for Prasad and DV Sadananda Gowda. It has the mandate to review economic trends, problems and prospects for consistent and integrated economic policies. It also coordinates all activities requiring policy decisions at the highest level.Minister for urban development and housing Hardeep Singh Puri has been included in the panel on accommodation after his elevation as Cabinet minister. The committee is tasked with overseeing and drafting the rules for the allotment of government accommodation. He was a special invitee earlier in the panel in his capacity as a minister of state. Ministers of state are special invitees to the committees.The Cabinet Committee on Security, the highest decision-making body on security affairs, continues to remain unchanged with Modi, Shah, Rajnath Singh, Sitharaman and Jaishankar on the panel. Janata Dal (United)’s RCP Singh is the only representative of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s allies to find a place in the eight committees. He has been named as a special invitee to the committee on skill development and employment.Lok Janshakti Party (LJP)’s Paswan, Shiromani Akali Dal’s (SAD) Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Shiv Sena’s Arvind Sawant were in the previous committees when they were ministers.SAD and Sena have quit the BJP-led alliance.
