23-07-2021||Lucknow||PF scam: Nearly 2 years on, PCL yet to get back money from DHFL||Running from court to tribunal for last two years, the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) has not got back even a single penny yet of the balance ₹2,267 crore of the employees’ provident fund (PF) it allegedly illegally invested as fixed deposits (FDs) in the Diwan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL)—a Mumbai-based private company that has declared itself broke since. Barring three of the total 117 FDs deposited in the DHFL between March 2017 and December 2018 have already attained maturity and the last one worth ₹5 crore will also mature next month on August 6 without the corporation getting anything. “There remains the status quo as far as getting the money back from the DFL is concerned,” UPPCL Contributory Provident Fund Trust secretary SK Awasthi confirmed. “The Mumbai high court has referred the case to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and we are urging the tribunal to direct the DHFL to pay the money back to us,” Awasthi said. The Trust invested ₹2631.20 crore from the employees’ GPF and ₹1491.15 from the CPF into the Diwan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFCL) allegedly in exchange of commission flouting the Central government’s investment guidelines. Only a few days after the PF scam surfaced in early November 2019 creating ripples in the state’s political and bureaucratic circles, the UPPCL approached the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for help to get the money back with due interest from the insolvent DHFL and on RBI’s advice it moved the Mumbai high court. The court, according to people aware of the matter, could not take up the case due to the Covid-19 pandemic that followed and when it heard the case a few weeks ago, it referred the same case to the NCLT for adjudication. A statement on the details of investment made by the UPPCL CPF Trust on August 6, 2020, shows that the first four FDs of ₹10 crore each invested in the DHFL matured October 7, 2019, and FDs of different amounts continue to mature every month the last one will mature on August 6. On one hand, the corporation has got no money back from the DHFL, the CBI that took over the case from state’s economic offences wing (EOW) a few weeks after the scam was unearthed, has not been able file the charge sheet in the case on the other. “Taking so much time by the CBI in filing the charge sheet in this high-profile case casts doubts over whether the accused named in the FIR are the real culprits or there is something more to the scam than meets the eye,” former IPS officer Amitabh Thakur hinted. The Allahabad high court on July 13 granted bail to former UPPCL managing director and one of the prime accused in the PF scam after he was put in jail around two years ago on the charges of criminal conspiracy. The court set him free on bail on the ground of accused-applicant’s bad health and lack of credible evidence against him. “The C.B.I. has been investigating the offence for almost two years. The accused-applicant is 70 years old and has been suffering from various ailments including heart ailment. Except for few documents allegedly signed by him, authorising investment in PNB Housing, LIC Housing and DHFL, there is no document on record regarding his involvement in the commission of the offence,” Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh said in his order granting the bail to Mishra. The court further pointed out in the order that the co-accused-Abhinav Gupta in his statement given to the police had stated that around ₹30 crore commission was obtained from DHFL and this commission was divided amongst the accused-applicant, his father, PK Gupta and Sudhanshu Dwivedi, but the CBI, it stressed, had not been able to unearth so far any money trail involving the accused-applicant to have received part of the commission allegedly given by the DHFL or the PNB Housing Company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pf-scam-nearly-2-years-on-pcl-yet-to-get-back-money-from-dhfl-101627064828961.html

The results will be made available on the website of the Council and through SMS,” said Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary, CISCE.Candidates can check their scores on the board’s portal and through SMS, officials said, adding that affiliated schools can also check school-wise scores through “Careers Portal” of the Council.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the council had cancelled its class 10 and 12 examination and results will be declared as per an alternative assessment policy tabulated on the basis of internal tests and previous performances of students. “Recheck of answer scripts is not applicable for 2021 examination as candidates have been awarded imputed marks,” Arathoon said in the notice released Friday.However, if candidates object to the scores, they can write to their schools, stating the objection in detail. Schools will then have to forward the application to the council after reviewing them and adding their comments on the candidate’s contentions. The last date for forwarding such requests is August 1. “This dispute resolution mechanism is only for the correction of calculation errors,” Arathoon added.Delhi only has one school affiliated to the council. Most schools in the Capital are affilitated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) which is also expected to declare its class 10 and 12 results by the end of this month.Like CBSE, the council will follow a moderation policy to ensure standardisation and check for inflation of marks. CISCE has allowed schools to moderate marks as per their best performance over the last six years though CBSE allows schools to choose reference year from the past three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cisceto-declare-class-10-12-results-on-saturday-101627064710026.html

The seven talukas that fall in the Thane district received only 27mm rainfall on Friday, while on Thursday a total of 147mm rainfall was recorded. “No casualty was reported due to natural calamity in Thane district. The work of repairing the roads and bridges, which were damaged due to the flood, is being undertaken by the concerned department,” said Shivaji Patil, deputy collector, Thane. As per the Thane district records a total of 7,000 residents were rescued from flood-affected areas across the district, from Wednesday night till Thursday afternoon. As per the district records, two men had drowned in flood water near a cemetery located at Chinchawli, Ambernath, on Thursday evening. The rescue operations were initiated, and bodies were recovered after 12 hours of operation. The two were identified as Vinayak Sanjay Parab, 18, and Ishaan Mohidekar, 20. “Three of them from Kalyan had come for a stroll in the premises and two of them went for a swim in the floodwater. The rescue operations were initiated by the local team. They carried out the operation on Thursday evening when the rainfall was less, and the water had receded,” added Patil. Residents of Anupam Nagar in Kalyan (West) pulled all their belongings that were destroyed in the flood water on Friday morning and took up the cleaning work. “Our lives have come to a standstill. All our belongings are destroyed in the floodwater,” said Mahesh Sawant, 35, a resident. On Friday, a 40-feet wide boundary wall of Garden Enclave society, at Siddhanchal​​, Thane (West), collapsed. There were no casualties or injuries reported. The remaining portion of the wall continues to be in a dangerous condition. The Regional Disaster Management Cell has put up temporary barricades within the premises for the safety of residents as a precautionary measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/water-recedes-as-thane-district-records-just-27mm-rainfall-101627064408974.html
23-07-2021||Mumbai||Konkan disaster could’ve been averted?||Heavy downpour in Sahyadri ranges and discharge of water from Koyna and Kolkewadi dams flooded shallow rivers of coastal Konkan region leading to floods in Raigad and Ratnagiri districts. Questions are being raised as to why there were no plans in place to shift people from vulnerable areas if there was a warning for heavy rainfall and the possibility of discharge of water from the dams. Local officials said they had begun shifting the people; however, many were not willing to go to temporary shelters, some were even worried about the Covid situation.Though the Konkan region experiences heavy rains every year, the downpour this year was much more. The high tide and discharge of water from dams made the situation worse, the officials said.“Catchment areas of Koyna and Kolkewadi dam received very heavy rainfall, following which, water from both the dams were released. The incessant rainfall and high tide flooded the entire Chiplun city,” said Dr BN Patil district collector, Ratnagiri. Koyna dam is located in the Satara district on the Sahyadri plateau, while Ratnagiri and other districts of Konkan are at the foothills of the Sahyadri mountain ranges. Due to very heavy rains in the Sahyadri ranges, rivers flowing through Konkan are in spate. Besides, water was released from the Koyna dam to maintain its water level. Water was also discharged from the Kolkewadi dam, which is part of the Koyna Project. The water came gushing down through rivers in Ratnagiri district leading to floods. Chiplun town and surrounding areas on the bank of the local river bore the brunt.Illegal constructions on the banks of the river made the situation worse. “We can call it a partially man-made disaster. Once the flood water recedes, a probe will be ordered into the illegal constructions,” Patil said.Raigad district collector Nidhi Chaudhari said the Savitri river also overflowed owing to heavy rainfall at Mahabaleshwar, which pushed the district into floods. “In the past 48 hours, Mahabaleshwar recorded over 1,100mm rainfall, which is record high and was also not expected. Most of the water from Mahabaleshwar ends up in the Savitri river. Unfortunately, high tide along with heavy rains coincided and the situation became critical,” Chaudhari said.“We are on red alert for the six days and around 1,000 people were also shifted to safer places, while those who were not comfortable shifting due to Covid-19 were requested to go to their relatives. The district administration ensured they leave the place. However, it cannot be denied that some people returned without informing the local administration,” she said.Till Friday, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts have recorded 1,242mm, 1,470mm and 1,236mm rainfall, respectively. All the three districts have also received 138.8%, 172.2% and 159.7% of the average rainfall for this month, respectively, according to the rainfall recording and analysis wing of the state agriculture department data.On Thursday, around 10,000 cusec water was discharged from the Koyna dam. On Friday, 51,000 cusec water was discharged, according to the officials from the relief and rehabilitation department.“Districts from Konkan regions won’t have to worry about discharge from Koyna dam today, as water is being released from eastern gates, which will impact districts from western Maharashtra such as Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur. There won’t be any problem related to floods even in these districts, because the Almatti dam (which is downstream) is releasing over 200,000 cusec of water,” said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department.Pravin Darekar, leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, criticised the state government for failing to anticipate the disaster despite predictions. “It is a fact that the Konkan experiences very heavy rains every year, so why did the state machinery come into action only after a disaster took place? The state government was expected to make war-footing arrangements following the predictions and a red alert sounded for the Konkan region. They remained negligent and people are facing all the brunt,” Darekar said, who visited Taliye village in Raigad, where a landslide claimed the lives of several people.State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said that they are coming up with a permanent system to resolve the issue. “A permanent system worth ₹3,700 crore will be set up by the state government in the Konkan region. Of them, ₹2,000 crore has been approved for underground cabling of the electricity network,” Wadettiwar said.Meanwhile, over 1,200 people from Ratnagiri district and 2,681 people from Thane district have also been evacuated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/konkan-disaster-could-ve-been-averted-101627064348948.html

However, the finishing of the building and white washing is pending.Executive engineer of the public works department (PWD), Adesh Gupta, said, “All three blocks are ready and only the finishing of the building is left. The work slowed down as the contractor has not received funds from the higher education department.”The project is worth ₹12 crore and is coming up on five acres of land. Construction started on November 3, 2018, and the contractor will hand over the building only after receiving the remaining amount. In June last year, the work on the construction of the new building of the third government college in the city had come to a halt due to the paucity of funds.Sanjay Talwar, MLA of Ludhiana East, who took the initiative to start the project, said, “I have sent the demand to hire Class- 4 employees and security guard for the college and classes for BA course will start from next month at the new building. The college already has five teachers who are conducting online classes from the premises of SCD Government College. Over ₹40 lakh has been approved for the furniture and I will also provide ₹1 crore from MLA’s quota. The balance funds will be released to the contractor in next 10 days.”The foundation stone of the building was laid on January 28, 2018. On April 11, 2018, a team comprising the director, public instructions (colleges), former deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal and other officials inspected a community centre at Jamalpur to start BA part 1 and part 2 classes temporarily from there. Students of these classes were supposed to be later shifted to the new college. For the last three years, students of the Government College, Ludhiana east, had been attending classes on the premises of SCD Government College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/construction-of-govt-college-ludhiana-east-building-hits-roadblock-101627064294268.html

He came under the tyre of the container and died on the spot. While the residents have blamed the potholes for the accident, the Bhoiwada police have registered a case against the container driver. The victim Tejas Patik, 24, resident of Vadghar was commuting with his friend along the Chinchoti-Anjurphata Road. He was heading home after running an errand. A police officer from Bhoiwada police station said, “Patil was trying to avoid a pothole around 10pm on Thursday when a container rammed into his bike. His friend Rohit Patil, 23, fell on the other side of the road and suffered minor injuries, while he was crushed under the tyres of the container.” Senior police inspector, S Indalikar, said, “Rohan, who was riding pillion, in his statement, said that Patil was trying to avoid potholes on the road.

23-07-2021||Mumbai||Sudha Bhardwaj bail plea: No illegality in 2018 sessions court order, State, NIA to Bombay HC||The state government and National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday, argued against the default bail application of Elgar Parishad accused Sudha Bharadwaj. The state and NIA admitted that there could be an irregularity on the part of the judge who signed orders taking cognisance of the charge sheet, however, there was no illegality in the order. The state argued that though judge KD Vadane signed the orders pretending to be a special judge under the NIA Act while he was only an additional session judge, there was no illegality in the order as the Act stipulates that such cases could be heard by any competent court and the sessions court was competent, hence the application of Bharadwaj for default bail should be dismissed. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the default bail application of Bharadwaj had been informed by advocate Yug Choudhry that Bharadwaj and her co-accused had been charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), which deals with scheduled offences, and cognisance of such offences could only be a special court. Choudhry had submitted that judge Vadane, who had taken cognisance of the charge sheet and signed the orders as a special judge, was only an additional sessions judge at the time, hence, in light of such a lapse, Bharadwaj was entitled to default bail. While responding to Choudhry’s submissions, on Friday, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state said, “Can it be said that just because cognisance was taken by someone who did not have jurisdiction, a person is entitled to default bail? This cognisance aspect cannot make them (Bharadwaj and her co-accused) entitled to default bail. Let us not make a mountain out of a molehill.” Kumbhakoni argued that the sessions court taking cognisance of the Pune Police’s case could be considered as an irregularity, but not illegality. He added that the petition by Bharadwaj did not mention that there was a failure of justice, or any prejudice was caused because of the lapse. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for NIA concurred with Kumbhakoni’s submissions and said that there was no irregularity in the sessions court taking cognisance of the case. “All sessions judges are equal. There is no greater or so, it is merely a question of notification distinguishing them as so,” said Singh adding that as the charge sheet had been filed within the stipulated 90 days the right for default bail ceased to exist, hence the claims of Bharadwaj could not be entertained. Further hearing of the petition will continue on August 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sudha-bhardwaj-bail-plea-no-illegality-in-2018-sessions-court-order-state-nia-to-bombay-hc-101627064048925.html

While Shraddha had a narrow escape, Kritika was not so lucky and suffered severe injuries on her arms, legs, feet and back. Hearing her screams, people came to her rescue and drove off the charging animal with sticks. The victim’s father, Sushil Singh, who works as a labourer at a steel unit, said, “The attack took place just near the gate of our house. Three-four bovines were grazing in the area and one of them launched a vicious attack on my daughter. Fortunately, the animal did not attack her with its horns and residents came to her rescue in time. Though my daughter survived the attack, she was grievously wounded. The attack was so brutal that it is painful to watch the CCTV footage of the incident.” A video clip of the incident reveals that the cow kept mauling the girl for 30 seconds. Slamming the civic body for failing to rein in the stray cattle, Singh said that a large number of livestock roam the area and after the incident people were scared to let their children play on the streets.Singh who has three daughters can barely afford Kritika’s treatment and has sought monetary aid from the authorities. “I work as a labourer and live in a rented accommodation. Around ₹1,500 was spent on first aid alone and her treatment is to continue. I urge the administration to help us.” Councillor blames slum dwellers On being apprised of the attack, ward number 23 councillor Sandeep Kumari blamed slum dwellers who run illegal dairy units in the area for the menace and sought action against them. She submitted a memorandum to MC Zone B commissioner Swati Tiwana on Friday and asked the civic body to have stray cattle removed from the area. Despite repeated attempts, Tiwana remained unavailable for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stray-cow-mauls-12-year-old-girl-in-ludhiana-101627063872367.html
23-07-2021||Mumbai||FIR registered against Param Bir Singh in Thane||A day after Marine Drive police booked former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in an extortion case, Kopri police in Thane registered a similar case against him on Friday.Thane Police commissioner Jai Jeet Singh confirmed that the first information report (FIR) has been registered. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Parag Manere and three civilians have also been named in the FIR as co-accused. Manere was the DCP (crime) in Thane when Singh was posted as Thane Police commissioner, and the offence allegedly took place during their tenure. Singh is currently posted as director general of Home Guards while Manere is posted with the economic offences wing (EOW), Mumbai.The other three named in the FIR are builder Sanjay Punamiya, his associate Sunil Jain and Manoj Ghotkar. Officers said the five accused have been booked for kidnapping, extortion and cheating under the Indian Penal Code. The complainant, Sharad Agrawal, deals in real estate and has alleged that the accused extorted money from him and also forced him to turn over some plots of land to them. The complainant’s uncle, Shyamsunder Agrawal, is the complainant in the case registered against Singh in Mumbai on Thursday. According to investigating officers, the offence dates back to 2016 when Shyamsundar was arrested in a case filed against him by Punamiya and Jain. “While Shyamsundar was remanded in police custody, Singh and Manere illegally restrained Sharad and demanded monetary gratification from him in exchange for not opposing his uncle’s bail plea and for not invoking the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against him. After negotiation, the price was set at ₹9 crore. Of this, ₹1 crore was paid in cash while the rest of it was given in the form of land, which the accused forced Sharad to sign over to them,” a senior officer said. He added that the entire negotiation was conducted by Ghotkar, who acted as a middleman in the alleged deal. Punamiya and Jain are also named as accused in the FIR filed by the Marine Drive police against Singh, and both of them were arrested on Thursday. Kopri police will be seeking their custody for investigation in the case registered on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fir-registered-against-param-bir-singh-in-thane-101627063872844.html
23-07-2021||Chandigarh||Cow cess runs in crores, but stray-cattle menace continues in Ludhiana||Despite collecting a whopping ₹3.5 crore annually as cow cess, the municipal corporation has failed to rein in stray cattle. The untethered bovines are singularly responsible for several road mishaps and freak accidents each year. With the MC failing to provide shelter to the animals, hundreds of cattle can be seen dotting roads, streets and chowks across the city. They are also seen roaming in posh areas of the city, including Sarabha Nagar, Model Town Extension,and Rajguru Nagar. Three gaushalas and NGOs have provided shelter to around 1,400 cattle for the MC over the years in exchange for a fixed amount for the care of each animal. Around ₹1.5 crore is spent on the upkeep of cattle annually. However, the shelters have been running out of space and the civic body has been trying to rope in more gaushalas. However, till more space can be found to house the cattle, residents are likely to remain on the receiving end. One of the residents of Model Town Extension, Manjeet Singh, said, “The MC should lift stray cattle from city roads as they block traffic. These animals have attacked locals on occasion and pose a danger to motorists as they dart onto the road out of nowhere.” A resident of Salem Tabri area, Parminder Singh, said, “Bulls should be lifted from roads on priority as they can be seen locking horns with each other. They are a menace, especially in narrow alleys and streets.” In the general house meeting held on July 14 senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra highlighted the need for establishing the city’s own cow shelter.

The victims, Sukhjit Singh, 45, of Dolon Khurd village and Nachattar Singh, 45, of Humayupura village were rushed to the hospital by passersby. While Sukhjit, a hardware store owner, was killed on impact, Nachattar is being treated at the civil hospital. The collision had forced the tyres of both the vehicles to come off. The accused, Harsimar Singh of Jalandhar, fled the spot leaving the vehicle behind. A complain was registered on the complaint of Sukhjit’s brother Gurmeet Singh. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Sandeep Kumar, who is investigating the case, said that an FIR had ben registered under Sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), and 304A (causing death due to negligence) of the Indian Penal Code against the accused, who is on the run.

23-07-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks NIA, state and Fr Stan Swamy’s counsel to justify continuation of bail appeal||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA), state and the counsel for Elgar Parishad accused Fr Stan Swamy, who died due to a heart attack on July 5, to inform it through their submissions on whether the appeals for regular bail and bail on medical grounds filed by the octogenarian priest can be heard as, according to prescribed laws, they stood abated after his demise. The court sought the submissions after NIA objected to hearing of the appeals but the counsel for Fr Swamy maintained that the HC could exercise its parens patriae power for the deceased citizen and supervise the magisterial inquiry that is yet to commence into the death of the priest. The bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar was hearing the bail applications of Fr Swamy which had been kept pending to ascertain the veracity of the claims of his counsel that there had been negligence by NIA and Taloja Central Prison towards Swamy’s health despite him complaining about the same before the court intervened. While making submissions, senior counsel Mihir Desai sought four directions from the court — permitting Fr Fraser Mascarenhas to attend the preliminary enquiry conducted under section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) into the custodial death of Swamy; conducting the probe in compliance of the guidelines of the National Human Rights Commission; appointing a magistrate from Mumbai as Fr Swamy’s death took place in Mumbai; and that the report of such investigation by the magistrate be submitted to the HC to ensure it is supervised. However, additional solicitor general Anil Singh said while he could possibly not have any objection to the investigation being conducted in compliance with the procedure under law, he had objection to the report being submitted to HC. Citing section 346 of CrPC, Singh submitted that any appeal by an accused stood abated after the death of the appellant. He argued that as Fr Swamy’s appeal challenged the rejection of his bail application by the special NIA court, it was abated after his death, and hence no proceeding remained for the consideration of HC. Chief public prosecutor Aruna Pai concurred and adopted NIA’s submissions. After hearing the submissions the court asked Desai to clarify on this aspect. Desai argued that while he agreed with Singh’s submissions on the legal issue, he was invoking the supervisory jurisdiction of the HC as it was a Constitutional court. He clarified that what was being sought was not part of the appeal and cited judgments wherein the Supreme Court had held that the HC was parens patriae to applicants which included the children, insane adults and deceased who could not speak or decide for themselves. After hearing Desai, the court directed him to file a written submission with the relevant judgments supporting his argument and also serve a copy to the respondents. The court also asked NIA and state to file their response and posted next hearing on August 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-nia-state-and-fr-stan-swamy-s-counsel-to-justify-continuation-of-bail-appeal-101627063808909.html

With the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic affecting several parts of the country, the current 2021-22 academic year too has been pushed online. Based on the requests made by teachers as well as parent groups, we have decided to reduce the portion by 25% again this year for the benefit of students,” Gaikwad said in a statement shared with media.A similar decision was taken by the school education minister last year as well, inviting mixed reactions. While parents and students rejoiced with the decision, schools and experts in the field of education had their doubts about reducing syllabus, especially for Class 10 and 12 students.However, many teachers also approved the decision. “Last year itself, the Central government had announced a stipulated time limit for online classes which cannot exceed 3.5 hours including a break in between. With such limited time, it makes sense to reduce the syllabus and stick to only what is required to be taught to better prepare students for the next academic year,” said a teacher from a suburban school. The omitted syllabus remains similar to the last academic year to maintain consistency, said officials from the education department..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-reduces-state-board-syllabus-for-class-1-12-by-25-101627063748839.html

It turned out that the certificates, like the vaccine doses, were fakes.At Kandivli, around 390 citizens were given fake doses. Later more such victims were identified, taking the total count to around 3,000 in around dozen such incidents across the city.Following this, BMC had, earlier this month, written to both the state and Central governments seeking guidelines on administering Covid-19 vaccines to the victims of fake vaccination scam in the city. In a statement issued on Friday, BMC confirmed that vaccination for the 390 citizens in Kandivli will be conducted on Saturday.“According to police investigation, the list of citizens who are suspected to have been given fake vaccines has been handed over by the police to the municipal administration. The information of these citizens is being verified by the municipal administration on the basis of mobile numbers on the CoWIN website,” BMC said in a statement. Civic officials maintained that other victims of such fake vaccination scam across the city will be vaccinated in a phased manner.The BMC statement further said that those, who were vaccinated at such fake vaccination drives but were given genuine doses of vaccine, will be administered the second dose after the completion of 84 days in case of Covishield and 28 days in case of Covaxin.Meanwhile, 82,062 citizens were vaccinated in the city on Friday. So far, 6,684,815 doses have been administered in the city and 1,506,647 beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated with both doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/390-victims-of-kandivli-fake-vaccination-scam-to-be-vaccinated-on-saturday-101627063690002.html
23-07-2021||Mumbai||Raj Kundra moves Bombay HC challenging magisterial remand order||Raj Kundra, husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, has moved the Bombay high court (HC) challenging the July 20 order of a metropolitan magistrate court remanding him in police custody in connection with the alleged pornography racket. Police had sought his custody on the grounds of suspicion that Kundra may have used the money earned in the pornography racket for online betting, and hence it needed to interrogate him with regards to the financial transaction between him and two banks. The petition is yet to be numbered. Meanwhile, Kundra’s police custody, which ended on July 23, was extended by the magistrate till July 27 on Friday. Kundra’s petition, filed through Parinam Law Associates, has pointed out that after the alleged incident of creating and publishing pornographic content came to light, a number of people were arrested in connection with the case and later released on bail. The petition states that crime branch officers visited his office on July 19 and conducted a search, following which they called Kundra to their Byculla office to record his statement. The petition further adds that when he complied, the police arrested him. Referring to the arrest, the petition said the mode in which he was arrested violated the procedure laid down under section 41A of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) which mandates that the police must issue a proper notice to the accused before making an arrest. The petition said that an application was made opposing his detention before the magistrate court on the grounds that law was violated. However, when the remand application of the police came up before the magistrate, he did not consider Kundra’s application and granted police remand till July 23. Citing that there are clear orders of the Supreme Court against arresting and detaining persons against whom offences are registered with punishment of less than seven years in light of the Covid-19 situation, the petition said the magistrate failed to take cognisance of the highest court’s order and remanded Kundra in custody. It added that the cumulative punishment for the offences that the accused has been booked for is less than seven years and that the magistrate had erred in allowing his police remand, hence the remand order should be quashed and he should be released. The petition will come up for hearing after it is numbered and its circulation is granted. On July 20, Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale had stated that Kundra and 10 others had been arrested for their alleged involvement in the creation of pornographic films and publishing them through mobile apps. Nagrale had said that Kundra seemed to be the key conspirator and there was sufficient evidence regarding that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/raj-kundra-moves-bombay-hc-challenging-magisterial-remand-order-101627063568841.html

23-07-2021||Noida||2 companies get show cause notice for stopping work on 440kV substation||The state power transmission agency has issued a show cause notice to two companies that jointly took up the construction of a 440 kilovolt (kV) substation, estimated to cost about ₹350 crore, in Noida’s Sector 123 only to drop the contract without intimation, said officials aware of the development.Shekhar Agarwal, Meerut zonal chief engineer (transmission), Uttar Pradesh Power Transmission Corporation Limited (UPPTCL), said the contract for constructing the 440 kV substation was awarded to Hyosung Power Corporation of South Korea and its Indian counterpart Piscesia Power Transmission Private Limited in November 2014. “The expected date of completion was March 31, 2021. However, since the Indian company stopped the work a few months ago, it could not be completed on time. Taking cognisance of their negligent approach, we have served a show cause notice to both the companies. Since no response has come from the Indian company, we have contacted the South Korean company. The Hyosung officials assured us that the project will be completed by October 2021,” said Agarwal. It may be noted that the 400 kV power station coming up at Sector 123 will ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to 80,000 consumers residing in Sectors 60, 63-68 and 70-79 in Noida. The construction work at the power station was halted on several occasions following guidelines from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority to check pollutionAgarwal further said almost 70% of the work on the substation is complete. “The 400 kV transformer has already been charged. Now, it needs to be connected with three smaller 132 kV substations, being constructed in sectors 63, 67 and 115. The transformers of the smaller substations have not been charged yet. Once completed, these substations will get power from the power grid in Jahangirpur,” he said. Explaining the negligent conduct of Piscesia Power, another official from the state power utility said the company is on the verge of a bankruptcy owing to a feud between its partners. “Since all of their bank accounts are frozen, they will not be able to operate. Now, the onus lies on its Korean partner to complete the project,” said the official asking not to be named. M Devaraj, the chairman of UPPTCL, said he is looking into the matter and the project will be completed within 100 days. When contacted, the spokesperson of Hyosung Power Corporation said they will restart the construction work in a week and will complete it by October. Officials of Piscesia Power did not respond to e-mails sent seeking their comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/2-companies-get-show-cause-notice-for-stopping-work-on-440kv-substation-101627062010314.html
23-07-2021||Noida||Admin plans ponds with plantation in catchment area of river Hindon||In order to bolster the health of dying river Hindon, the Ghaziabad district administration will plant trees and create ponds along its catchment area. Officials said it will enlist the help of different agencies such as the departments of Irrigation, rural development, UP Avas Vikas and the Ghaziabad Development Authority to carry out the proposed work. The issue of river Hindon pollution was discussed recently in a meeting of the district groundwater management council and it was agreed that the ecological balance of the river catchment area has to be improved. The district magistrate is chalking out a plan in this regard and different works will be assigned to different departments in a decentralised manner, officials in the know of the matter said. “The idea is to tap the catchment area of the river. In such areas, we plan to create water bodies (ponds) and also get the help of the forest department to take up plantation,” said Rakesh Kumar Singh, district magistrate. “For the purpose, we have asked different departments to contribute to the plan and agencies such as the GDA can also enlist the help of private developers and utilise the corporate social responsibility funds,” the district magistrate further said. The Hindon, western Uttar Pradesh’s most important river, has a basin area of about 7,000 square kilometres. It originates in the Shivalik range in Saharanpur district and flows down to Muzaffarnagar, before making its way through Shamli, Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar to meet the Yamuna downstream in Delhi.According to environmentalists and numerous studies over the years, the river has become so polluted that it has zero aquatic life in large stretches and is also affecting the human population in nearby villages and cities as the groundwater is also becoming polluted. “The work for the plantation and creation of water bodies will help preserve the boundaries of the river and will help in groundwater recharge. We have already demarcated the floodplains and work for installation of pillars will be initiated now,” said Sanjay Singh, executive engineer, the state irrigation department, which is the custodian of the river. “Simultaneously , we will also focus on tapping drains. We also plan to increase the water flow from one of the escapes upstream, where the river gets fresh water from the Upper Ganga Canal. This will induce a better flow and clean the river as well,” Singh said. But environmentalists are sceptical about how much this plan would work, when earlier such plans, to preserve and rejuvenate the river, have come to naught. “The plan should be implemented with a fixed timeline. Creation of ponds will boost the river system as the river Hindon is currently devoid of any water flow. Plantation will help preserve the natural surroundings and can eventually turn into a habitat for birds and animals,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and member of the district groundwater council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/admin-plans-ponds-with-plantation-in-catchment-area-of-river-hindon-101627062008758.html

Their other grouses include green belts that have been encroached upon, a community centre that is in a shambles and unoccupied houses that have been taken over by squatters. Repeated complaints to the Greater Noida authority, they say, have gone unheeded for the past one year.Sigma 2 has seven parks and five green belts, of which one has been encroached upon by unauthorised shops, residents said.“Despite residents speaking about these issues to every official of the Greater Noida authority who visited the sector over the past years, nothing has been done to address them,” said Yogender Bhati, president of the Sigma 2 residents’ welfare society (RWA).When Hindustan Times visited the sector, the team found the parks in a poor condition -- their boundary walls broken in places, clothes hung out to dry on trees and bushes and cattle left to graze at will. On a tour of the sector, the HT team found that several houses, which had no functioning toilets or power connection, were occupied. “They are squatters. There are at least 300 houses here that the owners have not rented out, but are currently occupied by squatters,” Bhati said.The community centre in the sector was also found in a state of disrepair— its plastering was peeling off, windows and doors had come unhinged, and the whole establishment had the look of a building left unused for a long time.“Since the boundary walls of the sector are broken at several places, people from outside leave their cattle to graze in our parks,” said Kuldeep Awana, the RWA vice-president. “The community centre is in a shambles and all the green belts, both within and outside the sector, as well as our seven parks are in a pathetic state.”Rajni Nagar, one of the residents, said, “In the absence of functional toilets in most of the houses, squatters defecate in the green belts and open drains. There are human faeces lying all around the sector. At night, we have quite a few inebriated people walking around.”“With drunk men roaming around, we do not feel safe to go out even for an evening walk. We have invested so much on a house in the city and yet feel like we are living in a shady part of the town,” said Nishita Gupta, a resident.Yudhishtir Sharma, who lives in another part of Noida, said in the past 15 years, he has removed squatters at least seven times from his house in Sigma 2. “I have finally put a guard there. However, there are many more like me who are struggling with the problem of squatters,” he said.Will do what we can, says authority Greater Noida authority CEO Narendra Bhooshan said he will look into the issue of encroachment on the green belt and will evict anyone who violated the law. “We will ensure that parks are repaired and maintained. We told the RWA to run the community centre as a club, or as a venue for holding events, on a revenue sharing basis with the authority. This will ensure upkeep of the place as well as generate revenue for its maintenance,” he said.On the boundary wall issue, Bhooshan said government sectors are not supposed to have one. “If it is a security concern, the RWA may employ security guards as is being done in other sectors,” he said.Bhooshan said the issue of squatters was a law-and-order one for which the property owner must approach the police.Yograj Singh, general secretary of the RWA, said they have appealed to the police in this regard. “We made a list of 128 plots that are being illegally occupied and submitted it to the police. We also raised with the police the issue of increasing crime in our sector,” he said.Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said, “I have directed officials to inquire into the law-and-order situation in the sector. As far as unauthorised occupancy is concerned, the plot owners need to move the court for civil eviction as that is not a police matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/unkept-sigma-2-sector-overrun-by-squatters-residents-look-to-g-noida-for-help-101627061949382.html

The Anjuman Intazamia Masjid said that they have given the land for the construction of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor which was inaugurated in 2019 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the beautification of the Kashi Vishwanath temple.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation of the project worth over ₹1,000 crore on March 8, 2019. Under the project, at least 24 new buildings will be constructed. The land was exchanged as the need arose for building a control tower for the Kashi Vishwanath corridor.The exchange of land, which comes as both parties are engaged in a legal tussle, is being considered as a significant development. Earlier this year, Varanasi civil judge (senior division) Ashutosh Tiwari ordered an archaeological survey of the Gyanvapi complex. He said it was required to assess the pleas which claim that the mosque was built by Mughal emperors after partially demolishing a Hindu temple. The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) earlier this month challenged the Varanasi court’s decision.Several petitions were filed claiming that Mughal emperor Aurangzeb demolished a portion of the Kashi Vishwanath temple to build the Gyanvapi Masjid in the 17th century. The petitioners demanded that the land on which the mosque stands be restored to Hindu parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mosque-admin-gives-1-000-sq-ft-land-for-kashi-vishwanath-corridor-report-101627061208098.html

The delegation, which comprised former union minister Harsimarat Kaur Badal, Balwinder Singh Bhunder and Naresh Gujaral, also called for withdrawal of all the recommendations made by the high-level committee including disaffiliation of colleges of Punjab by drastically reducing the territorial jurisdiction of the PU. The delegation also informed the chancellor that the high level committee had been hijacked by anti-Punjab forces, which are seeking to change the very character of the university in the name of governance reforms. It said an effort was afoot to wrest all powers from elected representatives of the alumni and render the office of the vice-chancellor, which will be vested with all powers now, an autocratic institution. It added that the committee also sought to eliminate Punjabis from the institution by recommending that the Syndicate have only ex-officio and nominated members instead of elected representatives. “It amounts to humiliating their voice and pushing them out of the national mainstream. Punjabis are deeply disturbed by this conspiracy to submerge their culture into a nameless set of ideas, values and cultural ethos quite alien to this region. This brazen cultural and administrative takeover of PU follows in the series of injustices wreaked on Punjabis including the snatching of the state capital, river waters and Punjabi speaking areas.” Sukhbir said as per the will and vision of the founders of the University, it was created for the people of Punjab to preserve and promote their academic, intellectual and cultural heritage. He said this ideal had been eroded with anti federal measures seeking to eliminate Punjabis from the running of the varsity. He requested Naidu to take immediate remedial action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sad-delegation-meets-naidu-on-governance-reforms-in-pu-101627059669059.html

That day, she was alone in the house. Sohan Singh, the victim’s son, discovered her body about 9am the next day.The convict worked at a farm close to the victim’s residence and had been deployed by the then sarpanch of Kotli Harchanda village. The trial has been completed in two years and four months, in spite of recurrent lockdown and virtual hearings during the Covid-19 pandemic. After completing this 25-year long imprisonment, the convict will undergo imprisonment for life and pay ₹25,000 as fine. If he defaults on paying the fine, he will have to undergo additional simple imprisonment for another eight months. “All substantive sentences shall run separately, one followed by another,” said district attorney Amanpreet Singh Sandhu, public prosecutor in this case. The court declined his request for death sentence, observing that this would be a severe punishment, in spite of gravity of the crime. “There is no research that suggests that the severity of punishment acts as a deterrent, certainty of punishment to the offender certainly acts as deterrent,” the court maintained. The court observed that the old woman was subjected to barbaric treatment, showing extreme depravity by the convict that leads to a sense of revulsion in the mind of a common man. “This case is an example that the dignity, person, and life of a woman is not safe within the four walls of her house. The rapist and murderer is not concerned with the age, colour, creed, caste, race, dress, life-style choices, urban or rural background or even with the deep wrinkles on her face and body,” the court added. The case had grabbed headlines, when it came to light and the police had arrested the Nepali, Rout, on the next day of the heinous crime. During investigation, Rout’s hair and pieces of his jacket were found in the nails of the woman. The samples from the head, hair and private parts of the accused matched those on the victim’s body and clothes in the DNA test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nepali-labourer-gets-double-jail-term-for-rape-murder-of-84-yr-old-in-gurdaspur-101627058829122.html

Earlier this week, the government had suspended two police officials allegedly involved in manhandling the legislators on March 23. The move came days after leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav wrote to the Speaker seeking a reply as to who all were responsible for ordering such violent measures against the Opposition members and seeking strict action against the erring officials. Yadav, who did not participate in today’s meeting as he is in New Delhi, also wrote in his letter to the Speaker that Opposition members were scared to attend the monsoon session given the violence against them in the budget session.RJD was represented by Lalit Kumar Yadav at the meeting on Friday. “We told the Speaker that mere suspension of two police officials was not enough. The policemen involved in manhandling legislators should be arrested and dismissed from service. Action should be also taken against those who ordered such violent measures when women MLAs were dragged outside the assembly and manhandled,” said Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma, who attended the meeting. Sharma, however, said it was not right for members to climb on the podium, referring to the unruly scenes in the House on March 23. Speaker Sinha urged the members to show discipline in the House during the forthcoming session. Parliamentary affairs minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav assured the members that government would give replies on public issues raised by members.

23-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi will reopen schools after monitoring situation in other states, says Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal told reporters on Friday that his government will keep an eye on the states where schools are being reopened to learn about their experiences before deciding on when to reopen schools in the Capital. Kejriwal insisted that the schools should ideally only be opened after vaccination has been done. "The ideal situation would be to open schools after vaccination. We will see for some days the experiences of other states where schools are opening and then decide. Parents are still worried about their child's safety," he told reporters.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo had said last week that the government is concerned about a possible third wave of coronavirus and will not be opening schools before vaccination is completed. Schools in the national Capital were shut in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic after some classes were briefly resumed in February this year. Starting from September-October last year, states partially resumed physical classes which had to be suspended again in March-April this year.Also Read: Is reopening schools in India risky now? What experts, government saidWith many experts insisting that the third wave can be brutal for children, the largest unvaccinated population, the opening of schools has become a contentious issue. The states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Rajasthan for classes 9 to 12 in the July-August period as cases have once again started to fall. All India Institute of Medical Sciences director Dr Randeep Guleria cautioned that schools should only be opened in areas where the positivity rate is low, staff are vaccinated and should be shut down if the positivity rate starts to go up again.

As many as 4,000 people reached for vaccination but the centre received only 500 vaccines. A few residents of Udaipuria village fought for vaccination. Police force had to be deployed at the centre.Rajgarh collector Neeraj Kumar Singh said, “A large number of people are reaching the vaccination centres. We have no system of prior registration and are doing spot registration. We are making arrangements and also requested the state government to increase doses.”In a similar incident in a village in Khargone, women engaged in a scuffle in order to enter the vaccination centre. A video of the incident went viral on social media. Block medical officer Dr Rakesh Patidar wrote a letter to district administration and police to make arrangements for security.People are allegedly panicking to get vaccination first due to rumours of losing the benefit of government schemes and fear of losing their work.A resident of Bujurg village of Khargone, Shiv Singh said, “We were told that if we don’t take vaccination against Covid-19, we will lose the benefits of all the government schemes. We will not get ration and work.”In Hoshangabad, Barwani, Vidisha and Panna, a long queue could be seen at centres due to the same reason. Even people are reaching the centre at the night to get the token first. A resident of Panna, Munna Ahirwar, 30, said, “We came back to our village due to lockdown. Now, our lives are solely dependent upon the government’s scheme. If we lose it, we will not survive so I am visiting the centre for the past one week but I am not getting the jab. The health workers here said they didn’t have enough vaccines and it will be given on a first come first serve basis.” In most of the districts, the administrations are increasing the number of centres.Panna district collector Sanjay Kumar Mishra said, “Initially, a few people were visiting the centres for vaccination but the sudden increase of numbers is creating chaos at the centre. Now, we have decided to increase the number of centres and token counters to maintain the social distancing.”Medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said, “We are getting regular doses of vaccine. Even, we made a record of vaccination of 10 lakh people on Thursday. We are in touch with the district administration and are trying to provide vaccine doses as per demand.”Recently, MP High Court has asked the central government to provide 15 million doses per month or 4 million doses per week to administer at least the first dose of vaccine before the third wave hits, which is predicted in September.In Madhya Pradesh, over 26.6 million vaccines have been administered till Friday and more than 75 million doses are required to complete the 100% vaccination target till December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/chaos-at-vaccination-centres-in-mp-health-department-to-increase-sites-101627053072795.html

On Tilak’s 100th death anniversary on August 1, the statue will be on display for all in his very own study room.Reminiscing about his father and sculptor Keshav Lele who sculpted the statue, Yeshwant Keshav Lele said, “This is the only full-size statue sculpted by the then 18-year-old sculptor Keshav Lele, with Tilak himself sitting as a live model in July 1919 when he was at Sardar Bhavan in Mumbai. The statue was made of Plaster of Paris (PoP) in July 1919 at Sardar Bhavan. That is also where he breathed his last a year later.”The statue is unique in that it is not in the usual standing pose but in an extremely realistic pose of Tilak in his daily life, sitting in a reclining armchair reading the Kesari (newspaper started by Tilak). The chair on which the statue is seated is almost as old as the sculpture.Yeshwant Keshav Lele recalled, “My father was a highly accomplished sculptor who specialised in making dioramas of moving statues. He was chosen twice to represent India; once at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, UK, in 1924 and again at the Sesquicentennial International Exposition at Philadelphia, USA, in 1926.”The Tilak family spent ₹1 crore in restoring their old house using old photographs and other paraphernalia. They employed the services of heritage restoration architect Kiran Kalamdani for the purpose.Reiterating that this is the only life-sized statue in existence sculpted with Tilak sitting as live model, Mukta Tilak recalled, “The statue took six months with Tilak spending an hour daily to sit in one place. He was very fidgety and would not sit still according to the then photographers. It has captured the very essence of Tilak in its features.”The statue is special also in that it is almost all that is left of sculptor Keshav Lele’s body of work as all his unique dioramas were destroyed by anti-social elements in the riots that broke out after Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination. Keshav Lele died in 1945 just shy of his 44th birthday. Ironically, he died of lung failure due to saturation of the lungs by PoP dust.Tilak’s statue, affectionately called “Tilak Ajoba” was practically a family member at the Leles’ residence in Dadar, Mumbai. After taking care of “Tilak Ajoba” for 60 years, Keshav Lele’s son, Yeshwant Lele, transported the statue to his daughter Dr Chitra Lele’s home in Pune in 1999 to curb any further damage due to the infamous Mumbai weather. In Pune, it was lovingly restored in 2015 by famous sculptor-restorer, Abhijit Dhondphale.“I have used fibreglass to restore the torso of the statue while the face, hands, and legs are the original in PoP. It took me almost a month-and-a-half to refurbish and bring it back to Tilak’s original skin colour,” informed Dhondphale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tilak-ajoba-gives-an-audience-to-pune-again-101627051987885.html

From last Sunday to Tuesday this week, the PMC had to shut down centres because of no stock. All those who got their first dose in April are due for the second shot. The current approved gap between two shots of Covishield is between 12 and 16 weeks, which is 84 to 112 days. However, senior citizens who got their first dose before April 30, are now queuing up outside vaccination centres to get the second dose. The second shot of the vaccine is essential to ensure that a person is fully vaccinated and has received maximum possible immunisation against the infection. The gap between the first and second shot has been raised multiple times, initially from one month to the existing three months.Dr Suryakant Deokar , PMC immunisation officer said, “For Saturday we have started over 185 Covishield centres and each of the centres will get 100 doses.

For the remaining 40%, 20% will be reserved for second shots and those who have taken their first shot before April 30. The remaining 20% is for second-shot walk-in beneficiaries. As of now, the current criteria for gap between first and second dose is 12 to 16 weeks and we are ensuring that everyone gets the second dose in that time. We will try to increase the slots for the second shot so that the more vulnerable population is fully vaccinated.”On Friday Pune district received a total of 60,000 doses of Covishield, of which Pune rural got 25,800, PMC got 21,000 and PCMC got 13,200.

As this year too Kanwar pilgrimage has been banned in Uttarakhand, this step is being taken to ensure Kanwariyas don’t head to Uttarakhand for fetching Ganga jal as they will be provided with the holy water through tankers in their city, town or village. Kanwar yatra is an annual pilgrimage of Shiva devotees, known as Kanwariyas, to Haridwar, Gaumukh and Gangotri in Uttarakhand to fetch Ganga waters which they take back to their respective areas to anoint Shiva Lingams in temples. District magistrate of Haridwar, C Ravi Shankar, has made a communique in this regard with respective district magistrates and deputy commissioners of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to send the information on demand and place of distribution in their respective administrative areas so that arrangements can be made for ferrying Ganga Jal to these places for Kanwariyas. “Owing to the Covid epidemic, Kanwar fair has been banned this year. But taking into consideration the religious sentiments of Kanwariyas, arrangements will be made through tankers to ferry sacred Ganga water to the neighbouring states. As soon as we get the requirement and point of distribution, tankers will be sent so that Kanwariyas can then use it to anoint Shiv Lingums on Shivratri (August 6),” said DM C Ravi Shankar. The DM also added that through the online portal epost service of the Indian Postal Department, devotees can also purchase Ganga Jal which will be sent through parcel service to them. Meanwhile, the Youth Congress unit has also dispatched 6,000 litres of Ganga Jal to urban and rural areas of western Uttar Pradesh for Lord Shiva devotees. “Kanwariyas can’t arrive this year too, so we thought to provide sacred Ganga water to Kanwariyas in neighbouring states. Last year also, the Youth Congress provided Ganga jal through water tankers in UP,” said Mahanagar president Akash Bhati, Youth Congress. Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha said that next year the yatra will hopefully resume and Kanwariyas will be able to fetch Ganga jal themselves. “But till then, tanker service is a good alternative,” he said. On July 13, the Uttarakhand government cancelled the Kanwar yatra amid the fear of third wave and Delta plus variant which has been already reported in the hill state. The decision was taken in the meeting chaired by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/ganga-waters-to-be-provided-to-kanwariyas-through-tankers-101627049830408.html

The government has thus established a 24x7 call centre answering every complaint.Nodal officers have also been assigned to every zone to ensure every complaint gets resolved and registered beneficiaries receive their due benefits in empanelled hospitals, the statement said.The state government has made a provision that if any empanelled hospital has taken money from any beneficiary of the scheme in the treatment relating to Covid-19 and mucormycosis (black fungus) in the second wave, it will be returned to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/over-1-2l-people-in-rajasthan-signed-up-for-the-state-s-health-scheme-says-govt-101627042640731.html

No loss of life has been reported yet, officials said.Two houses collapsed in the wee hours of Friday morning but no one was injured in Valpoi taluka in North Goa as the occupants abandoned their homes no sooner the water began rising at around 3 am.Chief minister Pramod Sawant inspected the areas which were flooded as a result of incessant rains in various parts of Bicholim taluka, one of the affected taluks. He also directed the officials to provide immediate assistance to people in distress. 23 people in Harvalem in Bicholim were rescued and brought to safety.“For the last eight days, Goa has received a lot of rain especially Sattari, Bicholim, Ponda, Dharbandora, Bardez and Pernem. The state received unprecedented rains. The last we received such rainfall was in 1982 but this time it was even more than that. One woman is feared dead after she drowned in the rising waters. We are still inquiring into the circumstances of her death," Chief Minister Sawant said."As per the present report more than 700 houses are damaged. 832 hectares of standing crop is lost causing a loss of 2.55 crore,” he added.A bridge in Paikul Sattari was washed away cutting the village off from the mainstream while at least three incidents of houses collapsing after being inundated by floodwaters were reported from different parts of Goa.In a related incident, the engine and a passenger coach of the Mangaluru Jn-Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus Express Spl (which was running o­n the diverted route via Madgaon-Londa-Miraj due to overflow of Vashishti River between Chiplun and Kamathe), suffered a derailment between Dudhsagar-Sonaulim section along the steep slope of the western ghats.“No passenger casualty has been reported (no injury/death). The passengers of the affected coach have been shifted to other coaches. The train is being pulled back to Kulem, and has crossed Sonaulim at this time,” the South Western Railway, which operates the line, said in a statement.Roads connecting Goa and North Karnataka have also been cut off due to landslides halting the flow of traffic.The India Meteorological Department, Goa, on Thursday night, warned of “very intense spells of short duration” over parts of Goa including Sattari, Dharbandora, Ponda, Sanguem, Salcette and Quepem. As predicted, the areas received very heavy rainfall with Valpoi in Sattari receiving 296.2 mm of rainfall, Sanguem 213 mm and Sanquelim 178.2 mm, respectively.Several villages in Valpoi, Bicholim, Pernem and Ponda talukas were cut off after the roads leading to the villages got affected.“Due to continuous and heavy rainfall, Mhadei has been overflowing. Water has entered different parts of Valpoi. Our people have faced immense hardship due to continuous and heavy rainfall in Sattari,” health minister Vishwajit Rane, who represents the Valpoi constituency, said.The MeT department has warned of more rainfall for the next five days.“Ghat areas and hilly areas in North and South Goa districts are very likely to receive rainfall exceeding 20 cm in 24 hours. Likelihood of very heavy rainfall (115.6-204.4 mm of rainfall in 24 hours) continues over North and South Goa districts for about three more days with scattered and isolated spatial distributions,” the weather department said in its forecast.Goa has been on a ‘red alert’ for Thursday and Friday and has been alternating between red and orange alerts since Jun 12 when the current spell of continuous heavy spells of rain began. Since June 12, Goa has witnessed heavy rains that are likely to continue for another five days at least.The rains have been further strengthened by a well-marked low-pressure area over Northwest Bay of Bengal off north Odisha-West Bengal coasts which has led to an off-shore trough at mean sea level which now runs from Maharashtra coast to north Kerala coast.“Winds of speed 45-55kmph gusting to 65kmph are very likely along with intense rainfall spells for a short duration are very likely over North and South Goa districts,” the IMD said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/overnight-heavy-rains-flood-goa-villages-cut-off-houses-collapse-101627045447697.html
23-07-2021||Patna||Bihar govt to facilitate self-help groups for transgender persons||The Bihar government is working to facilitate the formation of self-help groups (SHGs) for transgender persons in the state, officials aware of the matter said.Transgender persons interested in starting a trade can get together to form an SHG---the social welfare department is ready to give seed money to the transgender self help group members, they said. In Bihar, there are about 1 million SHGs for women that have been functioning under Jeevika, a World Bank funded poverty alleviation programme, run here since 2007 by the Bihar Rural Livelihood Promotion Society, an autonomous society under the rural development department of the state government. The programme was started to make rural women self-reliant through various kinds of activities, including farming, goat and poultry rearing to makings masks during the pandemic, and has been able to make nearly 12 million women economically independent. Also Read | Minority affairs ministry to counter vaccine hesitancy among communities“Likewise, the social welfare department has planned self help groups for transgender persons also. This way we will be able to provide them financial support. They may sell vegetables or start beauty salons or any other kind of work. The department will give them the seed money for any kind of business,” Rajkumar, director, social welfare department, said. A self-help group of transgender persons who sell vegetables in the state capital was formed last week on an experimental basis, he added. “The department has given them three months’ time to function this way and after that the department will give them seed money to plan something bigge,” he said. The official said that the seed money will be provided by the social welfare department’s transgender welfare board which has a budgetary provision of ₹50 lakh. Reshma, a former member of the transgender welfare board of the department, said that SHGs for transgender persons has been a long-pending programme and transgender persons have been waiting eagerly for this facility. “An SHG is, in fact, a group of persons living in the same geographical area and of almost similar level of income. They form a group and help one another when there is need of financial support. Every month, the group members deposit some amount of money in the group account and if needed, they get loan from this fund,” Reshma said. A group can have minimum 10 members with someone officiating as secretary and another as treasurer to maintain the account register, she added. There are over 40,000 transgender persons in the state as per Census 2011, while in the state capital, there are 2,200.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-to-facilitate-self-help-groups-for-transgender-persons-101627044847739.html
23-07-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: On Jackie’s Farm||A few years ago, I received the following mail in my inbox: “Such a nice piece on Ms Selvaraj and bee farming today. I am working on indigenous seed banks and bee farming and would love to know more about her methods.” Now, receiving mail from readers about a day’s column is not unusual for a city hack. Neither is the fact that someone could be interested in the rarified subject of bee farming. No, what was surprising was the name at the end of the mail. The sender was Jackie Shroff, star of over four decades and 220 films and winner of four Filmfare Awards among other accolades. To understand why it is so unusual to receive an email from an actor on a subject that has nothing to do with his own stardom, one needs to understand a little about how things stack up in the film industry. For the past two decades or so, Bollywood has occupied a huge chunk of public imagination, which many feel is disproportionate to its true worth; and at the very thin edge of its pinnacle, reside its stars — two-dozen-and-a-half or so of men and women, whose every moment is spent under the spotlight of intense adulation, often bordering on worship. Unsurprisingly, as a consequence, most stars (with a few notable exceptions) have a rather exaggerated notion of themselves and their importance, believing that the world turns around their axis. In this scenario, Shroff is not only a star but a legend, in addition to being father to one of the hottest young stars of Bollywood. So, what was he doing writing to a columnist about her report on bee farming, in such an easy, un-starry manner? *************************************** The answer to that is the kind of person Shroff is. As he likes to tell it, he grew up in a Mumbai chawl (it matters not that it was located at Malabar Hill, adjoining the Governor’s Bungalow), the son of humble and loving parents, a young man, roiled in the flavours and piquancies of Mumbai’s gullies and streets. In fact, sightings of Shroff loafing outside the Jehangir Art Gallery or Nepean Sea Road’s Pastry Palace in his characteristic bandanna and open shirt, knotted stylishly at the waist, were a familiar leitmotif of Mumbai’s Swinging Seventies. In many ways you could say Shroff’s life unfolded on Mumbai’s streets. It was at a bus stop at Rampart Row where ad executive Ashok Kurien remembers spotting him and calling him for his first audition that eventually led to his modelling career and then his film break. Photographer Pradeep Chandra, who shot Shroff’s first magazine photo spread, recalls walking with him to his then fiancé Ayesha Shroff’s home at the end of Nepean Sea Road, to borrow something to wear for it. “Jackie hasn’t changed at all,” he says, “We don’t meet often. But when we do, it’s like the old days.” In fact, instances of Shroff’s kindness, decency and humility abound in an industry where few have nice things to say about others, behind their backs. A young relative who did a stint as an AD on one of Shroff’s multi-starrers vouches that from the entire star cast, Shroff stood out for his camaraderie and kindness towards the junior crew. A few years ago, a news report spoke of how faced with a traffic calamity, unmindful of his status, Shroff had jumped out of his car to help others. Leading film critic Rajeev Masand recalls an evening at a glittering soiree at London’s Dorchester, where he observed queues of fans approaching Shroff for selfies. “Encouraged by his kind manner they took further liberties making him speak to their friends and family on FaceTime, but he never got crabby or irritable. I can’t imagine any other movie star obliging a fan in that way,” says Masand. My own observations of Shroff have been similar. Running in to him on Mumbai’s endless carousel of parties and premieres, one got the distinct impression that here was a man of depth and wisdom, one who was a breed apart from his contemporaries. And I’d always make a mental note to someday spend more time getting to know him better. Though of course, given the frantic assembly line rush of our pre-pandemic lives, I also knew that such a day might never come… *************************************** It was the slow pace enforced by the pandemic and curiously once again his response to a column I’d written, that changed all that. Reaching out about a nostalgic piece I’d penned last month, Shroff had texted the simple words: “I miss old Bombay.” “Me too,” I’d responded, and what followed was an invitation for a day’s visit to his farm, on the outskirts of Pune, where he’d spent most of the past year when not shooting or visiting Ayesha and his kids. Nestled between the rolling grasslands of Lonavala and Pune and built in the shape of Shiva’s crescent moon (all curves and undulations to encourage the free flow of wind and energy), a visit to Shroff’s farm is intrinsic to understanding who the man is, away from the arc lights and grease paint. Here, basking in Nature’s glory, surrounded by his beloved fruits, herbs, vegetable and medicinal plants, collected painstakingly over the years, Shroff pursues his nascent passion for the earth and sustainable, healthy living. When he’s not working barefoot on the field alongside local farm hands, to the accompaniment of their favourite radio music, he’s scouring the internet to learn more about the subject. Currently his interests are piqued by Vandana Shiva’s ideas on food sovereignty, biodiversity and bioethics; Japanese farmer Masanobu Fukuoka’s sustainable practices; and the information superhighway conducted by fungi deep within the earth. At Shroff’s farm, practices like permaculture, water harvesting , organic farming and bee keeping are not fashionable catch phrases, but part of the daily routine. And it is here that you are gently afforded a glimpse into Shroff’s soul, not so much through his words, because at the best of times he is a taciturn man, but through his long silences, which he interrupts occasionally to point out a rare bird’s song or a gathering breeze or with periodic reminders to you to breathe deeper, sit straighter and walk taller… Even his living quarters at his farm tell the story of who Shroff really is. Comfortable but certainly not luxurious, his room is filled with the memorabilia of all that sustains his expansive, life-affirming spirit: A handwritten note from Dev Anand about their “spiritual connect”; a cherished photograph of the time his idols Waheeda Rehman and Asha Parekh had visited; and occupying a place of pride, a sepia-tinged framed photograph of the beloved chawl he grew up in at Walkeshwar. “You see,” Shroff says simply, “While growing up, though I hung out with the kids of the drivers and cooks of the neighbourhood during the day, in the evenings, thanks to modelling and films, I would get invited to the drawing rooms of their employers. You learn a lot about life like that…” Prod him a little more about what makes him so different and grounded and humane, and you won’t get more than a shrug. “If everyone thought responsibly about the next generation and planted more trees and was gentler to Mother Earth and her children and practiced sustainable living, the world would be a much better place...” he mumbles. See what I mean about Shroff being a man of depth and wisdom, one who is a breed apart from his contemporaries?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-on-jackie-s-farm-101627044368256.html

During the early morning hours, local residents started removing debris and pulling out bodies. The delayed search and rescue operation angered locals, who said some lives could have been saved if it had started earlier.At least 36 villagers died as the landslide triggered after heavy rain-hit Taliye.Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Girish Mahajan criticised the government over the delay. “The administration and those in the government are citing difficult terrain for the delayed rescue operation. However, if we could reach here from Mumbai hours before the officials, what had stopped them. It has been 20 hours and no earthmoving machinery has reached here,” said Mahajan, who visited the scene.Raigad district guardian minister Aditi Tatkare said the rescuers could start operation only by Friday morning due to heavy rain, low visibility, and difficult terrain. “It took hours for rescuers and administration officials to reach the location. While earthmoving machinery could not be taken there, rescuers started removing debris manually.”In Satara district too, local administration faced difficulties in resuming rescue operations at Ambeghar and Mirgaon, where two landslides were reported. As many as 22 persons were feared trapped there, said Satara police superintendent Ajay Kumar Bansal.“The region is still receiving heavy rain as a result of which it has become difficult to expedite rescue and relief operation.”State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said the BJP leaders are trying to draw political mileage even from a tragedy. “Everyone, including the BJP leaders, know that reaching locations, which have reported landslides, is very difficult. Those who are criticising should rather offer assistance in this difficult situation rather than scoring political points.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-landslides-opposition-hits-out-at-govt-over-delay-in-rescue-ops-101627044127595.html

In her complaint, Kumari has accused Devi and three others of barging into her palace without permission, vandalising the property, misbehaving with her, and threatening to kill her by showing pistols on June 19, added Meena. Meena said they have probed the matter and found the accusation to be true. He added four other accused are absconding.Also Read | Clearing encroachments duty of state, not ours: SCThe accused have been booked under the Indian Penal Code’s Sections 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 294 (obscene language), 506 (criminal intimidation), 458 (house-trespass or housebreaking), and the Arms Act.The family has been involved in a property dispute since 2005. Kumari has insisted half of her property belongs to her daughter, Krishna Raja. Her son Raghvendra Singh has been claiming his father, late Maharaja Manvendra Singh, left a will saying the latter’s daughter will get that part of the property.

Police have arrested five persons on the basis of a complaint lodged by the hospital authorities and the patient was shifted to Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital (MMCH) the same evening. Late on Thursday, 52-year-old Rina Begum was rushed to the Shaktipur BPHC [block primary health centre] with respiratory problems. After a preliminary check-up, the doctor and nurses referred her to MMCH as the BPHC lacked the facility to handle her case. “The patient had chronic respiratory problems. Her oxygen saturation level had dropped below 80 and she had a high blood pressure. A BPHC is not equipped to treat such a patient...But some of her family members, who were in inebriated state, attacked the hospital staff,” said Prasanta Biswas, chief medical officer of health of Murshidabad district. A nurse who sustained injuries in her abdomen said though the patient was referred to a district medical college, her family demanded that she be treated at the BPHC as her condition was deteriorating. “I was hit in my abdomen. I had recently undergone a Caesarean delivery and there are stitches. The mob also attacked another nurse and doctor and vandalised the furniture,” said nurse Radharani Dey. The patient’s family said it would be difficult to shift her at night as the district medical college was around 35 -40km away. “When we reached the hospital, the patient’s condition was critical. We demanded that she be treated, and we would shift her to the medical college next morning. But the hospital staff pressured us to shift her at night itself. We never got the treatment and now police have arrested five of our relatives,” said Torabuddin Sheikh, a relative of the patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/doctor-2-nurses-assaulted-by-patient-s-family-in-bengal-s-murshidabad-5-held-101627043168341.html

A letter issued by Varanasi police commissioner A Satish Ganesh to VIP president-cum-animal husbandry minister of Bihar, Mukesh Sahni, cited the order issued by the UP government in 2008 whereby “a top-level permission” is required to establish the statue of any religious, political, or statesman, even on private lands. “You are organizing a programme in violation of the order which is objectionable,” the letter stated. It further said that the programme violates Covid-19 protocols and people have objected to the installation of the statue near Sujabad Shiv temple in Varanasi. People privy to the development in the VIP said that the SDM Varanasi had permitted to hold the programme by following Covid-19 norms and the party had sent detailed information to the UP-chief secretary about the programmes.“This is not right. The situation could have been avoided. But this doesn’t deter us from installing the statues for which we will proceed as per the rules of the state. In UP, the BJP government is in power, and we are friends in Bihar,” said Mukesh Sahni, hinting not to enter into confrontation with the UP government. The minister said that the programmes in UP will be held as per schedule but now there won’t be any public meeting.“Phoolan Devi is still alive in our thoughts for her struggles for the pride and prestige of mothers and sisters. We are celebrating July 25 as her martyrdom day from Bihar to UP and for this, we are going to install 18 idols of Phoolan Devi in UP and some in Bihar,” said Sahni, explaining the context of the exercise.The VIP, led by Bihar’s animal husbandry minister Mukesh Sahni, has got 18 such statues of 18-feet height built.With an eye on capturing votes of the Nishad community in the run-up to the UP assembly election in 2022, the VIP decided to install the statue of late MP Phoolan Devi in 18 divisions of Uttar Pradesh.Late Phoolan Devi’s bandit faction mostly comprised members from the Mallah community. The Mallahs (boatmen) caste, popularly known as Nishads, and other sub-castes in the Other Backward Communities (OBC) in UP constitute 14% of the state’s population.Bandit-turned-politician, Phoolan Devi was also popular as a female rights activist who took to a life of crime and banditry after enduring poverty, child marriage, subjugation and abusive marriage. She was convicted on multiple charges but was later released in 1994 as then ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, led by former chief minister Mulayam Singh, withdrew all charges against her. She contested the Lok Sabha polls on SP ticket and was elected an MP twice from Mirzapur. She was assassinated on July 25, 2001.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jolt-to-vip-as-up-police-refuse-to-allow-installation-of-phoolan-s-devi-s-statue-101627042629519.html

The BJP MLA filed the writ petition on Thursday seeking transfer of the criminal cases against him to the CBI for an "impartial investigation". Alleging that he is being subjected to "political vendetta" since he is an opposition party leader and the cases were registered against him with "false claims", Adhikari also sought an order of the high court directing quashing of the FIRs against him.The state police and its Criminal Investigation Department (CID) are probing a number of cases that relate to Adhikari. Amid the nationwide row over alleged snooping activities with Pegasus spyware, the BJP leader stoked a controversy when he said that he got access to call details of Purba Medinipur district SP Amarnath K, prompting the police on Tuesday to file suo motu cases against him.Adhikari, during a party meeting in the district's Tamluk area on Monday, had also publicly advised the local police chief to "refrain from doing anything that might lead to his transfer to Kashmir". The Nandigram MLA narrowly defeated Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in assembly elections held earlier this year.The district police is also probing a case of alleged pilferage of relief material in Purba Medinipur. The state CID is investigating an unnatural death of a police constable, who was part of Adhikari's security team three years ago when he was a minister in the previous TMC government.A case of murder was instituted recently on the basis of a complaint of the constable's widow and the probe was handed over to the CID by the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/suvendu-adhikari-files-petition-calcutta-hc-to-transfer-criminal-cases-to-cbi-101627038195066.html
23-07-2021||Delhi||DDMA seeks Centre’s help for protocols on inter-state travel curbs||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has sought the Centre’s help in chalking out protocols for appropriate restrictions on inter-state travel, citing the spread of the Delta plus variant of Covid-19 in some states and the high positivity rate in the country’s North-East. The issue was taken up at DDMA’s meeting on July 9. The records of the meeting were finalised on July 20 and HT has seen the related documents.Niti Aayog member (health) V K Paul, who attended the meeting, suggested the Delhi government consult the Centre before imposing restrictions on inter-state travel, according to the records. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, the chairperson of DDMA, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the vice-chairperson of DDMA, and chief secretary Vijay Dev, the executive head of the DDMA, also attended the meeting.According to the documents, Dev referred to reports of detection of the Delta plus variant in at least 12 states. The states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, and Haryana.Dev also highlighted the high-positivity rate in the eight North-East states. Most states in the region are under a hard lockdown or strict curfew restrictions. Among districts in India currently recording a positivity rate higher than 10%, nine are in Manipur, five each in Meghalaya and Mizoram, three each in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Sikkim, two in Tripura and one in Assam.“Delhi, being (the) capital of the country, is visited by people from all across India. In view of this, the guidance of experts is needed on what kind of measures are needed in Delhi to prevent the spread of Delta Plus variant cases. He (Dev) recalled that some restrictive measures were imposed in Delhi such as carrying of negative RT-PCR reports for the people coming from Andhra (Pradesh), Telangana and Maharashtra,” said one of the documents.The positivity rate in Delhi currently is less than 0.10% compared to 36% on April 22.The documents said Baijal suggested that an advisory by the Union health ministry will be appropriate.“...Paul suggested that the advice of the government of India should be taken before imposing any restrictions on the movement of inter-state travel as Delhi being capital of the country,” said the minutes of the meeting.Balram Bhargava, the director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Samiran Panda, a scientist at ICMR, Randeep Guleria, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Sujit Kumar Singh of National Centre for Disease Control and Krishna Vatsa, member of National Disaster Management Authority also attended the meeting.Currently, there are no restrictions on inter-state travel to, from, and through Delhi. For brief periods, conditions such as mandatory negative RT-PCR test reports were imposed for arrivals from some states such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra.

This survey covered the general population above 6 years of age and health care workers working in district hospitals of these districts. “This fourth round is significant due to widespread infection during the second wave and the vaccination drive this year,” he said.Sero prevalence was also very high in fully vaccinated people at 89.8% against 62.3% among the unvaccinated subjects.In Pulwama, the survey was conducted through the Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar with support from district administration and health experts of the district . “Some 430 blood samples were collected from designated 10 clusters besides 106 samples from healthcare providers,” said Khan.Of the 320,340 Covid cases in the 20 districts of Jammu and Kashmir,15,120 were recorded in Pulwama. The district also recorded 194 Covid deaths of the total 4,373 in the Union territory till July 22.A similar study is underway across the ten districts of Kashmir where samples are being taken from children, adults and pregnant women among general population, healthcare providers and police personnel to ascertain sero prevalence.“We are expecting results of the district-wise study in 3-4 weeks which will guide the policymakers in Covid management and protocols,” said Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4th-sero-survey-shows-61-2-pulwama-population-has-covid-antibodies-101627038427084.html

23-07-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Stamping around the world to get to the Olympics||So Wednesday morning at breakfast, we were playing Atlas. The kids play Atlas quite often - usually at meal times - and it’s a great way to train memory and learn about the world in an enjoyable manner. We join in from time to time.It’s a pretty straightforward game: one player starts with the name of a country or city and the next player names another country starting with the last letter of the previous country name. So, if I begin with ‘Denmark’, the next player has to name a place starting with ‘K’. We usually allow names of continents, oceans, rivers and states as well (on days when the game goes long, we debate whether to allow district and village names). As the game progresses it gets pretty intense since one cannot repeat any place name … and conversations do get heated with frequent aspersions cast on made-up place names.And so it was on Wednesday that I came up with Umm Al Quwain and everyone immediately pounced, wondering if there was such a place. Thankfully I had proof handy: stamps from Umm Al Quwain, one of the emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The stamps featured winners of events from the 1972 Winter Olympics.Soon enough there was uproar over Liechtenstein and then Brunei. And sure enough, I had stamps from both these countries (that’s how I had learnt about them in the first place). Three new names in a row piqued the curiosity of the kids and thus it transpired that we spent Wednesday evening reviewing my stamp collection and finding answers to questions like:“Where is Suriname?”“What is a stamp?”“So Andorra is a country? And not Pandora’s cousin?!”“What is a letter?”“So when you were growing up did pigeons carry your messages?”“Are there any triangle stamps? What about circle-shaped stamps?”“Has the Olympics been held in Japan before?”I started collecting stamps when I was around 7-years old. I found the coloured bits of paper on envelopes fascinating and used to cut out the stamps and keep them in a paper envelope. The information on the stamps was enough to drive my imagination and spur me onto long quests of discovery. Before long, I found that Mrs Bhosale - our neighbour - had family in foreign lands and that they wrote her letters frequently. Never a shy kid when it came to matters of my interest, I asked the question and that’s how I acquired my first 50 foreign stamps - from Bhosale aunty’s letters. It wasn’t long before I discovered that many other neighbours had family overseas and their polite offering of “you can have them if you want”, was invariably rewarded with me sitting in their living room cutting out stamps from their envelopes. My collection grew exponentially, as did my understanding of the world and the many wonders in it. Leaders, inventions, world organisations, important historic events, languages, people, farming techniques, science, art, wildlife, sports… stamps introduced me to it all. In fact, I first heard of the Olympics from a series of stamps from San Marino. (It was soon after that my father bought me a book on the Olympics published by the National Book Trust).And so on Wednesday we flipped through the collection and learnt that Japan had hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics (in Tokyo) and the 1972 Winter Olympics (in Sapporo). With a little bit of reading up, we discovered that Japan had also hosted the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.Of course today (July 23, 2021), is the scheduled opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, an event that we as a family are looking forward to. We have keen interest in a wide spectrum of sports from equestrian events and swimming to athletics, archery, gymnastics, shooting, basketball, tennis, wrestling, badminton, table tennis, and fencing among others.Swimming is the big draw for us, given that we have two champion (school and club level) swimmers in the family and two budding swimmers. I am the only one who is an embarrassment in the pool, but I make up for that with my certificates and trophies in soccer, table tennis and athletics. None of us are gymnasts, but we love rooting for all participants. India has a large contingent at the Games this year and I’m looking forward to the competitions.It’s a pity we can’t be cavalier and out and about during Olympics, due to the pandemic. Historically, people play more sports and take part in more physical activity during global sporting events. We have factored in work and school commitments and planned all our free time around the Tokyo Olympics for the next three weeks. It also seems likely that we will be snorkelling through our coin collection and exploring further the stamp albums and first-day covers in a bid to unearth more tidbits of intriguing historical information about the world we live in.Am quite sure we will also have our own championship of Atlas to address the competitive spirit in all of us.PS: With regards to Atlas, the trick is to trap your opponents into a cycle of place names starting with ‘A’. Why? Because most place names starting with ‘A’ also end with ‘A’ and unless you know the world Atlas really well, it becomes a pressure point to find yet another place name starting with ‘A’!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-stamping-around-the-world-to-get-to-the-olympics-101627037287953.html
23-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi approves process for tenders for around 400 e-buses||The Delhi transport department has approved the process for tenders for around 400 e-buses to be included in the city’s fleet of buses by the year-end, an official said on Friday. “The tender is likely to be floated next week. Delhi has 300 e-buses,” said an official.The government plans to have 1,000 such buses in the city by mid-2022. It is part of a plan of the Aam Aadmi Party government to add 4,000 buses to the city’s fleet by the end of that year. The overall plan includes standard floor and low floor buses -- both air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned.All these buses are supposed to comply with BS-VI emission standards and to be equipped with GPS devices, CCTV cameras, and panic buttons for enhancing the security of women commuters. The government has also set up a control room in Kashmere Gate for real-time tracking of its fleet.The plan to procure e-buses is in line with the government’s electric vehicle (EV) policy notified in August last year. The EV policy says that 25% of all registered vehicles in Delhi by 2023 will be electric. It is part of the government’s long-term action plan against air pollution. The Centre also notified a similar scheme in 2019.“With the proposed 400 new e-buses, Delhi is also likely to become the city with the largest fleet of e-buses. Currently, Pune has 600 e-buses,” said the official. Delhi has around 7,000 total buses in its public bus fleet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-approves-process-for-tenders-for-around-400-ebuses-101627035306907.html

23-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Tilak Nagar market shut down over Covid-19 protocol violations||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has directed that the market in West Delhi’s Tilak Nagar be temporarily closed from Friday till at least Tuesday due to alleged violation of Covid-19 regulations.It has also ordered the revenue department to survey the market area for encroachment by permanent shop owners as well as unauthorised street vendors, said an order issued by the DDMA on Thursday night, a copy of which HT has seen.In the last three weeks, at least 20 markets in the city have faced similar crackdowns. They include large parts of Sadar Bazar, Laxmi Nagar market, Lajpat Nagar Central Market, Gaffar Market in Karol Bagh and several local markets in areas such as Madangir, Rohini and Nangloi.Also Read | Bizman, friend found murdered in Delhi; 3 suspects in custody, probe onA lockdown was announced in Delhi from April 19, imposed due to an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases, which left the city’s healthcare system overburdened. As cases started to decline, DDMA started a phased relaxation process from May 31 and allowed markets to open from mid-June, subject to strict Covid-19 regulations concerning social distancing, mask compliance, etc.“Amid a possibility of a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and considering gross violation of health protocols under Covid-19-appropriate behaviour in the market.... I do hereby order closure / shutting of Tilak Nagar market, comprising of Mall Road, Main Market, Mangal Bazar Road, Old Market and Fruit Market area with effect from July 23 to July 27,” said the order signed by the sub-divisional magistrate concerned.DDMA, in its order, cited inputs from enforcement teams and senior revenue department officers visiting the market who noticed violations of Covid-19 norms on at least four occasions on July 7, 10, 17 and 22.Kapil Gandhi, president of New Market Welfare Association Tilak Nagar, said: “There are encroachment issues in the market. We need better coordination from the authorities instead of such crackdowns.”“In the last few weeks, several markets have faced such temporary suspension orders. It is unfair to put the entire burden of Covid-19 regulations on market welfare bodies. Local agencies and authorities too have responsibilities in this regard. We will meet the chief secretary soon to discuss the issue,” said Brijesh Goyal, president of chamber of trade and industry, a collective of market and trader welfare bodies based in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-tilak-nagar-market-to-be-temporarily-closed-due-to-violation-of-covid-norms-101627032487601.html

According to district administration, an almost equal number of people is still feared strapped under the debris. Meanwhile, around 22 persons are feared trapped in two landslides in Satara’s Patan tehsil, which received 300mm rainfall in 24 hours. A team of rescuers comprising locals and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) pulled out bodies from the debris manually as heavy rain and difficult terrain make it difficult for earth-moving machinery to reach the spot at Taliye in Mahad tehsil. According to state relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, villagers were alerted and moved to safer locations in anticipation of heavy rain, as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert. “We had relocated residents of Taliye few days ago to a safer location considering the risky terrain. However the locals moved back to the same place just before the landslide,” said Wadettiwar. Also Read | Flood in Maharashtra’s Chiplun: Water starts receding, rescue ops continueAccording to Raigad district collector Nidhi Choudhari, around 10 persons survived with moderate injuries as they quickly tried to escape when the landslide began. “Based on the information from locals and survivors, we can say almost 30-35 people are still feared trapped. We have pressed more rescuers into service to search people trapped under the debris,” said Choudhari. While the landslide occurred on Thursday evening, rescue operations started only by Friday morning due to visibility issues, said Raigad district guardian minister Aditi Tatkare. Earlier in the afternoon, Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray termed the Taliye and other landslide incidents in Maharashtra as unfortunate and asked people to move to safer locations. “The Taliye incident is unfortunate... There are landslides reports in other parts of the state and my appeal to everyone is to stay safe. Those living in risky terrain should move to safer places.” said Thackeray. In Satara, landslides were reported at Ambeghar and Mirgaon villages which witnessed heavy rain in the past 24 hours. Satara superintendent of police Ajay Kumar Bansal said that the two incidents took place sometime during Thursday night. He added that the local rescue teams have reached both spots and the rescue work is underway and some people have been rescued. “At Ambeghar, four houses were buried under soil following a landslide and there are 13 to 14 people are feared trapped, while in Mirgaon, three houses were buried and 8 to 10 people are feared trapped,” said Bansal. He added that due to continuous rain, the roads leading to these places are either blocked or inundated and big earth-moving machinery cannot reach these areas to aid in rescue work. Patan, along with neighbouring Mahabaleshwar, received record rainfall on Thursday. According to India Metereological Department, Mahabaleshwar recorded 600mm rainfall within 24 hours ending Friday morning. This is the highest rainfall reported at the hill station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-least-30-killed-in-landslide-in-maharashra-s-talie-village-101627030146225.html
23-07-2021||Delhi||#CraftTales: SRCC students help revive dying arts in the pandemic||Throughout the pandemic, there have been several talks of how Covid-19 crippled India’s economy, and especially the artisans who have struggled to make ends meet. Many are trying to help those who keep the dying arts alive. Among them is a group of Delhi University students, from Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), who have launched an e-commerce platform for artisans. “During the coronavirus pandemic, we were aware of the hardships faced by artisans, as they were unable to sell their crafts. We wished to do something for them, that’s when we realised the need to set up an online platform,” says Taruni Singhal, a B Com (Hons) final year student, and the project director. She says this initiative was under Project Virasat, as members of Enactus SRCC society tried to revive the Indian handicrafts. “Virasat is an umbrella organisation for craft cluster development. We have been working towards alleviating the problems faced by craftspersons, and are creating opportunities not only for the existing artisans but also for their future generations, so that they can safely carry on with the legacy.” The youngsters identified two dying craft forms – Usta Kala from Bikaner, Rajasthan and the Gaurahari stonework from Mahoba, Uttar Pradesh. “We could barely find any information on these art forms on the internet, and on further research we realised that barely a handful of people practise them now. Earlier, an entire village was practising Gaurahari stonework, but now only 2-3 families are pursuing it. So, we included these art forms under Virasat, and now we have almost 40 artisans as part of this initiative. We also handhold them through the design process, with help of a few design students,” informs Agrim Jain, a B Com (Hons) student and co-director of the project, adding, “Through the website, the artisans have received over a dozen orders in the last few days.” The artisans involved in the project are relieved that the new website will help them revive their craft. “The biggest problem we were facing is that our craft isn’t getting the right platform to excel. Many among the new generation does not want to pick up our art, aur paise kum hone ki wajah se hum isko achche se alag alag sheheron me bechne ke liye le ja bhi nahi paate. Par in college ke bachchon se milke ab aisa lagta hai ki humari kala ko bhi samman milega, dekh videsh mein,” says Mohsin, an Usta Kala artisan from Bikaner.

Raj Kundra and Thorpe were produced before a magistrate's court in Mumbai by the police, ANI added. Mumbai Police said in the court that they suspect that the money earned from pornography was used for online betting, the news agency said.

23-07-2021||Other||HC releases Manipur journalist booked under NSA over FB post||The Manipur high court on Friday ordered the release of journalist Kishorechandra Wangkhem who has been in jail since May under provisions of the stringent National Security Act (NSA) for a Facebook post saying cow dung and urine cannot cure Covid-19. NSA allows for detention without trial for up to two years.Based on a letter petition by Wangkhem’s wife Elangbam Ranjita, a bench of Chief Justice PV Sanjay and Justice Kh Nobin Singh suspended the NSA order issued by the Manipur government on May 17 till the next date of hearing on August 24 and directed the journalist’s release before 5 pm on Friday. Wangkhem’s release comes four days after political activist Erendro Leichombam, who was also arrested under NSA for a similar post on Facebook, was released from an Imphal jail on directions of the Supreme Court. “We find no distinction or difference between the case of the petitioner’s husband and that of Erendro Leichombam. Both of them put up similar Facebook posts, critical of the utility of cow dung and cow urine in treating the coronavirus,” the order read. “As they stand identically situated, we are of the opinion that the continued incarceration of the petitioner’s husband would be as much a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, as it was in the case of Erendoro Leichombam,” it added. The article deals with the right to life and personal liberty. Following the court’s order, Wangkhem, who was lodged at the central jail in Sajiwa was released at 4:20 pm on a personal release bond of ₹1000, his lawyer Victor Chongtham confirmed. “I have mixed feelings. I am happy for my release but concerned at the way laws like sedition and NSA are being abused by those in power. This was the second time I was arrested under NSA and may not be the last as I am not going to stop raising my voice,” Wangkhem said over phone after his release. “I may approach the court seeking compensation for my illegal detention so that governments think twice before imprisoning others incorrectly. I will continue to fight against abuse of power and draconian laws like sedition and NSA,” he added.

When my mother asked me to enter politics, his (Sidhu’s) father helped me. I used to go to his house when he was about six years old.”Padding up for a challenging innings in his political career, the cricketer-turned-politician said he will have love for juniors and respect for elders. “Punjab will win, Punjabis will win,” he said. The chief minister took the opportunity to highlight the Punjab pride and the Congress government’s achievements. “The state emerged number one in the fight against Covid and was rated first in primary education besides making the biggest contribution to the country’s food bowl,” he said.Congress revival through Punjab: JakharIn his address, the outgoing state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said: “We were hit by red tapism in our government. Our workers suffered due to that, but still we have time. We can course correct even now.”Looking at All India Congress Committee general secretary and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat, Jakhar said: “Rawat ji please tell (Congress interim president) Sonia (Gandhi) ji that revival of the Congress goes through Punjab.”On his part, Rawat urged all leaders to work unitedly and ensure the party’s win in the assembly elections. Former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal besides senior leaders Partap Singh Bajwa and Lal Singh were also present.Capt, Sidhu met after four monthsEarlier in the morning, Sidhu and Capt Amarinder Singh met for the first time in four months since tensions between them flared up in April after the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed a probe report on the 2015 Kotkapura police firing incident. Sidhu attacked the chief minister through his tweets over the alleged delay in justice in the 2015 sacrilege and subsequent police firing incidents.Sidhu had resigned as a state minister in 2019 after he was divested of the local bodies portfolio.He had switched sides from the BJP to the Congress before the 2017 state assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-takes-charge-as-punjab-congress-captain-101627026786090.html

23-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai's 'dabbawalas', hit by Covid-19, tie up with restaurant chain to survive||After the pandemic shut offices and put Mumbai's renowned lunchbox deliverymen out of work, the 130-year-old "dabbawala" network has tied up with a trendy restaurant chain to take on India's billion-dollar start-ups.For two decades, neither terror attacks nor monsoon deluges could stop Kailash Shinde from delivering hot lunches to Mumbai office workers, until lockdowns put the father-of-two on a forced hiatus for a whole year."It's been very difficult," the 42-year-old said. "I had to sell what I could and work odd jobs to get by."Instantly recognisable in his traditional Gandhi cap and white Indian attire, Shinde is one of 5,000 dabbawalas -- or "lunchbox men" in Hindi -- who have gained global recognition for delivering home-cooked food with clockwork precision.An intricate system of alphanumeric codes helps the largely semi-literate or illiterate workforce collect, sort, and distribute 200,000 meals across Mumbai each day via bicycles, hand carts, and a sprawling local train network.Their work has been studied as a "model of service excellence" at Harvard Business School, and inspired personal visits from Richard Branson, Prince Charles, and executives from global delivery giants FedEx and Amazon, among others.But with extended lockdowns forcing millions of Mumbai's white-collar professionals to work from home, many dabbawalas have been struggling to feed their own families since April last year."Our members have had to work as security guards and labourers, in addition to seeking jobs as deliverymen for restaurants," said Ulhas Muke of the Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Charity Trust, which represents the workforce.'Mumbai's original deliverymen'But delivery jobs are harder to come by in a space now increasingly dominated by mobile apps, especially for people like 39-year-old Pandurang Jadhav, who can't read or write.Unemployed for the first time since becoming a dabbawala aged 17, Jadhav moved to his ancestral village and spent the last year farming rice.The earnings were meager and he desperately missed Mumbai, where he managed 30 men."I used to love working as a dabbawala," he told AFP, describing it as "the best job".Help arrived this May in the form of a tie-up with some of Mumbai's most popular eateries, allowing Jadhav and 30 others to return to work.Instead of handling home-cooked meals packed in stainless steel tiffin boxes, he is now delivering restaurant staples from nachos to spaghetti carbonara to time-starved professionals as they continue working from home for a second year.The scheme offers restaurateurs an alternative to the prevailing local duopoly of delivery giants Zomato and Swiggy, whose steep discounts and razor-thin margins have slashed their profits."We are trying to find a way out of the tyranny of the aggregators," said Riyaaz Amlani, the owner of Impresario Restaurants, which operates 57 outlets across more than a dozen Indian cities."Of course we want to help the dabbawalas. They are the original deliverymen of Mumbai," he told AFP.A new beginningAmlani plans to expand his partnership with the dabbawalas, but analysts say that alone may not be enough to help the famed deliverymen survive the pandemic."It is paramount for them to be flexible at this point," said Sreedevi R, an assistant professor at Mumbai's SP Jain Institute of Management and Research."The dabbawalas could become delivery agents for last-mile delivery not just for restaurants but also for any e-commerce business," she told AFP.But a lack of literacy means many of them are reluctant to take on work that requires tech-savvy skills.Muke, of the dabbawala representative group, is instead finalising plans to set up a commercial kitchen of their own, delivering inexpensive meals across Mumbai.He has already secured millions of dollars in donations, including a hefty $2 million contribution from banking giant HSBC, with the kitchen due to open in the next few weeks."My grandfather was a dabbawala, and then my uncle and now I am," Muke said."This is the work that I like doing. I want to keep delivering food to people."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-dabbawalas-hit-by-covid-19-tie-up-with-restaurant-chain-to-survive-101627013613038.html

Capt Amarinder Singh had invited all Punjab Congress MLAs and MPs for tea at Punjab Bhawan at 10am, an hour before the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee new team, led by Sidhu takes charge. Also read: 3 Congress workers headed for Sidhu’s coronation killed in bus accidentThe CM’s invite came on Thursday afternoon soon after Sidhu reached out to a miffed Capt Amarinder Singh through two working presidents Kuljit Singh Nagra and Sangat Singh Gilzian. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat kept a close watch as Capt Amarinder Singh and Sidhu broke the ice and seemingly buried the hatchet. The masks were off as Sidhu, in his trademark maroon Pathani suit with a coordinated scarf, chatted cordially with Capt Amarinder Singh, attired in his simple, white kurta-churidar set as Rawat looked on but chose to keep his mask on. Sidhu’s usual flamboyance was muted as he greeted the chief minister with folded hands longer than usual till Rawat led them both to the table for breakfast and tea. It may be recalled that Capt Amarinder Singh had said that he will not meet Sidhu “till he publicly apologises for his personally derogatory social media attacks against him”. Sidhu left the venue for a few minutes and returned with outgoing Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar. Though Sidhu had reached Punjab Bhawan in Sector 2, Chandigarh, much before the chief minister arrived, he was in his room doing “ardas (praying)” and joined the CM when he received the message of his arrival. The two were together for more than half an hour before Sidhu left for the Punjab Congress Bhawan in Sector 15 in Chandigarh for the installation ceremony followed by the chief minister and other MLAs, who were all ears and smiles as their leaders interacted warmly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-bonds-with-capt-over-tea-before-taking-charge-as-punjab-congress-captain-101627020485509.html

As her village does not have mobile phone connectivity, she shifted to Rayagada town, 40km away, and rented a house along with a couple of her friends to attend her BA first year class online.“I missed an entire year’s class last year as I did not have a mobile phone. We don’t own a house or farmland,” said Nisika over the phone.Also Read | Three die inside newly constructed septic tank in Odisha’s Ganjam“Though my widowed mother and older sister don’t earn enough by working in others’ fields, this year they somehow managed to buy me a phone and arrange money so that I can pay room rent in Rayagada town.”After completing her Class 12 from Bhubaneswar’s Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS), last year, Nisika enrolled for BA in the same institute. Nisika had joined KISS when she was in Class 3 and has stayed in the hostel since then. Though she hoped to rejoin her BA classes, the announcement of a nationwide lockdown put paid to her hopes.Her college then started online classes during lockdown. With no books and no mobile phone, she could not attend online classes and almost dropped out till her teachers called up her uncle in May to ask why she was not attending classes.“My college teacher told my uncle that I would end up having arrears if I don’t appear for the semester exams. For a few days, I borrowed my cousins’ mobile phones, but it was very inconvenient. I could write the exams last month after my friends helped me with notes,” she said.Once she completes her BA, Nisika will be the first graduate from her village.Rayagada district collector Saroj Mishra said the administration will try to help her. “Mobile phone connectivity is a major issue in most of the tribal districts of the state, including Rayagada,” he said.Since July last year, all schools and colleges in Odisha have been conducting online classes for their students through Google Meet, Zoom, Skype, Whatsapp and other digital platforms. But with 20% of the state’s 51,311 villages without mobile phone connectivity, many school and college students like Nisika have been deprived of education since last year. Odisha school and mass education minister Samir Ranjan Dash recently admitted that of the 600,000 school students, the state government could hardly reach 220,000 children last year. As per the report by the school and mass education department, the number of children who attend online classes through a smartphone was 31.95%. At least 80% of the parents of these children in Malkangiri, Kandhamal, Nabarangpur, Rayagada and Deogarh districts did not have a smartphone before.The state government has now decided to start offline classes for classes 10 and 12 from July 26 due to problems in online education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tribal-girl-family-toil-on-others-farmlands-to-buy-smartphone-for-online-classes-101627017605502.html

The conference will be organised at a resort.The Ayodhya conference signals the BSP’s plan to replay the social engineering formula (Dalit-Brahmin alliance) that brought it to power in the 2007 assembly elections.Ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, the party plans to organise a series of Brahmin conferences across the state.The BSP has decided to project Khushi Dubey, the wife of Amar Dubey (an associate of Bikru case-accused Vikas Dubey), as a symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s alleged atrocities on the Brahmin community. Also Read | Parties scramble for support of Brahmins ahead of 2022 polls in Uttar PradeshEight policemen were killed in an ambush during a raid on Vikas Dubey’s house at Bikru village in Kanpur on July 2-3 night last year. A few days later, Vikas Dubey and Amar Dubey were killed in a police encounter. Khushi Dubey has been lodged in a Barabanki shelter home since July 8 last year. Her family said that she was not involved in the attack on the police personnel, yet the state government put her behind bars. She had married Amar Dubey just a few days before the Bikru incident, they said.BSP’s Satish Chandra Mishra said, “I met Kushi Dubey’s family. I have assured them all assistance in fighting the case for her release in court. Under the BJP government, there has been a spurt in atrocities on Brahmin and Dalit communities.”Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh also demanded the release of Khushi Dubey. BJP MLC Umesh Dewedi also wrote to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, demanding her release from jail. The BSP has put up hoardings and banners in Ayodhya, inviting people to participate in the conference while following Covid protocols. The party has named the conference Prabudh Varg Vichar Goshti (intellectual community meeting).“The Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court, on July 11, 2013, imposed a ban on caste-based rallies in Uttar Pradesh. In view of the court order, the name of the conference has been changed to intellectual community conference,” said a BSP leader.Brahmin conferences will also be organised in the BSP stronghold Ambedkar Nagar on July 25, in Prayagraj on July 26, Kaushambi on July 27, Pratapgarh on July 28 and Sultanpur on July 29.Announcing the launch of the Brahmin conferences on July 18, BSP chief Mayawati said, “The Brahmin community supported and tried the BJP for five years… They should support the BSP for their security, dignity and progress in the coming assembly elections.”The BSP chief said despite her party’s defeat in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections, there had been no decline in the BSP vote percentage.“Thenumber of seats of the BSP declined but its vote share is higher than the Samajwadi Party’s,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-assembly-elections-2022-bsp-to-begin-poll-prep-with-brahmin-meet-today-101627014424924.html

The design of the string used in such drones to drop the payload and “threads” recovered from the crater caused by the explosion at the Indian Air Force (IAF) station in Jammu on June 27 are the same, they added.“We have recovered the same threads and it is now confirmed that a similar drone had dropped the payload at IAF station,” said Mukesh Singh, an additional director general of Jammu and Kashmir police.The June 27 attack, which left two personnel injured, was the first such instance of suspected Pakistan-based terrorists deploying unmanned aerial vehicles to strike at vital installations in India. The National Investigation Agency is investigating the case. Drones have been repeatedly spotted in the region since June 27.Also Read | JKCC demands probe by SC judge into snooping row“Thursday night, we got specific inputs of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad dropping some payload via a drone in Akhnoor sector. We acted swiftly upon the input and laid an ambush. Around 1 am, a police team shot down a drone, well packed with five kg IED, which was almost ready to be used,” said Singh. He added only a wire had to be connected to detonate it. “Preliminary analysis of the drone revealed that it was a hexacopter with six wings and a flight controller and GPS.”Singh said there is a difference of a digit between the flight controller serial number of the drone shot down on Friday and that of another brought down a year ago in Kathua’s Hiranagar sector. “It establishes beyond doubt that the terror group has procured many flight controllers with similar series for the purpose of installing them in drones.”On June 20 last year, the Border Security Force shot down a Pakistani hexacopter carrying a cache of arms and ammunition in Hiranagar.Singh said the drone shot down in Kanachak was assembled with parts made in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. He added these drones can travel up to 20 kilometres with a payload of 10 to 12 kg. The aerial distance between the place where the drone was shot down and the border is about six to seven kilometres.Security forces have fired at several drones since June 27, but this is the first time that police have shot down such a flying object carrying a payload. There have been several incidents of Pakistan-based terrorists using drones in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir to drop arms, ammunition, drugs, and money to fuel terrorism in the region. Over 325 drones have been sighted along the border with Pakistan since 2019.On Wednesday, after four days, suspected drones were spotted again hovering over the Jammu airport near the IAF station. At least four drones were spotted hovering over military installations in Jammu, Samba, and Kathua between 7.10pm and 8.45pm five days earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jkpolice-shoot-down-drone-carrying-ied-near-jammu-101627012324719.html

Chief minister Amarinder Singh will attend the "installation ceremony" along with other party leaders, news agencies reported, signalling a truce within the dissension-riven party.Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday appointed Sidhu as the new chief of the party's Punjab unit, despite strong opposition from chief minister Amarinder Singh. She also appointed four working presidents -- Sangat Singh Gilzian, Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Pawan Goel, and Kuljit Singh Nagra -- to assist Sidhu in the run-up to the Punjab assembly elections scheduled to be held next year.Also Read | Sidhu shown black flags by farmers protesting against farm laws in PunjabNavjot Singh Sidhu, in a separate letter, requested Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to "come and bless the new [Congress] team".

"Thus as the eldest of our Punjab Congress family, I request you to please come and bless the new team."Sidhu and Amarinder Singh have been at loggerheads for some time, with the cricketer-turned-politician recently attacking the chief minister over desecration cases in the state. Much of the tension between the two politicians flared earlier this year in April when the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashed a probe report into the 2015 Kotkapura police firing incident.Sidhu, who joined the Congress after leaving the BJP before the 2017 assembly polls, attacked the chief minister through his tweets over the issue of alleged delay in justice in the 2015 sacrilege and subsequent police firing incidents. The Amritsar legislator later resigned as the minister in 2019 after he was divested of his local bodies portfolio.Although Amarinder Singh earlier demanded an apology from Sidhu over what he called "derogatory" tweets, the 62 Congress legislators who gathered at the cricketer-turned-politician's residence this Wednesday in a show of strength said that there was no need to tender an apology as the party stands "united".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-to-take-charge-as-punjab-congress-chief-today-cm-amarinder-to-attend-ceremony-101626998777217.html

The move came after Sidhu, in an apparent bid to bury the differences with the CM, wrote a letter on Thursday requesting Amarinder to come for the installation ceremony. “I have no personal agenda. My resolve and commitment on Punjab’s issues and fulfilling high command’s pro-people 18-point agenda for the welfare of every Punjabi is well-known to you and all,” Sidhu said. “Thus, as the eldest of our Punjab Congress family, I request you to please come and bless the new team,” wrote Sidhu.

The invitation letter was signed by over 55 legislators. “The 30-minute meeting was very cordial and the CM promptly accepted the invitation. It’s a party function and all are attending,” Nagra said. Sidhu and Capt Amarinder Singh have been at loggerheads for the past few months, with the Amritsar East MLA attacking the CM over the desecration cases. The chief minister also opposed his appointment as the state Congress chief and had said he won’t meet Sidhu until the cricketer-turned-politician apologises for his “derogatory” tweets against him. Pawan Goel and Sukhwinder Singh Danny are the other two working presidents in the new Congress team that will formally take charge at the ceremony at 11am. Harish Rawat, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs, will attend as the representative of the party’s high command.

23-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: RIP—Rest in Paharganj||No breeze, immense stillness. Fallen leaves litter the ground like a worn carpet. All around, hundreds, perhaps thousands of graves. Some extremely well taken care of, others in disrepair—as if they hadn’t been visited for long.This is the Indian Christian Cemetery in Paharganj. It is astonishing that at the heart of this congested, crowded, chaotic central Delhi locality, such a place sleeps in an all-encompassing silence.This evening, a brown cat with unusually huge whiskers is making her way through the tombstones. She finally stops by a grave commemorating “the loving memory of the elder son of Emlen and Vipin Ekka.” One wonders why the gravestone doesn’t bear the departed one’s name, but then you realise he didn’t live enough to have one—he was born on 4.1.99 and passed on 13.1.99. This portion of the graveyard appears to belong to infants. Baby Singh’s grave is inscribed with the words “Still Born”.Dating from 1983, its cement top has cracked open, exposing the red bricks underneath. Babu, a “New Born Baby”, has his well-maintained grave decked with fresh marigold garlands. An unusually large grave, nearby, is home to Abhinav Singh, aged 10.The grave that stands out prominently is of a 69-year-old woman. Rosaline Wilson’s resting place is decked with tiles showing huge dewy red roses. The grave looks like a greeting card. The Hindi inscription at the bottom says—“Maa, we realised what mother meant by being so far from you, now the heart understands what is a mother’s love.” This is followed by a line in English—We miss you, Mom.One of the persons buried in this graveyard was Jyoti Mariyam Hora. According to newspaper reports from 2013, she left Khunti village in Jharkhand for a new life in Delhi on Swarna Jayanti Express, with a friend, hoping to find work as a housekeeper. She died within a week of arriving in our city, stuck by jaundice, aged 10. It is difficult to locate her grave, perhaps it is unnamed.Near the graveyard’s only gate, a board displays the charges for burial— ₹2,000 for “kacha burial”, ₹3,500 for “pukka burial”, and ₹500 for a “cemented cross” to install upon the grave.Next, a marble slab says—“This cemetry is full to its capacity. Only family graves (doubling) are allowed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-rip-rest-in-paharganj-101626983887492.html

Chiplun and Khed in Ratnagiri district were the worst-affected, as floodwater from Vasisthi river and the discharge of water from Koyana dam submerged several areas. Officials said that rescue operations were delayed due to poor connectivity and bad weather.“We have deployed 17 NDRF companies in various districts, including Ratnagiri, Sindudurg, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara. We have kept one company ready for Vidarbha. The NDRF teams reached Chiplun late because of the landslides on the way. Seven villages in and around Chiplun town are submerged while people are stranded on roofs and terraces of their homes. Indian Navy too has been requested to help in Chiplun and Khed.

The court handed over his custody to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and sent him to judicial custody in a Ludhiana jail, said officials. Gaba, who is facing charges of money laundering, had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, challenging the non-bailable warrants issued by the Mohali court and the ongoing proclaimed offender (PO) proceedings against him. The HC, however, dismissed his petition and asked to surrender in the trial court. Harmesh, brother of Goraya-based businessman Chunni Lal Gabba, the other accused in the Bhola drug case, also moved a bail application in the PMLA court. In 2017, he had availed bail from the high court in the case but it was cancelled by the trial court in December last year. He was absconding since.The trial court has now issued a notice to the ED on his plea. The officials said Harmesh sold two prime properties in Phagwara even as they were attached by the ED. On July 1, Kapurthala police had booked Harmesh, Phagwara tehsildar Praveen Kumar Chibber (now posted in Shahkot), a patwari and others for cheating and criminal conspiracy for selling 14 kanal land attached under the PMLA. On Thursday (July 22), the police arrested Avtar Singh, posted as registry clerk in the Phagwara tehsil office, in property sale case. Praveen Kumar Chibber is still absconding, said Phagwara superintendent of police (SP), Sarabjit Singh Bahia. A senior Kapurthala police official said they will bring harnesh on production warrant in the case. The ED had chargesheeted nine members of the Gaba family, associated with Chunni Lal Gaba’s 11 firms, in connection with the Bhola drug case for alleged violation of the PMLA. Besides Chunni, his three sons — Gurjit, Gurmesh and Mahesh — father Suresh Kumar, brother Harmesh Gaba, 23-year-old grandson Khushwant Gaba, Gurjit’s wife Rekha and Harmesh’s wife Sudesh Rani were booked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/absconding-bhola-drug-case-accused-surrenders-in-mohali-court-sent-to-judicial-custody-101626983221703.html

The orders came after advocate HC Arora moved the tribunal seeking solution to the problem. In the July 20 order, the NGT said, “We direct a five-member joint committee comprising officials of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) regional office; ministry of environment, forest and climate change; Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), a nominee of secretary environment department (Punjab), and the deputy commissioner, Sangrur, to visit the site and interact with the stakeholders, assess the ground situation and recommend the measures required to be taken.” The tribunal said the committee may ascertain the number of tubewells discharging coloured water, depth of such wells, aquifer status in terms of movement and extent of contamination, characteristics of contaminated water with reference to effluent sludge disposed by industries, its effect on crops and agri products. “It may suggest short- and long-term measures considering agronomy and public health, remediation plan, cost of such remediation,” it read. Arora said the first meeting of the committee will be held within two weeks and the matter will come up for further hearing on November 12. On July 8, a video of the tubewell went viral on social media and teams of the PPCB inspected the site and submitted a report to the state government. The owner of the tubewell, Kulwinder Singh, said a private unit had polluted groundwater in the area. He said that the tubewell of his nephew was also throwing polluted water. The PPCB officials had claimed that the factory was dismantled in 2005 and the department had taken up the matter with the NGT, which had imposed a fine of ₹2 crore on factory owners, who did not pay up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngt-forms-panel-seeking-report-on-sangrur-tubewell-spewing-coloured-water-101626982861660.html

23-07-2021||Chandigarh||Floorwise sanctions never granted in Chandigarh, admn tells HC||The Chandigarh administration has told the Punjab and Haryana high court that floorwise building plans are not being approved in the city’s northern sectors.UT’s assistant estate officer Manish Kumar Lohan told the court that the petitioners’ allegations claiming the contrary were incorrect.“The factual position is that a building plan is approved for the entire building and not for an individual floor... Thereafter, any construction carried out on the site is to be as per the Chandigarh Building Rules (Urban), 2017,” the officer’s affidavit said, adding that a co-owner can submit a building plan without the consent of the other owner, but it has to be of the entire building and not an individual floor. The UT also submitted that fragmentation of a plot was not permitted, although there is no prohibition on occupation of the site by more than one family. Besides, the estate officer also makes periodic checks to ensure no alterations have been made without approval.The administration has said that as of advertisements regarding sale of apartments, any aggrieved person can approach it and appropriate steps will be taken. No sale of defined portion/floor of a building is permissible nor any such sale has been recognised by the administration, it has underlined.The response came on a bunch of pleas seeking a ban on construction of multi-storey apartments in the city’s northern sectors. The matter is pending since 2016. The high court had sought a fresh response recently in view of Supreme Court’s direction to it to decide the matter in four months. The apex court order had come in May on the plea of a party opposed to allowing construction of these apartments.The PIL seeks prohibitory orders on conversion of residential plots into apartments. It alleges in the recent years floors are being sold as apartments, which will destroy the city and put additional burden on infrastructure. Residents are divided over the issue. A section says by allowing apartments, those who wish to get property in northern sectors will get a chance to own them. On the other hand, many owners in northern sectors have been opposing the move, insisting that it could change the city’s character.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/floorwise-sanctions-never-granted-in-chandigarh-admn-tells-hc-101626982683296.html

Zero patients in Covid ward||For the first time since the pandemic outbreak in March last year, no Covid patient was admitted to the civil hospital on Thursday. Earlier on January 21, when the first wave was tapering off, the hospital had reported that it had just one Covid patient left but the cases had subsequently gone up. By May, when the second wave was on a rampage in the city, the civil hospital, which can accommodate 250 patients, was bursting at the seams as patients from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana were also coming here for treatment.“The civil hospital now has just four black fungus patients and one patient suffering from post-Covid complications,” said nodal officer for Covid, Dr Hitinder Kaur.She, however, added that the hospital is now preparing for the anticipated third wave.“The drop in cases in the second wave was due to the lockdown. As markets are opening, people are out and about again. Many are still not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. This could be a potential trigger for the third wave. However, as a large chunk of the population has been vaccinated, we can hope to mitigate the third wave to an extent,” said Dr Kaur.At Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H), out of the 150 earmarked beds for Level- II patients, only five are currently occupied, while out of the 180 beds earmarked for Level- III patients, nine are occupied.Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC&H) meanwhile has no patients as of now, while SPS hospital and Mohan Dia Oswal Hospital have two patients each in the Level- II facilities.Vaccine shortage yet again, no sessions todayLudhiana: As residents rush to get themselves inoculated ahead of the anticipated third wave of Covid-19 that is expected to hit the country later this year, Ludhiana is reporting a vaccine shortage. In the past 10 days, Ludhiana saw a dip in daily vaccination count on five occasions.

The vaccination drive in the district had kicked off on January 16 and so far, 14,17,359 residents have been inoculated.Meanwhile, residents are losing patience. Ruchi Sharma, a city resident who was enquiring about vaccine availability at the civil surgeon’s office on Thursday, said, “I came to know that the centre was out of vaccine only I reached here. I will wait for a couple of days.

23-07-2021||Chandigarh||Discomfort of former chief justice on CCTV installation misplaced: Punjab and Haryana HC||Reacting to the plea by former Karnataka chief justice NK Sodhi against installation of CCTV cameras opposite to his house in Sector 4 here, the Punjab and Haryana high court has said that his discomfort on Chandigarh administration’s move is “misplaced”. The high court bench of Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Sant Parkash, which dealt with his plea on July 20, disposed it of after taking note of UT’s response that former chief justice’s apprehension has been taken care of while installing CCTV cameras. The former chief justice lives in House Number 36, opposite to official residence of the Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana high court, RS Jha. “Security agencies have balanced the privacy of residents of area with the threat perception of the protected person by permanently adjusting the cameras in such a way so that privacy of not only the house of petitioner, but also of other houses in vicinity is maintained,” a report submitted by UT administration to the high court said.The report had come in the wake of former Karnataka chief justice approaching the high court seeking directions for removing the CCTV cameras installed near the front boundary of official residence of chief justice Jha. The CCTV cameras installed are high resolution and infrared capable, which can capture detailed images up to 150 metres and thus, can easily invade the privacy, which is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution to the petitioner, he had told the court. Earlier, he had taken up the matter with the high court in May on administrative side and upon response sought on the same from Chandigarh DGP, the high court administration had said that after site inspection, examining the footage and working of the CCTVs installed, it was found that none of the cameras cover the houses on opposite side of the street and only cover the area up to the road berm.“We are, thus, satisfied that the discomfort shown by the petitioner on installation of cameras is misplaced,” recorded the high court bench while disposing of the matter on July 20. As of his demand of framing of rules on this issue, the court opined that no such direction is required to be given and left it to the discretion of the administration to take a decision as and when the situation warrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/discomfort-of-former-chief-justice-on-cctv-installation-misplaced-punjab-and-haryana-hc-101626982141707.html

Alleging negligence by doctors, his father, Anil Kumar, had complained that they discharged his son though he hadn’t fully recovered and asked them to visit the OPD.Two days later, Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta had directed the civil surgeon to mark an inquiry and file a report.“The committee submitted its report on July 20. In the report, the doctors concerned have denied discharging the patient and said it was the father who insisted on it. Therefore, they advised them to visit the OPD. There, the family was asked to give the child ORS and report to the hospital if his condition worsened,” Dr Mukta Kumar, civil surgeon, Panchkula, said.Stating that no one was at fault, but it was a learning experience, Dr Kumar said an advisory had been issued making short stay mandatory for all mild cases reaching emergency.

First, they did not check the blood before issuing it and they did not alert the patient and the hospital administration about the goof-up.However, the state health department refused to compensate the affected minor children even as serious medical and administrative lapses at the government blood bank came to the fore.Meanwhile, the NHRC observed that “the state has failed and thus as a consequence, is liable for any omission or commission on the part of its employees, which in the instant case also falls within the domain of criminal act too as HIV-infected blood was knowingly allowed to be transfused to otherwise healthy patients, including a seven-year-old girl that time.”On April 1, the commission had issued a notice to the Punjab government on granting compensation but it did not receive any reply from the chief secretary even after a deadline of six weeks.“The commission observes that the reply to the show-cause notice from the CS is still awaited despite considerable lapse of time. In the circumstances, the NHRC presumes that the state has no objection to the recommendation of (granting compensation). The commission directs the CS to submit a compliance report along with proof of payment within four weeks, failing which the commission will call for the personal appearance of the authority concerned,” the order states.Vice-president of the Thalassaemia Welfare Society Mahinder Makkar said they would approach the NHRC to award compensation to the rest of the three patients who were wrongfully infused infected the blood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hiv-blood-transfusion-nhrc-tells-punjab-govt-to-give-rs-4-lakh-relief-to-two-families-101626982021715.html
23-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh saw 13.8% spike in power demand this summer||The city has recorded a 13.8% jump in electricity demand this summer, compared to last year. As per the ministry of power reply submitted in the Lok Sabha on Thursday regarding power demand in the country, demand of 352 million units was recorded in Chandigarh from April to June 2020. This year, it has shot up to 400 million units for the same period.Last year, for most of the summer months, there was a lockdown amid the pandemic outbreak. Even when restrictions were eased, commercial and industrial activity remained very low. “This year, even though the second Covid wave resulted in lockdown, it not as strict or comprehensive as last year. This pushed the demand up,” said a UT engineering department officialThis year, peak power demand also increased. “The demand for electricity increases in summer, but it has reached its peak in July. Demand reached 426 MW on July 8, which is the maximum this summer,” said the official.Notably, 2019 had seen the city breaking its all-previous records of power consumption, with peak demand touching 431 MW. In 2018, it was 404 MWWhile engineering department officials maintain that the city had adequate power supply, erratic supply was reported from several areas this time. The worst-affected areas were southern sectors, rehabilitation colonies and villages.Many in the electricity department blamed the ongoing process of handing over the department to private hands for the power supply problems.“With all attention on privatisation, the UT administration either postponed or denied permission to buy necessary equipment to improve the quality of electricity supply network in the city for around two years. This has impacted the department’s ability to supply disruption free power,” said an engineering department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-saw-13-8-spike-in-power-demand-this-summer-101626981964361.html

Besides, the child appears to be fine and active. “As the complainant has recently filed for divorce, she may be trying to implicate her husband. The matter will be clear once the toddler is medically examined,” said the SHO, adding that if the complainant does not cooperate, the police can initiate proceedings to cancel the FIR.In her complaint, the woman had stated that she had noticed some swelling in the toddler’s nether regions. One night she woke up to her daughter’s cries and was shocked to find her husband sexually assaulting the child.

The Union government should not try to muzzle the freedom of the press. The SAD stands resolutely in solidarity with the media in this hour of crisis,” he said, adding that the Centre needed to respond positively to criticism on sensitive issues like Covid mismanagement as they reflected the sentiments of the citizens of the country. The former Punjab deputy CM alleged that the government was following a vindictive approach towards farmers. “Farmers have rightly questioned the logic behind bringing in the three agricultural laws which help only the corporations and will result in the corporatisation of agriculture in the country. Instead of listening to the farmers and resolving their grievances the centre is adopting an intransigent attitude towards them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sukhbir-condemns-it-raids-on-media-houses-101626981721897.html

Those booked are wrestling coach Vikram Malik, boxing coach Naveen Sharma, school director Sanjay Malik, another coach Shashikant and two former students Sachin Kumar and Vinay. They have been booked under sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. In his police complaint, the 15-year-old student, who hails from a Bhiwani village, said he took admission in Class 10 at Asian Public School on April 21 as he wanted to pursue boxing. “A month ago, a Class 11 boy accused me of theft and planted a bottle of perfume in my bag. He started blackmailing me and sought money, threatening to take up the matter with school authorities if I didn’t conform to his demands. On July 9, coach Vikram called me to the warden’s room and started beating me up. At 11pm, I was called again to the warden’s room where Vikram, Naveen and Sanjay beat me up. I was also tortured in a water pool and made to gasp for breath by Vikram and two others,” the complainant said. He said his phone was taken away and I narrated the incident to my parents on July 16 when they visited the school. “When we asked the school authorities to provide my ward’s school leaving certificate on July 16, they told us that they are yet to enrol him,” the boy’s mother said.

Slamming the BJP leader for using derogatory language for farmers, who have been peacefully agitating against the Centre’s farm laws for eight months, the CM said it reflected the party’s anti-farmer mindset. He lambasted the NDA government for its efforts to suppress every single voice that dared to speak against them, as in the latest instance of Income Tax (IT) raids on the Dainik Bhaskar media group. “While the assault on the journalist covering the farmers’ parliament was deplorable and action should be taken against the guilty person, the union minister’s reaction was totally uncalled for and provocative,” Lekhi said, adding the minister had no right to defame farmers. The Delhi Police should file a case and investigate the case to identify the accused, and the law should take its own course, he added. “The BJP leadership is once again resorting to such shameful tactics out of sheer frustration,” the CM said, alleging that the BJP-led central government had shown, time and again, that it was not interested in the welfare of farmers, who were the country’s ‘annadaatas’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjps-anti-farmer-mindset-showing-capt-101626981361668.html

Addressing a press conference, Cheema added, “Congress legislators had told the party high command that they would not be able to enter villages because of state government’s non-performance.

It simultaneously appointed Sidhu as the Pradesh Congress President to shift the blame for the party’s non-performance on Capt Amarinder.” Asserting that such cheap political moves could not fool Punjabis, Cheema said Navjot Sidhu was part and parcel of the non-performing Congress government. “Sidhu was a minister in the government for half of its term. He should first admit his failure to do anything for the welfare of the people.” He added that Sidhu should simultaneously tell Punjabis when they would get a ₹85,000 crore farm loan waiver as promised by his government and party and why the promised 25 lakh jobs were not given, as these were part of party’s promises before coming to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/changes-in-punjab-cong-unit-signal-government-incompetence-sad-101626981003539.html

The opposition is based on possible damage to the nearby forest area, pollution in Sutlej River and loss of livelihood of villagers. Pargat visited the proposed site near the banks of river Sutlej in village Sekhowal and Garhi Fazal on Thursday, along with members of NGOs. He assured activists of taking up the issue with the government so that it drops the project. An umbrella organisation, Public for Action, had approached Pargat for help. Pargat added,” The site proposed for establishing the industrial park is near forest area and is near the banks of Sutlej. I will take up the matter at government level for dropping the project by convincing officials. The industrial park can be established at any other site or industrial area in the state.”Kuldeep Khaira, Amandeep Bains, Jaskirat Singh, Kapil Arora, all associated with NGOs claimed that a petition has also been filed in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) against the project.Khaira said, “The government is moving forward with the project and the panchayat land in villages has been acquired forcibly. About 70 families involved in farming at the panchayat land have been left unemployed only in village Sekhowal as the land has been acquired. We have also opposed the amendment in the master plan to convert the ‘no manufacturing zone’ to industrial area for the project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pargat-opposes-industrial-park-near-mattewara-forests-in-ludhiana-101626980702186.html
23-07-2021||Mumbai||CBI can probe postings as part of Deshmukh case: HC||The Bombay high court on Thursday said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) can inquire into the transfer and postings of police personnel and the reinstatement of controversial officer Sachin Vaze into the force in its probe against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, dismissing a plea by the state government for dropping two paragraphs in the agency’s FIR in the case.A division bench of justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar held that keeping in view the observation made in the April 5 order, directing CBI to carry out a preliminary enquiry against Deshmukh, CBI can legitimately investigate alleged corruption, transfers and posting of police officers and reinstatement of Vaze. The court, however, held that its order cannot be “an unfettered authority to CBI” and the investigation has to be carried on under the law of the land.“Conversely, the order of the division bench cannot be construed as giving an unfettered authority to CBI to inquire into transfers and postings of the police officers generally, which do not reflect upon the alleged acts and conduct expressly attributed to the former home minister and his confederates. We part with this judgment with an assurance that officers of CBI are and must be fully allowed to take their responsibilities. And the duty of police constituted under either state enactment or special Act, is to serve none but the law,” said the bench. In March, former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh in a letter to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray levelled allegations of corruption against Deshmukh.Senior counsel Rafique Dada, appearing for the state government, sought the court to stay its judgment for two weeks. The government petition alleged that CBI included the two paragraphs to try and destabilise the present state government at the behest of the political party which was not in power in Maharashtra.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, however, opposed it and said a stay would amount to interference with the investigation. The high court bench refused to stay its judgment.The CBI on April 21 this year registered an FIR against Deshmukh on charges of corruption and misuse of official position. However, he has denied any wrongdoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-can-probe-postings-as-part-of-deshmukh-case-hc-101626980527362.html

23-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra set to take a decision on relaxing curbs for trains, shops||Amid increasing pressure from various quarters to provide further relaxations in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) curbs enforced in the state, the Maharashtra government is expected to take a decision over opening suburban train services for a few more categories in the next few days. Also, the state government is looking to make a decision on relaxing shop timings, opening of malls and lifting of curbs on restaurants.Amid the state mulling relaxations, it added 7,302 fresh infections. The state’s active case count stood at 94,168 on Thursday, while total cases stood at 6,245,057. Maharashtra saw 120 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the tally to 131,038. Mumbai saw 389 fresh Covid-19 infections, taking its tally to 732,971. The city reported 10 deaths, pushing the toll to 15,810.A senior official said the demand for relaxations has increased from political, social organisations and business circles, forcing the government to chalk out a plan to reopen some activities and allow further relaxation in restrictions imposed for management of Covid-19 pandemic. The relief and rehabilitation department has put the system required for the issuance of universal passes using QR codes to the employees from the categories to be allowed to commute in trains. The process of issuing universal passes to the employees in the sector, which are already allowed to commute in trains, has already started. “Employees from state and central government, ports, cargo services, and electricity supply have already been allowed to commute on the trains. They will be issued QR code-based universal passes to restrict unauthorised commuting,” said an official from Mantralaya. The passes will be made compulsory for travel, the official added.Cities and areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) are following the restrictions in level three of categorised curbs specified for the management of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government is considering extending the relaxations to a few more categories. “Teachers, media employees and few more categories are expected to be added to the list of the people allowed to commute. The decision over allowing women in non-peak hours are also expected to be added, but the final decision over it will be taken at higher level. “We have tremendous pressure from political, social organisations to allow more people to travel on trains. At the same time the central government has issued us advisories with strict instruction to minimise the crowding at the public places in the wake of the potential third wave. It has become very difficult to strike a balance between restrictions and relaxations,” another officer from Mantralaya said. Another senior official added the demand to restart local trains is high. “But it was not possible to allow because they are the biggest spreaders. However, we are looking at methodology to allow more people. The fundamental decision will be to allow how many people. Will it be on the total seats. In that case, only 750,000 will be allowed, but three to four million people travel by trains so it is difficult to track and monitor. The chief minister and health minister will take a call on it soon,” the official said requesting anonymity.The people from the categories being added to travel in local trains, however, are expected to be allowed only after the MMR enters level-2. The decision of change in the level for Mumbai and other cities will be taken by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The notification related to the inclusion of few more categories will be issued by the public health department of the state government. A senior official said that henceforth all decision related to curbs will be taken and issued by the health department and not the relief and rehabilitation department.According to the guidelines chalked out, the universal travel pass will be issued to people from the specified categories by the relief and rehabilitation department and will be valid with identity card. The pass holders will be allowed to travel in the areas falling under level 1 to 3. The authenticity of the pass will be verified through QR code with the help of code reader on smart phone. Unauthorised travel on local trains will attract a fine of ₹500. Another senior official from the state secretariat said that shops and restaurants are also likely to be given more relaxation and an announcement on it is expected in the next few days. Currently, shops in Mumbai operate till 4pm, while home delivery is allowed. “There has been constant demand from the shops and establishments owners, especially in Mumbai, to allow more hours of operation. The rate of infection in Mumbai has gone down considerably. Though there is an imminent threat of the third wave [of Covid infections], ICMR has said one-third of the population has developed antibodies. The CM would take a call on shops and restaurants soon,” the official said.State health minister Rajesh Tope has already acknowledged the growing demand of allowing fully vaccinated people to use local trains. Speaking to a TV channel on Wednesday, Tope said, “There should be some relaxation and I hope that the CM and the Covid Task Force will take appropriate decision soon.” Last week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said during a review meeting that he would recommend the state government to allow malls to open with “fully vaccinated staff” for customers who have taken both their vaccine shots.BJP attacked the MVA government, asking if it will keep the all activities shut fearing Covid-19. Taking a dig at the government, BJP state president Chandrakant Patil on Thursday said that the government must permit those who have completed both the doses of the vaccine to resume normal activities. He was talking to media persons in Pune. Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena demanded that the Uddhav Thackeray government should allow fully vaccinated people to use local trains in Mumbai. “After completing both the doses, people can resume their normal activities with full precautions like wearing a mask, following strict hygiene protocols, maintaining physical distance and avoiding going to crowded places as far as possible,” Patil said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-set-to-take-a-decision-on-relaxing-curbs-for-trains-shops-101626980340914.html
23-07-2021||Mumbai||Rain hammers Maharashtra, floods Konkan and MMR||Heavy rain wreaked havoc throughout the state, causing several rivers to overflow and consequently inundate several areas in coastal Konkan, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), western Maharashtra and Vidarbha on Thursday. With hundreds of people feared trapped in various flood-hit areas, authorities have deployed 17 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams in Chiplun, Khed in Ratnagiri; Kolhapur; Sangli and Satara. At least eight people have been killed in rain-related incidents (landslide, wall collapse) in Palghar, Raigad and Ratnagiri, officials said. Chiplun and Khed were the worst hit as water from the Vashishti River and Koyna dam submerged several areas. The incessant downpour and poor mobile phone connectivity hampered rescue efforts. The state deployed 15 boats of the Indian Coast Guard and the police to evacuate residents stranded in their houses in Chiplun and Khed. Two rescue teams deployed from Pune could only reach late in the evening because of a landslide on the way. Two more teams of NDRF were expected to reach Chiplun and Khed by midnight. Over 700 people have been evacuated in the past two days, including 400 from Raigad and 250 from Ratnagiri. “We have deployed 17 NDRF teams in various districts, including Ratnagiri, Sindudurg, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara, and have kept one ready for districts in Vidarbha. The NDRF teams reached Chiplun late because of landslides. Seven villages in and around Chiplun town have been submerged, while people are stranded on the roofs and terraces of their homes. The Indian Navy, too, has been requested for rescue operations in Chiplun and Khed,” said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department of the state.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a review meeting to take stock of the downpour. He directed the state administration to mobilise help from state and central agencies towards rescue operations and minimise losses.According to information available, many rivers including Vashishti, Jagbudi, Bavanadi in Ratnagiri had crossed their danger level, which led to floods in parts of the district. A cloudburst in Mahabaleshwar on Wednesday resulted in heavy rainfall of 480mm in 24 hours, leading to a swelling in the water levels of Savitri, Kaal and other rivers in the Konkan belt, which are at the foothills of the Sahyadri mountain range. Similarly, the water level of Panchaganga in Kolhapur and Krishna in Sangli are nearing their danger level. The discharge of water from Almatty dam in Karanataka resulted in the rise in water level in Sangli. “The Koyna dam in Satara was full at 62% in the afternoon. We will have to discharge water from the dam if it reaches 80% by taking due precautions of shifting of people,” said Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, relief and rehabilitation department.“Karjat and Mahad in Raigad districts and Kalyan and Bhiwandi in Thane district, too, witnessed heavy rainfall. We have deployed NDRF companies in Mumbai and other parts of the state for quick rescue operations,” said relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar.Many national and state highways, including Goa-Mumbai, were shut in areas where roads and bridges were submerged. “Many rivers including Panchganga, Dudhganga, Warana, Hiranykeshi have already reached their warning level and are expected to cross their danger mark on Friday as per the prediction by the IMD. We have directed the district administrations to take all measures to ensure safety of the people,” said Satej Patil, minister of state for home and guardian minister of Kolhapur. Three people in Palghar district, three in Ratnagiri and two in Raigad have reportedley died in rain related incidents. District roads in Kolhapur have been closed as the rainwater has submerged stretches. In several rural areas of Kolhapur, the bridges have gone underwater, due to which, the traffic movement has been shut. The road near Jadhavwadi Nile in Shahuwadi tehsil and the Kolhapur- Ratnagiri road were closed as water came on to the road, the official said. As the bund at Khochi Dudhgaon got submerged, the traffic towards Sangli district from that route was diverted. In Raigad, 400 people from more than 100 families in Karjat, Mahad and Khalapur tehsils have been shifted to safer places. Kundalika and Savitri rivers in the districts have crossed the danger mark of water level, officials said.In MMR, governed by nine municipal corporations including Mumbai and Thane, the incessant rain over the past couple of days has resulted in waterlogging and disruption in local train operations. Of the seven lakes that supply drinking water to Mumbai, two — Modak Sagar (started overflowing early morning on Thursday) and Tansa — are almost full. Two other lakes, Tulsi and Vehar, had started overflowing last week. The rainfall in the last two days in the catchment areas of the lakes has resulted in the rise in the stock that will last for 64 days. This has resulted in scrapping potential water cuts for the city.The heavy rainfall in MMR has disrupted local train operations on the Central and Harbour lines. Train services on the Konkan railway, too, have witnessed disruption owing to the waterlogging on the tracks in Ratnagiri. “Eight trains have been regulated due to disruption on the route,” Konkan Railway has stated. Water level of the Vashishti river between Chiplun and Kamathe stations in Ratnagiri has gone above the danger level early g on Thursday.With moderate to heavy rainfall across the state over last few days, the water stock level in reservoirs has increased to 34.28%. State has received 57.3% of the season’s — from June to September — rainfall with 574.7mm rainfall, against the season’s average of 1,004.2 mm. The state has received more than 88mm rainfall in the past 60 hours, according to the state government’s website.A landslide has been reported at Talai village of Mahad Taluka in Raigad district. However, Raigad collector Nidhi Choudhary said officers who have gone to the spot are not reachable and hence the number of houses damaged or if there are any casualties could not be confirmed at the time of going to press.Two helicopters of the Indian Air Force have reached Ratnagiri airport and will start rescue operations from Friday morning. Six teams of the Coast Guard and a few from the Indian army will join rescue operations from Friday morning. The state has requested the Centre for at least seven more teams, expected to be deployed from other states.Forty people have died in rain related incidents since July 16 in 7 districts of Konkan. Highest, 30, are from Mumbai suburban, including the deaths reported due to the landslides on Sunday.Prime minister Narendra Modi spoke to Thackeray and assured central help. 30 lakh cusecs of water was released from Almatti river on Friday evening. With rise in water level in Koyana dam, the state is planning to release 10,000 cusecs of water on Friday. The district administration has been directed to take due precautions for the shifting of people from the villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rain-hammers-maharashtra-floods-konkan-and-mmr-101626980222616.html

In a press conference, the AAP leaders claimed that if the Electricity Amendment Bill, 2021, was passed, electricity will no longer be the right of the states. Mann claimed, “The Centre is now snatching electricity rights from states, just like it did with GST, agriculture, health, and education. Punjab contributes 40% to the grain pool, and electricity for tube-wells is free for the farmers. However, with this bill, the electricity subsidy that the farmers were getting from the Punjab government will end.”Mann added that it was the same bill on which discussions had taken place during 11 rounds of meetings between the farmers and BJP ministers Piyush Goyal and Narendra Singh Tomar. He claimed, “During these meetings, farmers were promised that this bill will not be introduced. During an all-party meeting on the issues, we were told this promise was conditional on talks with the farmers reaching a positive conclusion. They now say that because that dialogue never reached any conclusion, the bill will be introduced.” Mann added, “With the passage of this Electricity Amendment bill, farmers will start getting bills, which will put more burden on them. It is under a well-thought-out conspiracy of the Modi government to make farming ultra-expensive. The aim is to get farmers to surrender their land to capitalists.”Lashing out at PM Modi, Bhagwant Mann said that more than 600 farmers have been killed during the farm stir, but the PM has not uttered a single word. “Farmers are now protesting at Jantar Mantar, they are near to the PM now. The government should talk to them and accept their demands so that they can happily go back home,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-snatching-state-s-rights-on-electricity-claims-aap-101626980163589.html
23-07-2021||Mumbai||JSA works: Maharashtra govt widens scope of inquiry||Widening the scope of the inquiry into alleged irregularities in previous Fadnavis government’s flagship water conservation project, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has ordered a probe into all 63.3 million works completed under the Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyan (JSA) between December 2014 and March 2020. The collectors of the respective districts have been directed by the government to probe all JSA works and take action, if necessary. The water conservation project was touted as a solution to the water shortage in rural areas. A four-member state-appointed committee, headed by retired IAS officer Bijay Kumar, submitted its report on May 5, after which the state government decided to initiate action in all 63.3 million works completed by spending ₹9,634 crore. The committee was mandated to investigate 1,799 works in which either Comptroller and Auditor General had passed strictures for the irregularities and lapses or the state had received complaints. “The committee, after its probe by scrutiny of documents, meeting with the officials and visiting the sites, found 931 cases fit for an open inquiry by the anti-corruption bureau, while in 396 cases, the committee has recommended a departmental inquiry. The committee has also recommended that as it could not investigate other works beyond the cases submitted to it, because of Covid-19 related constraints, the committee has chalked out a criterion for scrutiny of the remaining 63.1 million works. The district collectors have been directed to conduct the scrutiny and register the cases as per the criterion fixed,” an order issued by the soil and water conservation department has stated. “While allocating the works, the administration did not follow the set norms of the bidding, hampering the competitiveness and transparency. The remarks on the audit of the works by third party were found to be forged to mislead the government and get the bills passed. The percentage of completion of the works in the registers were found inflated. Funds collected through CSR and public donations were deposited in private bank accounts. The audit of the funds thus collected was not done in the due process laid down by the government. The techniques for the widening and deepening of the bunds and nullah were faulty and not as per the set norms. These irregularities have led to the financial losses to the exchequer and need to be investigated under an open inquiry,” the report has stated. The report has also stated that the administrative lapses, such as absence of nod of the gram sabha, release of funds without the nod by the tehsil and district level committee, failure to conduct the third party audit of the works, may be scrutinised in departmental inquiry as the lapses have not led to the financial losses to the exchequer. The committee has in detail jotted down the parameters that are fit for the open and departmental inquiries. Devendra Fadnavis, leader of opposition in legislative Assembly and former chief minister, said, “The complaints are in just 950 works of the total 65.5 million works that had undertaken by our government. During my tenure as the CM, we had ordered a probe into 650 works as we believe that there should not be any irregularity in such an ambitious project. The powers related to the allotment and implementation of the project were given to the district collectors and few other departments including agriculture, water resources, rural development were involved in their execution. The funds were released by the collectors of the respective districts,” he said. Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “We had been repeatedly saying that the JSA had failed in achieving the goals of making villages drought-free. The scheme was designed keeping the interest of the contractors close to the BJP in mind. Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the scheme and said that 16000 villages in Maharashtra had become drought-free because of its effective implementation. A few days after, the government had declared many of the villages as drought affected. According to a 2018 survey, the ground water level in many of the villages in which JSA was implemented saw depletion in groundwater level.” The four-member committee was constituted on December 1 after the state cabinet decided to probe into the allegations of irregularities in the project. The project was implemented in 22,589 villages with 6.41 lakh works were undertaken between December 2014 and March 2020. The state government spent ₹9,634 crore on the project and 98% of works were completed, in which Comptroller and Auditor General of India found holes after inspecting 1,128 works allotted and concluded that it failed to achieve its aim. The project has been scrapped by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jsaworks-maharashtra-govt-widens-scope-of-inquiry-101626980162054.html
23-07-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects Anil Deshmukh’s plea seeking to quash CBI FIR||In a setback for former home minister Anil Deshmukh, the Bombay high court (HC) dismissed his petition which challenged the first information report (FIR) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 21 after completing the HC-ordered preliminary enquiry. Deshmukh and unknown others were charged for bribery, corruption and criminal conspiracy in the FIR. Deshmukh had subsequently sought to quash the FIR and urged for a stay on the investigation by CBI, but the court has rejected the plea. Senior advocate Amit Desai, for Deshmukh, sought a stay on the investigation on the grounds tha the question of law was not decided and wanted to challenge the same before the Supreme Court. After CBI opposed the same, the court held that there was no justifiable reason to stay the operation of the judgement and rejected the request. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, that had been hearing Deshmukh’s petition, had reserved its judgement on July 12. During arguments, Desai along with advocates Kamlesh Ghumre and Sonali Jadhav had argued that CBI had not followed proper procedure and its probe had gone beyond the mandate of the April 5 order of the HC bench, hence the FIR was illegal and should be quashed. On April 5, the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni had directed CBI to conduct a preliminary enquiry based on a complaint by lawyer Dr Jaishri Patil. Patil’s complaint referred to the March 20 letter of former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wherein he had alleged that Deshmukh had asked his officers to indulge in extorting money from bars and restaurants. Singh had further alleged that Deshmukh had asked arrested assistant inspector Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month, including ₹40 crore to ₹50 crore from 1,750 bars and restaurants in Mumbai. The court had directed for the preliminary enquiry to be completed within 15 days after which, based on the findings, the CBI director could take appropriate action. Upon completion of the enquiry, the central agency registered an FIR against Deshmukh and unknown others, which Deshmukh challenged in the HC on May 3. During arguments, Desai submitted that the entire procedure of registering the FIR after concluding preliminary enquiry was a case of overreach by CBI. He said though CBI was to take the consent of the state as per Delhi Special Police Establishment Act for registering FIR, it had failed to do so and had also failed to take consent of the state before initiating investigation based on the FIR. Desai had argued that state consent was required as Deshmukh was a public servant when the allegations were levelled against him. It was further submitted on behalf of Deshmukh that Singh’s letter could have been merely a whisper that may have been heard in the corridors of the police commissioner’s office and lacked any material evidence. Hence the intention behind naming Deshmukh in the FIR was to besmirch his position while at the same time while safeguarding certain people. Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, for CBI, while opposing the petition had informed the court that whoever was accused of corruption needed to be investigated and as the PE was ordered by the HC, there was no need for prior approval or consent of the state for registering the FIR or initiating investigations based on it. Lekhi submitted that there was substantial material against Deshmukh, but it was not final evidence of dishonest performance and that several other persons were involved in the corruption. After hearing submissions by both sides, the court had sought to know from CBI as to why even after two months since the FIR was registered it had not disclosed the names of unknown persons and sought progress report of the investigation in sealed cover. “Corruption is the root cause because of which systems are paralysed. No one should be left out,” the court had observed. The court had also held that no police officer could escape his responsibility when there was a cognisable offence. On Thursday while dismissing the petition, the court directed that the sealed envelope containing the progress report of the investigation be returned to CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-anil-deshmukh-s-plea-seeking-to-quash-cbi-fir-101626980100915.html
23-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: FYJC CET portal remains shut for third day||Nearly 24 hours after the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) shut down the common entrance test (CET) registrations website for first-year junior college (FYJC) aspirants due to technical glitches, the website remained inaccessible on Thursday as well. State board officials, without giving any clear answers, told HT that students will be informed about the reopening of the website in advance. “Not only will we inform students in advance, we will also extend the deadline for all interested students to complete the registration process,” said Dinkar Patil, chairman, MSBSHSE. The portal, http://cet.mh-ssc.ac.in/, which was supposed to open for online applications from 11.30am on July 20, remained inaccessible due to technical issues till Wednesday night, post which the board shut it down.Originally, registration for the optional CET exam for FYJC admission was scheduled to take place between July 20 and 26. However, since the portal has been inaccessible for the past three days, officials have assured students that new deadline will be announced once the website is up and running. “I have been checking the CET website as well as the state board official website for updates, but there have been none. The process that should’ve started on Tuesday has been left hanging due to technical glitch, which the board has not managed to fix yet. There seems to be no end to such delay,” said Anjum Chehal, an aspirant.Results for the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) were announced online on July 16, but the results website crashed within minutes of the results being announced. With no board exams conducted this year due to rising Covid-19 cases, the state decided to conduct an entrance exam based on the state board syllabus and made it optional for FYJC aspirants. As per a government resolution (GR) made public by the state school education department, priority in admission to FYJC will be given to students based on their CET scores and then seats will be allotted to remaining students on the basis of merit as per marks scored through the Class 10 assessment method depending on the vacancy of seats in junior colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-fyjc-cet-portal-remains-shut-for-third-day-101626980042310.html
23-07-2021||Mumbai||KEM Hospital becomes the first in western region to start centre for rare diseases||The King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel has become the first hospital in the western region to start a centre for excellence of rare diseases. The Government of India (GOI) will partially sponsor treatment while the rest will be done via crowdfunding. Welcoming the move, medical experts said rare diseases are treated as “orphan disease” owing to a small number of patients per disease.The common denominator of rare diseases is the infrequency of their occurrence in the population. World Health Organization (WHO) defines rare disease as often debilitating lifelong disease or disorder with a prevalence of one or less per 1,000 people. There are around 7,000- 8,000 rare diseases. As per the Foundation for Research on Rare Diseases and Disorder, there are over 7 million people living with rare diseases in Maharashtra. However, patients living with rare diseases have to suffer due to unavailability and cost of medical treatment. “At present, there were six such centres in India dedicated to the treatment of rare diseases. We are the seventh one and the first in the western region to have the facility,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital. “There is no specific out-patient department (OPD) for such patients as they are identified from different medical departments during diagnosis.”At the centre, profiles of patients will be directly synced with the centralised portal where citizens can donate money for their treatment. “They (donors) can choose according to enlisted names of hospitals, diseases or through profiles of patients,” said Dr Deshmukh.The Central government, in its National Policy for Rare Diseases, stated that less than 5% patients have therapies available to treat them. About 95% of rare diseases have no approved treatment and less than one in 10 patients receives disease-specific treatment. “We have also formed a local committee which comprises of doctors from different departments like hepatologists, cardiologists to look into such cases,” he added. The hospital, with the help of non-government organisations (NGOs) and social workers, will also help raise funds for patients for treatment.Though doctors have welcomed the initiative, they claim the Central government is not paying much heed to the needs of the patients. They also said that for such diseases for which drugs are available, they are prohibitively expensive, placing immense strain on resources.Dr Aabha Nagral, liver specialist with Jaslok Hospital and trustee at Children’s Liver Foundation, said, “There are three categories — in some cases like Wilson Diseases, the treatment is readily available. In the second type of diseases such as Lysosomal storage disorders, the treatment cost goes over ₹1 crore. Lastly, there are diseases where treatment is not available except for limited trials or research.”“Due to less profit, pharma companies are not producing these life-saving drugs. These are the most neglected diseases like orphan diseases,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kem-hospital-becomes-the-first-in-western-region-to-start-centre-for-rare-diseases-101626980040846.html

23-07-2021||Mumbai||Another FIR against Param Bir Singh in ₹15-crore extortion allegation||Another first information report (FIR) has been registered against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The case was filed by Marine Drive police based on the complaint of a Bhayandar-based builder who alleged that Singh and his subordinated has made an extortion demand of ₹15 crore at the behest of a businessman. The businessman, a former business partner of the complainant builder, has been arrested in the case along with his associate on Thursday.Marine Drive police on Thursday registered an FIR against businessman Sanjay Punamiya, his associate Sunil Jain, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (crime branch) Akbar Pathan, assistant commissioner of police Shrikant Shinde, inspectors Asha Kokare, Nandkumar Gopale, Sanjay Patil and others along with Singh.Singh did not respond to calls and messages.Punamiya and Jain were arrested in the case from their residences in south Mumbai and were produced in court which remanded them in police custody up to July 29.The complainant, Shyamsunder Agrawal, 57, claimed that he had done several real estate projects in Borivli, Bhayandar and Gorai between 2016 and 2011in partnership with Punamiya, but due to complications, conflicts and profit-sharing disputes, the two ended their partnership in 2011. He alleged that Punamiya has been registering false cases against Agrawal since then and has filed 18 cases against him in Mumbai and Thane. In 2016, Agrawal was arrested and while he was in jail, Punamiya and Jain allegedly demanded ₹20 crore from Agrawal’s nephew by claiming that Singh is Punamiya’s friend and if the money was not paid, they would add sections of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against Agrawal using Singh’s clout. This meeting was held at Singh’s Kopari, Thane residence and a DCP-rank officer, who is believed to be close to Singh, was also allegedly present in the meeting. He further said that the accused collected ₹9 crore from Agrawal and his nephew, according to the remand application.There was also a settlement deed signed between Agrawal, Punamiya and Singh, police sources said. According to the police case, this year another FIR was registered against Agrawal at Juhu police station on the complaint of Punamiya who alleged Agrawal was threatening him for extortion at the behest of gangster Chhota Shakeel.As per police’s remand application, Agrawal’s nephew Shubham was threatened by Punamiya, Jain and other accused at Punamiya’s Fort office demanding ₹15.5 crore and share in some properties in Gorai and Mira-Bhayandar. They allegedly threatened to put Agrawal behind bars for five years if the demands were not fulfilled. The accused also forcefully took Shubham’s signature and threatened the complainant with narcotics case.Shubham, meanwhile, recorded the conversation that took place in this meeting on his phone and presented it before the police as evidence. Based on the audio clip and some monetary transaction records, the police registered the case, sources said.Agrawal, in his complaint, claimed that he had paid ₹15 crore to Punamiya through cheque and ₹50 lakh in cash. He also allegedly paid hefty amounts to crime branch police officers to help him in the criminal case. He further added that Punamiya continued to harass him for the remaining ₹11 crore from the previous settlement in which Singh was also involved. Following this, he approached the police.Singh and other accused have been booked under sections 387 (putting a person in fear of death or of grievous hurt in order to commit extortion), 388 (extortion by threat of accusation of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, etc), 389 (putting a person in fear of accusation of offence in order to commit extortion), 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 420 (cheating), 423 (dishonest or fraudulent execution of deed of transfer con­taining false statement of consideration), 464 ( making a false document), 465 (forgery) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code.Singh is already facing multiple enquiries after he was shunted out from the post of Mumbai Police chief in March this year for improper handling of the Antilia bomb scare case.Maharashtra criminal investigation department is probing multiple allegations against Singh while the anti-corruption bureau has initiated an open inquiry against him pertaining to corruption allegations made against him by police inspector Anup Dange.Singh, who is the director general of Home Guards, was earlier booked in an Atrocities Act case in April this year on the complaint of a serving inspector from Akola police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/another-fir-against-param-bir-singh-in-15-crore-extortion-allegation-101626979860932.html

23-07-2021||Mumbai||Is separate question paper for other boards possible for FYJC CET, Bombay HC asks state||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday has asked the Maharashtra government through the school education department to inform whether it will be able to provide multiple question papers for the common entrance test (CET) for students seeking admission to Class 11 or first-year junior colleges from various boards. The division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice RI Chagla asked the question, while hearing the petition filed by Ananya Patki, an ICSE student of IES Orion School, Dadar, wherein it was argued that as the CET question paper would be based only on the state board syllabus, students from other boards would be at a disadvantage. In view of this, the petition urged that the education department be directed to have separate question papers based on CBSE and ICSE board syllabus. The court also asked that in the event of separate question paper is not provided, whether the state would withdraw the priority set to be given to students who appear for CET. The court was informed by advocate Yogesh Patki, father of the petitioner, that the petition sought to quash the May 28 notification of the state government which stated that admissions to Class 11 would take place based on a CET on the state board syllabus. The May 28 notification had announced that as Class 10 board exams could not be conducted in view of the pandemic, students would be evaluated through an internal assessment formula for the academic year 2020-21. The notification further stated that admissions to Class 11 would be conducted physically through optional CET based on the Class 10 syllabus of the state board and those unwilling to appear for it will be admitted on the basis of an aggregate of their Class 10 marks. Patki alleged that the CET was discriminatory as the first preference for admission to Class 11 would be given to students who appeared for CET, and as the exam is based on SSC board syllabus, the interest of his daughter and that of students from other boards would be prejudiced. He further said that as his daughter was not in a position to give the exam physically, she would be at a disadvantage at the time of admission. In view of this, he sought a stay on the implementation of May 28 notification pending hearing. Government pleader Purnima Kantharia informed the court that CET was proposed to be held on August 21 and registration for the same started from July 21 and would be accepted till July 26. After hearing the submissions, the court sought to know from the state whether separate question papers for students from CBSE and ICSE board could be provided. If that was not possible whether the government was willing to let go of the priority criteria stated in the notification. “In view of the statement made by the government pleader and in view of the fact that the matter is proposed to be heard on the suggestion given by this court on July 28, 2021, no interim reliefs are warranted at this stage,” the bench stated. The HC then asked the state government to file additional affidavit in reply and to place the data on record showing the number of application received by it for the CET exam during the next hearing. The court also allowed the petitioner to implead CBSE and asked ICSE to file an affidavit within one week and posted next hearing on July 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/is-separate-question-paper-for-other-boards-possible-for-fyjc-cet-bombay-hc-asks-state-101626979740859.html

It also intends to take up riverfront development, including development of ghats at Sangam area along river Ganga and Yamuna also, an official said.To develop 769.60 square kilometer area under PDA, the authorities have begun the process of appointing a consultant to prepare the vision plan and PDA officials have already floated a request for proposal (RFP) for this. PDA superintending engineer, Rohit Khanna said the consultant would present a blueprint of the master plan, identifying projects for augmenting the socio-economic base of the city and generate employment for the local population through tourism, pilgrimage and other activities.Some important projects include development of 12 Madhav Circuit, upgradation of Sangam area including river cleaning and dredging, developing riverfront and Ghat development on Sangam area, ropeway connecting Quila Ghat, Triveni Pushp and Saccha Baba Ghat, land development along ring road (besides Yamuna), restoration of water bodies of mythological and religious importance etc.“Development of integrated tourism master plan is aimed at developing Prayagraj as ‘Teertharaj- a global tourist destination,” informed a PDA official associated with the project. “The plan is to develop Prayagraj as international tourism hub while retaining and embellishing the regional cultural heritage and customs including iconic Kumbh and Magh melas.

23-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi links beds with test positivity rate as part of graded Covid action plan||With Delhi preparing for another wave of Covid-19 infections, the state government has decided to link the number of reserved beds with the test positivity rate, as part of the state’s graded-response action plan to thwart any further outbreaks in the Capital.The colour-coded plan, drafted by an expert committee formed by the Delhi government and approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), is similar to a mechanism to fight air pollution during pre-winter months.It classifies outbreak severity into four bands – yellow, amber, orange and red – with each representing a more severe outbreak and, thus, stricter curbs than the one preceding it.“Now, the government has linked the escalation of beds to the graded response plan as well, meaning the hospitals will know how many beds they have to increase if the positivity rate is 0.5% or 5% and so on,” said a Delhi government official who asked not to be named.The official added, “What this means is that the government will not have to go to the state cabinet every time and issue separate orders to increase Covid-19 beds. For the time being, hospitals can use the beds for the treatment of non-Covid-19 patients, since the city’s caseload is very low.”As the fourth wave of infections rapidly expanded its footprint in April, the Delhi government issued four orders within two weeks — on April 12, April 14, April 18, and April 19 — asking government and private hospitals to increase the number of beds reserved to treat patients with the viral infection.At its peak on May 16, Delhi had 27,633 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients. Of these, 60.8% beds were occupied. At the peak of hospitalisations on May 3, there were over 20,000 Covid-19 patients admitted to Delhi hospitals. Just a week before on April 27, Delhi had completely run out of ICU beds — barring 11 meant for women in late stages of pregnancy — when the city had over 4,700 ICU beds earmarked for Covid-19 patients.During the height of the fourth wave, Delhi added 25,294 new infections in a week in the seven days ending April 23. The positivity rate peaked a day earlier, hitting 36.2%.With Covid-19 cases on the decline – Delhi reported only 49 new cases on Thursday – the number of beds earmarked for the treatment of the viral infection in the city has dropped by 10,000 from the peak in May second week. The number of oxygen and ICU beds in the city has also halved, shows data on the government’s Delhi Corona app.Hospitals and makeshift facilities across the city still have over 17,000 beds earmarked for Covid-19, of which only 2.3% were occupied as on Thursday afternoon.Private hospitals, however, are yet to receive any intimation about de-escalating beds. “After the last order by the Delhi government (issued on April 12) reserving a huge proportion (exact proportion different for several different categories of hospitals) of beds for Covid-19, and a reduction in proportion for the hospitals completely reserved a couple of days later, no further orders have been received by private hospitals,” said Dr GS Grewal, president, Delhi Medical Association.Hospitals, however, have been using the beds to treat non-Covid-19 patients, as HT reported on June 24.Central hospitals such as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) also have escalation plans in place for any subsequent waves of the infection. “Keeping in mind the possibility of a third wave, we have not touched the trauma centre beds; it continues to be a dedicated Covid-19 centre. The centre has 250 beds reserved for the illness, but only 45 are occupied. If Covid-19 cases start increasing, the number of beds can be increased to 300,” said a senior administrator from the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-links-beds-with-test-positivity-rate-as-part-of-graded-covid-action-plan-101626979260838.html

No casualty had been reported, the official said. The railway official said the train left Chibadagaon station in Ballia around 9.10 am and as it neared Kareemuddinpur railway station, a snag apparently in the coupling led to large number of bogies getting detached. Varanasi division’s public relation officer Ashok Kumar said that the detachment happened around 9.25 am.The engine driver, however, quickly stopped the train soon after, and the coaches that had got detached stopped on their own as the train hadn’t caught speed when the incident happened, officials said.The engine driver informed the station master of Kareemuddinpur about the incident following which a team comprising engineers and technicians was rushed to the spot and rectified the problem after which the train resumed its onward journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/snag-sarnath-express-train-engine-leaves-bogies-behind-101626979140830.html

The former Indian weightlifter, who is the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal, said that the university will admit students on the basis of their interests and various physical assessments.“We plan to start admitting students for our school section from April next year. Right now, we are in the process of formalising the curriculum and setting up the entire university. We will be offering interested candidates an opportunity to join the school wing of our university and then graduate from the same institute,” said Malleswari.University officials also said that they are currently approaching various stakeholders, including former sportspersons and others working in the field of sports, to develop a “robust” curriculum. “We have to ensure that the curriculum focuses on both the educational and the training aspects of the students. This is why we are holding consultations with all stakeholders to decide on what is the best way to go forward,” she said, adding that 70% of the curriculum will focus on sports and the remaining on academics.For now, the university has appointed administrative officials and is operating from the Thyagaraj Sports Complex. Earlier this month, HT had reported that due to a delay in construction of the varsity campus in Mundka, the Sports University would begin its operations from a government school building and sports complex in Civil Lines.Speaking about her own experiences, Malleswari said, “When we had started training, there was very little infrastructural support or knowledge. We often trained barefoot and in the fields. The idea of the university is to identify those with a passion for sports and provide them the guidance and infrastructure needed to win medals for the country.”Apart from inviting applications from interested candidates, the university will also send its teams to various parts of the country to scout for talent. “Work is going on to establish protocols and assessment criteria for these teams that will cover even villages to look for promising candidates,” she said.In 2019, the Delhi cabinet passed an order to set up the university in Mundka. Officials said the university will offer field-specific degrees that will be at par with those offered in other courses at the graduate, post-graduate and doctoral levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-sports-varsity-to-start-admissions-to-school-section-from-april-next-year-says-v-c-karnam-malleswari-101626978960788.html

Now we have extended it by 30 days,” said a senior DDA official.Resident welfare groups, traders and civil society members in the city have been demanding extension of the deadline to submit their comments since the draft MPD-2041 was put in the public domain in June.RWAs and civil society members welcomed the move but added that the DDA should also put baseline data and achievements of the MPD-2021 in the public domain.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi RWA front, said, “We have submitted our suggestions and objections, but we welcome the decision to extend the deadline. We want DDA to put in public domain details of what all provisions of MPD-2021 were actually implemented. People have a right to know if these plans really work or not. These details will only help us in framing our comments.”Members of the Main Bhi Dilli campaign, a collective that aims to make planning in Delhi “more representative and inclusive”, had earlier flagged the 45-day discussion window as “too short”, especially due to limitations as a result of the pandemic. The collective demanded extending the public consultation period by six months.Shalaka, the coordinator of the campaign, said, “While we welcome DDA’s decision on our repeated requests for extension of the timeframe, we reiterate that DDA must reach out to citizens and do on-ground consultations with marginalised communities -- people living in informal settlement, people with disabilities, women, transgenders, homeless, etc. This should be a rigorous process for the next 30 days. DDA must also launch a helpline number at every zonal office to address the queries.”Vishal Ohri, general secretary of GK-II market association, said, “It is a good thing that DDA has extended the date. Irrespective of the objections and suggestions it receives, the DDA should start meeting traders’ bodies and RWAs concerned to improve the ambiguities in the MPD-41, if they are really interested in improving it and making it practical. Otherwise, it is all an eye wash.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dda-extends-deadline-to-submit-comments-on-delhi-s-2041-master-plan-by-a-month-101626978901386.html

Auto drivers are being heavily challaned,” advocate Paras Jain, appearing for the union and the drivers, told the court which listed the next date for hearing on August 20.The petition filed through advocate Mohini Dubey has stated that there are dozens of prominent shades of both khaki and grey and since no particular shade had been stipulated, the enforcement authorities were left with a wide berth on who they wanted to prosecute.The petition also stated that the uniform itself has not been defined so as to mean pant-shirt, safari suit or kurta-pajama and that even specifications of fabrics, trims and accessories are also absent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hcnotice-to-centre-delhi-govt-over-uniforms-for-auto-taxi-drivers-101626978900814.html

Now the three-member commission has two people - the chairman and member AK Ambasht.A senior government official said the annual revised power tariffs are likely to be issued soon. “With the appointment of the new DERC chief, we can expect the tariff order anytime now. The new chairperson will review it once. The tariff order is, otherwise, ready and there is unlikely to be any hike in electricity charges this time again,” said the official on condition of anonymity.Delhi government officials said the name of justice Husnain was strongly recommended to the Delhi government by the acting chief justice of Allahabad high court Munishwar Nath, saying that he will be a great asset to the institution.

However, two days before the date of the elections, polling was postponed on account of the second wave of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dsgmcelections-on-aug-22-results-by-aug-31-101626978841307.html

The focus is also on different areas in the city that have reported high number of cases,” said Dr Manoj Agrawal, chief medical officer of Lucknow. Aliganj reported a maximum 26518 Covid cases, Chinhat 19281, Alambagh 18213, Old City 11823, NK Road 7663, Silver Jubilee (Chowk) 11823, Qaiserbagh 5385 Aishbagh 3394 and Sarojininagar7549. In all, these areas contributed to over 41% of the total over 2.38 lakh cases reported in Lucknow till now. The average collection of Covid samples in Lucknow is over 17,000. The number of daily cases in Lucknow has now come to its lowest level.On Thursday there were three new cases. A day before on Wednesday there were only four new cases. There have been no fresh deaths since the past two weeks. “Since threat from a probable third wave looms, focused sampling is an important task at present. Such a practice, if continued for long, will make sure that if any new variant enters the state it will be traced quickly and won’t spread much,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. The city has been divided into 24 sectors. Each sector will have 70 rapid response teams to screen the population and do a sampling of suspected ones. Those coming from high case positivity rate states would be identified and would be traced for symptoms, said health officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-screening-at-airport-rly-and-bus-stations-in-lko-101626978720852.html
23-07-2021||Delhi||IMD predicts light rain over the weekend, heavy rains from Monday in Delhi||Light to moderate rainfall, instead of the heavy rainfall predicted earlier, is likely to continue in parts of the National Capital Region on Friday, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday, adding that intense showers will once again hit the city on Monday.“On Thursday also some parts of Delhi received light rains and this will continue through the weekend as well,” said a senior Met official.The official said that light to moderate rains, accompanied with thunderstorm and gusty winds blowing at a speed of 30-40kmph, will continue through Friday in isolated pockets.On Thursday, the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, recorded a maximum temperature of 34 degrees Celsius (°C), a notch below what is considered normal for this time of the year, and a minimum temperature of 25.6°C, which is on par with the normal temperature.Despite a slow start, as on July 22, Delhi has covered its rainfall deficit and recorded a surplus rainfall of nearly 27%. Most of this was due to the heavy rains between July 18 and July 20. From June 1 to July 22, Delhi usually receives 192mm rainfall, but the city has already recorded 248mm rain this time.Early in June, the IMD predicted the onset of southwest monsoon in northwest India, including in Delhi, by June 15, which would have been the earliest monsoon ever. After a string of wrong predictions, monsoon finally reached Delhi on July 13 this year, after a delay of 16 days from its normal date.Met officials said that despite the delayed arrival, July is likely to record “normal to above normal” rains.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather, too sided with the IMD prediction. “The trough has shifted north and now the possibility of heavy rain is from July 26. Between July 26 and July 29, the city will receive good rains,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/imdpredicts-light-rain-over-the-weekend-heavy-rains-from-monday-101626978660760.html
23-07-2021||Lucknow||Azad Samaj Party exploring pre-poll alliance in Uttar Pradesh||The Azad Samaj Party (ASP) led by Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad will contest the 2022 assembly election in Uttar Pradesh in alliance with like-minded political parties.The Congress, the nine-party alliance of the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha and Samajwadi Party leaders had parleys with the Bhim Army chief over the pre-poll alliance in the assembly election.Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Chandrashekhar said the ASP had not finalized the alliance and talks were on with various political parties. The decision over alliance and the number of seats the ASP would contest would be decided soon, he said.To mobilize the party cadre for the assembly elections, the ASP launched a bicycle yatra on July 1 in 403 assembly segments in the state. The 21-day yatra concluded at Lucknow on Wednesday (July 21). The party organized the cycle yatra before elections to grab the legacy of Dalit icon and BSP founder Kanshi Ram. “To mobilize the Dalit community, Kanshi Ram had travelled on bicycle across UP,” Chandrashekhar said.The ASP will the raise the issue of increasing atrocities over the Dalit community in UP, appointment on vacant posts according to the reservation formula and implementation of SC/ST/OBC reservation policy in appointments for government jobs.The ASP would also raise the issue of rise in the prices of essential commodities, misuse of government machinery and use of money and muscle power by the BJP in the recently concluded zila panchayat chairperson and block pramukh elections, he said.To win the support of the Muslim community, Azad had met Shia cleric Syed Saif Abbas on Wednesday.The ASP had contested the Bihar assembly election held in October last year in alliance with Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) led by Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav. ASP and JAP joined Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA) of the smaller political parties. The ASP failed to open its account despite a month -long campaign by Chandrashekhar Azad.In the zila panchayat ward election s held in UP in May the Bhim Army made its presence felt, winning wards in Bijnore, Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/azad-samaj-party-exploring-pre-poll-alliance-in-up-101626978540735.html
23-07-2021||Delhi||Uptick in use of ration card scheme in Delhi, days after roll-out||At least 400 ration card holders registered in other states availed food grains from fair price shops in Delhi on Thursday, up from only two such transactions on Tuesday, a day after the ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ (ONORC) scheme was notified in the national capital by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government.Government records seen by HT said that in the three days since the scheme was notified in Delhi, around 430 ration card holders registered in other states have availed food grains here. Of these, around 400 availed rations on Thursday, 28 on Wednesday and only two on Tuesday.Of the 430 such ration card holders, 224 are from Bihar, 190 from Uttar Pradesh, and the remaining from Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Odisha, showed government records said.The state government on Monday issued orders for the complete roll-out of the central programme from this month, following a June 29 Supreme Court order that asked Delhi, West Bengal, Assam and Chhattisgarh to implement the scheme in its entirety by July 31Senior officials said the numbers are expected to increase in the coming days as awareness of the scheme spreads and more ration are distributed in the city’s 2,000 fair price shops.Delhi has 1.78 million ration card households, which translates to around 7.2 million beneficiaries. According to government estimates, migrants with ration cards registered in other states will add another 200,000 households, translating to around another million beneficiaries.Currently, ration beneficiaries are entitled to a monthly supply of food grains and sugar under the National Food Security Act, 2013, which covers the general public distribution system (PDS), and additional 5kg of foodgrains per month under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) — is a special arrangement in light of the Covid-19 pandemic that has affected household incomes across India.In June, when a pilot of the scheme was initiated engaging 42 fair price shops in the city, 373 ration card holders from other states availed its benefits. Of the total such card holders, 212 were from Uttar Pradesh, 150 from Bihar, and the remaining were from Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Odisha and Jharkhand, showed government records.Senior government officials said that the numbers roughly reflect the demographic composition of Delhi’s migrant population.Delhi has the second highest population of inter-state migrants in India, according to 2011 census data on migration released in July 2019 -- trailing only Maharashtra, which is a much larger and more populous state. The data said that more than 6.3 million people in the city – roughly 40% of its population recorded in the 2011 Census – were migrants from other states. It also said that roughly three-fourth of the total migrants were from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and a large number of them had arrived in the city between 2001 and 2011.“The Delhi government has started the ration distribution in line with new practices through e-PoS from all fair price shops in Delhi to each PDS beneficiary… The distribution under ONORC scheme is now also being implemented through all e-PoS enabled fair price shops in Delhi and this facility will be available to all migrant beneficiaries under national portability scheme,” said Delhi’s food minister Imran Hussain.Shailendra Kumar, president of the Delhi Public Distribution System Welfare Association, said, “There were some glitches initially. The process has picked up now. People are getting ration without hassles.”Monday’s order, issued by the state food supplies and consumer affairs department, stated that the distribution of ration under the National Food Security Act, 2013, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, and any other scheme implemented through fair price shops in the Capital will henceforth be done only through electronic point of sale (e-PoS) machines – which are Aadhaar-based biometric devices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/uptick-in-use-of-ration-card-scheme-in-delhi-days-after-rollout-101626978480801.html
23-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi to get 50 battery swapping stations soon||The Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL), which operates Delhi’s CNG distribution, is planning to launch 50 battery swapping and charging points at its CNG stations across the Capital, a move, that senior officials of the Delhi government said, is likely to boost the electric autorickshaws, for which the Delhi government has decided to reserve 4,000 permits.“IGL is looking to diversify beyond the CNG and PNG distribution. It will soon foray into providing electric charging points. To start with, the company is planning to start with 50 battery swapping facilities at its CNG stations. It will support the fleet of 4,000 e-autos, which will be granted permits by the Delhi government. It is likely to be commissioned by the end of this year,” said a senior official.Currently, Delhi has at least 85 charging points for electric vehicles. On July 14, the Delhi government floated a tender to select vendors for setting up charging stations for electric vehicles (EV) in spaces such as shopping malls, theatres, multiplexes, departmental stores, hospitals and residential areas.This is separate from the tenders floated and work orders issued by the government to empanel vendors who will be setting up 500 EV charging points across 100 locations--most of them in bus depots and outside metro stations in the city.Records seen by HT show that since August last year, when the EV policy was announced, Delhi registered over 13,963 EVs. Of these, 8,012 (57.3%) vehicles got the incentives offered by the Delhi government. Of the 8,012 EVs, 4,782 (59.6%) new e-rickshaws were given subsidies under the EV policy --- the highest among all vehicle categories. This was followed by electric two-wheelers, 1,340 of which received the benefits. Only 610 e-cars were registered from August last year till July 20.On August 7, the AAP government notified the Delhi EV Policy 2020 that was unveiled by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in December 2019 with an aim to reduce air pollution and kickstart the economy by spurring the demand for electric vehicles. It envisages that 25% of all new vehicle registrations should be battery electric vehicles (BEVs) by 2024. The policy offers subsidies, and road tax and registration free waivers, for electric vehicles bought in the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-to-get-50-battery-swapping-stations-soon-101626978420794.html
23-07-2021||Mumbai||Citizens furious as parts of Mumbai receive muddy water||The residents from several areas in the city like Worli, Dadar, Mahim, Kandivli, Mumbai Central have complained of getting muddy drinking water supply for the past three days. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), however, said that the water supply was affected after the heavy rainfall inundated the Bhandup water filtration plant on Sunday, and the advisory to boil drinking water has been issued. The BMC has said the problem would be resolved in a day.On Sunday, following heavy rainfall, rainwater entered the Bhandup complex, forcing BMC to shut down the water purification system and electric supply, as a precautionary measure. Excess stormwater (rainwater) from the Bhandup complex drains into Vihar lake. Since the lake also overflowed on Sunday morning, it did not accept stormwater accumulated inside the complex. This led to waterlogging and inundated the complex building.Following this, several parts of the city did not receive the regular municipal drinking water supply on Sunday morning. Water supply to parts of the eastern suburbs was also affected.Dhanpal Jain, a resident of Worli said, “The colour of the water is yellow. Even after boiling, the water is not drinkable. Citizens are prone to water-borne diseases like cholera, typhoid, jaundice, skin infections and gastric diseases. For people like us, it is relatively easy to buy mineral water from outside and consume it. However, many are consuming the same water by boiling it, as they cannot afford mineral water.”Another Worli resident, Praneshan MS said, “We are getting yellowish, muddy water since Wednesday. It cannot be boiled or used even for washing clothes or bathing.”Mahim resident Irfan Machiwala said, “We have been getting muddy water since Monday. I also complained to the local ward’s water department officials. But their response is standard that the problem is due to the Bhandup plant’s waterlogging. It has been five days to the incident now, but the civic body is still not able to find a solution for the same.”Ajay Rathore, chief of BMC’s hydraulics department said, “The problem is due to the waterlogging at Bhandup’s plant. We are assuming that something went during maintenance work and the situation was very difficult at that time. However, only some parts of the city are affected. By tomorrow, the situation will get normal everywhere.”The BMC supplies around 3,850 million litres of drinking water to the city against the demand of over 4,000 million litres daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/citizens-furious-as-parts-of-mumbai-receive-muddy-water-101626977940757.html
23-07-2021||Pune||Dead fish, by the hundreds, found floating on Pune’s Jambhulwadi lake||PUNE Dead fish by the hundreds were found on the surface of the Jambhulwadi lake on Thursday morning, with crowds of people rushing to collect them. The reason behind the dead fish floating to the surface of the lake is still not known, but according to fishermen in the area, who regularly fish on the lake, it is because of mud waves inside the lake. A total of 10 tonnes of dead fish were found and taken away by people.Jambhulwadi lake, which is close to Katraj chowk, is surrounded by many residential housing societies and a bypass road passes over the lake. On Thursday at 6 am, hundreds of fish started floating to the surface and people out on their morning walks were shocked to at the sight. “It was dawn and suddenly hundreds of fish were coming out of the water and they were lying all at the side of the lake. As the time passed, many people from nearby areas got to know about it and started coming to the lake to collect the fish,” said Manohar Pardeshi, a fisherman, whose family has been given a contract to fish on the Jambhulwadi lake by the state fisheries department. “When we came to know about the incident all our workers and family members rushed to the spot and started collecting the dead fish. It might because of the mud waves inside the lake. It was around 10 tonne fish which came out from the lake,” added Pardeshi. People, including children, women and senior citizens were rushing in to collect the fish for free. Mahesh Kamble, a resident of the area said, “I managed to collect around 10 big fish lying at the side of the lake. I don’t know whether the fish are good to be eat, but I will distribute it amongst our family and friends.”An official from the department of fisheries who rushed to the spot, speaking on the condition of anonymity said, “We are checking the reason for this incident.
