14-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra approves adventure tourism policy to make it safe for people||Maharashtra government on Wednesday approved a policy for adventure tourism to streamline adventure activities across the state. The policy was approved in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday and detailed guidelines will soon be issued by the tourism department. The new policy has focused on the safety of the people and covers all tour operators that organise adventure tourism except adventure sports, performance-oriented sports, forest safari and nature trips.The policy will establish a regulatory framework for the sector with guidelines on necessary training of personnel and equipment etc. It will make it mandatory for tour operators to register with the state tourism directorate and take all necessary precautions while organising adventure tours, officials said.State tourism and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said the priority of the government is to save lives of the people. “There were no rules related to adventure tourism and accidents were also happening. The policy is an attempt to streamline the activities by covering all the three mediums of adventure tourism — land, water and air. It will cover all tour operators that organise adventure tourism. It means they will have to follow all the rules while organizing adventure tourism tours for amateurs and tourists,” Thackeray said.“The state government’s priority is to save the lives of the people. We want to encourage adventure tourism and send a message that it is safe for them. We want Maharashtra to lead in tourism once Covid pandemic is over,” he said.A senior official from tourism department said, “All tour operators that are related to adventure tourism will have to make a temporary registration with the tourism directorate. They will get permanent registration once they fulfil all the criteria. Following which they will have to follow guidelines to be issued by the tourism department and take all the necessary precautions mentioned.” The activities that come under adventure tourism are mountaineering, trekking, bungee jumping, mountain biking, cycling, canoeing, scuba diving, rafting, kayaking, zip-lining, paragliding, hiking, exploring, canyoneering, sandboarding, caving and rock climbing.Maharashtra is the fifth state in the country in terms of organising a number of adventure tours and is expected to be on top with the help of this policy.“There was no rule in the state making it mandatory for tour operators for registration. There are lots of fly-by-night people in the profession who are not following regular safety procedures. We have brought in registration and guidelines so that the safety and security of tourists is not compromised,” said Valsa Nair Singh, principal secretary, tourism department.She said the guidelines will be strict, making it mandatory to have experts in the team going for adventure tourism, equipment, first-aid preparedness, insurance etc. There will also be a mandatory site inspection for completing the registration process for tour operators, she added.The government has also decided to form three committees for monitoring and effective implementation of the policy. One will be a state-level committee headed by the tourism secretary, second would be divisional-level committee and third would be local-level committees. All these committees will have experts from the field and officials from sports, forest and police departments, the principal secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-approves-adventure-tourism-policy-to-make-it-safe-for-people-101626287340536.html

14-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: DC cracks whip against poor mobile connectivity||Deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar has given a 15-day ultimatum to mobile service providers (MSPs) to take steps to improve the signal reception across Chandigarh.In a recent meeting with MSPs and heads of different departments, the deputy commissioner (DC) enquired about the reasons behind poor mobile reception being encountered across the city in recent times.“The MSPs contended that the work from home (WFH) culture has led to a dramatic change in the usage pattern of mobile transmission,” said Kuljit Paul Singh Mahi, additional deputy commissioner (ADC) and the nodal officer under Chandigarh Right of Way Policy for Telecom Infrastructure.MSPs had created higher density of mobile towers and transmission infrastructure in commercial spaces and near office complexes, such as IT Park, as the demand for these services was more in these locations. “But, with the pandemic, the demand pattern has shifted to residential areas, where there is relatively smaller footprint of towers and other related infrastructure,” said Mahi.The firms will have to reconfigure their existing mobile tower infrastructure to provide improved services in residential areas. “The DC has asked them to do so in order to resolve problems such as drop calls, poor mobile signal and low mobile internet speeds,” said the ADC.Residents decry poor signalResidents complain that poor mobile reception has become a severe problem in the past few months, even affecting their work.Vasudev Vashisht, an IT professional working with a multi-national company, said: “Since the start of the pandemic, we have shifted to WFH, and mobile network has become key to our functioning. But, for the past few months, mobile signals have become very erratic. Call drop, particularly during longer calls, keeps disrupting our work.”“There are no physical meetings nowadays. We are dependent upon virtual meetings, but with poor mobile connectivity, we are losing key business. We have tried changing the MSP, but the problem persists,” said Naveen Manglani, presidents, Chamber of Chandigarh Industries.Admn to facilitate infra expansionWhile the MSPs can improve services to certain extent with the existing infrastructure, the expansion of network is required for resolving the issue on a long-term basis.In view of this, Brar has also directed local departments, including estate, urban planning and municipal corporation, to facilitate faster approvals for setting up mobile towers in the city.An MSP has to take consent from different departments, and a feasibility study is done by the urban planning department for erecting a mobile tower. “Currently, they have to follow the process physically. But, we are also setting up a web portal dedicated to MSPs for them to get necessary approvals online, which will speed up the process,” said Mahi.The UT administration in February this year notified the Chandigarh Right of Way Policy for Telecom Infrastructure for the city. It envisages a single-window electronic application process for submission of all applications relating to the Right of Way. All departments have to appoint a nodal officer to deal with such applications. Earlier, the NOC was given by the estate office, but now the ADC has been made the nodal officer.“We recently received around 32 applications for the erection of new mobile towers, but were rejected as they were incomplete. We have asked the firms to submit the applications again,” said the ADC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-dc-cracks-whip-against-poor-mobile-connectivity-101626286920946.html

As many as 29,259 beneficiaries having ration cards in UP availed food grains in 18 other states between May 2020 and June 2021 while 5,891 people having their ration cards registered in 12 other states bought their ration from PDS shops in UP, data sourced from the food and civil supplies department showed. “The largest number UP’s ration cards were used in Haryana where 9996 UP families/migrants bought subsidized food from PDS shops there followed by Maharashtra (4746) and Gujarat (4323,” said commissioner, food and civil supplies, Manish Chauhan. As many as 2505 families using UP’s ration cards bought food grain in Daman and Diu also. Among other states where migrants from UP availed their ration during the period were Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chandigarh, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, MP, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Tripura and Uttarakhand. According to Chauhan,, the highest number of transactions in UP were made by Maharashtra with 3535 people using Maharashtra’s ration cards procured their monthly PDS quota in UP followed by Haryana (803) and Bihar (679). The intra-district and inter-district transactions were found to be relatively higher. According to the data more than 1.63 crore households with their ration cards registered at a PDS shop in one place bought food grain from a PDS shop at any other place within the same district between August 2019 and June 2021. Similarly, around 14 lakh families living in one district bought food grain in the other district within UP during the same period. “Besides, a total of 58,74,734 intra-district and 6,19,012 inter-district transactions were made under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKAY) under which food grain was provided free of cost to ration card holders and others between May 2020 to October, 2020 and from May2021 till June, 2021,” Chauhan said. Under the ration card portability that is a part of the Central government’s One Nation, One Ration Card project, eligible beneficiaries can access subsidized/free food grain in the state where they are living and not necessarily in their native place where their ration card is registered. Calling One Nation, One Ration Card, “an important citizen-centric reform, the Supreme Court on June 29 set deadline of July 31 for all states to implement the scheme. The Centre told the Supreme Court that four states—Assam, Chhatisgarh, Delhi and West Bengal—were yet to implement the One Nation, One Ration Card scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/use-of-ration-card-portability-on-the-rise-in-uttar-pradesh-101626286860450.html

This year the kanwariyas have been given permission to play DJ music during yatra, with some preconditions. Following the decision of the state government and hoping to make up for the loss in business due to first and second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, roadside shops near Sangam and Daraganj are being set up to enable kanwariyas buy things they need during the journey. The month of Shravan would begin from July 25 and excited kanwariyas said they were eager to undertake the arduous religious trek. A host of items are on display at many of these makeshift roadside-vends, from saffron colored dresses, t-shirts, different sizes of tumblers, shoes, hand bands, rudraksh malas with 108 beads, decorated sticks with handles (to hang the vessels) and several other things that are in great demand among the kanwariyas. “This year, the shopkeepers are selling eye-catching artistic works, both on the t-shirts and the sticks that would be used by the kanwariyas. DJ music, though only for playing religious songs, has been allowed and this is a great move that would make the trek truly enjoyable and motivating”, said Mahesh Chandra, 38 who has been undertaking this journey for a decade now. “Apart from the dresses, the main attractions of these shops are the decorative items which we use for decorating the kanwar stick,” he shared. The Kanwar stick is prepared by the family members of shop owners and a colourful stick costs anywhere between ₹150 to ₹350, depending on the vessel, decorations, quality. “Due to the pandemic, the cost of t-shirt and other items have increased as compared to past, but we are happy that at least we would be undertaking the yatra while following all the Covid-19 protocols, said Rajesh Kumar Singh, another kanwariya. The t-shirts, with pictures of lord Shiva, is being sold between ₹150 to ₹250, shorts are being sold for ₹80 to ₹150, bags for ₹50 to ₹65, flowers for ₹10 to ₹15 a piece and waist pouches for ₹150 to ₹250. Suraj Yadav, 42, a local shop owner of Daraganj said, “We are happy that we would have some business during these testing times and believe that lord Shiva will bless us all through the kanwariyas who arrive at our shop.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/roadside-vends-come-up-ahead-of-kanwar-yatra-101626286621419.html

14-07-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Two borewells sealed as carcinogenic level 46 times safe limit||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) ordered two borewells in Ghaziabad sealed after groundwater samples from there were found to have the carcinogenic hexavalent chromium at almost 46 times the safe limit.The borewells are located in the Meerut Road Industrial Area adjoining the Lohiya Nagar residential locality. Authorities said the contamination source was a plot where heavy metal waste were previously dumped and that they would engage a survey to find out the extent of contamination.“On February 27, the CPCB had collected 13 groundwater samples from different points in Ghaziabad, including three from the two borewells. The three samples were found to have more than permissible limit of hexavalent chromium (0.05 mg/litre). The CPCB has directed the closure of the borewells,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). “We have informed the district officials and the two borewells will be sealed once a magistrate is available.”Citing the test report, officials said that the three samples contained 0.49mg/litre, 1.36mg/litre and 5.05mg/litre of hexavalent chromium - an average of 2.3mg/litre, which is 46 times the safe limit of 0.05mg/litre.In 2010, the UPPCB had found that the groundwater there had been polluted by several units that were engaged in chrome plating. “After that, the units set up a remediation plant in the locality and treated the groundwater,” Sharma added. He said that the measure was largely successful in taking off a great deal of the contamination. “But the plot on which the waste was once dumped continues to contaminate the groundwater,” he said. “No waste is currently being dumped there but it has not been cleaned either.” The report also found presence of iron in five samples, lead in four samples, nickle in one and manganese in four samples. Officials said that these too were found beyond to be at levels beyond the permissible limits.The CPCB has directed more tests in one kilometre radius of the two borewells to ascertain the extent of contamination.“The responsible parties may be directed to carry out detailed site investigation study to ascertain the source and extent of contamination in soil and groundwater followed by risk assessment and remediation of contaminated site at Lohiya Nagar,” the CPCB recommendation, said.City-based environmentalist and lawyer Akash Vashishtha said that heavy metals, which cannot be removed completely by home filters, can adversely impact health. “Hexavalent chromium can impact liver and kidneys as well, besides causing other health issues. The primary source of contamination is in the industrial area and over a period of time the contamination has spread to other adjoining localities. A hydrogeological survey followed by remediation is must,” said Vashishtha.In February 2020, the UPPCB also sampled groundwater from nearby Raj Nagar residential locality and the industrial area. It had found that four of the 14 samples were had hexavalent chromium beyond permissible limits.“A second sampling was done in January this year and that found little hexavalent chromium. However, we need to continuously monitor the area and we have also recommended a hydrogeological survey. Assessments indicate that the Meerut Road Industrial Area is a major source of contamination from where it possibly spread to other nearby areas,” the UPPCB regional officer said.Vashishtha, however, pointed out that the second sampling had not considered the original sampling points of February 2020.“There is a nursery across the road in Raj Nagar and its occupants still drink the yellowish water. So, the contamination is still there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-two-borewells-sealed-as-carcinogenic-level-46-times-safe-limit-101626286380400.html

14-07-2021||Mumbai||Visa, second shot problems at home for students going abroad||More than a month after Maharashtra announced a special vaccination drive on priority for students enrolled in universities abroad, many are still scrambling for visa and their second shot in time for the start of the fall semester next month.Many students have taken to social media platforms including Twitter to share their travel woes. “Flights from India are not yet allowed to enter Canada, so some of us have booked tickets to travel to another country from India first, and then take a separate flight from there to Canadian cities,” said Mohit Patel, another student enrolled for a Masters in Data Management at the Northeastern University in Toronto. Patel is spending nearly ₹1 lakh more to fly to Mexico and then to Toronto to avoid the travel restrictions.The Centre opened universal vaccination for adults on May 1 but asked states to bear the cost and burden of vaccinating those in the age group of 18 to 44 years by procuring vaccines directly from the manufacturers. However, several manufacturers, including the two supplying vaccine doses to the Centre – Serum Institute India and Bharat BioTech – were unable to supply directly to the states, the first on account of the lack of approvals and indemnity and the latter due to insufficient production. On June 21, the Centre began to procure vaccines for this age category too. Till then, states including Maharashtra began to prioritise students who needed to travel abroad by allocating specific dates for their vaccinations.Another policy decision spelled further delay. In May, the Union health ministry announced that it would increase the gap between the two shots of Covishield to 84 to 112 days (it was previously 42 to 56 days sparking worry among students about reaching their allotted universities in time. This rule however changed recently by the central government, and students can now opt for their second dose of the vaccine within 28 days of their first shot.Students from small towns said that they were struggling to convince authorities about the reduced gap. Yash Nayak, 22, has already got his visa to the United States approved, but he’s still unsure when he will be allowed to take the second shot of Covishield. He is in a Masters in Science (MS) in Management Information Systems (MIS) at the University of Buffalo.“I got my first dose and as per the 28-day rule, I should be getting my second vaccine now. But unlike cities like Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai where students are being vaccinated on a priority basis, authorities in smaller cities are still demanding that we wait for the second shot,” said Yash, who resides in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh. “First it was the fight for getting vaccinated, then we had to wait for the government to decrease the gap between two shots of Covishield and now it’s the seemingly never-ending wait for visas. I received my visa papers for Canada on May 4 but till date haven’t received the passport submission and payment link. Few people I know through Twitter and I are waiting to hear from VFS Global for an update,” said Priyesh Sharma, who will be pursuing a one year post graduate degree in communications from the University of Ottawa.The government of Canada on their official website have also clarified that even though flights from India are currently suspended, students who completed the submission of their study permit application before May 15 should get a confirmed decision from the visa authorities by August 6, 2021. “We will process complete applications submitted after May 15 as quickly as possible—but we can’t guarantee that you (student) will get a final decision before the fall semester begins,” a statement read.On July 8, the Twitter handle of VFS Global Care, posted: “Please note that Canada VAC (visa application process) have started Passport Submission Service in a phased manner. Customers who completed their 2-way courier process prior to the lockdown will be contacted by VFS Global by email.”VFS Global is a private firm that manages the passport and visa-related administrative work for a host of countries around the world.Tamil Nadu resident Rathin Umesh, 22, has received his US visa and has both shots of Covishield vaccine. His tickets to the US are for August 4. What is holding him back, however, is the fear of the new Delta variant of Covid. “My parents and I are equally worried about the new variants of Covid-19, which research shows is bypassing the vaccine effect as well. I really hope to reach my university healthy,” said Rathin, who is going to pursue a Masters in automotive engineering technology from the Minnesota State University. Akshay Chaturvedi, CEO & Founder of Leverage Edu, an EdTech and career guidance company, said the concerns of students also depends on the country they are heading to.“So far there has been absolutely no problem that has come from our students heading to the UK, a huge testament to how the country has handled the pandemic. Our students who are now going to the US have started booking their visa slots in the last few weeks,” said Chaturvedi. “However, the embassy and the government has acknowledged that they are currently managing a huge influx of student visa applications and have advised students to be in constant touch with their universities for alternate options in case visa interview dates aren’t available before their start date. However, this is a very rare instance and we are talking to university partners and students on a daily basis to ensure the right information is carried from source to destination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/visa-second-shot-problems-at-home-for-students-going-abroad-101626285780371.html
14-07-2021||Mumbai||NTA’s new changes to NEET-UG pattern leave students worried||In view of the reduction of the Class 12 syllabus across education boards, the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for undergraduate (UG) medical and dental students will have a change in paper pattern for the first time since its inception in 2016. The announcement came through the official exam brochure which was released by the National Testing Agency (NTA) late on Tuesday evening. Even as students are still unclear about the reason behind this move, the NTA clarified that the changes were introduced keeping in mind the reduction of the syllabus by various school education boards for their Class 12 students in 2020-21, considering the loss of academic time due to Covid. “To rationalise the decision of reduction in the syllabus by various school education boards, the NTA has taken the decision to provide choice in Section “B” for each of the four subjects,” clarified NTA through an information bulletin.Students have now approached the examination authority for clarity on the marking system of the new paper pattern. Until 2020, the NEET-UG paper pattern consisted of 180 objective type questions from physics, chemistry and biology (botany and zoology) to be answered on a specially designed sheet using a ballpoint pen only. Each correct answer gives students four marks and each wrong answer deducts one mark. According to NTA, the new paper pattern will now comprise two sections under each subject. Section A will consist of 35 questions that students have to attempt compulsorily, and section B will consist of 15 questions from which the candidate can choose to attempt any 10 questions. The amount of time to solve the paper remains the same and the marking pattern remains similar to last year as well. This choice of choosing 10 questions out of 15 has confused students. “When NTA says students can attempt any 10 out of 15, will students be marked in the negative for a wrong answer? Also, if a student chooses to attempt all 15 questions, will the NTA choose only the correct answers for the final marks or choose the first 10 answers only? Such questions are running in all our minds,” said the parent of a NEET-UG aspirant. After much delay, NTA earlier this week announced that the all-India exam will be conducted on September 12 this year and registrations for the exam started this week. While medical and dental aspirants were relieved to finally get information on their exams, this change in exam pattern has introduced new anxieties for students. “Instead of a 180-mark paper, we will now be attempting a 200 mark paper. This automatically means we should get more time to appear for the exam, but NTA has clarified that we will get three hours only. How is this fair?” asked Soniya Talreja, a NEET-UG aspirant. In separate letters and emails addressed to the NTA, students and parents have sought clarity to these questions, and at the same time also demanded that NTA release mock test papers for students to solve before they appear for the actual exam. “We also insist that NTA inform all exam centres to ensure that students are given 15-minute reading time of the question papers before the exam begins so that they are in a good head-space to attempt the three-hour test,” said another parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ntas-new-changes-to-neet-ug-pattern-leaves-students-worried-101626285720520.html
14-07-2021||Mumbai||Ola-Uber cab rates hiked by 15% in Mumbai||Amid the continuous increase in fuel prices in the city since May 3, mobile phone application-based cab aggregators Uber and Ola have also hiked their fares by 15%. The hike in fares of both app-based taxis has been done across different states in India, corresponding to the rise in fuel rates.Officials from both companies said their drivers demanded an increase due to the constant hike in fuel prices. Mumbai has one of the highest fuel prices in India — one litre of petrol was priced at ₹107.20, while one litre of diesel was available at ₹97.29. Compressed natural gas (CNG), too, has seen a hike in price. “The demand for rise in fares by drivers started in May when fuel prices were increasing across the country. The increase in fuel prices was studied and then the fares were increased.” said officials from Ola and Uber, who requested anonymity. Both Uber and Ola refused to comment on the fare hike in Mumbai and the new fare structure. Passengers have complained about the hike in fares. “I travel between Byculla and Chinchpokli at Rs30, but when I booked an Ola cab on Wednesday, I had to pay Rs45. The hike is not justified as there has been an increase in prices of everyday products.” said Anil Jain, a Byculla resident. “I have noticed an increase in fare prices of both Ola and Uber. Last week, I had booked a cab from Thane to Nariman Point and the rate was around Rs550. Later, towards the end of the week when I tried booking, the fare was Rs900.” said Savita Yadav, a 34-year-old Thane resident.The drivers, however, have stated that there has been only a minimal increase. “If passengers are noticing an increase in fares at present, that could be because of rainfall. During rainfall, there are fewer vehicles on the road. The increase in fare is minimal and is not going to help drivers substantially.” said an Uber cab driver, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/olauber-cab-rates-hiked-by-15-in-mumbai-101626285721260.html

14-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai corporators demand citizen-friendly online booking system for Covid vax slots||The corporators across the party lines have demanded that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) should make the online booking of vaccination slots more citizen-friendly. Further, from Thursday onwards, vaccination for pregnant women will take off at 35 vaccination centres across the city.The corporators said that every ward opens slots at a separate time, which leads to confusion. Hence, they have suggested that online slots for vaccination centres be released at a fixed time across the city and the information be shared on social media platforms.BJP corporator Abhijit Samant said, “I have written a letter to the municipal commissioner requesting that there should be a uniform time for all wards to release their slots on the Co-WIN portal. Further, the BMC should also decide on a fixed time to announce whether there will be vaccination or not on the next day. There are a lot of citizens who are struggling to get an appointment for their second slot. This makes it more difficult for citizens to get their slot booked online.”Asif Zakaria, Congress corporator from Bandra said, “More citizen-friendly steps should be taken by the BMC when it comes to vaccination. There should be a uniform time for releasing slots. I have seen senior citizens struggling to book their slots online as there is no fixed time when the slots are released.”Zakaria added, “Also, for walk-in vaccination citizens form a queue at 5am or 6am and get free only by noon. I have requested the BMC to arrange water, tea and biscuits to be given to citizens. The citizens will happily pay provided they get such a facility. The BMC’s earlier plan of having vaccination on a walk-in basis for three days a week and on the basis of online appointments for the rest of the week was better. It was catering to all citizens, and everyone was getting covered.”Meanwhile, on Wednesday 65,244 citizens were vaccinated taking the total count of vaccination to 6,233,629. On Thursday, vaccination will be conducted between 2 pm to 5 pm owing to limited availability of vaccine doses.The BMC in a statement on Wednesday said that pregnant women in the city will be able to undertake vaccination at 35 vaccination centres across the city on a walk-in basis and no prior appointment will be required for the same.In the statement, the BMC said, “Necessary training has been given to all the concerned staff on Covid vaccination duty to give proper counselling to pregnant women coming for vaccination. Those pregnant women who will be given should be in the full post-pregnancy period. However, women who have developed covid-19 and who have been treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma will be vaccinated after 12 weeks of the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-corporators-demand-citizen-friendly-online-booking-system-for-covid-vax-slots-101626285660382.html
14-07-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC dumps legal size paper for double-sided A4 prints to cut consumption by half||A small step the Bombay high court took on Wednesday could mean a giant leap for the city’s and the state’s judiciary turning environment-friendly. A circular issued by the court’s administration allows the use of the smaller A4 size paper instead of the legal-size paper; a move that, lawyers and court officers say, could reduce paper usage by half. The circular allows the use of A4 size paper, printed on both sides, for filing petitions, affidavits and other pleadings before the high court, and its benches at Nagpur, Aurangabad and Goa. Until now, the court accepted only legal size paper printed on one side, and there were no specifications on the fonts. The new circular specifies fonts (Times New Roman or Georgia), font size (14) and the margins (5cm inner and 3cm outer). Advocate SR Nargolkar, who represents the high court administration, informed the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni of the notification. The effective reduction in paper size is 10% (330mm x 210mm for legal versus 297mm x 210 mm for A4), but the use of both sides for printing will potentially cut down paper consumption by half, a senior court officer said. “It is difficult to estimate how much paper is being used for filing proceedings before the HC, but this shift will cut usage by half and give us more space to store court records.” Nargolkar was responding to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by city lawyer Ajinkya Udane seeking directions to the court administration to shift to A4 size paper. His counsel, PR Katneshwarkar, submitted that the PIL was filed after an earlier petition with similar prayers had been disposed of, asking the petitioner to make a representation to the high court’s registrar general. Katneshwarkar informed the bench that though a representation was made, no decision was taken. The petitioner was, therefore, “constrained to approach the court again.” To be sure, the Bombay HC is not the country’s first court to issue such a direction. According to Udane’s petition, other high courts such as Kolkata, Allahabad, Kerala, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Tripura have already adopted the A4 size paper with both-sides printing as standard. Nargolkar said a notification amending the Bombay High Court (Appellate Side) Rules, 1960 and Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1980 was issued on July 6, so as to allow use of A4 paper, printed on both sides, for pleadings before HC. He said a circular for permitting the use of A4 size paper printed on both sides was issued on Wednesday. The bench then directed Katneshwarkar to make a representation to the HC’s registrar general Mahendra Chandwani to issue directions for allowing use of A4 size paper printed on both sides for pleadings before all subordinate courts in Maharashtra. The circular says, “With a view to bring uniformity about use of paper in day-to-day working on the administrative side, to minimise consumption of paper and consequently to save the environment, Honourable Chief Justice and the Judges of the Bombay High Court have been pleased to direct that henceforth, the Registry shall use A4 size paper (on both sides) for internal communications at all levels in the Registry.” It adds: “It is, clarified that all the pleadings, petitions, affidavits or other documents, etc, filed in the Registry, on Judicial side for the purpose of filing in the High Court and its Benches at Nagpur, Aurangabad and Panaji (Goa) and all other Courts in the State of Maharashtra, the following specifications of paper type would be applicable: ‘Superior quality A4 size paper having not less than 75 GSM with printing on the both sides of the paper with Font - Times New Roman or Georgia, Font size 14 with inner margin of 5cm and outer margin 3cm.” Dr Birendra Saraf, vice president, Bombay Bar Association, welcomed the decision and said that it would contribute to saving not only paper but also pave the way for digitisation of court records. “Once there is uniformity in the size of the paper used, and the process of digitisation is completed, it will be convenient for courts to call for records from lower courts and even while hearing cases in appeal. It will save nearly 60 percent of the paper utilised, a positive step towards saving the environment as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-dumps-legal-size-paper-for-double-sided-a4-prints-to-cut-consumption-by-half-101626285600405.html

14-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra expected to ease few curbs, relax shop timings||The Maharashtra government is expected to take a call on relaxations from the ongoing Covid-19-enforced lockdown in the next few days. Besides the relaxations from mandatory RT-PCR tests for domestic fliers, the state is expected to extend the timings of shops and establishments. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray may take a decision in consultation with the state-appointed task force in the next few days.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the government is positive about relaxations for shops and restaurants, and a decision is likely to be taken soon. Commercial establishments have been demanding for relaxations in their operation timings and have said that they were ready to follow the compulsion of vaccinating staff. Tope said the final decision over it will be taken by the CM, who heads the state disaster management authority.“There was a detailed presentation made in the state cabinet today [Wednesday], but no decision was taken over the relaxations. We have decided to do away with the mandatory RT-PCR [tests] for the domestic fliers coming in from other states if they are fully vaccinated. Similarly, shopkeepers and restaurants have been demanding more relaxations for the operators fully vaccinated. The final decision will be taken by the CM,” he said.Tope said 92% of the 104,000 active patients are in 10 districts, with the remaining 26 districts having only 8% active patients.“The daily caseload has been below 9,000 over the past more than one month. The growth rate in Maharashtra is much low than other states. Although there are instructions by the Centre about third wave, there are no signs of immediate third wave. The decision about relaxations is expected to be taken soon,” he said.According to officials from Mantralaya, the state-appointed task force has submitted its report to the chief minister. The task force of leading doctors has reportedly recommended the relaxations in the districts with test positivity rate of less than 5%, high vaccination cover of more than 70% and where the Covid-appropriate behaviour is strictly followed. The state government is also of the opinion that since there was no significant surge in cases in districts and cities like Nagpur, Navi Mumbai, Thane, which had implemented level 1 and 2 relaxations for some time last month, a few relaxations can be given.“We have completed 100 days of lockdown after starting roll-out on April 5 after second wave hit. With various reports, including that from INSACOG, over the infection scare from the Delta Plus variant, there is no reason to continue the curbs. We will have to go for relaxations in the next few days,” another official said.The task force and the officials from departments involved in Covid-19 management are strictly against the opening up of the local trains in MMR for general public. They point at the fact that the second wave hit MMR only after the local trains were opened for all.“The state will have to take very cautious approach, while unlocking the activities. The Centre has already alerted all states about the potential third wave and advised to avoid crowding at public places. The percentage of the oxygen-occupied beds has again increased to 14% over the past few days. In such a backdrop, the lenient unlocking may cost us dear. Chief minister is in favour of graded relaxations,” he said.Meanwhile, Tope said that they expect the supply of 42 million doses of vaccine by the central government in August. “The centre is expecting the supply of 420 million doses from the manufacturers’ next months. If distributed to the states in the proportion of the population, 10% of it should be supplied to Maharashtra. We are also talking to the private hospitals and corporate houses requesting them to procure maximum of 25% stock allotted to them from the vaccines manufactured in the country. Presently, we have been able to vaccinated around 300,000 people daily on an average owing to the short supply by the Centre,” he said.Tope also announced to recruit 1,000 doctors in the next few days as part of the preparedness ahead of the potential third wave. State cabinet on Wednesday also decided to extend the retirement age of the doctors and medical officials in government services by one year, taking it to 62 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-expected-to-ease-few-curbs-relax-shop-timings-101626285540880.html

The case has been given a “provisional” registration and is awaiting final numbering by the Supreme Court’s registry, a person aware of the matter said.The development comes hours after the Calcutta High Court issued notice to Suvendu Adhikari on Banerjee’s election petition challenging her defeat from Nandigram in the assembly polls. Adhikari defeated the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief by a margin of 1,956 votes. It was her first electoral defeat in 32 years. Banerjee insists that election officials didn’t count the votes properly and when she sought a recount after the results were declared, the returning officer rejected her request.The high court also ordered the Election Commission to preserve all records, devices, such as EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) and video recordings,” Sanjay Basu, a lawyer who represents Banerjee, said after the single judge bench of justice Shampa Sarkar held the first hearing on Wednesday.“Let notice be issued. The matter is made returnable on August 12, 2021. Pending the decision of the case, all documents, election papers, devices, video recordings etc connected with the election which is under challenge before this court shall be preserved by the concerned authority”, justice Sarkar said in her order on Wednesday.Banerjee’s lawyer Sanjay Basu said the court also noted that the election petition does not suffer from any defect under the Representation of the People’s Act.Last week Justice Kausik Chanda recused from the case after imposing a fine of ₹5 lakh on the Trinamool Congress chief for the manner in which she sought his recusal was sought. Banerjee and her party asked for transferring the petition to another judge citing “apprehension of bias” since Justice Chanda had, before his elevation to the bench in 2019, represented the BJP and its leaders in court cases and was seen in photographs sharing a dais with BJP leaders including state unit chief Dilip Ghosh.Justice Chanda, who agreed to step back, however, underlined that it was preposterous to suggest that a judge who had a past association with a political party as a lawyer should not receive a case involving the said political party or any of its members. “The past association of a judge with a political party by itself cannot form apprehension of bias,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/let-mamata-banerjee-s-election-plea-be-heard-outside-bengal-suvendu-adhikari-to-sc-101626285481472.html

He had knowingly misused his power and position to influence others by placing the photographs on a public platform, that is, on Facebook,” the plea read.Besides seeking removal of Khan from the post, the plea sought direction to the authorities to withdraw all facilities given to him and to stop his remuneration.The court listed the matter for further hearing on August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hcseeks-delhi-govt-response-on-plea-seeking-removal-of-minority-commission-chief-101626285301474.html
14-07-2021||Other||HC to Delhi govt: Why Covid facility in Dwarka not been made a super specialty facility?||The Delhi high court on Wednesday rejected the Delhi government’s stand of not developing the Indira Gandhi Hospital in Dwarka as a super specialty facility and keeping it as a dedicated Covid-19 hospital as a precautionary measure for an “imminent” third wave of Covid-19. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh directed the Delhi government to give a fresh timeline by when the super specialty facility can start functioning. The court noted that a Covid facility does not merely mean setting up oxygen beds but also requires other super specialty facilities. The court said, “People of Delhi need treatment and (the) infrastructure available as of now is not adequate.”“Your (Delhi government) other hospitals, some of which are super specialty, have been turned into dedicated Covid-19 facilities. It is not that once you are a Covid patient, you don’t want any other treatment. The patient would want everything, whether a nephrologist, pulmonologist etc,” the bench observed. “It’s not that Covid hospital does not require a super specialty. Therefore, your endeavour should be to make it now… This is not rocket science. There was a need for it and so you thought of making it,” said the bench. The court’s observations came while hearing a plea by the Dwarka court Bar Association, represented by its president advocate Y P Singh, who contended that the Indira Gandhi hospital in Dwarka was not yet functional despite crossing the deadline of 2019. Appearing for the Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra told the court that the hospital will have total 1,241 beds, including 169 ICU beds for Covid management. He said the hospital will be self-sufficient in terms of oxygen requirement with a manifold gas pipeline system, liquid medical oxygen storage, distribution tanks and pressure swing adsorption plants.“Hospital furniture (beds etc.) and equipment like ventilators, bipap, multipara monitors, oxygen concentrators have already been procured as part of preparation of Covid care,” said Mehra. The senior advocate added that since the hospital has been designated as a Covid facility, the super specialty facilities have not been started as of now. “When the hospital will be declared as a non-Covid hospital, necessary arrangements to start the super specialty facility will be considered,” said Mehra. However, the court took exception to these submissions noting that the facility should have been created by 2019.“We are not willing to accept this statement. We had asked you to tell what was envisaged in the project. We want to know about the cardiology department, the burns ward..,” the court said asking Mehra to withdraw the report and file a fresh one. Singh said there is only one Covid-19 patient in the entire facility at the hospital in Dwarka and people with several post Covid complications are lacking adequate treatment. He added that the hospital caters to one-fourth population of the city. However, due to delay, patients are being directed to other hospitals. Mehra said the government wants to check the progress of the first phase of works and introduce other super specialty facilities in the second phase. Stating that six floors of the hospital are ready, Mehra sought time till August 15 so that at least the facilities introduced in the first phase can be inaugurated.

BSES Rajdhani, on behalf of all three Delhi discoms, floated the tender for empanelment of vendors, for providing installation of slow and fast EV chargers to anyone in Delhi. In line with vision set by CM Arvind Kejriwal of making Delhi the EV capital of India, Delhi will soon be the first city in India where anyone can get an EV charger installed [and] avail Delhi government subsidy, by making a single phone call or applying online,” said Jasmine Shah, vice chairperson of Dialogue and Development Commission, a think tank to the Delhi government, in a statement issued on Wednesday.Earlier this year, the government initiated a single-window policy for application and installation of EV charging stations in private and semi-public spaces.The statement issued on Wednesday further said, “Residential spaces like apartments and group housing societies, institutional buildings like hospitals, and commercial spaces like malls, theatres and grocery stores, can use this single window facility for hassle-free installation of EV chargers in their premises.”“The decision to implement a single window facility and empanel vendors through discoms for smooth rollout of EV chargers in private and semi-public places was taken on June 14, 2020, at the Charging Infrastructure Working Group meeting of Delhi government. We have received requests from many apartment societies, RWAs, mall owners etc that they wish to install EV chargers but don’t know how. This innovative, single window process will enable quick and efficient installation of EV chargers,” said Shah.The schemes are in line with the city government’s EV policy – notified last year – which aims to ensure that 25% of all registered vehicles in Delhi by 2023 are electric vehicles. The EV policy is part of the Delhi government’s larger long-term action plan to fight air pollution in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-government-floats-tenders-to-empanel-vendors-for-setting-up-ev-charging-stations-101626285186786.html

Two people are still missing,” said Kangra SP Vimukt Ranjan.Rulehar village of Boh panchayat in Shahpur sub-division of Kangra district was hit by a landslide triggered by heavy rains on Monday morning. Five people were rescued by the locals, one body was found on the same day, while four bodies were retrieved on Tuesday.CONG LEADERS VISIT AFFECTED VILLAGESLeader of Opposition in the state assembly Mukesh Agnihotri on Wednesday visited the affected village and and met the family members of the victims to express his condolences. He was accompanied by state Congress general secretary Kewal Singh Pathania, district Congress president Ajay Mahajan, former MP Chandra Kumar and MLAs Pawan Kajal and Ashish Butail.Agnihotri assured all possible help to the affected families, and later at a press conference, he hit out at the state government for inadequate help.He alleged that the chief minister announced ₹4 lakh each to the kin of the deceased but no immediate help was provided to those whose houses were damaged in the tragedy.“It’s matter of shame that the government has not provided any immediate relief to the affected families,” he said.Agnihotri said he also visited Rajol village of the sub-division where 15 families were displaced due to the flash floods. “They told me that no help has reached them. When chief minister was visiting the area, he should have ensured that the help reaches everyone,” he said.He said the government should rehabilitate the displaced and build houses for them.

14-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi child rights panel sends recommendations on Centre’s proposed anti-trafficking bill||The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) on Wednesday sent a series of recommendations to the Union ministry of women and child development on the draft Tafficking in Persons (prevention, care, and rehabilitation) Bill, 2021, and also expressed several reservations about the bill in its current form.The Centre, on June 30, issued a public notice inviting recommendations on the draft bill. According to the ministry, the objective of the bill is to prevent and counter the trafficking in persons, especially women and children.In a letter addressed to the ministry, DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu on Wednesday raised objections over the alleged exclusion of child rights statutory bodies in the bill. “The Commission notes that the National Commission For Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has not been included. Similarly, section 6(2) skips the State Commission For Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR). Since children are vulnerable to trafficking, it is crucial that the child rights statutory bodies are included in the National and State Anti-Human Trafficking Committees. Similarly, the Commission recommends inclusion of ChildLine within the national and state-level committees considering their crucial role for protecting children,” he said in the letter.In its recommendations, the DCPCR said the present draft has “no safeguards” in place. “It is a settled principle and the law that the burden of proof lies on the prosecution and not the accused. The proposed bill reverses the presumption of innocence into a presumption of guilt... This is a problematic position and is a dangerous precedent. There are special laws, where the burden of proof is reversed, but those special laws contain safeguards. The proposed draft of the bill has no safeguards. The absence of safeguards makes it a draconian law,” Kundu further said, adding that certain safeguards can be provided to the accused before imposing any form of reverse burden to uphold the constitutional validity of the provisions of the bill/Act. Referring to Section 49 of the proposed bill, the DCPCR said, “The bill states that even the bail shall not be given unless “the designated court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of such offence. This is the definition of acquittal and hence cannot be the standard for granting bail. Such a provision threatens the most basic jurisprudence of the justice system. This essentially declares the accused guilty without trial.”The commission further recommended a “monitoring and evaluation mechanism”, which is missing from the bill. It also suggested that timelines mentioned in the draft be shortened and the bill, as a whole, be made “gender-neutral” as the victim has been mentioned as “he/him” throughout. No immediate response was available from the ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-child-rights-panel-sends-recommendations-on-centre-s-proposed-anti-trafficking-bill-101626285120279.html

They expressed concerns over security issues due to open drinking in the vicinity of the shop.Around 100 residents gathered at the liquor vend at 10.30am on Wednesday and blocked the road to register their protest.Residents alleged that the entrance to the liquor shop, which, earlier used to face the main road, is now facing the internal road of the residential colony.NK Mehra, a resident of Block A who served as a dean of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said that opening a wine shop in a residential colony would pose security issues as well as adversely influence children. “The shop was not expected to be operating from here. We had filed a complaint with the civic agencies to take action, but they did not do anything. We had no other option but to come out and protest,” said Mehra.Women who took part in the protest said that open drinking is a major problem in the city and they are afraid to step out of their homes after evening due to drunken brawls.Lata kumar, a resident said, that it will be difficult to undertake evening walks since there will be a crowd outside the vend. “Authorities should take action and ensure a safe atmosphere in the residential area, “ she saidSanjay Bakshi, a resident of the area, said that they are planning a larger protest if the gate is not shifted. “We have also launched a signature campaign in the area against the vend that was earlier situated on the road, as part of a commercial complex,” he said.Residents said that it will become difficult for women and children to move about in the area.“How can the government allow a liquor shop near a residential area? I went along with other residents of the colony and questioned the shop owner, who claimed that he was allotted the vend in the auction this year and with the permission of authorities, he has changed the entrance. He also said that if the government deemed it right, he would relocate his shop,” said Sunil Sharma, a resident of Block A.The owner of the liquor vend could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.Residents also approached Anil Yadav, a former municipal councillor of Ward 32 to intervene in the issue. “We will call for a meeting with excise officials to direct liquor shopkeepers not to keep the entrance opened towards the residential colony. Also, private security guards must be deployed to control any untoward situation,” Yadav said.VK Beniwal, the deputy excise and taxation commissioner (east), said that they will check the site on Thursday and will review if permission was granted to the owner to change the entrance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/liquor-shop-in-residential-colony-a-concern-say-sushant-lok-residents-take-to-streets-in-protest-101626284644228.html

Yashpal Yadav, the deputy commissioner of Faridabad said that action would be taken if there any negligence in this matter as miscreants, criminals and anti-social elements can take advantage of the laxity to evade detection from law enforcement agencies. “Action would be taken against those concerned if employees, tenants or house helps are found to be lacking police verification. Those who violate this order will face legal action and be considered a participant in any crime, as lack of police verification makes it difficult to catch criminals,” said Yadav. The deputy commissioner said that directions in this regard have been issued to the police department, subdivisional officers of Faridabad, Badkhal and Ballabhgarh, Tehsildar Faridabad and Badkhal, and municipal officials. “There have been instances where people with criminal antecedents have been hired without police verification and they were later found to be involved in crimes. The district police will strictly work to ensure that verification is done for tenants, workers and domestic helps being hired by the people,” said Sube Singh, spokesperson, Faridabad Police.Officials said that the directions by the district administration are significant as it was noted that criminal and anti-social elements often start working in the district and evade detection because police verification is not carried out by employers. “It is important to know who we are hiring and what are his/her antecedents. It becomes difficult to catch someone if we don’t know their right credentials. This step will help in curbing crimes,” said Yadav, who also held a review meeting with all departments during a district coordination meeting. The DC also asked the health department to take stock of health facilities to ensure that district has adequate medicines and oxygen to meet the challenges that could be posed by the third wave of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/police-verification-of-tenants-and-workers-a-must-says-faridabad-dc-101626284580748.html

The mercury levels shot back up on Wednesday, with the city recording maximum and minimum temperatures of 35.4 degrees Celsius (°C) and 26.1°C, respectively, compared to 30.8°C and 23.1°C recorded on Tuesday. According to a forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gurugram will have to wait for a few more days for “good weather”, as rain is likely to intensify over the weekend. According to the weather warning issued by IMD, a yellow alert, requesting authorities to be prepared has been issued for July 17-18, with predictions of heavy rain and thunderstorm or lightning at isolated places. A similar alert has been issued for neighbouring Faridabad district, said officials. An official from IMD Chandigarh said, “Monsoon has arrived across Haryana, but Gurugram will see less rain in the next few days, and it will pick up July 17 onwards. There is a possibility of heavy rain over the weekend and an alert has been issued for the same.”According to a weather report from the IMD on Tuesday evening, Gurugram received 51.6mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours. As per the district-wise season rainfall status of Haryana issued by the IMD, the normal rainfall range for Gurugram during the monsoon, till mid-July, is 110.8mm, which indicates that the district is still suffering from a 61% deficit in rainfall, as of Tuesday.

They said that work was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but is likely to resume in full swing soon.Nirman Jambulkar, project director, NHAI, said, that work is currently going on at the site and that the work on the 0.3 acres will start in August. “The land will be transferred to us by July-end and this will help us in completing the work,” he said. The under-construction cloverleaf will connect the Dwarka Expressway, also called the Northern Peripheral Road (NPR), with the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR), which is on the other side of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. It will ensure hassle-free movement of traffic between SPR and NPR, said officials. The cloverleaf will be a two-level interchange, on which left turns will be handled by slip roads. Work at the site was stuck for over a year due to litigation over two small plots in the vicinity. However, following directions from the Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari and Gurgaon member of Parliament Rao Inderjit Singh during a visit in March, the district administration and other civic agencies facilitated the transfer of these plots.NHAI officials said that one of these plots has already been transferred to the authority and with the transfer of the second plot, the road projects will be completed without any further obstacle. The deadline for the Gurugram section of the project was fixed for December 2021, but due to the lockdown, the contractor is likely to get more time, said officials. Officials on Wednesday also said that due to less rain on the first two days of the monsoon, there was no serious waterlogging issue at the project site, even as they insisted that the civic agencies have to develop a comprehensive stormwater drainage system to manage the flow of water.Gadkari, during his visit in April, set August 2022 as the deadline for completion of the entire 29-kilometre Dwarka Expressway project, 11 kilometres of which fall in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dwarka-expressway-project-work-on-cloverleaf-intersection-to-start-in-august-says-nhai-101626283800826.html
14-07-2021||Gurugram||GMDA to repair two-kilometre stretch between Sirhaul, Kapashera borders||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will carry out repair works of a key two-kilometre stretch that connects Sirhaul toll and Kapashera border, through Udyog Vihar, and upgrade the infrastructure for smoother traffic flow and reduce the traffic volume at Sirhaul border, officials said on Wednesday.GMDA officials said that the purpose of the “special repairs” is to provide an alternative route for commuters stuck in congestion at either of the border points as well as for diverting traffic in case of an emergency.The GMDA floated a ₹6.54 crore tender for this project, which is expected to take at least nine months to complete from the date construction commences. Officials said that they will start work on the project after the monsoon, in September, and in the interim, finalise a contractor and complete all other tendering work.The repair work will involve extensive relaying, dismantling of damaged bitumen road with cold milling machines, widening of carriageways, fixing and filling of potholes, building a new footpath and service roads, as well as laying and fixing basic stormwater drain along the stretch.“The contractor will have the responsibility of widening the existing carriageway and strengthening it wherever needed, with extensive bitumen-related work. The contractor will also have to construct a parallel service road, footpath, remodel intersections and junctions falling along the stretch, set up traffic barriers, paint road markings, erect signage and fix streetlights, among other such amenities,” a senior GMDA official privy to the matter said.The official cited above said that the contractor will have to submit an earnest money deposit (EMD) of ₹13.09 lakh for placing a bid and the validity of the bid will last for 120 days. The official said that since the project cost is over ₹5 crore, the contractor will also have to hire technical personnel, such as a site engineer, plant engineer and a quantity surveyor to oversee the project. Further, the contractor will have to start work seven days after a work order is issued and will have to maintain the stretch for 36 months after the completion of work.GMDA officials said that of the ₹6.54 crore, ₹4.36 crore is the expected cost for the work, barring the money needed to lay and fix stormwater drains.As per GMDA’s 2019 comprehensive mobility plan (CMP), nearly 334,000 and 64,000 vehicles travel through the Sirhaul toll and Kapashera toll, respectively, on a usual weekday. The two routes cumulatively carry 44% of Gurugram’s traffic, the CMP further states. Due to the high volume of traffic, both stretches often witness snarls and it takes commuters 20-40 minutes to cross the border during peak traffic hours. The CMP was compiled by the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) on the behest of GMDA.Sewa Ram, an urban transport systems design expert and a faculty member of SPA, said that the two-kilometre stretch, along with a proposed road connecting Cyber City (DLF Phase 3) with Nelson Mandela Marg in Vasant Kunj, were proposed as measures for reducing traffic on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway.“The Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway has reached a saturation point. Hence, the repairing and upgrading of the Udyog Vihar stretch were proposed so that small distance traffic travels through the Kapashera border rather than the Sirhaul toll. Together, the two stretches can bring down the traffic volume at Sirhaul toll by more than 24%,” said Sewa Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-repair-two-kilometre-stretch-between-sirhaul-kapashera-borders-101626283741173.html

Officials said that the drive went on from 11am to 2pm and that the target for the day was achieved.Locals said that around 200 houses were demolished in the drive, but there was no official confirmation. The drive is set to continue and will be completed before the next hearing in the Supreme Court.Garima Mittal, the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad, said, “The action to remove illegal encroachments from forest land in Khori area of Lakadpur village was started by the municipal corporation on Wednesday. We have time till July 19 to comply with the orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and all encroachments will be removed in this stipulated time. The target set for Wednesday was achieved and the demolition drive was stopped due to rain.” On June 7, the Supreme Court ordered the eviction of thousands of slum dwellers encroaching on the Aravalli forest area in Faridabad district, holding that “there cannot be a compromise or concession on forest land.” There are around 10,000 households in the village. A senior official of the district administration, requesting anonymity, said that nine teams were deployed on the ground for the demolition drive and over 3,000 police personnel, including three deputy commissioners of police, 12 assistant commissioners of police, traffic police personnel, crime branch officials, a rapid action force and Swat teams, were deployed as part of the security arrangements. Anshu Singla, the deputy commissioner of police (NIT), who oversaw the drive, said, “The demolition squad of the MCF reached Khori village with 17 JCB machines on Wednesday morning to remove illegal encroachments from forest land. This action will continue, in compliance with the order of the Supreme Court, and till then, necessary protection will be given to the MCF squad. Strict action will be taken against any anti-social elements.” During a visit to the area on Wednesday, an HT team learnt that mainly, houses in Vishwakarma Colony were demolished on Wednesday. Items like water tanks, utensils, folding beds, chairs, cupboards were kept outside, covered with tarps, underneath which residents were taking shelter from the rain. Residents said that the police force was deployed in the village at 6am, but the demolition started around 11am. Sangeeta Devi (37), a mother of three, whose house was demolished on Wednesday, said, “I was going to bathe today morning, as usual, when all of a sudden, I heard a loud noise. People started gathering outside their houses. I rushed outside with my children and picked up whatever little items from my house and kept them aside before a bulldozer ran over my house.” “We had finished construction of our house just six months ago after spending around ₹6 lakh. We had taken a loan and still have to pay back around ₹3 lakh. Where will we stay and how are we supposed to pay back the loan? So far, we had only been paying a monthly interest of ₹5,000 as we could not even think about clearing the principal amount,” she said. On Tuesday, the administration announced a rehabilitation initiative for residents of Khori village, but residents said that they are still waiting for camps to be set up to facilitate registration. Locals said that they were not even given any information on the application process. Roopmani Devi, a resident of Vishwakarma Colony, said, “This would not have happened had there been people. All these days we were being told that demolition won’t take place and we will be informed if it happens, so most people went out to work, and from behind, our houses were demolished. We used all of our savings and bought a house here around two years ago. Now, where do we go?” Nirmal Gorana, a member of Mazdoor Awaaz Sangharsh Samiti, that has been working with the residents to seek rehabilitation, said, “Just 24 hours ago, the MCF talked about rehabilitation, which it has not been able to implement so far and today (Wednesday), they came down to demolish houses in Khori. Officials talked about giving rehabilitation on the grounds of humanity, but they did not have the slightest mercy to first take the people to the transit camp and then take further action. The government should immediately give shelter to the people in the transit camps till the arrangements for rehabilitation are made.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khori-demolition-drive-starts-200-houses-razed-on-first-day-101626283620926.html

In 2020, a board collapsed at the Sancheti hospital chowk, but due to a lack of traffic because of Covid-19 restrictions, no harm was caused to the commuting public. The anti-encroachment department has been is busy removing the boards.Social activist Mayur Shinde said, “Last year, only 26 boards were removed and the remaining 22 should have been demolished with immediate effect. The structural audit had clearly stated that all the boards must be brought down. Various social workers and political personalities were found using these board to put up illegal hoardings. All this will stop with the removal of the remaining boards in the past few days.” According to the PMC administration, most boards had been erected some 13 years ago at the time of the national games in Pune. Most were fixed on Jangli Maharaj road, Paud road, Baner-Balewadi, Fergusson College road, old Mumbai-Pune highway and the airport road.Vijay Landge of the PMC’s Skysign and Licence Department said, “There were a total 48 direction boards and they all have been removed. Gas cutters were used to bring it down and the material has been kept at the ward offices and the anti-encroachment department’s godown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/46-direction-boards-removed-after-audit-deems-it-dangerous-101626281103903.html
14-07-2021||Other||53 convicts refuse to take advantage of emergency parole: ADG Prisons||PUNE Prisons in Maharashtra have 53 convicts who have refused to take advantage of emergency parole, granted in an attempt to decongest overpopulated prisons.“There are 53 inmates in Maharashtra who have refused to leave the facility during this process. They get food, a place to live, and clothes. They do not wish to leave. If they choose, they can be released with one application. The High Court has also allowed for them to stay back if they so choose,” said Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of police, Prisons, Maharashtra.Forty-six prisons in Maharashtra currently house 4,863 convicts, of which 4,122 are vaccinated with the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The administering of a second dose has also begun in some prisons for convicts, as well as under-trials, according to ADG Ramanand.Along with the traditional prisons, the prison department has 52 temporary prisons in the state. Therefore, the same machinery and number of officials that handled a 33,000-36,000 inmate population before the pandemic, is now handling a floating population of an additional 12,00-13,000 inmates in temporary prisons.So far, 10 prison staff and 13 inmates have died due to the Covid-19 infection. Covid care centres and isolation facilities have also been established. However, to supplement the existing strength of 116 doctors, the state government has allowed for recruitment of 10 more doctors in the prisons.Easing the pressure on the health and security infrastructure of prisons, the strength of the prisons in Maharashtra had reduced by 10,000 during the first wave in 2020, when the decongestion process began. However, it quickly mushroomed back to its original strength. To this, ADG Ramanand said that inmates released for decongestion will not be brought back while the pandemic lasts, unlike some other states in the country.“As long as the Epidemic Diseases Act is in force, I have no intention of bringing back the released inmates. It can be thought of when the act is pulled back,” he said.Even with decongestion, the total population of the prisons is 33,719, with 13,000 in temporary prisons. The largest population is in Yerawada central prison which has 5,000 inmates.The current condition of the prisons has necessitated expansion and reduction of the number of under-trials. The proposal for a new prison in Mumbai is a step in that direction, if the proposal sees the light of day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/53-convicts-refuse-to-take-advantage-of-emergency-parole-adg-prisons-101626281102702.html

The initiative is a part of the department’s plans to build sports complexes in all the 38 districts of the state to groom sportspersons and provide them facilities required to keep pace with national and international players. The plan has so far been approved in 28 districts, including state capital Patna, while sports complexes in nine of these districts have also been inaugurated and will start functioning in a couple of months, officials said. The nine districts are Saharsa, Madhubani, Arwal, Katihar, Rohtas, Nawada, Lakhisarai, Jamui and Bettiah.Facilities of learning and practising indoor games such as weightlifting, kabaddi, wrestling, taekwondo, karate and table tennis will be available at the complexes, besides gymnasiums and yoga sessions. “Though such facilities are available at many places, such complexes were mostly scattered. The department plans to bring these facilities under one roof,” Mithilesh Kumar, deputy director, directorate of youth affairs, said. He added, “Besides, though there have been sports facilities for professionals at many places, no such outlet has been available for non-professionals, especially for girls, who want to learn for the sake of interest.”At such sports complexes, non-professionals may join any sport under the “pay and play scheme” of the department. However, while men would have to pay entry fees and for coaching, women have been spared all charges, Kumar said. The department will also form a committee to run and manage the sports activities, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/women-to-get-free-entry-coaching-at-govt-sports-complexes-in-bihar-101626281101405.html

However, while PMC is yet in the process of starting to provide facilities like water supply to the villages, amidst the pandemic, villagers still await vaccines against Covid-19. Residents from these areas said that Zilla Parishad centres, which get about 100 doses once a week are operating, however, the PMC is yet to set up any such vaccination centres.Additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “We have been getting a lot of demands from citizens. However, we are awaiting the Zilla Parishad hand over of the PHCs or to at least give us some space to start a temporary vaccination drive. In Wagholi we have identified a place. In another case we did identify a school where we could begin the drive, but since the school is a ZP property, we want them to hand over the space. The process to officially handover ZP properties to PMC is a lengthy one which will take a lot of time, so till then, the ZP can hand over some space to begin the drive.” ZP CEO, Ayush Prasad said, “Our population is a lot more than PMC, even without these23 villages which constitute about 0.4 million of population. Currently we continue our drive of Covid-19 vaccination at the six PHCs which are located within the PMC area and each of the PHCs is provided 100 doses. The PHCs that are in PMC areas are still managed by ZP. All the services, medicines, vaccines would be provided by ZP until the state government approves transfer to PMC. We shall be providing vaccines without reducing the quota. We have requested PMC authorities to provide extra vaccines to these PHCs.” Nitin Kumar Jain, one of the directors of the Wagholi Housing Society Association, said, “We have one PHC which has not seen any vaccination drive for the past few weeks. In the past month also we had the drive only one day in a week. While private hospitals continue with their drive, government centres are shut. We have conveyed our problems to the PMC who have promised that they would start a temporary centre soon.” Another resident named Narendra Hagwanem, former deputy sarpanch and member of the Kirkatwadi Development Forum, a citizen’s activist group, said, “The ZP PHC is doing vaccination only once a week which is also shut now. The 100 doses that come to the centre once a week are reserved for both HCQ, FLW, second doses and first doses as well.

The judge said that the police officers “miserably failed in their statutory duties”.The case was related to Mohammad Nasir. He was shot in the eye during the February 2020 riots in Delhi. Nasir registered a complaint with police against six people, including former BJP MLA Naresh Gaur.However, the police reportedly linked the complaint to an unrelated case, following which Nasir reached out to the metropolitan magistrate.The court had directed to register an FIR. The order was later challenged by the police.Investigators maintained that there was no need to lodge a separate FIR as it had already registered one earlier and there was no evidence against the people who allegedly shot him. The police say that the accused were not present in Delhi at the time of the incident.Over this, the judge reproached the police for “lack of efficacy and fairness” in the investigation and said that it “has been done in a most casual, callous, and farcical manner.”“A copy of this order be sent to the Delhi Police Commissioner for bringing to his notice the level of investigation and supervision in the matter and to take appropriate remedial action under intimation to this Court," Yadav further added in an order dated July 13.The judge also said that Nasir is free to exhaust his remedies available to him in accordance with the law to get a separate FIR registered in respect of his complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-case-court-slaps-rs-25-000-on-police-for-callous-and-farcical-investigation-101626279451848.html

14-07-2021||Patna||Bihar health minister for mass campaign to control population||Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey on Wednesday advocated for a mass campaign with public support to control population boom in the state, that had shown a decadal growth rate of 25.1% in the last census (2011). Pandey steered clear of courting any controversy as he parried a question on the need for legislation to control population, as Uttar Pradesh has recently done, while talking to media persons on the sidelines of an event to mark World Population Day (July 11) here on Wednesday. Toeing the line of chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar, Pandey said education played an important role in controlling population. He said intermediate-pass girls in the state have a total fertility rate (TFR) of 1.7% against the national average of 1.8%. Similarly, girls who graduated college have a TFR of 1.6% against the national average of 1.7%. He said the CM had minutely examined this fact and already announced opening of at least one high school in every panchayat as well as monetary incentive for girls to study. “Unwed intermediate-pass girls are eligible for a monetary incentive of ₹25,000, while those girls who have complete their graduation get ₹50,000 under Mukhya Mantri Kanya Utthan Yojana,” he added. Pandey said it was due to social mobilisation campaign and mass awareness drive that for the first time this year, the state’s decadal population growth was projected be around 22% - 23%, almost identical to what it was in 1971 (22%). He said the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5 had shown some positive indicators for the state, as its TFR had decreased to 3.0% from 3.4% in their last survey. He, however, stressed the need to increase use of modern spacing methods among married girls and women between 15 and 24 years of age to improve use of modern contraceptive among nulliparous and low parity couples to delay or space the birth of children, as the median age of women in the state, who begin using contraceptives, was still 25 years. He also cautioned against malnutrition and said there was need to focus on nutrition if maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate were to be brought down. Earlier, Manoj Kumar executive director, State Health Society, Bihar, spoke about the state’s improvement in the two NFHS surveys. He said the unmet demand had gone down from 21.2% in 2015 to 13% while the modern contraceptive prevalence (mCPR) among married women of reproductive age (MWRA) increased in Bihar from 23.3 in NFHS-4 to 44.4 in NFHS-5. Flagging an area of concern, Kumar said that over 40% of girls, who are less than 18 years of age, are still getting married and getting pregnant between 15 and 19 years of age. Sunil Babu, Care India chief of party – Bihar Technical Support Project – and deputy team lead-family planning Dr Padma Buggineni, threw light on the challenges in controlling population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-health-minister-for-mass-campaign-to-control-population-101626279719953.html

14-07-2021||Patna||Bihar heading for financial crisis, says CAG official||Bihar is heading towards a financial crisis as the state has shown trends of revenue deficit in the fiscal year 2019-2020 against the revenue surplus in fiscal 2018-19, said additional deputy (eastern region) Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) Rakesh Mohan on Wednesday.Revenue deficit is when the government has less income to meet its expenditure, whereas revenue surplus is when its net income is higher than projected expenditure.The revenue deficit in 2019-20 is expected to be around ₹2000 crore as against the revenue surplus in 2018-19 of ₹6897 crore. These observations were made by Mohan, who censured the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar led state government for making unrealistic budget in the last few years, parking funds in personal ledger accounts (PLA) and personal deposit accounts ( PDA) worth crores and not providing records of various departments for audit. “We can say that Bihar is heading for a financial crisis. The signs are not good because the state has been showing trends of revenue deficit in a year when there was no pandemic, which means there aren’t enough funds to meet all expenditures as per the budget outlay. The revenue of the state is decreasing. Capital expenditure (money spent on making assets, including infrastructure, health, education) is also showing a downward trend,” Mohan said. Mohan, who met deputy CM and finance minister Tarkishore Prasad and principal secretary (finance) S Siddharth on Tuesday, said that he has flagged these issues to the government’s top officials and advised them that avenues of gaining income should be increased by the state. “We are afraid that the figure of revenue deficit will increase further in 2020-21, during which the state faced economic contraction owing to Covid-induced lockdowns and overall revenue shortfall by states across the country,” he said. The top auditor, who is in charge of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, also expressed his displeasure over the way the state government has been making unrealistic budgets since the last few years by putting higher projections of expenditure in the outlay of various departments but ending up spending much less. “In 2018-19, the total budget was ₹2.09 lakh crore whereas the actual spending was ₹1.60 lakh crore. The saving was ₹49,000, which is 23% of the total budget. In 2019-20, there are projections that the state government could have saved more than 30%. Many departments have not been able to spend even 40% of their allotted funds. This is wrong because the budgets in the last few years are being prepared unrealistically without taking into account how much funds are available,” he said. Ram Avatar Sharma, accountant general (audit), Bihar, was also present during the interaction.Highlighting that the accountant general was preparing the state’s financial report for fiscal 2019-20, Mohan was also critical of the way abstract contingent (AC) bills and detailed contingent ( DC) bills were piling up without reconciliation. AC bills are generated when there is a withdrawal of funds for any expenditure by departments while the DC bills are submitted to provide an account of expenditure with related vouchers within six months. The AG audits the AC/DC bills for financial probity.“Despite us raising objections over non-reconciliation of AC/DC worth ₹5770 crore in 2018-19, there has been not much progress. The same is the case of non-submission of utilisation certificates (UCs) against grants. These are all signs of financial mismanagement,” Mohan said. Besides, the senior auditor also rued that various departments like Panchayati Raj, Urban Development, IPRD were not giving proper records for auditing to the AG office despite reminders. “Although we face problems in getting records from many departments for auditing, some are very chronic. Auditing is a constitutional obligation and such attitude is not acceptable,” he said. Mohan said. Meanwhile, some financial experts believe that the state started facing a loss in revenue since liquor was banned in the state in 2016.Odisha and Jharkhand continue to be revenue surplus states while Bihar and West Bengal are in deficit, said Mohan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-heading-for-financial-crisis-says-cag-official-101626279599978.html

14-07-2021||Pune||Awareness needed among youth about Army as career option: Gen Naravane||Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General M M Naravane on Tuesday said there was a need to create greater awareness among the youth about the armed forces as a career option. General Naravane was speaking virtually at the silver jubilee function of Rani Laxmibai Mulinchi Sainiki Shala, a military-oriented school for girls run by the Maharashtra Education Society near Pune. In its 25-year journey, the school has taught 2,000 girls starting with the first batch of only 40 girls and eventually growing the intake into 90 per year from all over Maharashtra. This special school is spread in 32 acres of land that was given by the government of Maharashtra with a special sanction right from the first day. Located under Mulshi tehsil, at Kasar-Amboli, just 25 km from Pune, the school is located as part of hill -top construction. General Naravane pointed out that some regions are under-represented in the defense forces. “We ensure that all the officers and soldiers, irrespective of gender, get equal opportunity to serve the nation and enhance their career prospects. Women officers are serving in the Indian Army with distinction and we have taken a number of steps to give them maximum exposure in challenging assignments,” said Gen Naravane. The army chief also emphasised that the Indian defense forces and the Army in particular believe in gender parity and women’s empowerment. The Indian Army reflects the unique strength of the country which is ‘unity in diversity’, he said. “The army recruits from all the regions and in that effect mirrors a Mini India. However, I must highlight that the regional representation in the army is not a balanced mix,” he noted. ‘The northern region of our country, which comprises 14 percent of our population, accounts for 45 percent of the strength of the Indian Army, while the western region which also includes Maharashtra, with the same 14 percent of the population has mere eight percent representation in the army,’ he said. This disparity needed some introspection, he said. “There is a need to create greater awareness among the youth about the armed forces as the preferred career option and offer them adequate guidance and opportunity and we need to join hands and start the collective work towards this, and this school is one step in that direction,’” the army chief said.

14-07-2021||Delhi||Asks consent to operate inclined lifts in Signature bridge: Delhi tourism dept||Delhiites will soon have a bird's eye view of the city from the 154-metre-height of Signature Bridge as the tourism department has sought approval from concerned authorities to operate inclined lifts installed in legs of the pylon of the bridge. Officials of the Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) said that a glass facade (viewing gallery) has been built atop the bow shaped pylon - twice the height of Qutub Minar - of the country's first asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge. The height of Qutub Minar is about 73 metres.They said that four lifts have been built inside the legs of the steel pylon of the Signature Bridge out of which two are inclined lifts and two are vertical. These lifts will be used to ferry visitors to the viewing gallery situated at a height of 154 metres. Selfie points will be set up along the journey to the top. The glass gallery can accommodate around 50 people at a time.Officials said that though inclined lifts are operational in various projects, such as Eiffel Tower, in foreign countries across the world, it would be the first in India if permitted.A senior official of the DTTDC, on the condition of anonymity, said that for quite some time, the department has been trying to seek no-objection-certificate from the electrical branch of the labour department of the Delhi government to start operations."We have again written to the electrical wing of the labour department last week and requested them to inspect these elevators to provide the approval. We have also requested them to suggest if any improvements are to be done or any conditions they want to add for the operation. Both types of lifts (inclined and vertical) are ready for operations but need proper approval from the department," the DTTDC official told PTI.According to DTTDC officials, tourists will have to take inclined lifts from the base of the bridge to the middle of the bow-shaped pylon. From there, visitors will interchange the elevators and board into vertical lifts that will take them to the glass box.The all-glass viewing gallery will offer a panoramic view of the river Yamuna and the city and will have four levels with a spiral staircase. It will take about half-an-hour to transport people up to the deck as the speed of elevators will be very slow and only four people can be ferried in one lift in one go, officials said. "Because of the peculiar nature of lifts installed the pylons of the bridge we have to ensure proper safety measures for visitors. We are also studying foreign models where such practices are operational. We will ensure that all international safeguards are followed while operating inclined lifts in the bridge," the DTTDC official said.Another official of the department said that lifts in the Signature Bridge have been installed after following all international standards but the labour department was not giving NOC due to inclined nature of lifts. Another challenge that DTTDC officials are facing is to come up with a solution to control the heat inside the glass facade. Officials said that since it is all made of glass so in summers on a sunny day the temperatures inside can go up above 50 degrees Celsius."We are studying all international experiments to come up with an eco-friendly solution to control heat inside the glass chamber. We are hopeful of finding the solution soon," the official said.The Delhi government's plan to develop the Signature Bridge and area around it into a tourist hotspot includes the construction of a children's play zone, eateries, open-air plaza, toilet facilities and parking space on the western end of the bridge near Majnu Ka Tila (towards the Outer Ring Road). A 300m-long pedestrian walkway is also being developed to connect this recreational area with the bridge's existing sidewalk."Work on the development of walkway, parking and cafeteria is underway and is likely to be completed by the end of July. We are also developing selfie points for visitors to make it a popular tourist destination," an official said.The Signature Bridge was built at a cost of ₹1,518.37 crore by the Public Works Department (PWD). It was inaugurated for motorists in November 2018.The bridge, which connects Outer Ring Road with Karawal Nagar and Bhajanpura in northeast Delhi, boasts of 127 strands of steel cables and is projected as India's first 'asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge'.However, work on the construction of lifts and viewing gallery continued for more than a year. It was handed over to the DTTDC in 2020 for development of tourism activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/asks-consent-to-operate-inclined-lifts-in-signature-bridge-delhi-tourism-dept-101626267989389.html
14-07-2021||Pune||MahaMetro developing mobile app for last-mile connectivity||Maharashtra Metro Railway Corporation limited ( MahaMetro) has started working on the last-mile connectivity for the Pune Metro service which will start at the end of this year. MahaMetro has started signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with transport service providers which will include mobile application in the last-mile connectivity. Till date, MahaMetro has signed a MoU with auto, cars and electronic two-wheeler providers. MahaMetro is ready to start passenger service of 12 kilometres in the month of October and November on both corridors (Vanaz –Ramwadi and PCMC-Swargate) of Pune Metro project. Before that, MahaMetro has signed an MoU with public and private transport services to provide last-connectivity to passengers. Atul Gadgil, director of MahaMetro said, “The MahaMetro will develop an application under the last-mile connectivity to provide feeder services to passengers which includes transport services like public and private players. We are signing agreements with those who want to get benefits mutually. Till date, we have signed MoU with AAP (Aam Aadmi Party) auto-rickshaw union. We are inviting all auto and car services to sign MoU with MahaMetro. We have nothing to do with fare structure. It is not our part. We just want to provide transport facilities to commuters to reach Metro stations and to their destination and vice-versa.” On the other hand, rickshaw panchayat, one of the leading unions of autorickshaw drivers, has raised objections to sign a MoU with MahaMetro.. Nitin Pawar, general secretary of rickshaw panchayat said, “MahaMetro doesn’t have the right to decide passenger fares. There is a government committee which has power to decide passenger fare. Metro is a private body and they will have to provide space and parking facilities to autos in their premises. MahaMetro will decide to give access to auto drivers of unions which will sign MoU with them. It is unfair and we are against it.” Hemant Sonwane, general manager of MahaMetro said, “It is open to all to sign a MoU with Metro. Till date, AAP auto union, Ola and Uber and e-scooter signed an agreement. It is only to provide detailed information of the metro schedule. It is knowledge sharing and not revenue sharing.” Passenger service will start from October-November Last week, the MahaMetro conducted a technical trial run between Vanaz to Anandnagar stretch on Vanaz to Ramwadi metro corridor. Due to Covid-19 pandemic situation, MahaMetro is already behind schedule. Therefore, MehaMetro has started concentrating on the Vanaz to Garware college stretch. It is a six kilometre of stretch and it is a priority stretch in the Vanaz-Ramwadi metro corridor In the month of January 2021, the MahaMetro completed a six-kilometre stretch between PCMC and Phugewadi of Pune Metro and successfully conducted a trial run on the PCMC to Swargate Metro corridor. Gadgil assured, “We are working simultaneously on Vanaz-Ramwadi and PCMC- Swargate corridors. We have an almost complete 6 kilometer stretch between PCMC (Sant Tukaram nagar) to Phugewadi on PCMC-Swargate corridor. In the Vanaz-Ramwadi corridor, we will complete all works soon. We will be ready to start passenger service on both corridors of a stretch of six kilometres on each corridor in the month of October or November.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mahametro-developing-mobile-app-for-last-mile-connectivity-101626278999871.html
14-07-2021||Pune||Storm water drain work on MG road creates traffic snarls||Major traffic snarls are being reported for the past few days on MG road after the administration began the work of laying down a 100-metre brand new storm water drainage line to prevent flooding of the Bata Chowk area. The work is likely to be completed within a week’s time. However, the Pune Cantonment board administration has said that the work is being done in larger public interests after city MP Girish Bapat sanctioned ₹15 lakh towards the work. MG road is the arterial road which connects suburbs like Hadapsar, Kondhwa, NIBM, Koregaon Park to the city and vice versa. Commuters alleged that the roadwork being carried out in monsoon was causing traffic snarls at the chowk and demanded early completion of the work. The board administration maintained that it was its endeavour to complete the work much before but due to lack of funds; the several developmental and infrastructural related works had been hit hard due to the shortage of money. Ameya Baviskar, a commuter said “The traffic coming from all the roads joining at Bata Chowk is getting blocked due to the road work. We demand that it be completed at the earliest and PCB administration must fully complete the work within a week so that further inconvenience is avoided.” PCB Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Amit Kumar said, “The work was due for a long time and work is being carried out from city parliamentarian Bapat’s funds to lay a new drainage line for the area. It has been observed that the area was getting clogged in rainwater and causing inconvenience to the citizens after which we took up the work on war footing. More work will be done in the future aimed at improving the entire drainage infrastructure of the cantonment area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/storm-water-drain-work-on-mg-road-creates-traffic-snarls-101626277919804.html
14-07-2021||Pune||Shivaji Market awaits restoration six months after fire||The work of restoration of Chhatrapati Shivaji Market in Punefollowing a massive fire in March is yet to begin and likely to be delayed further due to lack of funds. The PCB had sought funds from the district administration after which the collector office agreed to pay ₹1.25 crore if the board paid the remaining ₹1.25 crore as part of the ₹2.50 crore funds required for the project. The board administration on June 30 took a decision to seek the pending taxes from the traders wherein an amount of ₹80 lakh is due as tax from the defaulters. PCB Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Amit Kumar said, “After the joint meeting with the district collectorate officials, it was decided that the district collector’s office will give ₹1.25 crore and we will give the remaining amount. We issued notices to the traders and asked them to pay their pending tax which is around ₹80 lakh while we will contribute ₹50 lakh. The board is facing one of the severest financial crises in our history and trying our level best to ensure that developmental works don’t get affected. They had committed to that they will deposit the amount by July 12 but only ₹10 lakh has been deposited two days ago. Once the balance amount is ready, we will sanction the necessary funds. A meeting with the cantonment MLA has been convened on Thursday to resolve the restoration issue.” Shivaji Market Traders Association President Manzoor Shaikh said, “On June 29, we had a meeting with army officials and CEO regarding restoration of the market. The restoration work must not be stopped just for the sake of dues as deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar sanctioned ₹1.25 crore for the restoration work. We are creating awareness amongst the traders about the pending dues and we have paid around ₹15 lakh so far. We will offer all our support to the board for pending tax recovery. The board administration must not put a pre-condition that the traders must pay their pending dues as most of our traders have been badly affected by Covid-19 and facing huge business losses.” A massive fire broke out at the Chhatrapati Shivaji market on the night of March 15 which destroyed at least 25 shops in the fish and chicken section of the market. Fire tenders from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) were rushed to the spot and the fire was brought under control within an hour’s time. Chhatrapati Shivaji Market, a grade I heritage structure, has been a bustling marketplace since its construction in 1885 by British army officer Lt Gen John Ross as per the design by Gen Cecil D’Urban La Touche and WM Ducat. The heritage structure still awaits restoration owing to lack of funds from Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) which is facing a near bankruptcy of central government funds for the past three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shivaji-market-awaits-restoration-six-months-after-fire-101626277859805.html

Your success and achievements will inspire the younger generation of the state, and the government will felicitate all the athletes when they come back from the Olympics,” said Adityanath during a virtual interaction with the athletes on Wednesday. While promising full support of the state government to the Tokyo-bound athletes, the CM also congratulated the family members of the athletes. “I admire the contribution of the families of these athletes as they were the biggest supporters of their wards. After the Tokyo Games, I will meet family members of the athletes in person,” he said. Interacting with state athletes, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually met Indian athletes on Tuesday, the CM said these sportspersons deserve special praise for their continuous effort to qualify for the mega event even when the world was going though the corona crisis. While reiterating the supporting stand of the PM to sportspersons across the country through the Khelo India scheme, the CM said besides implementing different development schemes for sports in the state, his government was also implementing schemes of Khelo India adequately. “It’s great to see that most of our Tokyo-bound athletes of UP come from rural background, especially from western Uttar Pradesh, and that’s why the government is setting up a sports university in Meerut,” he said, adding, “The sports university will not only cater to the needs of the new generation of sportspersons, but also help the government generate new opportunities for sportspersons.” Out of 10 sportspersons, race walker Priyanka Goswami; javelin throwers Annu Rani, Seema Punia and hockey player Vandana Katariya – hail from Meerut, whereas shooter Saurabh Chaudhary (Meerut), Mairaj Ahmed Khan (Bulandshahr), pugilist Satish Kumar (Bulandshahr), rower Arvind Singh (Khabra) too come from the same region. Two others – javelin thrower Shivpal Singh and hockey player Lalit Kumar Upadhyay belong to Varanasi. “Under the one district one product scheme, the government has chosen Meerut for sports goods. In the last four years or so, the government has put its best foot forward for the development of sports and the process will continue further,” said the CM. Most of the athletes praised the UP Sports Directorate for extending full support to sportspersons, but a few demanded some changes in the state government’s policies regarding the prize money to athletes who do well at the international level. National record holder Priyanka Goswami demanded setting up of a synthetic track in Meerut and appointment of good coaches at the centre. Annu Rani urged the government for the construction of at least one ground in each district of UP, whereas Olympian Mairaj Khan demanded a shooting academy in western Uttar Pradesh. The CM advised them to submit their demands to the Sports Directorate after coming back from the Olympics and assured all possible solutions to their problems. “The government is setting up two shooting academies, one each at Lucknow and Varanasi, and we will invite shooters like Khan and Chaudhary to give their valuable suggestions for the same.” Showering special praise on Asian Games gold medalist Chaudhary, the CM said age was with the young shooter and success will take him ahead in future. “You have age with you and I am sure you will go a long way in your field and achieve many more successes,” he told Chaudhary. Addressing hockey player Upadhyay, the CM said a sportsperson doesn’t play for his or her own self, but brings name and fame for his/her city, state and country. “The government stands like a rock behind sportspersons of the state forever,” he said. Sportspersons need jobs, not just promises: PandeyUP Olympic Association secretary general, Anandeshwar Pandey, on Wednesday said sportspersons in the state needed jobs, and not just promises. “Leaders are encouraging sportspersons to do well at the Tokyo Olympics, but nobody is talking about their real needs. Athletes need jobs and not just assurances,” stated Pandey. Pandey, who is also the treasurer of the Indian Olympic Association, said around 186 posts of sub-inspectors and 1,120 posts of constables in UP Police are lying vacant. “Besides, several posts of gazzetted officers under sports quota in different departments and posts of regional sports officers and sports officers in the sports department are also vacant since long.

14-07-2021||Other||Rural Amritsar lags urban areas in getting the jab||Amritsar Rural areas in this border district continue to lag urban areas in getting vaccinated. Even as 62% of the urban eligible population has got at least one shot, the corresponding figure for the rural areas is 38%. The district has a population of 26.5 lakh and 42% of the eligible population has been given the jab. In a silver lining of sorts, 40 of 846 villages in the district have been declared as fully vaccinated. The overall gap, however, between urban and rural response to getting the jab is worrying officials of the health department. Officials attribute the lower coverage to lack of awareness and misleading propaganda on social media. Residents in urban areas are keen to be vaccinated, they add. Limited supply of vaccination is also a factor. Health department officials add that 40% of the district’s population (around 1 lakh) is below 18, so the remaining 1.6 lakh people are the main target. In addition to the higher population in rural areas, residents of 50-odd slums that dot the city have also been laggards. Many residents here complain of not getting the time to line up in the vaccination queue, as they go for hard labour during the day. District medical officer Dr Karan Mehra, said, “The gap between the rural and the urban areas is due to the unwillingness of people living in the countryside. Some of them fear that vaccination would make them sick. As a third wave is predicted, they join get themselves inoculated.”He added, “We’ve arranged a special mobile van for Thursday, which will reach the slums and rural areas to clear people’s doubts.”Assistant civil surgeon Dr Amarjeet Singh said, “We have been facing shortage of vaccines, but people must shun any apprehensions. We have to be careful for another four weeks to get a measure of control over the spread of the virus.” Previously too, the rural population had resisted testing. Finally, the Amritsar-rural police had to be roped in to ensure the health department could complete its target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rural-amritsar-lags-urban-areas-in-getting-the-jab-101626271439951.html
14-07-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand minister slammed after photo with mask hanging on foot goes viral||Uttarakhand minister Swami Yatishwaranand was slammed by critics on Wednesday after a photograph, in which his face mask was seen hanging on the thumb of his foot, went viral.The minister for sugarcane industries in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state was not wearing a mask on his face during the time and neither were the two other ministers, Bishan Singh Chuphal and Subodh Uniyal, nor the two other party leaders, who were all huddled in an indoor meeting. The date and the place of the meeting could not be confirmed immediately.After making the rounds on the social media on Wednesday, the photograph was picked up by opposition leaders, who slammed the leader and also the state government for allegedly not taking Covid containment protocols seriously.“The photograph showing cabinet minister Swami Yatishwaranand hanging his mask on foot just shows that he and his government put Covid-19 guidelines... under their feet,” said Qazi Nizamuddin, Congress MLA from Haridwar.Congress state spokesperson Garima Dasauni asked: “When lakhs of people lost their lives to Covid-19 pandemic in the country, what sort of message Swami Yatishwaranand, who is a cabinet minister in Uttarakhand government, is delivering to the people by putting his mask on [his] foot?”Dasauni said if people in responsible positions, such as the minister, are not following the guidelines then it was futile for the government to expect people to follow them.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is looking to make a mark in bipolar state politics, too condemned the minister.“It just shows how much the BJP leaders care about the Covid-19 guidelines when many died in the second wave due to the inadequate arrangements made by their government at the Centre. Swami Yatishwaranand should apologise for his behaviour to the public for his despicable act,”AAP’s state spokesperson Amarjit Singh Rawat said.The embarrassment follows state governments decision on Tuesday to cancel the Kanwar Yatra to destinations in the state to prevent the spread of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-minister-slammed-after-photo-with-mask-hanging-on-foot-goes-viral-101626270900104.html

I believe in doing my work and I am confident that people of Jharkhand will be happy with my work.”Bais is a BJP veteran who represented Raipur, Chhattisgarh’s capital, seven times in Lok Sabha and was later made the governor of Tripura after the 2019 general elections. Bais said “party feeling” should be restricted till the time of election and development should be the only focus after it. The new governor said he held a constitutional post and would take Centre’s help for issues related to the state’s development as per the laid down procedures. “Today is my first day in office and I told the chief minister we can discuss the issues related to the state whenever he is free. I assured him that I would always work with him as a colleague,” he added. Bais took over the gubernatorial post from former governor Droupadi Murmu who served for more than six years in Jharkhand Raj Bhawan. In her last media interaction, Murmu said she had briefed the new governor about the controversial notification of Tribes Advisory Council (TAC) rules 2021 by the Hemant Soren government, transferring the authority to constitute the TAC from the office of the governor to the chief minister. Speaking to reporters after the governor’s oath ceremony, chief minister Hemant Soren said, “I hope the long (political) experience of the governor will be beneficial for the state.”Jharkhand Congress chief and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon said he hoped the new governor would work for betterment of the tribes in the state. Congress is a partner in the state’s coalition government led by the JMM.“Jharkhand is a fifth scheduled state owing to its large tribal population. Governors are guardians of the scheduled areas.

14-07-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand grants concession to national parties to build office in Dehradun||Uttarakhand on Wednesday allowed concession to national political parties for building offices in capital Dehradun and also extended the maximum age limit of candidates appearing in government recruitment examination by one year to offset the disadvantage caused by the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic.“In the existing provision of Dehradun master plan-2025, there was concession in fees and other charges on the construction of government buildings. The government has now agreed to include all the national political parties in that provision after which they too will be provided the concession in construction of their offices,” Cabinet minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said while giving out details of important decisions taken by the state Cabinet chaired by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is building a new state headquarters in Dehradun and its foundation laying ceremony was held virtually in October last year. The party’s current state headquarters is in a residential colony in the state capital and it cited the “inconvenience” caused to the residents as the reason for the shifting. Uniyal also explained the rationale for granting age concession to applicants for government jobs. “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, many recruitment examinations were not held or postponed. Because of this, many aspirants crossed the eligible age [for appearing in the examination]. Hence, the government decided to extend them a concession of one year so that they are able to sit in the recruitment examinations. It will be applicable till June 30 this year,” he said. The government has also cleared creation of 501 new vacancies for management of three existing government medical colleges in the state. “The vacancies will be created for the government medical colleges in Dehradun, Haldwani and Srinagar. Apart from this, 44 new vacancies will be created in the super specialty hospital in Haldwani,” said Uniyal. He said the state government also decided to include as many specially-abled people as possible from the state in the national food programme. “Under this, those specially-abled persons with a monthly income of less than ₹4,000 will be provided ration under Antyodaya programme, while those having a monthly income of less than ₹15,000 would be included in the Primary Family programme and will be provided ration accordingly,” said Uniyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-grants-concession-to-national-parties-to-build-office-in-dehradun-101626264299564.html
14-07-2021||Chandigarh||Akal Takht jathedar alleges dera chief’s name dropped from FIR||Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Wednesday questioned the Punjab government’s motive behind removing Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh’s name from a case registered in connection with the Bargari sacrilege incident while filing a chargesheet in a Faridkot court. “Recently, a new SIT formed by the state government has filed a chargesheet in connection with FIR number 128 by removing the dera (sect) chief’s name. It is causing suspicion. Politics is at play. Why was his name removed quietly? Is it for taking mileage in the 2022 elections?” the head of the highest temporal seat of Sikhs told reporters in Amritsar. Also read: Punjabi University lodges police complaint in fake billing caseHe said the special investigation team (SIT) should reply why the dera head’s name was allegedly taken out while filing the chargesheet. The statement assumes significance as the Akal Takht and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) rarely speak against the Sirsa dera head over his role in the sacrilege issue. The SIT, headed by inspector general of police (IG) SPS Parmar had filed a challan in connection with FIR number 128 against the six dera followers. The jathedar said, “When the Bargari sacrilege incident took place, I was the head-granthi at Sri Muktsar Sahib. I had witnessed the incidents and subsequent protests. The then SIT, led by deputy inspector general Ranbir Singh Khatra, had registered FIR number 63 in connection with the theft of the saroop from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in Kotkapura. Besides Mohinder Pal Bittu, the dera head was named an accused in the FIR. Later, another FIR number 128 was registered regarding the sacrilege. The Punjab and Haryana high court termed both the FIRs as co-related. The SIT questioned the other accused named in FIR number 63, but not the dera chief, why?” Demands shifting dera chief to Punjab jail He said that he was surprised that Panthic organisations were also mum on the issue. “It is our demand that the dera chief be shifted from the Haryana jail to a Punjab jail for his strict questioning. There is a deep conspiracy, a conspiracy to win the 2022 elections. I appeal to all Sikh organisations to speak up against this. There may also be the involvement of the Centre to absolve him,” the acting jathedar said. Since August 2017, Gurmeet Ram Rahim is undergoing a 20-year sentence at Sunaria jail in Rohtak for raping two followers. In January 2019, a special CBI court in Panchkula had sentenced him and three others to life imprisonment for the murder of Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati. Won’t allow politics over sacrilege The jathedar said, “We will raise this issue during a meeting of more than 100 Sikh organisations at Takht Sri Damdama Sahib on Friday. We will not allow any party whether it is the Congress, the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Aam Aadmi Party or the BJP to play politics over the issue.” Won’t name anyone without evidence: SIT head When contacted, IG Parmar said, “Ram Rahim was never named in FIR number 128 so there is no question of removing him. We have filed a chargesheet against six accused who were arrested in May and also named three members of the dera’s national committee as conspirators. They are absconding. It is a must to file a chargesheet within 60 days after the arrest of the accused. Our investigation is on and this is only the first chargesheet. More people will be named in the course of investigation and supplementary chargesheets will be filed. With the arrest of the three conspirators, we will try to find out at whose instance the crime was committed. If they name the dera chief or any evidence comes out against him, we will name him also. I will not name anybody without evidence as was done by some officers previously, because we have to prove it in court,” he said. He said politically motivated statements should be avoided and facts should be checked otherwise it leads to distrust among people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akal-takht-jathedar-alleges-dera-chief-s-name-dropped-from-fir-101626264179412.html
14-07-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: A new era dawns, as a Peshwa appears on the scene||Pune as a city has suffered its set of misfortunes before the tide changed and was effectively revived under able rulers and administrators. The political scene in Deccan at the start of the 18th century was the peak of the Maratha-Mughal conflict. Rajaram Maharaj was left with two wives and two sons. The elder, Shivaji, was born of queen Tararani, a clever and resourceful woman. She immediately took steps to have her son, Shivaji II, set upon the throne and solemnly declared his father’s successor, with herself as Regent, the boy being 10-years-old.The defining battle between the Mughals under the leadership of Emperor Aurangzeb and the struggling Marathas under the leadership of queen Tararani was in full swing. With generous support and assistance from diplomats and commanders such Ramchandra Pant Amatya Bavadekar, Dhanaji Jadhav, Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi, Shankaraji Narayan Pant Sachiv, Tararani firmly took the reins of the Maratha kingdom in her hand. At this time the Marathas were largely split up into marauding bands. They roamed the country harassing the Moghuls and plundering. The loot they stored in various mountain fortresses. A partial account of their gains was rendered to the head of the state, but the major portion was embezzled or dissipated. They appeared more like a scattered band of horseback troops. This very fact, however, rendered them all the more formidable and destructive; guerrilla warfare being best calculated to succeed in that distracted epoch.Marathas were successful in conquering forts around Satara, such as Bhushangad, Parali-Sajjangad and also launched a camp in the north and conquered the area till the river Narmada. The joint efforts to keep Sinhagad fort however, did not succeed. Many forts around Pune, including fort Purandar and Sinhagad were successfully taken over by Aurangzeb and his sardars by bribing the killedars. Inspite of encouragement by queen Tararani to hold fort, the forts were surrendered, sometimes to prevent the wanton loss of Maratha soldiers. Purandar was named Azamgad and subsequently fort Rajgad and Torna were included in Mughal domains. Meanwhile, Prince Shahu and his mother, Yesubai, wife of Sambhaji Raje, were in the custody of Emperor Aurangzeb since Sambhaji Raje’s assassination. When the question of releasing Shahu was mooted, Aurangzeb arranged political marriages for the young prince, giving him as wives the daughters of the two most eminent Marathas in the imperial service, namely, the Shindes, patil of Kanherkhed and the Jadhavs of Sindhkhed. As the wedding present, Aurangzeb conferred the jahagirs of Akkalkot, Indapur, Supa, and Nevasa upon the bridegroom. Aurangzeb aimed to use prince Shahu effectively to subdue Maratha resistance in the Deccan.The battle for succession finally compelled Aurangzeb to withdraw from the neighbourhood of Pune and retire to Ahmednagar. History turned its page when Aurangzeb finally passed away in the spring of 1707, at the ripe age of 88, leaving a power vacuum and creating a tussle over succession amongst the Mughal princes. The ensuing war of succession resulted in accession of prince Muazzam, who ascended the Mughal throne with the title Bahadurshah. Tarabai and her followers were quick to profit by the withdrawal of the imperial army. In 1707, Lodi Khan, the Moghul left in command of Pune city, was defeated by Dhanaji Jadhav, one of Tarabai’s generals, but the city of Pune still remained in possession of the Mughals. Parts of Pune region witnessed alternative rule, by the Mughals and the Marathas. Mughal commanders feared the relentless Maratha attack under Dhanaji Jadhav as he took the fort Sangramdurg at Chakan.In order to deter Maratha advances, governors of Deccan, Azam Shah and Zulfikar Khan, suggested that young prince Shahu, son of Sambhaji Raje be released to create political tussle in Maratha camp over succession. Faction of Marathas such as Dabhades and Balaji Vishwanath Bhat were engaged in diplomatic talks at the Mughal court for release of Shahu Maharaj. Balaji Vishwanath Bhat, a kokanastha Brahmin from Diveagar village, who served the Siddhis of Janjira, had migrated to join the Marathas under Sambhaji Raje and Rajaram maharaj in 1680s. Between 1699 and 1702, he was Sar-subhedar of some part of Pune jahagir around Khalad and Belsar. He, later, was Subhedar of Daulatabad between 1704 and 1707. Balaji Vishwanath had a fallout with Dhanaji Jadhav’s son and went to join Shahu Maharaj as an assistant in 1708. He was instrumental in the diplomacy talks with Mughal camp and by lobbying with various Rajput and Mughal sardars, persuaded them to release Shahu Maharaj. Shahu Maharaj’s mother, Yesubai, and his two wives were retained as hostages. The young Maratha was told that, should he establish his authority, and show himself a loyal ally of the Moghuls, he would be given the territory which his grandfather, the great Shivaji Maharaj, had wrested from Bijapur, with an additional tract between the rivers, Bhima and the Godavari. Purandares, Balaji Vishwanath and many other Maratha Sardars rallied by Shahu Maharaj’s side to finally establish him firmly as a Maratha ruler in Satara in 1708. Queen Tararani was subjugated and her Kolhapur throne was brought under subordination in 1712. Shahu Maharaj asserted own authority on Pune by nominating his commandant, Balaji Vishwanath to look after his family’s Poona jahagir. Balaji Vishwanath chose to rule Pune from the town of Saswad where he stayed with sardar Purandare who was his close ally and oversaw the jahagir. With the success of the Maratha Empire and defeating the Siddis at Janjira, Balaji Vishwanath was awarded the title of Peshwa, the prime minister of the Maratha Empire on November 16, 1713.Hyderabad’s Nizam-ul-Mulk’s sardar, Rambhaji Nimbalkar had captured Pune in 1707. He officially received the jahagir of Poona from Daudkhan Panni, a Mughal sardar in 1713.It proved disastrous for Poona. Matters came to such a pass that the Mughal Governor actually ordered his troops to sack the place. On the order of “Rao Rambha”, Faujdar Baji Kadam and Shekdar (Mahalkari) Gundoji Naik looted Pune, mercilessly.The dual rule of the Mughals and the Marathas continued in Pune till 1715. Balaji Vishwanath managed to secure rights of chauthai (1/4th tax) and Sardeshmukhi, popularly known as “Swarajyachi Sanad” from newly crowned Mughal emperor, Faaruksiyar. However, Thanedar Rambhaji Nimbalkar refused to submit chauthai taxes to Marathas. Displeased with Rambhaji’s actions in 1715, Balaji Vishnwanath, on orders of Shahu, finally sent officer Vyankoji Dhamdhere to conquer Pune and over throw Rambhaji Nimbalkar. Balaji Vishwanath personally met Baji Kadam who was incharge of Pune then, and persuaded him to join the Marathas. Thus, without shedding blood or endangering masses, Pune was handed over to Marathas. Thus, Balaji Vishwanath’s swift actions freed Pune from Mughal rule and Nizam-ul-mulk’s tyranny. Balaji Vishnwanath established his official hold on Poona under the “Swaraj sanad” issued by the emperor of Delhi, Farukhsiyar. Power over Pune was extremely crucial as it meant rule over entire area including twelve mawal. Peace was finally restored and Pune citizens heaved a sigh of relief. In October 1719, Balaji Vishwanath obtained leave from Shahu Maharaj to retire to the village of Saswad. Balaji Vishwanath Bhat-Peshwa died on April 12, 1720 at Saswad.Balaji Vishwanath was succeed by young Bajirao Ballal, aka Bajirao I who was conferred the Peshwa position in a hereditary capacity by Shahu Maharaj. The promising Peshwa Bajirao I was a boon for Pune as well as the Maratha Empire, as we shall see further. In order to ensure everlasting peace for Pune, Shahu Maharaj ordered Bajirao I to make Poona his residence. It would then also become first line of defence for northern attacks and secure Satara, which was Shahu Maharaj’s headquarters. Pune was finally set on its course towards uninterrupted development, as the Peshwa decided to make Pune as his headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sutradharas-tales-a-new-era-dawns-as-a-peshwa-appears-on-the-scene-101626263699867.html

After over 8,000 people flocked to the Hills, the Chikkaballapur district administration decided to reportedly ban entry during the weekends. The hills will remain closed from Friday 6pm to Monday 6am, reports suggest.The Karnataka government had imposed a lockdown soon after the second wave of Covid-19 hit the country. It was lifted in a phased manner and the Nandi Hills was thrown open to the public on June 21 even though it remained shut during weekends.

The tiger was captured by the department on June 23 and June 30, but evidence of its presence was visible earlier --a cow belonging to a villager was killed in the third week of June; it distinctly appeared to be the work of a tiger and not any other wild cat, said authorities. “An adult tigress was spotted atop the Surla plateau along the border with Karnataka. It must’ve moved in from Karnataka as part of routine foraging. The presence of tigers is well established in the area,” chief wildlife warden Santosh Kumar told HT. Also Read | Angry villagers attack forest guards after tiger killed two in Pilibhit Tiger ReserveThe Mhadei wildlife sanctuary was estimated to have five tigers in 2014, but subsequent counts placed the figure at three in 2018, the time of the last census. The sanctuary made news for the wrong reasons in January 2020, when an adult tigress and three male young adults were found poisoned to death. Forest officers arrested three male members of a tribal family and two more persons in connection with the suspected poisoning. All five were released on bail in a few days. The present spotting, while in the same wildlife sanctuary, is some distance away from where the four were killed in 2020. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), which filed a report into the deaths of the tigers in the following months, said the management of the sanctuary left “much to be desired” and that without adequate strengthening of conservation efforts the place may become a “death trap for tigers.” “Unfortunately, even after more than two decades of declaring Mhadei as Wildlife Sanctuary, it is managed on a completely ad-hoc basis as there exists no management plan for such an important sanctuary of the Western Ghats,” the report noted. An NTCA team, during its field visits, observed that there was no proper protection mechanism inside the sanctuary, such as a network of well-connected anti-poaching camps (APC) at strategic locations manned by forest guards or watchers round the clock, which they said were “a very common feature of a well managed protected area (PA) or Tiger Reserve.”“The protected areas of Goa (Mhadei WLS and Mollem WLS) are part of the Western Ghats landscape complex which has the unique distinction of having the world’s largest tiger population. This landscape has several interconnected tiger reserves and protected areas along with reserve forests. However, factors like plantations, agriculture, industrial and infrastructure development activities like widening of roads and railway lines are threatening the existing habitat connectivity in the Western Ghats. Without upgrading the legal status of Goa’s protected areas to that of a tiger reserve and putting in place a strong protection regime in place, the state may become a death trap for tigers dispersing in this landscape,” the NTCA noted.Since the Goa government has been dragging its feet on acting on the NTCA report, an environmental NGO, the Goa Foundation, has approached the Bombay high court in Goa to direct the state government to act on the NTCA report and declare Goa’s wildlife sanctuaries as tiger habitats. The high court has asked the Union as well as the Goa governments to file detailed responses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/first-tiger-spotted-in-goa-s-mhadei-after-four-big-cats-were-poisoned-in-2020-101626260099343.html

Banerjee lost to Adhikari from Nandigram.The next date of hearing is August 12.Banerjee was also present online for the hearing. “The bench also ordered the Election Commission to preserve all records, and devices, such as EVMs, and video recordings,” said her lawyer, Sanjay Basu.The matter is being heard by justice Shampa Sarkar after justice Kausik Chanda recused himself from hearing the petition and imposed a fine of ₹5 lakh on the Trinamool Congress chief for the manner in which the recusal was sought.Also Read | TMC to move Election Commission over holding by-polls in West BengalBanerjee had moved the Calcutta high court alleging voting irregularities in her loss by 1,956 votes to her protégé-turned-rival Adhikari from Nandigram. It was her first electoral loss in 32 years.“The bench also noted that the election petition does not suffer from any defect as per Section 86(1) RPA,” said Basu.The TMC demanded a recount shortly after the results were announced in favour of the BJP candidate but the request was turned down by the Election Commission.Her case was initially slated to be heard by justice Chanda. However, Banerjee asked for transferring the petition to another judge citing “apprehension of bias” since justice Chanda had, before his elevation to the bench in 2019, represented the BJP and its leaders in court cases and was seen in photographs sharing a dais with BJP leaders including state unit chief Dilip Ghosh.“Such calculative, psychological, and offensive attempts to seek recusal need to be firmly repulsed and a cost of ₹5 lakh is imposed upon the petitioner,” justice Chanda had said in his order on July 7.

The painters were not wearing safety gear when the accident took place and hence the police have registered a case of negligence against contractor Santosh Ramkuti. According to the police, the accident took place at around 10.30 am when ten workers were painting the outer wall of Shailesh Tower at Nerul, sector 19A. All of a sudden, a bamboo pole in the scaffolding gave way, triggering the collapse of the entire scaffolding. “Around eight painters were injured in the accident and two of them suffered grievous injuries. All of them were rushed to DY Patil Hospital at Nerul. No resident from the building suffered injuries,” said a police officer. Sunil Gowli, inspector from Nerul police station said, “The contractor, Santosh Ramkuti had not provided the painters with safety gears for doing the work.

14-07-2021||Kolkata||Ex-Bengal Congress president’s son slams Adhir Chowdhury for poll defeat; quits||Rohan Mitra, son of former West Bengal Congress president Somen Mitra, resigned from the Pradesh Congress committee (PCC) on Wednesday holding state president Adhir Chowdhury responsible for the rout in recent assembly polls. The Congress does not have a single legislator in Bengal for the first time since Independence. Chowdhury, who was the PCC president before Somen Mitra held the post, became president for the second time after the latter died in July last year. Rohan Mitra was a general secretary in the PCC but always had his differences with Chowdhury. On Wednesday, the young leader did not attend a meeting convened by Chowdhury and instead sent his resignation letter which was also released to the media. “Your attitude towards me since the very beginning has been pathetic…” Rohan Mitra wrote and accused Chowdhury of interfering in the state youth Congress elections in 2018 to stop him from becoming the youth wing president. Mitra also accused Chowdhury of being surrounded by people who insulted him and his father. “The sycophants surrounding you have not only brought [about] your downfall but also led to the ultimate downfall of the party in the state, with no visible sign of revival in the near future. The change in your tone and narrative towards the incumbent Trinamool Congress government and chief minister of West Bengal is proof of that. The people you have brought in and put in the position of leadership show how incapable you are as the face of the West Bengal Pradesh Congress,” Mitra wrote. The letter reached Chowdhury amid wide speculations that the central leadership might remove him from the post of leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha. Chowdhury was scheduled to attend a virtual meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi during the day, state leaders said. Chowdhury was busy in a series of meetings at the state Congress headquarters and could not be contacted till Wednesday afternoon. Somen Mitra and his wife Sikha Mitra joined the TMC in 2009 and represented the ruling party in the assembly and the Lok Sabha. However, both returned to the Congress in 2014. In his letter, Rohan Mitra also alleged that Chowdhury projected leaders who were partial towards the Bharatiya Janata Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/exbengal-congress-president-s-son-slams-adhir-chowdhury-for-poll-defeat-quits-101626255718949.html
14-07-2021||Chandigarh||Harnessing happy hormones as lockdown blues turn green||The stay-at-home era had curtailed my sphere of activity and lowered my sense of achievement. The joy of completing a task and feeling good about it was fast waning as there were not many options to explore. I was looking for ways to boost my level of endorphins within the precincts of my abode. The lockdown blues turned green when I realised that I had an opportunity to execute those mundane jobs, which may have otherwise taken eons to materialise. One fine morning, I did it! I managed to move my desk to a new position in the study. Resetting the formidable furniture in the house was something I had wanted to do for a long time, and seeing my little efforts fructify, was exhilarating. It was as thrilling as moving the mountains. Brimming with new energy, the crusader in me went scouting around the house to reorient, reorganise and resettle all the corners. My family had conveniently slipped into comfort zone, and they refused to budge .They were the same people whom I had tricked into doing their own chores in the initial phase of the lockdown. But now they had absolved themselves of every responsibility, as if taking cue from our worthy politicians. So, there were a few sloth bears in the house, and my Tarzan was also on an unprecedented leave. The only one to share Jane’s enthusiasm was a scrawny house help, whom she did not want to burden too much. I was virtually out on a limb, treading the path of unknown challenges. I’ve heard that if the syllabus is tough, start with the easier chapters. Solving smaller problems gives a sense of achievement and builds confidence. I started with the no man’s land, the common areas of the house, and managed a decent facelift. The adrenaline was working and off I went to the attic to rummage through a few artefacts besides carpets that I had collected over the years. The cobwebs and dust stuck to me like long lost friends. Was I fazed, certainly not! I did not hesitate to dive into the deepest closet next, and discovered a few hidden treasures while cleaning it. The monkey ladder had once been my favourite swing in school, but now the simple steel ladder at home, seemed a daunting task. But I earned my prize when I climbed it to open the upper cupboard, and out tumbled my favourite cushions, that I had woefully assigned to the list of lost property. The changes in the house had brought in an air of freshness. Though I had ruffled a few feathers while shifting the furniture, no one was complaining. Instead, their smiling faces brought immense joy and I think I also heard a silent applause. Not the one to rest on my laurels, I was already eyeing my children’s bedroom furniture. Dragging them out of their couches would have meant war so I decided to cherish the peace that prevailed, for a while, for I knew, it was the lull before the storm. alkagaurkashyap@gmail.com The writer is a Chandigarh-based advocate||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/harnessing-happy-hormones-as-lockdown-blues-turn-green-101626255179065.html

Also read: Embezzlement: Punjabi University suspends two officials, sacks peonLast week, vice-chancellor Prof Arvind suspended two administrative wing employees, senior assistant Nishu Chaudhary and superintendent Raminder Kaur, besides terminating the services of a peon on contract after a three-member fact-finding committee found substantial evidence of embezzlement of funds. In May, the cash-strapped university’s internal audit department and finance wing red-flagged five bills amounting to ₹6 lakh. The stamp and signatures of the department head were found to be fake and the names of research scholars and assistants against whom the bills were raised were bogus. The committee probed the bank accounts of the senior assistant and others involved. The help of the university’s forensic department was taken to investigate the fake signatures and stamps. SSP Garg said: “I have asked the university authorities to submit the preliminary report with the police. The DSP (City-2) has been directed to conduct the inquiry.” According to the report, the senior assistant — who handled funds provided to the university under various heads and was posted in the same department for over a decade — used to create and submit the fake bills in the name of fake research scholars and assistants to siphon off the money. The funds included those provided by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for development schemes, non-UGC grant for research projects and scholarships given by the Union ministry of education besides those received under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan. It is learnt that the embezzlement went unchecked for six years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabi-university-lodges-police-complaint-in-fake-billing-case-101626251458703.html

By-polls to at least seven assembly constituencies, including Bhabanipur in south Kolkata from where chief minister Mamata Banerjee is expected to contest, are pending.Banerjee, who lost the March-April assembly polls to her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari from Nandigram, needs to be elected by November to continue as the chief minister as per constitutional requirement.“A team of TMC parliamentarians, including Sudip Banerjee, Derek O’Brien, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, and Kalyan Banerjee among others, is likely to approach the ECI this week in this regard,” said a TMC leader on condition of anonymity.Also Read | Calcutta HC to hear Mamata Banerjee’s plea against Nandigram loss todayThe TMC returned to power for the third consecutive term in May, but Banerjee lost to Suvendu Adhikari by a narrow margin.Elections for two seats in Murshidabad were cancelled when the candidates died of Covid-19 in April. Later, two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Parliament members Nisith Pramanik and Jagannath Sarkar, who won the assembly polls, resigned. Two other TMC legislators died after contracting Covid-19. A third TMC lawmaker from Bhabanipur, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, resigned so that Banerjee could contest from the seat in the by-polls.“By-elections should be held as early as possible. The Covid-19 situation is under control. If the third wave arrives, then you cannot do anything. A week’s time for election campaigning will be enough,” Banerjee said earlier this week.The BJP hit out at TMC for seeking assembly by-polls while the ruling party has not held civic elections for over a year now. “Civic elections for over 100 civic bodies are pending. The ruling party has not even held college elections. It is very eager to hold the by-elections. Covid-19 cases are still being reported every day. The Madras high court made some observations and gave some directions on Covid-19 when assembly elections in (four) states and a Union Territory were being held. The Covid-19 situation has not changed a bit,” said Dilip Ghosh, BJP’s Bengal unit head.TMC leader Saugata Roy questioned the BJP’s stand. “Why is the BJP so concerned about Covid-19? When assembly elections were held in eight phases in West Bengal and cases shot up alarmingly, the BJP did not say a word.

Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that Delhi is likely to receive “light to moderate” rain on Wednesday but temperatures are expected to be 1-2 degrees higher than Tuesday. Srivastava added that Delhi-NCR may see a “normal to slightly below normal” monsoon this year. “There are various meteorological parameters such as easterly winds and monsoon trough, among others, a combination of which determines the intensity of the rainfall received in a particular area. Looking at the current parameters, it could be predicted that Delhi may have a near normal monsoon,” he said.“After July 14, the rain activity may slow down. It is expected to intensify again from July 17-19. Around this time, the monsoon trough is likely to shift northwards, passing over northern parts of Rajasthan, south Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh,” said Srivastava.Also Read | Delhi sees light rainfall; IMD announces arrival of monsoon“The normal day temperature for this time of the year is around 35 degrees Celsius.

14-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Back story||Parked outside a narrow lane in Gurugram’s Bhim Garh Kheri, the handcart is stacked with bricks. Two labourers are carrying these to a house being built up the street. One of the men packs 18 bricks on his back and walks towards the construction site. The bricks aren’t tied together. The stack rests on a scrap of strong jute fabric, which seems to have once been part of a gunny sack. The man’s back is bent forward.He returns a few minutes later.Labourer Kishore, 22, says that “in the village, I would have worked as a mazdoor (labourer) on big people’s fields, earning about ₹200 daily. Here I earn ₹600.”Kishore lives with a dozen other labourers, all from the same district in Bihar.Doesn’t it hurt to carry bricks on one’s back?He shakes his head.No back pain?Kishore shakes his head.Does any colleague suffer from pain?“Sometimes the shoulders hurt, or the legs or feet, and then we (self) massage with pure mustard oil.”Kishore says there’s no old person in his group. “Everyone is in their 20s or 30s.”Labourers who, like Kishore, carry bricks on their backs, are spread across the Delhi region. Their work lies outside the confines of more formal construction projects, high-rises for instance, where the hired labourers are given safety gears. A group of such labourers lives behind the Delite Cinema, in central Delhi — one of them is a grey-haired man in his 50s. During a recent interaction, he was reluctant to give his name but described himself and his co-workers as “thele wale”, implying that they operate by transferring construction material (bricks/cement sacks) on their handcart, with usually the last portion of the transportation unfolding on their back. The grey-haired labourer disclosed that every labourer—middle-aged or young—suffers from body pain, which gets more discomforting during the winter months. If it pains too much, they take paracetamol, he said.The young Kishore returns to the cart, his bare back straight. He ponders for a long time when asked where the labourers go when they grow old and their bodies can no longer withstand extreme stress. “They go back home.” He thinks again for some time before adding: “By then their sons have grown up in the villages… they come to the city to work as labourers, and earn for the family.”The grey-haired labourer in Delhi had said the same thing.Kishore now picks up a water bottle from the cart. The bottle is wrapped in a green gamcha. While drinking, some water flows out of Kishore’s mouth, rushing down to his sweating neck. He goes back to packing bricks on his back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-back-story-101626220038192.html
14-07-2021||Pune||Miami-type multi-storeyed jail planned in Mumbai: Prison official||The Maharashtra prison department plans to set up a multi-storeyed facility in Mumbai that can accommodate up to 5,000 inmates to ease the pressure on Arthur Road Jail there which is crowded and offers no scope for expansion, a senior official said on Tuesday. Additional Director General of Police (Prisons) Sunil Ramanand said the prison being envisaged will be on the lines of the Miami Correction Facility in the United States of America to tide over the acute paucity of land in the metropolis. "The Women and Child Welfare department in Chembur has agreed to give us a 15-acre plot. If we get this land, we can build a multi-storeyed prison. Arthur Road Jail is overcrowded and cannot be expanded any further," he said. "There is urgent need to build prisons in the state. The number of inmates rose for 24,000 to 36,000 in the city in the last 10 years. Incidentally, 13,000 inmates are out on temporary bail due to Covid-19, so the current prison population is around 33,000. There are plans to build prisons in Pune, Hingoli, Palghar and Gondia," the ADG informed. Ramanand also said he had sought an amendment in the Code of Criminal Procedure so that producing inmates in court in virtual mode is also considered, as the current rules stipulate that evidence cannot be recorded if the accused is not physically present in court. "We have sought that the appointment of officials above the rank of deputy superintendent of prison should be done through competitive exams instead of walk-in interviews. We are also strengthening the canteen facility by adding ready-to-eat items, fish, chicken, branded eatables, dry fruits, fruits, mineral water, ghee etc. All these things will have to be purchased by the inmates. They are allowed to spend up to ₹4,500 per month and each one has an account into which their families can transfer money," the official said. Speaking on the coronavirus situation among inmates, the ADG said there are 69 active cases in the state's prisons currently, while 13 have succumbed to the infection. A total of 24,000 inmates across prisons in Maharashtra have been vaccinated against Covid-19 so far, he added. The High Court had recently appreciated the efforts of the prison department to implementing various measures to curb the outbreak among inmates, Ramanand said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/miamitype-multi-storeyed-jail-planned-in-mumbai-prison-official-101626219543787.html
14-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi snatchers run amok, safe streets at premium||On February 27, at around 9.30pm, Simran Kaur, 25, was returning home with her mother and two-year-old daughter from a nearby market in Adarsh Nagar. Just a few metres away from her house, two men on a motorbike tried to snatch her necklace. When Simran resisted, one of them stabbed her with a knife. As Kaur collapsed, bleeding profusely, the two snatchers escaped. Kaur succumbed to her wounds in a hospital.Snatching is one of the most commonly reported street crimes in Delhi, with 3,829 cases registered till June 15 this year. Last year, 2,612 cases were registered during the same period. Experts say that the data does not reflect the real dimension of the problem because several snatching cases are registered as simple theft. This, they add, ignores two important aspects – first, unlike simple theft, snatching is an important indicator of the citizens’ safety on the streets, and the additional trauma that a victim of snatching goes through.Even statistically, a comparison of Delhi Police data on snatchings and robberies across the city in the past 10 years paints a disturbing picture. In 2011, 1,476 people became victims of snatching. This means every six hours at least one person was targeted by a snatcher. Over the years, the frequency of this crime has increased to at least one every hour in 2021.Similarly, with 562 robberies reported in 2011, at least three robberies were reported over every two days in 2011. This has now increased to one every four hours. Experts, especially former police officers, say it is time to draw up a plan that reigns in street crime to make the city safer.An analysis of these two most common street crimes recorded over the last few years also shows that they are not confined to any particular area. They are as rampant in gated colonies as is in open neighbourhoods and unauthorised colonies.What varies, however, is the purpose and expectations of the criminals in the targeted areas.For instance, in north Delhi’s Prashant Vihar, which has regularly featured in the top 10 list of snatching hot spots in the city, local residents cite secluded roads, easy access through arterial roads, and close proximity to unauthorised colonies and slum clusters as some of the primary reasons behind rampant snatchings and robberies.The ease with which snatchers operate in this area has prompted residents to change the way they move about. Manju Uppal, who lives in Sita Apartments at Prashant Vihar said: “There are many parks around the residential areas here, which are not well-lit, and are secluded especially after dark. There have been so many incidents of snatchings here that we have stopped stepping out wearing or carrying anything expensive.”Police officers who have investigated snatchings and robberies say that snatchers usually move on motorbikes, and operate in pairs. They said these criminals target people with high-end phones, women wearing jewellery in upscale areas such as Vasant Vihar, Greater Kailash, and Defence Colony, and businessmen carrying cash in busy markets such as Chandni Chowk, Gandhi Nagar, and Azadpur. In lower-income areas, gold chains and phones are the primary targets, the investigators added.Kamla Bisht, 42, is still going through the trauma she suffered when three snatchers, all minors, stabbed her husband multiple times on June 25 and left him to die on the streets of Sultanpuri’s Jalebi Chowk, when he tried to resist them from taking away his cell phone and wallet that had ₹700.The police said the boys were looking for money to buy liquor when they targeted Ravinder Bisht, 48.A police officer familiar with the details of this case said the juveniles may have been regular snatchers, but that there is no way for police to confirm this because the current law does not allow them to keep a record of juveniles. “90% of the juveniles who are apprehended for crimes in Delhi are snatchers. In fact, snatching is the gateway offence into the crime world. This is why it has become so common across the city,” said the officer who asked not to be named.Former Delhi police officer, LN Rao, who worked in the force for over three decades and retired as a deputy commissioner of police (DCP), said: “These snatchers are everywhere. These days when a young criminal needs money, all he needs to do is to go on the road and snatch a person’s phone or a woman’s necklace. Unlike other crimes, it does not need planning. It is time the police made a concerted effort to crack down on these hoodlums on the road.”Another retired Delhi Police officer, Ashok Chand, who headed the crime branch and the special cell units, said the current laws that deal with snatching are inadequate. “In Haryana, the law has been made stringent. These snatchers will only stop if they are put behind bars for a longer time. Also, it is important for police to crack every link of this crime ring. Not just the snatchers, the police should also crack down on the people who buy stolen items from these criminals,” Chand said.The Haryana government made snatching a non-bailable in 2015 by inserting sections in 379A and 379B of the Indian Penal Code and in schedule 1 of the code of criminal procedure (CrPC).In Delhi, cases of snatching are currently registered under two sections — 379 (theft) and 356 (use of criminal force). The offender is given a maximum punishment of three years under sections of theft and two years for use of criminal force.The Delhi Police has proposed that like Haryana snatchers should be booked under Section 379 A (simple snatching without use of force) and Section 379 B (use of criminal force in snatching). The minimum jail term under 379 A is five years, which could go up to 10 years. Under 379 B, the minimum jail term is 10 years, and a maximum of 14 years. The amendments make snatching a non-bailable offences.The proposal is pending approval by the Lieutenant Governor.An HT analysis of the profile of snatchers arrested between 2018 and 2020 shows that at least 90% of those arrested were caught for the first time, and did not have a prior criminal record. Police registered them as “first-time offenders”, and noticed that they were often pushed into committing crimes either because of unemployment after being pulled out of schools or lured by other criminals in their neighbourhood — a trend that has become more worrisome since the Covid-19 outbreak.The story of one of Delhi’s most notorious gangsters, Sandeep Kala points to how street crime is a gateway to more heinous offences. Kala, who is currently one of the most wanted men in the city, accused of crimes such as murder, extortion and robbery, was first arrested in 2004 for snatching a mobile phone at Samaypur Badli.Several Delhi Police officers, who asked not to be named, agree that while other crimes such as burglary, vehicle theft, and even pickpocketing need expertise and logistical support, snatchings and robberies on streets only need a high-speed bike and some basic practice on how to snatch an item. It is the reason that many first-timers are involved in these street crimes.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said curbing street crime and making citizens safe is the topmost priority for the force. “In his first meeting with senior officers after taking charge on June 30, the police commissioner directed that street crime should be the top priority. Criminals should not be able to dominate any road in the city. Our personnel at the police stations regularly conduct street patrolling and area domination exercises. We are mapping crime by identifying trends, their occurrence, and preventing it at many levels. Our mobile patrolling teams keep a close watch on vulnerable stretches. All anti-snatching teams have been activated. The crime branch and special cell are also working on busting these snatching gangs. We are even cracking down on receivers of stolen property so that all members of a crime ring are put behind bars.”Biswal said the police are also making efforts to stop youngsters from taking to the crime. “While we are an enforcement and investigative agency, Delhi police also runs a programme to identify juveniles or teenagers who are vulnerable and could go the wrong way. Across the city, police stations have tied up with different agencies and we train them in different skills, and help them find jobs under our Yuva scheme.”He added that comparing data from two different years may not be enough to predict a trend because of the involvement of a lot of factors. “It will not be correct to compare number of cases compared to last year. We had the lockdown last year. Fewer people were on the roads.”Biswal added that the police have arrested snatchers this year till June 15, compared to the corresponding period last year.In this series, HT puts the spotlight on the Capital’s biggest crime challenges, and explores how the city can be made safer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/snatchers-run-amok-safe-streets-at-premium-101626218801692.html

The Indian athletes have been denied visas for the event, to be in Kazakstan on August 15, despite being fully vaccinated for Covid-19.The physically gruelling race involves 3.8 km of swimming, 180 km of cycling and 42 km of running in full Ironman in a single day.IPS (Indian Police Service) officers such as Krishna Prakash and Ravinder Kumar Singhal and model-turn-actor Milind Soman have completed the immensely difficult and physically gruelling race in the past.Several participants from Mumbai, Navi-Mumbai, Nashik, Aurangabad and Pune, apart from other parts of the country, were hoping to participate in the triathlon to be held in Kazakhstan. Police constable Ashwini Deore was keen to participate in the Kazakhstan triathlon as it was cheaper in Kazakhstan, as compared to western countries where it is held.“We have received e-mails from 2021 Ironman Kazakhstan and 2021 Ironman 70.3 Astana asking us to defer our participations to next year,” said Dr Arun Gachale, a paediatric from Nashik, who is one of the participants. “As swimming pools are closed, I have practiced in Owe dam at Kharghar that even had snakes, and today I received an email asking me to defer the participation. I have spent a lot of energy practising,” said Satish Patil, who works for a German company.Mahendra Chhoriya, a 43-year-old businessman, said participants from all countries, including Pakistan and China are allowed. China is the origin of the pandemic, but they have not been banned but instead Indians are banned, he said.“We have spent lot of energy and money preparing for the event. Every month, we have been running 200-300 km, cycling 600 -800 km and also spent several hours swimming. If they refuse to allow us this year, I am not sure if I will be in the same body shape the next year,” said Chhoriya.Another participant, Nilesh Zaware, said the athletes have written to the Prime Minister’s Office.“We are also communicating with them regularly to get quick updates as by Thursday, we have to give confirmation on the deferral to 2022 or else ₹50,000 that we had paid will go wasted as the organisation doesn’t refund the money,” said Zaware.Pune-based Omkar Jokar, a mechanical engineer, was to participate in the event along with a visually-impaired Aurangabad resident Nikit Dalal. The duo was to ride a cycle for 180km.“It was a special event and Nikit was very happy as we had prepared well and were confident of achieving our goals in time. We are not sure if next time we will get so much time to prepare,” said Jokar.Participants have also approached newly appointed minister of state for health and family welfare Dr Bharti Pawar. “Dr Pawar has assured us that she will take the issue at the earliest with sports minister Anurag Thakur and the ministry of external affairs (MEA), “ said Dr Gachale.Pravin Pawar, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Dr Bharti Pawar’s husband, said, “We are following up the issue with MEA and are coordinating with them to chalk out a solution.”Ironman’s media cell did not revert to an email sent to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ironman-triathlon-150-indian-athletes-denied-visas-asked-to-defer-participation-to-2022-101626207295015.html
14-07-2021||Other||‘Elgar Parishad accused’s plea intends to stall fight against Maoist plague’||The National Investigation Agency (NIA), in its affidavit filed against the petition filed by Elgar Parishad case accused Surendra Gadling and Sudhir Dhawale, has informed the Bombay high court (HC) that their plea is an exercise to impede and stall investigation that has been initiated to unearth the “Maoist plague”, which the agency is fighting in the country. The affidavit has also stated that the submission in the petition that the transfer of the probe from Pune Police to NIA would lead to the agency indulging in procuring false and fabricated evidence against the petitioner and other accused was a reckless one and made with the sole purpose of misleading HC. NIA has also submitted that as the accused are booked under scheduled offences, investigation can be taken over by the central agencies from state investigators at any point of time. The affidavit, which was submitted before the bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, stated that in view of the gravity of offence and the inter-state link having implications on national security, the Central government has taken a suo motu decision to direct NIA to take up the probe into the case. The Pune Police, in its first information report (FIR) had alleged criminal conspiracy linked to banned organisation CPI (Maoist). The case was transferred to NIA on January 24, 2020. While arguing for the accused, advocate Satish Talekar stated that there were no compelling reasons for the transfer of the case to NIA after two years of registration of FIR and that there was no provision which empowered the Centre to transfer the probe after it had been completed and trial was set to commence. Talekar stated that the case was transferred due to mala fide and political expediency soon after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was ousted from power in the state and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi coalition proposed to constitute a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the matter. In its affidavit, the Central agency has stated, “...The petitioners had gone to the extent of scandalising and questioning the credibility of NIA, which is fighting for the prevention of unlawful and terrorist activities in the country in which the Maoist plague has caused destruction at many levels.” The agency further said that the action taken against the accused was “solely based on incriminating material evidence” showing their involvement in the case and any commission of scheduled offences requires investigation from NIA and therefore the transfer of probe was justified. “By trying to cast mala fide against NIA, the petitioners raised a direct attack on the criminal justice system. The petitioners and the other accused in this case have made it a tradition to file writ petitions, public interest litigations (PIL) directly or through others, particularly when the investigation is in progress,” the affidavit stated, adding that such an exercise was nothing but “sheer abuse of due process of law”. HC is likely to hear the plea next on July 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elgar-parishad-accused-s-plea-intends-to-stall-fight-against-maoist-plague-101626207175056.html

Swamy died in Holy Family Hospital, Bandra, where he had been shifted from Taloja jail on May 28 based on an HC order.HC took on record a 300-page compilation of Swamy’s medical papers since the time was kept at Taloja jail after his arrest last October, along with a report of the Bandra hospital.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar had asked the authorities to respond to the contentions that the tribal and human rights activist had passed away due to lack of medical facilities and the apathy of the jail authorities and National Investigation Agency (NIA) officers. The bench that was earlier hearing the bail application of the priest directed the authorities to respond on the request of Swamy’s senior counsel Mihir Desai.Desai had urged the court to keep pending the applications by Swamy and had also sought to call for medical records.On Tuesday, chief public prosecutor Aruna Pai, representing state prison authority, placed on record a 300-page compilation of documents which included Swamy’s medical reports since the time he was brought to Taloja jail, as well as his post-mortem report.The court took on record the compilation of Swamy’s medical papers along with the report of Holy Family Hospital, and asked the parties to collect the same from its registry.On July 5, the court had also said that all necessary inquiries required to be made in the case of custodial death should be done by a competent authority. In light of that, the court told Desai to ask someone to participate in the probe undertaken by the magistrate under section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Desai said he would respond and make submissions on the same during the next hearing.The HC posted further hearing to July 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elgar-parishad-case-bombay-hc-asks-nia-prison-authorities-to-study-stan-swamy-s-medical-reports-101626207054991.html

The petitions have sought quashing of the charge sheet filed against him on the grounds that he was framed on the basis of material that was allegedly planted on Wilson’s electronic devices. The affidavit stated that the petition was intended to delay the commencement of the trial, and as the forensic report of the US consultancy firm relied upon by the accused is not part of the charge sheet, it can be dealt with by the trial court and hence HC need not consider it. The US-based firm had no locus to give an opinion without permission of the court, it further stated and also said that its report could be relied upon at the time of leading evidence in the trial. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, which is hearing Wilson’s writ petition, was informed that Pune Police deputy commissioner Shrinivas Murlidhar Ghadge had filed an affidavit in response to the allegations made by Wilson. Apart from quashing of the charge sheet following the disclosure by Arsenal Consulting in its report that his computer was infected with a malware which was allegedly planted through an email on June 13, 2016 (two years prior to his arrest on June 6, 2018), Wilson has also sought compensation for malicious prosecution, harassment and defamation. Pune Police’s affidavit also stated that Wilson’s petition challenging the sanction granted by the Maharashtra government to prosecute him under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act was premature and that he could not dispute the approval, as the sanctioning authority had granted it after following due procedure.While dealing with the issue of sanction, the affidavit stated, “If at all the petitioner wants to contend that the sanction is not proper and the authority granting the sanction has not followed the proper procedure, it is necessary to give the opportunity of being heard to the sanctioning authority and the prosecution at the time of trial.” The police said that the present petition is filed to cause delay in the trial as cognisance of the charge sheet has already been taken by the trial court and hence, sought dismissal of the petition.HC will hear Wilson’s plea on July 26 along with the plea of another co-accused, Shoma Sen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rona-wilson-s-plea-to-quash-charge-sheet-filed-to-delay-trial-pune-police-101626206994969.html

In the first raid, Rahmeen Charaniya – a consulting psychologist affiliated to a well-known hospital in south Mumbai – was arrested and 10-kg brownie cake containing hashish, 320 grams of opium along and cash worth ₹1.72 lakh were allegedly seized a from his residence. NCB officers said the cake was being sold as hash brownie. According to an NCB officer, a team raided Charaniya’s residence in Mazagaon on Monday evening after receiving specific information. “He was allegedly involved in baking brownie cakes with a mixture of weed/hashish and opium and used to supply them in private parties of high-profile groups in the city,” said NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. During interrogation, Charaniya revealed a man named Ramzan Shaikh used to supply hashish and weed to him. The officers then intercepted Shaikh in Crawford Market and allegedly seized 50 grams of hashish. “Hash brownie is made using hashish as an ingredient, and eaten for its psychoactive effects. Ingesting cannabis and hashish are among the most powerful ways to abuse cannabis-based drugs and produces. The effect lasts for at least six hours because in process of smoking, the THC (a psychoactive compound in cannabis) travels directly to the brain and leaves a more potent effect on receptors. This is why edibles are so much more hard-hitting than just smoking,” mentioned in the release. In another operation, the federal agency received information that a Nigerian national, Chukwu Emeka Ogboma alias Micheal, is allegedly involved in the illicit sale of cocaine at Nallasopara and its nearby vicinities. He was intercepted and during the search, the agency recovered an intermediate quantity of cocaine, said Wankhede. Ogboma is working for a syndicate based in Nigeria and delivers drugs based on the cartel’s directions. The seized contraband is a part of consignment sourced from South American countries like Peru, Brazil and Chile. NCB is investigating other syndicate members and trying to bust the supply chain from abroad, added Wankhede.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/10kg-hashish-cake-drugs-seized-from-mumbai-psychologist-s-home-101626206934974.html

Congress minister Aslam Shaikh said they will find out the report if at all it has been misplaced. There was no response from the government till late on Tuesday. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte did not respond to calls and messages. The chief minister’s office (CMO) did not deny or clarify on the claims. There were also two versions in the general administration department (GAD). “It is not true that the report is misplaced. Nothing of this sort has ever happened,” said a senior GAD official, requesting anonymity. Another GAD official said, “A copy of the report was missing but we have its second copy.” The commission had been appointed by then CM Devendra Fadnavis. It was asked to probe whether the land belonged to the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation – a state subsidiary – and if the deal was illegal. Though the commission submitted its report in July 2017 and was to be tabled in the legislature, it was never made public during Fadnavis’s tenure. Khadse himself had demanded that the report be made public. Leader of Opposition in the legislative Council Pravin Darekar said, “It appears that those in the state government want to bring Khadse in trouble. If there was a BJP government, we may have faced accusations of misplacing the report as the commission has reportedly given Khadse a clean chit.”Shaikh said someone is trying to settle scores with Khadse and hence, the senior leader is facing the probe, based on which he was sidelined. “After Khadse joined NCP, they [BJP] are trying to harass him through new means. Taking revenge from a leader like Khadse, who spent his entire life for the party and parted ways due to some reasons, is not fair,” Shaikh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-panel-report-on-ncp-leader-eknath-khadse-s-land-deal-missing-101626206814950.html

Congress central leadership has reportedly expressed unhappiness over Patole’s remarks and has asked him to avoid needless controversies. Patole had kicked up a row last week after stating that he was put under surveillance by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar, and that his movements and chats were being closely watched. After a clip of him making these allegations at a party meeting on Saturday went viral, there were strong reactions from Congress’ allies NCP and Shiv Sena and even from within the party. He also had said that Pune district was neglected and funds were diverted to Ajit Pawar’s constituency Baramati. He went on to saying that NCP and Sena backstab Congress when it comes to releasing development funds for the bodies controlled by it.The statements had irked NCP and Sena leaders. Pawar had ridiculed Patole on Sunday by saying that he was “a small leader whose comments do not warrant a response.” Senior Congress leaders took the reaction from Pawar seriously, and it was brought to the notice of the central leadership. The state leaders raised the issue of frequent ‘misfiring’ statements by Patole which unnecessarily create rift between coalition partners, during their meeting with leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, and All India Congress Committee general secretary and Maharashtra in-charge HK Patil in the past two days. Kharge was in Mumbai on Monday.“The strong reaction by Pawar was taken seriously by the Congress. Patole’s statement related to the alliance in the forthcoming local body polls and a letter related to the probe in a tender related to the mining department held by the Shiv Sena, too, had created troubles within the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi. His resignation from the speaker’s post, given without consulting two other parties, has already created bitterness within the alliance. The Congress leaders called on Pawar to ensure that further rift in ruling parties is averted,” said a senior leader who aware of the developments.Besides Patil, senior leaders and state ministers Ashok Chavan and Balasaheb Thorat met Pawar at his home. Patole was deliberately kept away from the meeting. He had a one-on-one meeting with Patil in the morning. Patil reportedly expressed his unhappiness over Patole’s tirade against MVA allies. However, later Patil downplayed the episode by saying that Patole’s statement was misconstrued in the media. “A wrong statement leads to disturbance within the ruling alliance, but Patole’s statement was mispresented in the media. He was speaking about the Central government and he himself has clarified it,” said Patil.Patole said he was misquoted, and the leak of the selective part of the video was a conspiracy to defame the party. He said that the meeting with Pawar was to persuade the Centre for the release of the empirical data on other backward classes. As the collection of the empirical data by the state backward classes commission was not possible in next three-four months before the local bodies’ elections, there was no option to get it from the Centre, said Patole. He also claimed that the state leaders were planning to meet CM to push for the data.Meanwhile, Patil held number of meetings with state and Mumbai Congress leaders over the past two days to discuss the party’s preparedness for the forthcoming local body elections. Twenty-four district councils, 22 municipal corporations and 144 municipal councils and panchayats are scheduled for polling till May 2022. Meanwhile, senior Congress leader and former CM Prithviraj Chavan said that leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis misguided the legislature by saying there were 80 million errors in the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) data. He said that the Registrar General and Census Commissioner and Union home ministry have already clarified that SECC data has been thoroughly analysed and there was no error in 98.87% data. Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has stated that the letter by Centre in July 2015 to state governments had clearly stated that there were 80 million errors in SECC data. BJP said that of them, 67.3 million were latter rectified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/row-over-nana-patole-s-statements-congress-seniors-meet-sharad-pawar-for-damage-control-101626206695027.html

Strike was observed in parts of Valley as former J&K chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti and the National Conference (NC) slammed the government for locking the gates of the graveyard. Shop and businesses were closed and traffic movement was thin owing to a spontaneous shutdown in Srinagar. However shops in many rural towns were open and vehicles were plying normally. “Today on the occasion of Martyr’s day, gates leading to their graveyards have been locked up. Attempts to distort & rewrite Kashmir’s history is being done only to create a sense of defeat & helplessness amongst Kashmiris,” tweeted Mehbooba Mufti.“Government imposed restrictions disallowed our visit to Mazare Shohada today.

It was terrifying,” he recalled.Brani Devi, a resident of Rulehar, said, “The water was flowing dangerously above normal level. About a dozen people were digging channels to divert the flow.” “About 11am, Bhimo Ram, who is among the missing and whose house is the first on the top of the village, started screaming and warned the people to run to safety. People outside rushed to a safer spot. However, those who were inside their houses got no time as debris swallowed everything within seconds.

The incident took place around 3pm when Masih was addressing a protest held by the Christian community members demanding quashing of case registered against him. Masih, also a former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader, was rushed to Amritsar Fortis Escorts Hospital. On Monday, the court of additional district and sessions judge Pushpinder Singh cancelled Masih’s interim bail that was granted on medical grounds following the recommendations of a high powered committee constituted by the Supreme Court to decongest jails during the first wave of Covid-19 in July 2020. The STF had opposed the bail. The SFT had recovered the contraband from a house that was on Masih’s name in February 2020 on the disclosure of one Sukhbir Singh, alias Happy, who was arrested with 6kg of heroin in Mohali. After the raid, the police had arrested seven people, including Masih and an Afghanistan national. During investigation, many more people were named in the case, including the racket’s kingpin Simranjit Singh, alias Sandhu. The heroin was smuggled from Pakistan via a Gujarat post, the investigation had found.The Afghan national was helping the other accused in processing the contraband. Masih had given his house on rent to another accused Sukhwinder Singh since December 2019. According to the STF, Masih was charging ₹80,000 per month rent from the accused and he was aware of the drug smuggling racket.Pressure tactics, say police Masih’s son Joel alleged that the STF officials were harassing his father. However, deputy superintendent of police (STF) Vawinder Mahajan, who is investigating the case, termed the incident a “drama”. He said: “The accused has been trying to put pressure on us and creating a scene to avoid going to the prison. We have enough evidences against him,” he said. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-city 1) Harjit Singh said: “According to the doctors, Masih is out of danger.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/194kg-heroin-haul-case-accused-tries-to-end-life-outside-amritsar-stf-office-101626206275562.html
14-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers reluctant to adopt DSR for paddy sowing due to abundant availability of water: PAU study||Farmers are unwilling to adopt the direct seeding of rice (DSR) technique as an alternative to sowing of paddy with traditional puddling due to an “abundant availability of water”, a study conducted by the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has revealed. The study, funded by the Punjab State Farmers’ and Farm Workers’ Commission, focused on the paddy crop pattern in 2020. The DSR helps save water consumption by at least 15% when compared to the traditional method and also saves in terms of labour cost. “Besides abundance of irrigation water, the farmers’ trust in the well-established paddy transplantation and no experience of DSR were also seen as the reasons behind non-adoption of the new method,” adds the report. Farmers’ commission member secretary BS Sidhu said it is not easy to bring behavioural changes as the traditional method has been practise for years. “The new method is a paradigm shift and it will take some time for the paddy growers to adopt it,” he added. Last year, paddy was sown through DSR method over 5 lakh hectare area in the state. The results are not encouraging this time as the agriculture department is way behind its targets of doubling the area. As per information gathered by the Ludhiana-based Remote Sensing Centre, the area recorded under DSR is more or less the same when compared with the previous season with the sowing nearing end. As part of the study, the experts gathered data from 11 districts — Hoshiarpur, Ropar, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ludhiana, Sangrur, Ferozepur, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Faridkot, Muktsar and Bathinda. The study covered 2 blocks with the highest reported area under DSR and 5 villages in each district where the method was majorly adopted, covering 110 villages of 22 blocks of the state. Of the 1,650 farmers approached for the study, 1,100 were those who adopted the DSR. The report concludes that more educated farmers who were associated with organisations such as kisan clubs and cooperatives tended to adopt the DSR method They are medium to large farmers with an average holding of 22 acres. The highest concentration of DSR was reported in south-western districts — Muktsar (72.5%), Bathinda (61.4%), Sangrur (57.3%) and Faridkot (56.0%). In Hoshiarpur, Amritsar, Ferozepur, Ropar and Fatehgarh Sahib, the coverage was 40-50% while in Ludhiana and Jalandhar districts, it was between 30% and 40%. Three districts — Jalandhar, Ropar and Ludhiana — reported 70-80% of the DSR area that was replaced with traditional sowing last year. Faridkot, Fatehgarh Sahib, Sangrur, Muktsar, Bathinda, and Ferozepur districts recorded 35-60% such area. Poor initial germination, high weed infestation, poor crop look and the problem of rodents were among the primary reasons for ploughing of the area under DSR and switching to transplanting of paddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-farmers-reluctant-to-adopt-dsr-for-paddy-sowing-due-to-abundant-availability-of-water-pau-study-101626206162019.html

Joshi was expelled from the BJP for six years three days ago for alleged “anti-party activities”. He has expressed solidarity with the farmers agitating against the Centre’s three contentious agriculture laws and questioned the role of the party’s state leadership in handling the issue. “I have come to seek blessings for initiating a new journey.

I also request God to show us the path of serving the people of Punjab by rising above petty politics,” the ex-minister said after paying obeisance at the Golden Temple and the Durgiana Temple in Amritsar along with his supporters.“They (BJP leaders) might be thinking that they punished me but for me it is a medal I received for voicing for people’s rights. I raised my voice for 500 farmers who died during the agitation,” he said.On taking BJP leaders hostage and manhandling them by the agitating farmers at Rajpura, he said, “What happened at Rajpura was not good but it was a result of the stubbornness shown by the Union government on the issue of farm laws. The state party leadership has failed in handling the issue wisdom and maturity.”On the possibility of his joining a political party, he said, “I am still thinking what I can do for Punjab, my motherland.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/my-expulsion-from-bjp-pre-planned-started-a-new-innings-anil-joshi-101626206159360.html

Later, another communique was sent on June 28 and the board was asked to submit the details by July 11,” said a VB official. PPCB chairman Satwinder Singh Marwaha said the bureau was seeking some official records. “We have handed over the same on time,” he said.Last week, principal secretary (science, technology, and environment) Anurag Verma had shifted a senior PPCB environment engineer for alleged corruption after he was accused of receiving ₹15 lakh bribe from Ludhiana-based industrialists and s ordered an inquiry. The money was taken for clearing the operations of common effluent treatment plants (CETPs).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ppcb-submits-records-to-vb-in-graft-complaint-against-official-after-3-reminders-101626206155572.html

He questioned the present system to renew the pay and pensions by the Vidhan Sabha itself, the members of which are the beneficiaries of their own decision. Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, Dhindsa also an MLA, said Punjab government’s acceptance of the recommendations of the sixth pay commission and the announcement to increase salaries and pensions is no less than a hoax. “The state government had announced a 259% increase. But if we look at the past performance of the government, it has so far remained silent on the payment of arrears of salaries and DA to the employees from January 1, 2016, to June 30, 2021,” he said. The former finance minister said as per the new notification, the government needs ₹25,000 crore to clear dues of around 5 lakh employees whereas only ₹8,000 crore is earmarked in the budget for the year 2021-22. “The finance minister had promised in his budget speech to clear all arrears but no mention of this has been made in the notification issued by the Punjab government,” said Dhindsa. He also criticised the cut in the house rent allowance and rural allowance. “NPAs of doctors, who are currently risking their lives, used to be the part of salaries. It has now been made an allowance,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lawmakers-pay-perks-pension-need-rationalisation-parminder-dhindsa-101626205798055.html
14-07-2021||Chandigarh||Capt hits out at AAP, SAD over political funds charge||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday hit out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for “lying blatantly” on the issue of political funding from private power companies.He said unlike the illegal donations made to these parties by various shell companies, the funds provided to the Congress have nothing to do with Punjab elections or the controversial power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by the Akalis. Amarinder said that political donations by certain power companies were made not to the Punjab Congress but to the All India Congress Committee (AICC) back in 2009 and 2014, with no connection whatsoever to the incumbent government in the state. He slammed the SAD and AAP for spreading carnage of lies in a desperate attempt to mislead the people ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. The PPAs in question were signed by the erstwhile SAD-BJP government, and were legally binding so that his (Amarinder’s) government could not rescind the same without heavy penalties on the cash-strapped state, he added in a statement. On Monday, the AAP and SAD accused the Congress of taking funds from private companies running power plants in the state. While the AAP alleged that the Congress did not cancel the faulty PPAs due to funds received for the party, the SAD demanded a CBI probe. Dismissing their allegations, Amarinder said his government was exploring legal recourse to neutralise ill-effects of the PPAs without further burdening the state’s exchequer, which the Akalis, along with their BJP allies, had allegedly milked dry to fill their own pockets. He claimed that the donations taken by Arvind Kejriwal’s party during the 2014 elections were already under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate as, unlike the funds donated to AICC by the private power companies, these were neither accounted for nor declared. Media reports recently said that the ED had registered a case pertaining to four cheques amounting ₹50 lakh, allegedly given to the AAP during the 2014 Delhi assembly elections. Last year, Delhi Police had registered a case of forgery, cheating against four companies, he said.Capt trying to lie his way out, alleges SADThe Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) accused chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh of trying to lie his way out after his party was caught taking funds from private thermal plants. SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema asked the CM to explain how he had made a differentiation between the Punjab Congress and the AICC. “How can the Punjab Congress unit be a separate entity from AICC? It is surely subservient to it,” he said in a statement. He accused the chief minister of trying to fool Punjabis by admitting that money was taken but by the high command and not him even though he was part and parcel of the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-hits-out-at-aap-sad-over-political-funds-charge-101626205795436.html

According to the plea, he declared an income of ₹9.66 crore in October 2016. However, the assessment done under Income Tax Act 1961 by the department, which was completed on December 21, 2018, estimated it at ₹13.19 crore. Sidhu has told the court that he was intimated about the same through a notice served on him on March 31, 2019, against which he moved an appeal before the joint commissioner, income tax, Range-1, Amritsar, who acts as commissioner, income tax (appeals), seeking revision. However, the impugned order of dismissal of the revision plea was taken on March 27, 2021, which as per Sidhu was passed on “flimsy and untenable grounds”. Rather than divulging on merits, his appeal was dismissed in a completely arbitrary manner, he claimed, seeking direction to quash the March 27 order. The plea was taken up by the bench of justices Ajay Tewari and Vikas Bahl, but hearing was deferred till July 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-moves-hc-against-income-tax-dept-101626205619579.html

The activists also marched to Mann’s house and handed over ‘proof’ of alleged AAP’s plan to close down four thermal plants in Punjab within seven days as petitioned in the apex court as well as letters written by Delhi environment minister to the Centre and the Central Pollution Control Board, demanding closure of the thermal plants. YAD president Parambans Singh Romana said, “We have come with proof to Bhagwant Mann’s house so that he does not get another chance to peddle lies by claiming the Delhi government only wanted the thermal plants in Punjab to be upgraded and not closed.” Mann said the Akali Dal has started rehearsals to hold protests once the AAP forms the government in Punjab in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/yad-stages-dharna-near-bhagwant-mann-s-house-in-sangrur-101626205436877.html

Responding to the AAP’s post asking him to comment on Twitter on the Congress’ fund raising from power companies, Sidhu posted that the opposition party has always recognised his vision and work and knows who is really fighting for Punjab. “Our opposition AAP has always recognised my vision & work for Punjab. Be it before 2017– Beadbi, Drugs, Farmers Issues, Corruption & Power Crisis faced by People of Punjab raised by me or today as I present “Punjab Model” It is clear they know – who is really fighting for Punjab (sic),” he tweeted with an old video of AAP leaders Sanjay Singh and Bhagwant Mann extolling him. The video showed Sanjay Singh showering praise in 2017 after Sidhu had quit the BJP and there was talk that he may join the AAP and another visual was of Mann calling the former cricketer his role model. The MLA’s tweets were seen by some as an attempt to warm up to the AAP amid his ongoing rift with Amarinder . The Congress top leadership has held a series of meetings to find a way to accommodate Sidhu in the state unit. In another tweet, the Amritsar East MLA said: “If the opposition dares to question me, yet they can’t escape my Pro-People Agenda…This means they have resigned to their fate (sic)”. Sidhu also questioned the AAP’s digs at him lately. “Our opposition singing about me and other loyal Congerssmen – Tum Agar AAP mein aaoge toh koi baat nahin…tum agar Congress mein rahoge toh mushqil hogi (If you join the AAP, it is okay…if you remain in the Congress, it will be difficult),” he added. On Monday, Mann, while addressing a press conference, accused the ruling Congress of not scrapping the faulty power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed with private companies during the previous SAD-BJP government as it had received funds from them for the party. “Sidhu has been tweeting a lot. He should post a tweet on the funds received by the Congress from power companies,” the AAP leader said, taking a jibe at the former minister’s frequent tweets seeking annulment of power pacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-takes-a-dig-at-aap-says-it-recognised-his-vision-for-state-101626205435455.html

While the civic body has roped in a third party temporarily for shifting the garbage generated in the city to the main dumpsite at Tajpur Road, the waste processing work at the main site has come to a halt. Over 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage is generated daily in the city. Over 16 lakh metric tonnes of garbage has accumulated at the dumpsite over years. The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) has been protesting against the failure of MC in taking up solid waste management.The MC committee had visited Vellore, Tamil Nadu in 2019, and Indore in 2020 to study solid waste management there but, no concrete steps have been taken yet.Mayor Sandhu said MC is studying the waste management models in different cities before hiring a firm to deal with waste in the city. The MC officials will study the model in Chandigarh in a few days and then submit a report. The MC will soon float the tenders to hire a contractor. A consultant firm will also be appointed for the installation of a ‘waste to energy’ plant at the main dumpsite to dispose of the garbage generated in the city.During the meeting, Ashu directed the officials to expedite the execution of development projects including laying of new athletic track at Guru Nanak Stadium, running the biogas plant in Haibowal Dairy Complex to its full capacity, and rejuvenation of Buddha Nullah, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-civic-body-to-study-door-to-door-waste-collection-in-chandigarh-101626205135448.html

He was later arrested.The boy’s grandfather, Kundan Lal of Green City, Raikot, was with the victims when the accident took place. He said, “We had gone to a market near the Old Bus Stand and were walking along the roadside when a speeding car hit Seeta and Nitin. While Seeta was thrown onto the side, Nitin was crushed under the car. I managed to extricate Nitin from under the car with the help of onlookers and rushed them to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital.”Both Nitin and Seeta were in a critical condition.

14-07-2021||Mumbai||Will take a decision at an apt time, says Pankaja Munde||Upset over the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) decision to ignore her sister and Beed MP Pritam Munde Khade for a ministerial berth at the Centre and instead picking another Other Backward Classes (OBC) leader for the post, party leader Pankaja Munde on Tuesday trained guns on the party’s state leadership. Munde, who is considered as BJP’s OBC face in Maharashtra, ruled out a revolt against the party, but insisted that she has been avoiding a “Dharmayuddha” (war fought for principles) as much as possible and would take a decision at an appropriate time. Munde did not deny that she was unhappy over the party’s decision and blamed the BJP’s state leadership, but at the same time insisted that she had full faith in the party’s central leadership.Munde’s supporters see the party’s decision to elevate party’s Rajya Sabha MP Bhagwat Karad as a union minister a move to put forth a new OBC leader and to undermine the importance of Pankaja. They blamed former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for the same. The supporters, many of whom apparently quit party posts in protest, had gathered outside Munde’s residence at Worli on Tuesday.“Time is the solution to everything. This is not the time to take any extreme decision. Why should we leave our own house, which has been built with our efforts? We will see if the roof comes crumbling down on us in the future,” she remarked. Pankaja is the eldest daughter of the late Gopinath Munde, who played a significant role in building the party’s base in Maharashtra. He was also regarded as the most influential OBC leader in the state and is often credited with changing the earlier perception of the BJP that it was a party of a few upper caste communities. After her father’s death in 2014, Pankaja has been fighting to retain his legacy in state politics. She was locked in a bitter power tussle with Fadnavis. Following Karad’s inclusion in the union cabinet last week, several of her supporters expressed their anguish on the social media and blamed Fadnavis, alleging that the move was aimed at undermining Pankaja’s leadership. Karad, once a confidant of the late Gopinath Munde, comes from the OBC community and also hails from the central Maharashtra region, just like Pankaja Munde. Pankaja, while addressing her supporters on Tuesday, said that though they are unhappy with the party decision and though the “sacrifice” and the “hardwork” done by them has not been honoured by the leadership, it was not time to quit the party. Pankaja also equated their fight against the “ill-intended detractors” within the party with the battle in Mahabharat. She slammed her detractors from the state unit of BJP without naming them.Munde said that she was targeted within the party for saying that she was the chief minister in the minds of the people, but what about the people who dream to become the prime minister. “I never said that I wanted to become CM. It was the wish expressed by the people. How did the news about my past remarks suddenly appear after BJP won power? I was targeted for the same, but what about the people who say they want to become the prime minister? They keep talking about the posts and ministerial berths I got, but conveniently forget about what was snatched away from me,” she remarked. Munde also hinted that many leaders in the state unit of the party were upset with the leadership in the state and were in touch with her. “Even the lieutenants of Kauravas in Mahabharat were not with them emotionally. They were mentally with the Pandavas,”she said. She also announced that the resignations submitted by her supporters were rejected by her. Her supporters openly spoke against party’s decision about not inducting Pritam in the cabinet.Munde said that she has full faith in the party’s central leadership and they will never let her down. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi, union home minster Amit Shah, party’s national president JP Nadda are our leaders and I have full faith in them. They have treated me with full respect. Even in our meeting with the central leadership on Monday, I told Naddaji about the discontent among party workers. He has shown full faith that I will convince you to calm down. This is a short pause in our political journey,” she said in an emotional appeal to supporters.Till late in the evening, the state BJP had not reacted to Munde’s remarks. There was no reaction from Fadnavis either. Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “It was a revolt by Pankaja Munde, although she has not said so directly. It was an attempt of show of strength and a warning of an extreme step. She has attacked Devendra Fadnavis without naming him and has praised the central leadership. Though BJP’s central leadership never gives in to pressure tactics, it may take a different stand in Pankaja’s case as she is an OBC face and enjoys a support base in parts of Marathwada and western Maharashtra. She can dent BJP if she decides to walk out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-take-a-decision-at-an-apt-time-says-pankaja-munde-101626204714851.html
14-07-2021||Mumbai||‘No decision’ to declare wetlands as bird sanctuaries, says Maharashtra in RTI||Responding to a right-to-information (RTI) request from a Navi Mumbai-based environmentalist, the state revenue and forest department said “no decision” has so far been taken by the state wildlife board (SBWL) to declare wetlands in Sewri, Navi Mumbai and Uran as bird sanctuaries. These include 1,600 hectares across Sewri-Mahul on the city’s eastern seafront, Panje-Funde in Uran, and the TSC-NRI wetland complex in Navi Mumbai. The government’s response, dated June 11, and shared with HT this week by the applicant NGO, NatConnect Foundation, has drawn the ire of environmentalists, given that it is seemingly at odds with earlier commitments made by the state.The then Devendra Fadnavis government had, on December 4, 2015, announced via the official Facebook page of the chief minister’s office (CMO), “CM Devendra Fadnavis chaired the 10th meeting of the State Wildlife Board at Mumbai, in presence of forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. The board approved three bird sanctuaries in Mumbai region (Mahul-Shivdi, TSC land near Palm Beach and Panje Funde), which will help in conservation of flamingos.” The announcement is still available on the CMO’s official page.Mitigation measures suggested by Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) were taken into consideration before giving approval to the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) project, the post read. “There is a need to give protected status to the wetlands of southern Mumbai... especially, the Uran mudflats, and the NRI-TSC wetlands, Panje-Funde wetlands,” the BNHS had noted in a 2015 report to the MMRDA, prior to the construction of MTHL, and which was considered by SBWL before it green lit the project. The minutes of SBWL’s December 2015 meeting clearly mentioned that the session had approved the wildlife mitigation measures as suggested by BNHS.However, almost six years later, there has been little movement toward bringing these wetlands under any kind of legal protection. Instead, the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary was declared in 2015 has been criticised for not including some of the most prime flamingo habitats within its 1,690 hectares delineation.“There was a public announcement to bring these satellite wetlands under the ambit of the wildlife act. If the plans have changed or scrapped, it calls for a public clarification. BNHS’ suggestion seems to have just slipped through the cracks. More worryingly, the minutes of the December 4, 2015 meeting of SBWL do not reflect any such decision. It makes one wonder if the Fadnavis government jumped the gun on announcing their decision, which had to be dropped later for whatever reason,” said BN Kumar, of the NatConnect Foundation.HT reached out to Fadnavis for a comment on this development, but did not receive a response until late on Tuesday.A senior government official privy to the matter, who did not wish to be identified by either name or department, threw some light on the issue. “The bird sanctuaries were approved in principle, but they would have been a challenging task to establish in Mumbai. The government would have had to draw a 10km eco-sensitive zone around the sanctuaries, and this would have jeopardised the MTHL project itself. Besides, there was no separate proposal tabled either by BNHS, or by MMRDA, or by the various land-owning bodies like CIDCO and JNPT to declare the water bodies as sanctuaries.”This view was echoed by Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell). In order to enhance protection for these satellite wetlands, the Maharashtra forest department last June approved and published an official document showing six ecologically sensitive areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) as wetlands, as part of a 10-year management plan for the Thane creek flamingo sanctuary (TCFS). Six sites – Bhandup (11 ha) in Mumbai, Panje (124 ha), Belpada (30 ha), Bhendkhal (8 ha) in Uran, Training Ship Chanakya (13 ha) and NRI Complex (19 ha) in Navi Mumbai – were designated officially as satellite wetlands.Then, in July 2020, forest department wrote to the Cidco and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) — who own the land on which this network of wetlands is located — seeking their comments on declaring these six water bodies as Conservation Reserves under the Indian Wildlife Act, which would deter any further development around them. Cidco and JNPT both rejected this proposal.In a response to the forest department, Cidco wrote that these sites “are developable land parcels” which “do not qualify to be declared as wetlands.” Cidco is also currently fighting a Bombay high court order which restricts it from developing the TSC-NRI wetlands into an 80 hectare golf course and residential complex. “As it is challenging to declare these areas sas sanctuaries, we have now asked BHNS to formally respond to the points raised by CIDCO and JNPT. Our view is that the wetlands should at least be given Conservation Reserve status.

14-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra vaccine shortage sparks worry over 3rd wave||Three weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced universal adult vaccination across the country to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, Maharashtra -- the state which has conducted the highest number of vaccinations – faces an acute shortage of vaccine doses. The Centre announced free vaccination for all adults starting June 21, which led to a record 8.5 million doses administered that day across the country. Maharashtra administered 552,921 doses the following day, its single-highest number till that day. However, unavailability of doses in the ongoing mass immunisation programme has sparked concerns about staving off the third wave effectively and reviving economic activities, many of which are dependent on vaccination as per the state’s unlock guidelines. On Tuesday, only 263,152 people were vaccinated across 2,734 centres in the state. “It is due to the shortage of vaccines from the central government that many of our vaccination centres in Mumbai and Maharashtra are closed,” said Mumbai city guardian minister Aslam Shaikh.Though Maharashtra remains the state which has vaccinated the highest number of people – 37 million till date; its capacity, health minister Rajesh Tope told the Assembly last week, is 1 million a day – several districts have been forced to halt their vaccination on certain days after running out of vaccine supply. For instance, on July 11, other than Gondia, districts of Hingoli, Sindhudurg, Osmanabad and Wardha recorded zero vaccinations. “The cumulative supply of vaccines has improved compared to previous months. However, the vials are now supplied in lesser quantities on a weekly basis which is slowing down the vaccination process as the demand has increased drastically. Though we have a capacity to vaccinate [over] 1 million people daily we can’t meet our target due to the shortages. We are failing to meet the growing demands,” said Dr Archana Patil, director, Maharashtra Health Services. The state received 700,000 doses four days ago. Last week, the state passed a resolution seeking 30 million doses a month from the Centre. Tope said that the increased doses would help expedite the vaccination drive, which was “necessary for economic revival”. The financial capital of the country too is feeling the pinch. On July 12, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had only 120,000 vials of Covishield and 40,000 vials of Covaxin. The civic body has the capacity to inoculate 100,000 people daily. In Prabhadevi, citizens lining up from 4 am onwards on Tuesday for their shot were told that the centre had only 25 doses for walk-ins. Similarly, in Palghar, 2,000 citizens lined up for vaccination, but only 500 doses were available.“Last week, we got 85,000 doses of Covishield and on Monday, we got another 35,000 doses. As per protocols, the central government will procure 75% of the produced vaccines and the remaining 25% of the vaccines will be given to the private hospitals. So, we can’t do anything about this as the procurement process is centrally monitored,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC. An analysis of data provided by the state health department shows that between June 18 and 30, 5.2 million people were vaccinated in Maharashtra. The number fell to 4.5 million over the following 12 days, between July 1 and 12. Officials attribute the dip to the disruption in the timely supply of vials to districts from the Union health ministry, which oversees the distribution of vaccines across the country. Shortage of vaccines is also damaging the efforts made by district health officials (DHO) and ASHA workers to quell vaccine hesitancy. Take the case of 67-year-old Sudarshan Bhede from Birsi village in Gondia. Bhede is among many residents of his village who hasn’t taken a single dose of anti-Covid-19 vaccines. On July 8, Parbhani Nene, a local ASHA worker, knocked on Bhede’s door and counselled him and his family members about the importance of vaccination. “Bhede is a senior citizen with cardiac ailment which makes him vulnerable to the virus. But due to his scepticism over the efficiency of the vaccines, he avoided taking the shots along with his family members. But after an hour of counselling, he finally agreed for the vaccine. I helped them get vaccination slots on June 11,” said Nene. But after travelling for two kilometres to reach the centre, they were informed that the vaccination drive was cancelled due to lack of vials. “I will again have to visit the family to convince them to visit the centre for vaccination. This is really discouraging,” she said. Dr Ajay Davale, district health officer, Wardha, said they are getting a supply of only 10,000-14,000 vials [per consignment] which is inadequate to meet the rising demand. “On Monday, I got 13,000 vials and on the same day, we finished all the doses due to the high demand. With rising awareness, we are getting better responses but we don’t have vials. On Tuesday (July 13), we had zero vaccination as I don’t have a single vial,” he said. Meanwhile, a few private hospitals like Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai Central, and Shalby Hospital have procured Sputnik vaccine from the manufacturers directly. Dr Parag Rindani, regional head, Wockhardt Hospital they have enrolled 200 people for the first shot of the vaccine through the Co-WIN application. Dr T Jacob John, virologist and retired professor at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, blamed the central government for lack of preparedness before giving the emergency approval for the use of the vaccines. “In January, the Centre approved emergency use of Covishield. But even after seven months, districts are struggling to get vials. This shows how the authorities failed to estimate the demands in India. Despite rolling out nationwide mass immunisation programme, it is heartbreaking that many still continue to die of the infection, ”said Dr John. Staving off the third wave In the first 11 days of July, Maharashtra reported 88,130 Covid-19 cases amidst the looming fear of a third wave. As photos and videos on social media go viral showing with the relaxation of the lockdown, people are again violating the Covid-19 appropriate behaviour which could be the precursor for the third wave. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state’s Covid-19 taskforce, said, “We need to focus on two things now— consistency in the supply of vaccines and breaking the hesitancy among people from the rural parts of the state. Double vaccination can lessen the impact of the third wave in the population.” In the last week of June, state Food and Drug Administration Minister Rajendra Shingne stated that nearly 50 lakh people including five lakh children could be infected in Maharashtra in a possible third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Taking this into consideration, public health experts have raised the need to vaccinate as many people as possible before the third wave hits the state. Dr Sanghamitra Gawde, civil surgeon of Ratnagiri said, “After the flattening of the pandemic curve, we were instructed to boost vaccination in June and July before we face the third wave. But now, the vaccination process is completely dependent on the availability of the vials.” The Centre has so far provided 28,439,060 vaccine doses and the state government has purchased 2,510,730 doses, Tope told the Assembly last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-vaccine-shortage-sparks-worry-over-3rd-wave-101626204236019.html

There the paramilitary force guards the Line of Control (LoC) along Pakistan under the operational command of the Army.Punjab shares a 553-km border with Pakistan and the front is prone to narcotics and arms smuggling. The BSF Punjab frontier was raised with the birth of the border guarding force on December 1, 1965.It has multiple battalions guarding the area, which is marked by farms of Indian farmers beyond the border fence and the Attari-Wagah integrated check post at Amritsar. The check post is popular for its daily public flag lowering ceremony conducted by BSF troops and their counterparts, the Pakistan Rangers.The border areas under this frontier also witness illegal drone activity that take flight from across the border for reconnaissance missions and dropping of arms and drugs, similar to what is seen along the Jammu front.The current IG of the Punjab frontier Mahipal Yadav will replace Mishra in Delhi, officials said.The about 2.65-lakh personnel strong BSF guards a total of 6,300 kms of India’s land border with Pakistan and Bangladesh.Out of this, the India-Pakistan IB is about 2,290km long and it runs from Jammu to Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat on the western flank of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sonali-mishra-to-be-1st-woman-to-head-bsf-s-punjab-frontier-101626204175271.html
14-07-2021||Chandigarh||Panchkula: Robbery accused kept in jail for 16 months despite bail||The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought explanation from a former Panchkula district and sessions judge about circumstances under which a robbery accused granted bail 16 months back had to remain in jail.The petitioner, Nishant, was booked in a robbery case in Panchkula on May 6, 2019. He approached the trial court and secured bail from the chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Panchkula, on February 13, 2020. However, this fact did not come to Nishant’s or his counsel’s notice, and he moved another bail plea before the sessions judge, Panchkula, on September 3, 2020, which was declined on September 15. It was against this order that he had moved the high court on October 26. The matter came to light in court when the accused filed a plea to advance the hearing, which was listed for September 14 this year. “It is very surprising that without verifying and going through the order passed by chief judicial magistrate, Panchkula, learned sessions judge, Panchkula, proceeded to dispose of the application for regular bail when it should not have been done as bail had already been granted to the petitioner,” justice HS Madaan observed, further lamenting that neither the counsel appearing for the petitioner nor the public prosecutor brought this fact to the notice of the sessions judge. It was incumbent upon the police authorities to assist the court properly and intimate it with regard to the order passed by the CJM, the high court said.‘Fix responsibility of persons at fault’Another fact that came to light was that the reply to the bail application before the sessions judge was filed by the prosecution. Also the CJM order was passed in presence of the accused, who was in custody, and his counsel, but surprisingly they didn’t come to know about the grant of bail and approached the sessions court.Justice Madaan observed that in the process, precious time of the sessions judge and high court has been wasted, and the accused has remained behind bars for more than 16 months on account of non-functioning of courts.The court has now sought explanation from Subhas Mehla, the then sessions judge, as to how this situation arose. The state’s counsel was also directed to bring this order to the notice of director, prosecution, Haryana, and director general of police, Haryana, so that responsibility of the persons at fault could be fixed and necessary action taken against them. The explanation has been sought by August 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-robbery-accused-kept-in-jail-for-16-months-despite-bail-101626203875481.html
14-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Lawrence Bishnoi gang running extortion racket in jail||A businessman from Kerala who was lodged in the Model Jail, Chandigarh, has alleged that a co-accused along with gangster Lawrence Bishnoi’s aide, who was in the same barrack, extorted ₹2 lakh from him. Complainant Philip Jacob along with five others, including Prabhat Thyagi, was arrested by the operation cell of Chandigarh Police in April for illegally dealing in remdesivir injections. After being treated for Covid-19, Jacob was moved to the Model Jail, also known as Burail jail, on May 1. After coming out on bail, he lodged a complaint at the Sector 49 police station on Monday. Jacob alleged that the extortion demands were initially made by Thyagi, who had been sharing details about Jacob’s business and financial details with other inmates in the barrack. Later, Lawrence Bishnoi’s aide Ankit Narwal, who was in the same barrack, allegedly threatened to kill Jacob in the jail if he didn’t pay up ₹40 lakh. Thyagi intimidated him further by saying that the Bishnoi gang has more than 6,000 shooters all over India and they would kill him on the date of court hearing, it was alleged.Narwal had shared the phone number of his brother Vikas with Jacob to make arrangement for the money transfer, stated the complaint. Jacob shared the number with his wife, who contacted Vikas and received details of a bank account in Rohtak. She then transferred ₹1 lakh to the account twice on June 18 and 22. According to sources, the account is in the name of Narwal’s mother Kamla Devi. According to the complaint, Jacob was supposed to pay ₹10 lakh while in jail, the remaining ₹30 lakh were to paid after he got out on bail.Police have registered a case against Narwal and Thyagi under Sections 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. “We will get the custodial remand of the duo on production warrants. Vikas and the account holder will also be questioned, but they are still at large,” said Shruti Arora, assistant superintendent of police (ASP, south).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhlawrence-bishnoi-gang-running-extortion-racket-in-jail-101626203695472.html

She adds that she was married to Badal, of Gharaunda in Karnal, but he too abandoned the mother-daughter duo.Even as the government has launched many welfare schemes for women and the economically weak, benefits of these schemes are not reaching them. They said nobody has come forward to offer help.They have two iron boxes, clothes, two charpoys, blankets, some utensils and a chulha. “Earlier they were living at a bus shelter, but from past few years, they are here. They were here even during the pandemic and lockdown,” said a police official deputed to monitor the traffic.“We have no home to go to,” the duo says.In May this year, the Haryana State Commission for Women took notice of them and officiating president of the commission, Preeti Bhardwaj Dalal, has asked the district officials to furnish details of the two so that they can be provided benefits under government schemes.District women and child protection officer Rajni Gupta said, “We tried to collect details of their family and found out that Kamla’s husband Narender had left her and married another woman before his death about five years ago.Gupta added that Sanju’s husband lives with his maternal uncle in Gharaunda and is a labourer.She said Sanju does not live with him as she does not want to leave her mother.An official of the department of social justice and empowerment said as per their present status, Kamla is entitled for widow or old-age pension and Sanju is entitled for differently-abled monthly pension, besides ration and other benefits provided by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/not-getting-benefits-of-govt-schemes-panipat-woman-differently-abled-daughter-living-under-flyover-101626202743580.html

The Joint Government Doctors’ Coordination Committee (JGDCC), accompanied by the nursing staff staged a protest outside Mother and Child Hospital. With the nursing staff also on strike, emergency, Covid, post-mortem and medico and vetro-legal services were paralysed. Only the Covid vaccination drive went on uninterrupted. Outpatient and inpatient department services, elective surgeries and other non-emergency services remained suspended as over 400 doctors posted at the civil hospitals in Ludhiana, Khanna, Jagraon, and 10 community health centres joined the protest.Patients demanded resumption of services saying that private hospitals were unaffordable. “At private practices, doctors charge anything between ₹250 to ₹500 for a checkup. The government and the doctors should think about the poor and end this impasse,” said Ranjit Singh, a resident of Field Gunj.“With nurses and doctors busy raising slogans, there is no one to attend to my father who is lying in the emergency ward,” said the irate son of a patient.16 test +ve for virusSixteen patients tested positive for the coronavirus disease in the district on Tuesday. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said, “So far, 87185 patients have tested positive for Covid, of which 84,933 have recovered, while 162 cases are active.”One Covid patients is on ventilator support.

14-07-2021||Chandigarh||Tikri border rape case: HC seeks status report of probe||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday directed the Haryana Police to file a status report of the probe into the alleged rape of a West Bengal woman, who was a participant at farmers’ protest at Tikri border.The HC bench of justice Rajesh Bhardwaj acted on plea of accused Anoop alias Anuj, who had approached the HC seeking an anticipatory bail.The status report and a response from the state government have been sought by July 23.The complaint, which became basis for an FIR, was filed by the deceased activist’s father and a case was registered on May 9.The West Bengal woman, who was first assaulted on April 28, had succumbed to Covid-19 at a private hospital in Jhajjar’s Bahadurgarh on April 30.As per police, the main accused in the rape of the 25-year-old woman, has admitted to sexually assaulting her twice — once on the train to New Delhi and then at the protest site.There are six accused who were with her on train from West Bengal to New Delhi, when she came to join the protest. HC dismissed the bail plea of another accused Ankur Sangwan on June 29, who is still at large. As of now, police have arrested only Malik.In the plea, Anoop said it was actually a case of molestation but serious charges of gangrape were filed against them by the police to oblige their political bosses.He claimed that no offence of rape is made out against anyone and even allegations of sexual harassment are against one Anil Malik, touted as the main accused by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tikri-border-rape-case-hc-seeks-status-report-of-probe-101626201715111.html
14-07-2021||Chandigarh||AJL case: Hooda approaches HC for quashing of ED case||Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has approached the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking quashing of the enforcement directorate (ED) probe of alleged money laundering in allotment of a plot to Associated Journal Limited (AJL), publisher of the National Herald newspaper.The plea will be taken up by the bench of justice Ajay Tewari and justice Vikas Bahl on Wednesday. An ECIR was registered by the ED on July 15, 2016. It filed prosecution complaint before the Panchkula trial court on August 26, 2019 and the trial court took note of it on September 26, 2019 and summoned Hooda as an accused.On July 5 this year, the trial court passed an order that it will hear arguments on framing of charges on the next date and decide plea seeking deferring of hearing in the case.The plea for the same was filed by Hooda in view of the HC staying trial against him in the CBI case into same controversy.He has argued that there is neither any legal sanction nor any material warranting his prosecution under the offence of money laundering. The complaint is liable to be dismissed as the same is violative of the constitutional protection granted under Article 20 (1) of the Constitution of India against retrospective operation of penal provision.He has claimed that no prosecution can be lawfully launched on the basis of a complaint which, admittedly from the respondent side, is subject matter of further investigation before the prosecuting agency.Hence, he has sought quashing of the August 2019 complaint and September 2019 proceedings under which cognisance was taken by the trial court.The money laundering probe was based on allegations that the property was allotted to AJL in 1982 but was taken back by the estate officer, Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) a decade later, October 30, 1992 since AJL did not comply with the conditions of allotment.In 1995 and 1996, an appeal and revisions were filed by AJL against resumption of the plot, but these were also dismissed by the HUDA administration and Haryana’s financial commissioner (town and country planning).However, when Hooda became the chief minister in 2005, he allowed re-allotment of the plot to AJL at old rates. At the time of registration of the CBI FIR, late Moti Lal Vora was chairman of AJL and Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi were among the shareholders. The newspaper was launched in 1938 by Jawaharlal Nehru.Initially, on May 5, 2016, the FIR was registered by the Haryana vigilance bureau regarding allegations of cheating and corruption against Hooda and others.In December 2016, the Haryana government recommended CBI probe. CBI has submitted a chargesheet against him in trial court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ajl-case-hooda-approaches-hc-for-quashing-of-ed-case-101626201655650.html
14-07-2021||Noida||Children suffering from clubfoot disease treated free of cost at district hospital in Noida||Noida: Salarpur village resident Uday Pratap Singh and his wife were ecstatic when their son was born in 2019. However, their joy was short-lived as neighbours and locals in their area started cursing them on seeing that their son’s feet were bent inwards.“People in the locality started calling my son ‘witch’s son’ while some blamed me and my family for the condition. Some old women in the village said I must have “stepped out during an eclipse” while pregnant. People said my son will never be able to walk as this condition is not treatable,” said Uday Pratap, who works as a daily wager for a private firm.His son, Shivaay Singh, was born at the Gautam Budh Nagar District Hospital, where the Rashtriya Bal Swastha Karyakram (RBSK) scheme of the STATE OR CENTRE? the government was launched in February 2019 to provide free treatment for congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), commonly known as clubfoot disease for patients who are up to two years of age. Clubfoot is a debilitating birth defect that causes one or both feet to point inward and upward, making it difficult and painful to walk.After Shivaay’s birth, he was screened for congenital diseases at the hospital during a follow-up after which he was referred to the orthopaedic department. Here, Dr Brajesh Kumar Singh, the district nodal officer for RBSK’s clubfoot disease program and senior orthopaedic surgeon at the hospital, started his treatment.Today, Shivaay’s feet have been cured by as much as 70% and he is able to stand with support. He is one of the 46 kids undergoing treatment at the hospital under the program since 2019. Of these, 42 are from Gautam Budh Nagar while others have been from Ghaziabad and Delhi.“Once the disease is detected at birth, the treatment begins. This disease is treated in three steps. First, their feet are plastered for five-seven weeks. Second, tenotomy surgery of the child’s foot is done. Third, special types of shoes or braces are given to the child, which are to be worn till the age of four-five years,” said Dr Brijesh.Uday Pratap said had the treatment not been free of cost, he wouldn’t have been able to afford it.In order to make the program a success, an international non-profit, Miraclefeet, has been providing technical and logistical support to the district hospital which includes training doctors as well as providing latest technology for braces for the feet. The NGO works in partnership with the Uttar Pradesh Department of Family Welfare and the National Health Mission, Uttar Pradesh.“We fund and manage the support staff to educate and follow-up with families, and provide training, technical and organizational guidance, and innovative monitoring and evaluation tools to doctors involved in the treatment. Patients under the program are provided with MiracleFeet foot abduction braces,” said Saurabh Chauhan, program executive, Miraclefeet.An estimated 7,000 children are born with clubfoot in Uttar Pradesh every year, he said.According to Dr Brijesh, lack of awareness regarding clubfoot treatment is a major concern of health officials.“Whenever a child is found born with the disease, a loud and clear message has to be given to the parents that the disease is treatable with early intervention. The disease is difficult to treat only if the child has grown up to the age of four-five or above. Under the government’s program, treatment is given to children below two years of age for free,” he said.He added that in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, the program had to be stalled for at least nine months. “Otherwise, the number of patients under the program would have been at least 100,” he said.Follow-up treatments are another cause of concern. “Most of the parents are daily wage earners and during early stages of treatment, the child needs to be brought to the hospital every week. In many cases, parents fail to do so. This is where program volunteers have to go for home visits and convince the parents to bring the child to the hospital,” said Chauhan.The high cost of treatment is another deterrent for low-income families.“While plasters at early stages cost ₹500, the cost can go upto ₹10,000 as the plaster has to be changed every week till the child is at least 10 months old. The tenotomy surgery costs around ₹25,000. Besides, the braces that the child has to wear for at least three more years cost ₹18,000 each. As the child grows, they have to be changed at least twice a year,” said Dr Brijesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/children-suffering-from-clubfoot-disease-treated-free-of-cost-at-district-hospital-in-noida-101626201656276.html

The length of corridor for the ambitious project will be 14.5km, the DPR said. In March this year, Yeida had roped in the central government agency, Indian Port Rail and Ropeway Corporation Limited, to prepare a DPR of the pod taxi project that will boost the connectivity between the Jewar airport and the film city.“This important project will provide smooth connectivity to residential and industrial areas falling between film city and the Noida International Airport. We have started studying the DPR so that we can suggest any changes if required, and subsequently it will be sent to the UP government for approvals,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.Pod taxis, which are quite popular in several western countries, can accommodate four to six passengers per car.According to the Yeida officials, earlier the project was proposed to be built on an elevated corridor but the DPR has suggested it to be constructed on surface itself.“We had planned only one corridor for pod taxi from airport to film city and return commute. But the DPR has suggested that there should be two corridors for a hassle-free and fast commute,” said Singh.Since there will now be two corridors, the cost of this project has been pegged at ₹862 crore as against an initial estimate of ₹300 crore, said the officials.As per the DPR, the corridor will pass through various sectors such as 21, 28, 29, 30 and 32, among others, falling under the Yeida region. The officials said that the authority wants the pod taxi project to be completed by 2023 when the first phase of the Jewar airport is likely to be operational. The Swiss company -- Zurich International -- may start work at the site of the airport next month, while the work on the film city project will be started once the UP government gives its green signal to the DPR sent to it on June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/pod-taxi-project-to-connect-noida-airport-with-film-city-will-cost-862-crore-says-dpr-101626201534640.html
14-07-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad corporation’s board okays 15% hike in property tax||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC) during its board meeting held on Tuesday gave a go ahead for a “pending” 15% increase in property tax. The decision will impact about 364,000 properties under the jurisdiction of the corporation, officials said.The corporation’s board also cleared a proposal related to handing over its 5,800 square metres of land at Makanpur to the health department for development of a government hospital in the trans-Hindon area of the city. “During the board meeting, it was decided that the pending hike of 15% in house tax should be implemented. The hike (5% each year) was pending for the past two financial years and the current year,” said MS Tanwar, commissioner, GMC. In 2016, the corporation board had decided to hike 5% in property tax each year in order to generate more revenues. The GMC earns about ₹150 crore on account of the property tax. However, during the financial years of 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22, the tax increase was put on hold due to different reasons, the officials said. The board also passed the budget for the current fiscal 2021-22, with ₹946 crore expenditure and an income of ₹1,197 crore. “With the clearance of the budget, we will fast-track different civic infrastructure projects. It was also decided that ₹1 crore will be spent in each of the 100 residential wards during the year. A library has been proposed in each of the five corporation zones. Besides, to plug the revenue leakage, it was decided that computerised charges deduction should be taken up at 37 parking lots operated by the corporation,” said Arun Kumar Mishra, accounts officer of the corporation. On the clearance of the proposal to give the land for a government hospital in trans-Hindon area, Tanwar said, “The land will be handed over free of cost to the health department for development of a hospital. The transfer would be done with the process of resumption through the state government.” The health department had been searching for a land for the development of a hospital for almost a decade amid demands from residents for a government medical facility in the trans-Hindon area. The move will pave the way for a 100-bed hospital at Makanpur (Indirapuram).The board meeting was held at Hindi Bhawan in Lohia Nagar in the wake of Covid protocols and several important issues were discussed, including the contentious issue of development of a multi-level underground parking at Ambedkar Park in Navyug Market. Meanwhile, as the board meeting commenced in the morning, hundreds of people from the colonies near Navyug Market walked to the meeting venue and staged a protest for about two hours, demanding shifting of the parking project to a different place. The officials said that the protesters were pacified with assurance that they will look for another place. “The board members have asked for change of place of the project. So, we will proceed in the matter after due deliberations,” said the municipal commissioner. The cost of project, which will be developed under the state smart city mission, is pegged at ₹44 crore. The corporation has already sent the detailed project report of the project that will accommodate 235 cars to the state government for approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-corporation-s-board-okays-15-hike-in-property-tax-101626201474626.html

14-07-2021||Chandigarh||Patients with severe Covid develop thyroid dysfunction: PGIMER study||Patients with acute Covid-19 infection get more frequent and severe thyroid hormonal imbalances, revealed the medical experts of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) on Tuesday.In a study titled “Spectrum of endocrine dysfunction and association with disease severity in patients with Covid-19”, the experts of the department of endocrinology, PGIMER, suggested the hospitals to supplement low cortisol steroids to severe Covid patients, as they believe that the high steroid dose given without supervision, and continued indiscriminately, may worsen hormonal imbalance.The study was published in a scientific journal, Frontiers in Endocrinology, on July 2, 2021.Giving details, professor Sanjay Kumar Bhadada, the head of endocrinology department, PGIMER, said, “Experts associate severe Covid-19 infection with multiple pre-existing endocrine conditions such as diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. But PGIMER has assessed the hormonal changes in the bodies of the patients and found that 50% developed thyroid dysfunction.“The health conditions of as many as 84 patients admitted in the dedicated Covid care centre of the hospital were assessed: 42% of the patients had moderate-to-severe-disease and even had low oxygen saturation and comorbidities, and 58% of the patients had a mild infection,” he said.“We evaluated various hormonal parameters of the patients within 24 to 48 hours of their admission to the hospital,” said Bhadada, adding that the department was studying the levels of hormonal imbalances to expand their research.A close follow up was, however, required to know whether the condition was transient or permanent, he added.Dr Liza Das, a research scientist, said that patients with severe Covid-19 were developing thyroid dysfunction, which could be hypothyroidism, euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) or atypical thyroiditis.“Though ESS does not usually need treatment, both secondary hypothyroidism and thyroiditis need follow-up and timely management. Also, low cortisol and testosterone levels were more common in those with severe Covid-19 infection. These hormonal dysfunctions need to be recognised both during the acute state and on follow-up for timely management,” concluded Dr Das.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patients-with-severe-covid-develop-thyroid-dysfunction-pgimer-study-101626201176459.html
14-07-2021||Mumbai||Monoclonal antibody cocktail: Glimmer of hope against Covid-19||As the city’s management and medical experts prepare for an anticipated third wave of Covid-19, an experimental drug has offered a glimmer of hope against the virus. Known as monoclonal antibody cocktail, the drug’s response has been analysed in 199 patients who were admitted to Mumbai’s Seven Hills Hospital, and the findings are promising, say doctors. Their analysis underlined two important findings – persistent fever in patients resolved within 48 hours and the days of hospitalisation were reduced. This suggests that the drug could play a role in reducing the number of severe Covid-19 cases and thereby the fatality. More studies with larger sample sizes can provide a better understanding of the drug’s usefulness in the fight against Covid-19. Here’s everything that we know about monoclonal antibodies and the drug cocktail. What are monoclonal antibodies? When our bodies are attacked by an infection caused by viruses or bacteria, they produce natural antibodies or proteins to fight back. These antibodies are crucial in our immune system’s defence mechanism. Monoclonal antibodies are similar to natural antibodies except that they are laboratory-made. They are designed to target a specific disease and are often referred to as ‘designer antibodies’. Monoclonal antibodies have been widely used in cancer and autoimmune diseases. A 2020 review published in the Journal of Biomedical Science stated that antibody engineering has evolved dramatically since the first monoclonal antibody was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1986 and over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market worldwide. Monoclonal antibody cocktail drug used for Covid-19 A monoclonal antibody cocktail drug is a combination of two or more monoclonal antibodies that are administered to patients. Last November, the US FDA issued an emergency use authorisation to REGEN-COV, which contains two monoclonal antibodies – casirivimab and imdevimab – to be administered together for treating mild to moderate Covid-19 patients. The cocktail is indicated for adults and paediatric patients (12 years of age or older weighing at least 40 kg) who were at the risk of progressing to severe Covid-19. India granted an emergency use authorisation to the drug in May and it is the same used by doctors at Seven Hills Hospital. The drug is available in India through a tie-up between Roche India and Cipla. There are other monoclonal antibody drugs in the fray for Covid-19. In June, India’s drug regulator gave an emergency use approval to American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly’s antibody-drug combination – bamlanivimab and etesevimab. The same month, Indian company Zydus Cadila was granted permission to conduct clinical trials for its antibody-drug therapy. How does the drug work? The monoclonal antibodies mimic the actions performed by natural antibodies during an attack by a pathogen. For instance, casirivimab and imdevimab present in REGEN-COV are specifically made to target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, designed to block the virus’ attachment and entry into human cells. “Thanks to its specific engineering of two neutralising antibodies which bind to different parts of the virus spike, the casirivimab and imdevimab cocktail remains efficacious against the widest spreading variants and reduces the risk of losing its neutralisation potency against new emerging variants,” said a release from Cipla. Doctors who have used the cocktail drug said that timing is the key to get good results. “One must also select the patients carefully,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Tanu Singhal, who practices at Mumbai’s Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital. She has administered the drug to two patients – a 75-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities and a 50-year-old man with hypertension – and found that their fever went away within 24 hours of drug infusion and they recovered well. “It’s ideal to give the drug within seven to 10 days and only to patients who are likely to progress to severe disease. It is an expensive therapy, therefore it’s crucial to choose the right candidates and not misuse it,” she said. Drugs like tocilizumab and itolizumab that were repurposed for Covid-19 are also monoclonal antibodies. While they are indicated in severe patients who have already developed inflammation, cocktail therapies like REGEN-COV have to be administered much earlier, in order to stop the patient from developing the inflammatory syndrome. A pack of REGEN-COV contains one vial of casirivimab (1,200 mg) and one vial of imdevimab (1,200 mg) and is priced at ₹1.19 lakh (inclusive of all taxes).

14-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra unveils revised policy for electronic vehicles||The Maharashtra government announced its revised electronic vehicle (EV) policy on Tuesday. It has proposed changes in the development control rules (DCR) to promote the setting up of charging stations at parking lots of housing societies and corporate parks.“We want to install charging stations to be set up at parking lots of housing societies, building premises, corporate parks and thus proposed changes in DCR, which is part of our policy. People would like to have charging stations close to their homes which will promote the use of electric vehicles in the state,” said Aaditya Thackeray, state environment and climate change minister while revealing the policy that was cleared by the state cabinet last week.“Urban local bodies will be encouraged to provide property tax rebates to residential owners for installing private charging infrastructure within their premises. Details will be announced soon,” states the Maharashtra State Electric Vehicle Policy 2021.“The developer is likely to be allowed floor space index (FSI) against the space used for charging stations so that they won’t have to face financial losses,” said an official, wishing not to be named.Thackeray said charging won’t be a problem because solutions are bound to come when demand for the electronic vehicle will increase. “The charging technology is constantly changing. With the new technology in place, vehicles can be charged with normal sockets and with the desired speed. Hence, it would be better if private charging stations are promoted. Apart from them, charging stations at government and corporation places will remain available… Bus depots can also be used for the same,” the environment minister said.In its revised policy, the state intends to set up 1,500 charging stations in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), 500 in Pune, 150 in Nagpur, 100 in Nashik, 75 in Aurangabad, 30 in Amravati and 20 in Solapur city. It plans to set up at least one public charging station in a 3 km x 3 km grid or a minimum of 50 charging stations per million population, whichever is higher, said Ashish Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, transport department.By 2025, the state also intends to provide full-scale infrastructure for electric vehicles on four major highways — Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, Mumbai-Pune Express Highway, Mumbai-Nashik, and Nashik-Pune highway, he added.The revised policy will remain valid till March 31, 2025.The state government aims to boost the demand for electric vehicles and improve supply as well through incentives. The state government believes that incentives for automobile companies and subsidies for the buyers will help in encouraging its manufacturing and increase demand among the buyers.The new policy aims to electrify 10% of all vehicles by 2025. Also, public transport and last-mile delivery vehicles will see 25% electrification under this policy. Starting from April 2022, all new government vehicles be it owned or leased operating within the major cities will be only electric, stated the policy.It also intends to incentivise purchase of 100,000 electric two-wheelers, 15,000 e-autos, 10,000 cars, 20,000 goods carriers (both three and four-wheeler) and 1,000 e-buses. Maximum incentive against two-wheelers would be ₹10,000, three-wheelers ₹30, 000, three-wheeler (goods carrier) ₹30,000, four-wheelers ₹1.5 lakh, four-wheelers (goods carrier) ₹1 lakh and e-buses ₹20 lakh.All electric vehicles will be exempted from road tax and registration charges till 2025. Scraping of electric vehicles has also been incentivized by the state. For two-wheeler ₹7,000, three-wheeler ₹15,000 and for four-wheeler ₹25,000 will be given by the state government, stated the additional chief secretary.Maharashtra was one of the first states to unveil its electric vehicle policy in February 2018. However, it could not be implemented effectively due to the subsequent changes made by various central government departments.Apart from promoting electric vehicle production and sales, the policy also emphasises the requirement of batteries for electric vehicles. It intends to set up at least one gigafactory for manufacturing advanced chemistry cell batteries. It will also allocate money for promoting research and development, innovation and skill development in the state’s electric vehicle ecosystem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-unveils-revised-policy-for-electronic-vehicles-101626201114604.html

Two forest guards were injured in the attack. The forest department has decided to lodge a police complaint against unidentified persons regarding the attack. “A team of forest guards conducting combing operations in the area were attacked by some miscreants. Our personnel escaped the attack with minor injuries,” said deputy director of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) Naveen Khandelwal. According to locals the incident occurred at around 8 am in the morning when the forest guards asked a group of men standing on the edge of the forest to vacate the area. “There were around a dozen men who hurled abuses towards the guards and tried to manhandle them. They got into the skirmish when more forest guards reached the spot,” said a local resident The incident took place hardly a kilometre away from the spot where two people were killed in a man-tiger conflict late on Sunday night. Another man who was travelling with the duo climbed on a tree and spent his night perched on the tree to avoid being killed by the big cat. After the bodies were recovered on Monday, forest department has set up motion sensor cameras in the area to identify and track the predator. Combing operation in buffer zone is also being conducted. As per forest officials, an adult female tiger, which was seen in the area with her cubs, was behind the attack. Forest officials believe that the big cat has moved towards the buffer zone after the attack. The forest department along with the local administration is also planning to launch awareness campaign in nearby villages to mitigate possibility of man-tiger conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/angry-villagers-attack-forest-guards-after-tiger-killed-two-in-pilibhit-tiger-reserve-101626201055239.html

14-07-2021||Delhi||Water crisis will be over soon, says DJB vice-chief||Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice chairperson Raghav Chadha on Tuesday said the Haryana government has released the city’s “rightful share of water”, two days after the water utility filed a petition in the Supreme Court over the issue.“The Haryana government released 16,000 cusecs (the share of water the Capital is legally entitled to) of water to Delhi, two days after the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government filed a petition in the Supreme Court. The water released at the Hathinikund Barrage will reach the city’s water treatment plants (WTPs) over the next three days,” Chadha said in a statement.On Monday, Chadha visited the Wazirabad barrage, claimed that the water level in the Yamuna has slipped to its lowest mark since 1965, and blamed Haryana for the shortages that squeezed supply in the national capital with several areas in the central, south, west and New Delhi districts going without regular supply.On Tuesday, Chadha said the water shortage being faced by residents in several parts of the city will be resolved soon with enough water being available at Delhi’s treatment plants.“Soon after the petition was filed in the SC, the Haryana government released 16,000 cusecs of water to reach Delhi for its consumption. I would like to congratulate the people of Delhi for this victory,” he said.Chadha also expressed his regret for the water shortage faced by a large number of residents over the past few days.The Haryana government on Monday strongly denied the charges of withholding water.“First, they (AAP government) presented false figures during Covid second wave to procure oxygen, much above the requirement, and now Kejriwal is doing the same on the water issue to hide his own failures. They are levelling baseless allegations,” Haryana home minister Anil Vij said on Monday.DJB officials said that, at present, the water level is around 667 feet itself but will increase to normal as the water released from Haryana reaches it. “Also, with the monsoon showers expected over the coming days, the river may swell up like every year,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be namedDelhi’s daily water demand is 1,150 millions gallons per day (MGD), and the normal daily supply is 950 MGD.

14-07-2021||Delhi||First monsoon rain meets rush hour on Tuesday||When the first monsoon shower in Delhi met the morning rush hour on Tuesday, water-logging and traffic jams were reported from several arterial roads across the city. The much-awaited southwest Monsoon finally arrived in Delhi on Tuesday, bringing respite from scorching summer temperatures as 28.1 mm rainfall was recorded at the Safdarjung observatory between 8.30am and 5.30pm, according to IMD data.According to traffic police control room records, roads around the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) flyover, Defence Colony flyover, Som Vihar, Dwarka Link Road, Airport underpass, Janakpuri West Metro station, Ashok Vihar, Chhatarpur, Qutub Minar Metro station, Uttam Nagar T-point, Mathura Road near Sarita Vihar traffic signal, and Delhi Cantonment flyover saw ong queues of vehicles trying to negotiate the inundated stretches.“There was good rainfall in the morning. Water-logging was reported on several arterial roads, slowing down the traffic movement. We ensured that additional traffic policemen were deployed to assist and direct traffic,” said a senior traffic police official asking not to be named.Flooding was reported from the Pul Prahladpur underpass, near the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road. forcing the public works department (PWD) to stop traffic movement for some time.“As a precautionary measure, we had to stop traffic for about two hours due to heavy water-logging at the Pul Prahladpur underpass. It was caused due to the overflow of a DJB (Delhi Jal Board) sewer line,” a PWD official said.However, there was no water-logging reported at the Minto Road rail underpass, a spot that gets flooded during the rains every year --- often providing an iconic and customary photograph of a blood submerged in water. PWD officials said elaborate arrangements were made to avoid water accumulation under the bridge.People posted pictures and videos of water-logged streets on social media, blaming the authorities for the annual problem.“Traffic in a standstill near Qutub Minar metro station this morning. The first rain brings traffic jams and water-logging in Delhi,” tweeted Vaibhav Bisht.Another commuter, Vipul Malik, said: “Stuck at the Delhi Cantt flyover for the last 30 minutes. If this is what the first rain does to traffic, do not want to imagine the plight on roads for the next few months.”Shalini Gupta, a resident of Saket, said every year colony roads get submerged. “The claims made by civic agencies that they have cleaned the drains and ensured proper outflow of stormwater fall flat every year. Some accountability must be fixed,” said Gupta.South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) mayor Mukesh Suryan said, “We have cleaned all drains under our jurisdiction. It is the bigger drains falling under the jurisdiction of the Delhi government departments including PWD and the Irrigation and Flood Control (I&FC) that are choked. Since the smaller drains fall into the bigger drains, the overflowing sewer water flows back and floods residential areas,” he said.Senior PWD officials rejected claims by the municipalities. They said since the corporations do not remove solid waste properly, it chokes the storm water drains despite being cleaned. “We have completed our desilting process on time. Tonnes of solid waste is dumped in drains, which chokes them and cause water-logging on the roads,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/traffic-jams-in-delhi-as-first-monsoon-rain-meets-tuesday-rush-hour-101626200816818.html
14-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 16-year-old girl hacked to death with an axe, stalker arrested||A day after a 16-year-old girl was attacked and killed by a man wielding an axe near her home in south Delhi’s Moti Bagh, police on Tuesday said they have arrested her attacker, who was allegedly stalking her for the past several months.The 21-year-old suspect was identified by his single name, Pradeep alias Praveen. Police said he was harassing the girl for a relationship but she turned him down. Around two months ago, the girl’s father slapped him for troubling his minor daughter, the police said.“Pradeep was arrested from his sister’s house in Palwal, Haryana. He was stalking the girl for the past several months and the girl’s father had slapped him over this. This angered Pradeep and he wanted to take revenge. He purchased an axe from RK Puram a month ago and used it to attack the girl on Monday afternoon. The axe was recovered from the scene of crime,” said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh.Police said the attack on the girl was captured by a CCTV camera installed near the spot. The footage helped them deduce the exact sequence of events leading to the attack and establish the attacker’s identity. It is a key piece of evidence against Pradeep, they said.According to the girl’s younger sister, Pradeep was threatening the girl for the past the few days -- he had said he would kill her before her birthday on July 13. “Pradeep attacked her just a day before her birthday. He was harassing my sister. He once came to our house drunk at night and quarrelled with us,” the sister said.Police said the teenager lived with her parents and three siblings in a slum behind some government quarters in Moti Bagh. Her parents sold fruits and electrical items from a shop nearby, with her father sometimes working part-time at an embassy ( the family did not say which one). The 16-year-old girl was a class 11 student at a government school and she helped managed the shop in her free time, police said. That was where Pradeep saw her.Pradeep lived in a tenement nearly a kilometre away from the girl’s house, but he used to visit his friend’s shop, which is nearby her parents’ shop, the police said.On Monday around 1pm, the girl was walking towards her home in Moti Bagh and was about 200 metres from her home when Pradeep allegedly accosted her and attacked her with the axe, leaving her with severe head and face injuries. He fled the crime scene, but left behind the axe covered in blood, said DCP Singh.“The injured girl was rushed to Safdarjung hospital by the time the police reached the crime scene after being alerted by a passerby. She was alive at the time of her admission, but succumbed to injuries during treatment. The case that was initially registered as attempt to murder was later converted to murder,” the officer said.Police said that the CCTV camera footage from near the crime scene was shown to the girl’s family members, who identified her attacker as Pradeep. The investigating team then examined CCTV cameras on the route that Pradeep took after the crime. A search was conducted at his house but he was missing. Through technical surveillance and information collected through their informants’ network, Pradeep’s location was traced to his sister’s home in Palwal. A search was conducted there and he was arrested, they said.Delhi has reported at least five cases of rape and six cases of sexual harassment every day this year till June 15, according to the latest data uploaded on the Delhi Police’s website. During the corresponding period last year, the capital witnessed three rapes and four cases of sexual harassment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-stalker-held-day-after-16-year-old-girl-dies-in-axe-attack-101626200695791.html
14-07-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 vaccines in short supply, may shut jab sites: Delhi govt||The Covid vaccination drive in Delhi has again run into shortages, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday, declaring that around 500 jab centres will have to be closed from Wednesday if the city does not receive more stocks.Delhi currently has a vaccine stock of 168,000 doses to be administered through 1,374 centres, Jain said.Delhi last inoculated more than 200,000 people on June 29; and between June 30 and July 13, it has vaccinated more than 100,000 people only on six occasions, according to the data from the CoWIN dashboard.“We have the capability to administer 300,000-400,000 doses a day. But there is a shortage of vaccines. We received a small stock of 150,000 Covishield doses on Monday night. We have around 168,000 doses which will not last beyond Tuesday or the first half of Wednesday. We have to shut down vaccination centres because of lack of vaccines,” Jain said.Taking a dig at the Haryana government, Jain said, “We can’t function like Haryana and slow down the vaccination drive to hoard on stocks. We are vaccinating the maximum number of people as and when we are receiving the vaccines.”On May 31, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had accused the Delhi government of exhausting its share of vaccines soon.The vaccination drive picked up pace after a policy change from June 21, when the Centre took over the procurement and free distribution of vaccines to all adults. Union health ministry officials, however, said states should plan their drives according to the supply of vaccines.“We are running a marathon, not a sprint race; and need to understand its challenges... From about 250,000 doses daily average in January to the current 4 million doses, we have made significant progress. States are being informed about supplies well in advance and can plan vaccination coverage accordingly. In some time, there will be more doses available,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, during a press briefing on Friday on vaccine shortage.Though more than 128,000 doses were administered till Tuesday evening, according to the CoWIN dashboard, Delhi districts said that they had to close some of the centres due to rationing of doses.“There are intermittent shortages of vaccines as the supply is not regular. Districts are allocated doses only for two or three days at a time now, which is much lower than the demand. There is a sort of rationing; today we got some doses, tomorrow some other district will get it. This is the reason for the drop in vaccinations on some days,” said an official from South West district. “Today, our district received a fresh stock of doses so around 15,000 jabs were administered. Yesterday, we had managed only 4,000,” the official added.Another senior district official said the problem is likely to continue this month. “Today, we had to shut some of the vaccination centres. There have been days when we could run only a couple of centres because of the shortage of doses. And, this is likely to continue for the month because Delhi’s allocation for the month is low. Hopefully, with production being ramped up, more doses will be available from the next month,” the official said.No relaxation on CovaxinMeanwhile, a month after the Delhi government restricted use of its Covaxin stock only for those lining up for second doses, the authorities are yet to open Covaxin for first jabs. Officials said that it was unlikely to happen this month due to irregular supply.“There were talks of resuming Covaxin first dose, however, it is not being considered at the moment because there are still people who got the first jab in May and now need the second dose. In addition, the supply is not very stable. The government might open it up next month after those eligible for second dose have received it,” said another district official.Currently, only 20% of the Covaxin doses are being used as first dose, mainly for those older than 45. The proportion of Covaxin doses administered in Delhi fell from 30% at the beginning of June to 24% as on Tuesday evening, according to CoWIN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-vaccines-in-short-supply-delhi-govt-says-may-have-to-shut-more-jab-sites-101626200575399.html
14-07-2021||Delhi||Soon, Metro feeder e-buses with auto ticketing system||After a wait of nearly seven years since the last batch of feeder buses were inducted into the service, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) last week received 25 fully electric feeder buses with an inbuilt automatic fare collection system -- the first in the country.DMRC plans to induct a total of 100 such low-floor, air-conditioned e-buses out of which the first batch of 25 buses have undergone the necessary fitness tests conducted by the state transport department and are likely to be launched next month. The remaining 75 buses will be inducted gradually in a phased manner within this year, a DMRC spokesperson said. DMRC inducted the last set of feeder buses in 2014-15.“These buses can also operate without a conductor. They have machines where one will have to just tap the Metro smart card and the fare will be deducted automatically, and a receipt will be generated. Passengers will have to swipe the card twice -- during entry and exit -- to calculate the fare and automatically deduct the fare,” said transport minister Kailash Gahlot.DMRC currently has 174 CNG feeder buses, operated by private concessionaires, on around 20 routes to provide last-mile connectivity. With the induction of 100 new buses, DMRC will have 274 feeder buses plying on around 30 routes.DMRC executive director Anuj Dayal said the new buses have a seating capacity of 24. “They will operate on 10 routes covering 14 metro stations... The buses follow all urban bus specifications and are also equipped with GPS, CCTV cameras, panic buttons and so on. There will also be a digital passenger information system,” he said.However, a senior Metro official, on condition of anonymity, expressed apprehension over the sustainability of the system.“It remains to be seen if people cooperate, honestly swipe their cards... trials are on,” said the Metro official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/soon-conductor-less-feeder-e-buses-along-metro-routes-101626200214520.html
14-07-2021||Delhi||Buildings near Metro station to get less parking space||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Tuesday approved dynamic parking norms for the national capital in a bid to address the issue of traffic congestion by limiting parking space, and encouraging people to use public transport.Under the new norms, all new buildings (except residential), coming up near Metro stations and multilevel car parking lots will have 10%-30% less parking space than what is allowed under the current policy.The new regulations were placed in the public domain for scrutiny and feedback in March. They will now be sent to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for notification, said a senior DDA official.The Supreme Court termed parking as one of the “most serious problems” while hearing a case in September 2019.“Currently, parking norms are based on the designated use of the premises. It has been observed that the surplus parking from buildings spills over to roads and results in congestion in public spaces. The new parking norms have been worked out based on the availability of the Metro network, other modes of public transport (including cab aggregators) and multi-level car parking facilities,” the official cited above said, requesting anonymity.According to the new rules, for any non-residential property located within 500 metres of a Metro station, there will be a 30% deduction in the permissible parking space. For properties located 500-800 metres from a Metro station, there will be a 15% reduction. For buildings coming up within one kilometre radius of a multilevel parking lot, there will be 10% deduction. The new deductions will also apply commercial centres and markets such as Connaught Place.The rules for plotted residential areas remain unchanged, but those for group housing societies have been altered. A second DDA official said the new policy will be applicable on ongoing projects, especially those in various stages of approval. However, deductions for Metro and multilevel parking lots will not apply to residential buildings or areas.“For residential areas, DDA has proposed to take the number of dwelling units as the baseline instead of the built-up area,” the second DDA official said.Currently, the scale used to calculate parking space for group housing is two equivalent car spaces (ECS) per 100sqm of built-up area. It will now be changed to one ECS per dwelling unit for societies where each house/flat has an area between 40sqm and 100sqm. “But in case of government housing, the norms of General Pool Residential Accommodation colonies will be adopted,” the second DDA official said.Transport expert Amit Bhatt, director transport at World Resources Institute (WRI) India, welcomed the new regulations. “It will encourage people to use public transport. A lot of cities world over are moving towards capping the maximum parking space. This should be done in Delhi too,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-buildings-near-metro-stations-multilevel-lots-will-have-reduced-parking-space-101626200155139.html
14-07-2021||Delhi||DDA nod to cheap rental homes in city||To provide affordable housing, particularly to migrant workers and the urban poor, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Tuesday approved a proposal for the construction of affordable rental housing complexes (ARHCs) in the Capital. DDA officials said the scheme, which is modelled on the Centre’s ARHC guidelines, will be included in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021, and a proposal will be sent to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for notification.“The proposed ARHCs will ensure affordable and easily accessible rental housing in the vicinity to urban poor or migrant workers near their workplaces in Delhi. While the provision for ARHCs has been made in MPD-2041, we have decided to include this in the current master plan as well so that it can be implemented at the earliest,” said a senior DDA official. Under the plan, ARHCs will have a mix of dwelling units -- single and double bedroom -- and four-six bed dormitories, with common facilities. They can be developed on private or government land, or plots auctioned by DDA.Meanwhile, experts expressed apprehension over the sustainability of the model. “It is a good concept, but it is unlikely that many developers will invest because there is a huge gap between the rental yields versus the investment in developing these complexes. The project has to be financially viable... For this, there is a need to incentivise these projects,” said Mudassir Zaidi, executive director, Knight Frank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dda-approves-affordable-rental-housing-scheme-to-be-included-in-mpd2021-101626200154483.html

14-07-2021||Other||PM to gift projects worth ₹1,583 cr to Varanasi||VARANASI Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate and lay the foundation of 134 development projects worth around ₹1,583 crore during his visit to Varanasi on July 15. Kashi region BJP president Mahesh Chandra Srivastava said the PM will inaugurate 68 development projects worth ₹744 crore and lay the foundation of over 65 projects worth ₹839 crore, besides addressing a public meeting at IIT-BHU ground during his visit to the temple city. These projects include the inauguration of Varanasi International Cooperation and Convention Centre (VICCC) ‘Rudraksha’, Mother and Child Heath Wing of the SSL Hospital (BHU), Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, operation of cruise boat from Rajghat to Assi Ghat, operation of RORO vessels in Ganga, installation of signages at all 84 ghats and others. Srivastava said the Prime Minister will launch the developmental projects during a programme at the IIT-BHU ground. After that, he will address people present in the programme. Thereafter, the PM will visit the VICCC and inaugurate it. Ambassador of Japan to India, Suzuki Satoshi, his wife Chikaga Suzuki, counsellor Kiyose Kazuhiro, secretary Oda Akari and a three-member-team of Japan International Cooperation Agency, led by its chief representative Matsumoto Katsuo will attend the inaugural ceremony of the VICCC. Special arrangements have been made to give a welcome to Suzuki Satoshi, added Srivastava. The PM will interact with around 300 prominent people of Kashi in the auditorium of VICCC. In December 2015, the then Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had visited Varanasi, along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Abe had gifted the VICCC project to the city. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) had funded the construction of the VICCC, which cost around ₹186 crore. Japanese company Fujita Corporation, which was given the contract to construct the centre, built it and handed it over it to the Varanasi Smart City recently for its management and operation. After inaugurating the VICCC, the PM will go back to the BHU, where he will interact with a team of 25 doctors regarding preparations to deal with the possible third wave of Covid, added Srivastava. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday instructed officials to make foolproof arrangements for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Varanasi on July 15. Reviewing the preparations, he inspected the IIT-BHU ground, VICCC ‘Rudraksh’ and later held a meeting with the officials in the Circuit House auditorium. “There must be impregnable security arrangements during the PM’s visit,” the CM told police officials. Yogi said police personnel in plain clothes should also be deployed and the required investigations at all the venues should be done in advance. He also instructed civic officials to run a special sanitization campaign in the entire city. “Make such arrangements that there is no water-logging at the meeting place in case of rain. Plastic ban should be enforced strictly. Proper arrangements of drinking water should also be in place,” said the CM. “Everyone coming to the meeting of PM should undergo thermal scanning and wear a mask,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pm-to-gift-projects-worth-rs-1-582-cr-to-varanasi-101626193074009.html
14-07-2021||Pune||Central team to check rising Covid cases in Maharashtra||On Monday, the central government deployed a multidisciplinary team of experts to keep a check on the state’s rising cases, especially the districts which continue to report a higher positivity rate. While central teams were sent earlier when the state saw its peak of the first and second Covid-19 waves, this is the first time the team is coming when the second wave is receding but districts like Kolhapur, Ratnagiri, Sangli and Satara where the RT-PCR positivity rate is still higher than 10%.The central government in its letter to the state has stated that four experts, Kunal Kumar, Nodal Covid officer for the state of Maharashtra and joint secretary, ministry of housing and urban affairs; Dr Ajit Shewale, deputy director, National Center for Disease Control, Delhi; Dr Pranil Kamble, deputy director, Regional Office of Health and Family Welfare, Pune and Dr Satyajeet Sahoo, assistant professor department of pulmonary medicine, AIIMS (Nagpur).The four experts had been deployed to guide the state health machinery to specifically look into testing, contact tracing, including surveillance, containment operations, Covid appropriate behaviour, availability of hospital beds, sufficient logistics, including ambulance, hospital-wise case fatality rate and Covid vaccination progress. The team will assess the situation, suggest remedial actions, and report everything to the Centre and state every day starting from Tuesday.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, confirmed about the team’s deployment and said, “This is not the first time the central team has been deployed.

14-07-2021||Pune||Compulsory two vax dose rule leaves Pune players miss regular training||Pune: The mandatory two doses of vaccine and restriction of training timing till 4pm for indoor sports have made things difficult for sports academies in Pune. With players missing practice for the past 15 months, the latest Covid restrictions are keeping them away from court. The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) order restricting indoor and outdoor sports till 4pm on all days is a move to break the chain of Covid infections. Players, coaches and support staff involved in indoor sports training need to take two doses of vaccination before getting permission to play. “Two doses are compulsory,” said Rubal Agarwal, PMC assistant commissioner. Many upcoming players who are not seasoned campaigners are missing training as they await for the vaccine dose. Professional players are undergoing practice as they have completed both the doses. “Whatever steps the government has taken, it is looking at the safety precautions and they are right on their path. But if you look at the technicality and if someone has taken a dose of Covishield and s/he cannot take the next dose till (28 days but before 84 days) then one should be allowed to practice. I pointed it to the state sports government officials and they have allowed the training,” said Nikhil Kanetkar, director, Nikhil Kanetkar Badminton Academy (NKBA) at the Shiv Chhatrapati sports complex in Balewadi. NKBA is maintaining vaccination details of all players who are coming for training. The academy is making sure that those who are due for second dose get it done at earliest. “One must understand that training and competition are two different things. And training is a continuous process and indoor sports also need regular training so we cannot hold it for long,” he said. Ranjeet Natu, Poona District Metropolitan Badminton Association (PDMBA), honorary secretary, said, “We were expecting a few more relaxations for players. Currently those who have taken two doses are only practicing at the courts. We will be writing to PMC to arrange a vaccination camp at PDMBA so we can provide doses to those who have yet not got it.” Chess coach Pavan Rathi said, “Chess is still not allowed to be played offline. Players are learning chess online, but permission for offline practice must be given now.” Extend play time till 7pm Pune Municipal Corporation has allowed sports training till 4pm which is making things difficult for sports academies as they cannot accommodate more players in limited timing and with online school going on till 3pm, many players are unable to continue with practice routine. “When we are targeting players for the 2024, 2028, 2032 Olympics then we cannot keep players under-18 without practice. Once timing is increased clubs can accommodate more players. Players (under-18) missing one more year of training will be a huge loss for the future,” said Kanetkar. “Due to the start and stop of academies, many new players are not joining sports. Timing is also one big factor as most of the clubs runs batches after 4pm and which is unavailable right now. Extension of timing will help players and academies,” said Neeraj Honap, table tennis coach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/compulsory-two-vax-dose-rule-leaves-pune-players-miss-regular-training-101626190313839.html
14-07-2021||Pune||Five development plans to cover Pune city||PUNE: Pune could be the first city in Maharashtra to have five development plans (DP) for different areas. Experts fear that different rules for different areas may lead to confusion and haphazard urban growth. With the latest state government notification expanding the city limits, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is preparing a development plan for the newly merged 23 villages and the count of DP covering the city has touched five. Pune city has DP for old city limits, 23 villages which have bio diversity park (BDP) provision, Yeolewadi, 11 villages merged in 2017 and the latest for newly added 23 villages. A development plan is a long-term planning document that gives a conceptual layout for proposed future growth and development. It covers buildings, social settings and surrounding environments. The plan includes analysis, recommendations, and proposals for a site’s population, economy, housing, transportation, community facilities, and land use. The plan could be renewed every 20 years. Three DPs are already in place — for old city limits, 23 villages and Yeolewadi. The DP for 11 villages is in the pipeline and the municipal corporation has called a general body meeting on July 15 to start the process for newly merged 23 villages. Town planner Ramchandra Gohad said, “The government and municipal corporation’s policy for merging and demerging villages is responsible for this situation. In 2070, we suggested planning for fringe areas that were not part of the municipal corporation. Later, in the nineties, we suggested to merge 53 villages in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations with 38 villages in PMC and 15 in PCMC. Again, it was not accepted. The delay led to haphazard development in these fringe areas and now these villages have become part of the municipal corporation.” Gohad said, “At least now steps should be taken to carry out integrated planning for the whole area. The PMC area has become vast and there are challenges for providing municipal services like water, garbage management.” Urban planner Anita Benninger said, “Along with the various development plans, there are some other agencies like Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Collector, Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) involved in the planning. They had given some permission. We need to review the limits and their jurisdiction for doing an integrated planning.” Oppn decry BJP’s call for GB meet The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to call a general body (GB) meeting on July 15 to chalk out DP process for the newly merged 23 villages. Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) that covered these villages has prepared a DP for these areas. Recently, municipal commissioner announced that to save time, PMC will adopt the DP from PMRDA and invite suggestions and objections. However, the BJP opposed the move stating that as these villages became a part of the municipal corporation, PMC has the right to prepare DP. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol and leader of House Ganesh Bidkar took this stand. Criticising the BJP’s stand, NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “PMC has been preparing a DP for 11 villages for the last three years. PMRDA had prepared the DP when it was ruled by the BJP and now they question that same DP.” Congress leader Aba Bagul blamed the BJP for calling a general body meeting without discussing it with the opposition parties. “PMC can adopt the DP from PMRDA and carry the future process,” Bagul said. Five DP DP for old city limits DP for merged 23 villages which have BDP provision DP for Yeolewadi DP for merged 11 villages which got merged in 2017 DP for merged 23 villages which got merged in June 2021||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/five-development-plans-to-cover-pune-city-101626189233894.html
