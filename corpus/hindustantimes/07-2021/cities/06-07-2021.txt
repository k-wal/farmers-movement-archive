While shop owners will ensure Covid-19 regulations in the premises of the enterprises, the joint action committees will be helpful in following regulations outside the shop premises. We will write to the police, MCDs, the L-G and the revenue department in this regard,” said Brijesh Goyal, president of the chamber of trade and industry (CTI) – a Delhi-based traders’ body which organised the online meeting of market associations.In the last seven days, the district administrations have ordered temporary suspension of markets in areas including Laxmi Nagar, a section in Gandhi Nagar, a pocket in Sadar Bazar, Nangloi, Punjabi Basti and the central market in Lajpat Nagar, for alleged violation of Covid-19 regulations such as social distancing and mask compliance.Vinay Narang, a trader leader from Kashmere Gate market, said: “A joint action committee comprising market association representatives, police, municipal officials, civil defence volunteers and enforcement officials is necessary at this stage. We have collectively decided to write to the concerned agencies at the earliest regarding this.”Nitin Gupta, president of Kamla Nagar market traders’ association, who also took part in Tuesday’s meeting, said, “It is time the authorities crack down on illegal encroachments instead of cracking down on market associations. If shop owners are found flouting rules, action should be taken against the particular shop, instead of closing an entire market.”Atul Bhargava, president of the Connaught Place market association, said, “Unauthorised street vendors and hawkers are increasing the size of the crowd in the markets. That is not in the hands of the power market associations to control.”However, representatives of street vendor associations countered this viewpoint. Arbind Singh, national coordinator of the National Association of Street Vendors of India, said, “Accountability in this case should be evidence-based and not prejudiced. Street vendors are often poor and end up being blamed for most problems. Secondly, they operate in the open, which is less risky in terms of Covid-19 transmission than closed spaces from which permanent shops operate. When there is a protocol for penalising for violation of Covid-19 regulations, there is no room for such blame games.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-market-associations-push-for-joint-teams-to-ensure-adherence-to-covid-norms-101625596156786.html

DPCC officials confirmed on Tuesday that a joint team comprising members from DPCC, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) conducted inspections in Kondli and Gharoli villages, and in Gharoli dairy farms between June 4 and June 7, to find 66 dairies violating the Water Act and ignoring the “guidelines for environmental management of dairy farms and gaushalas’’ issued by the CPCB.These dairies have also been slapped with an environment compensation fee of ₹1 lakh each for operating without consent and discharging wastewater and cow dung into drains in the area. “The dairies have been issued closure notice and directed to deposit environmental compensation of ₹1 lakh within 15 days, failing which necessary action will be initiated against them as per law,” the DPCC said in a statement on Tuesday.Meanwhile, in a separate raid, DPCC also sealed six jeans washing and dyeing units in Kavi Nagar, near Khyala industrial area, for allegedly releasing chemicals into the water. Officials said that the DPCC, along with teams from the Delhi government’s revenue department and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), had conducted elaborate raids and shutdown at least 40 such units operating in the area in December last year. However, since the city reopened after the second phase of lockdown, the pollution monitoring department received a complaint that these units have restarted operations. “The raid was conducted based on a complaint that we received. The electricity connection was disconnected and the meter was confiscated. DPCC shall also impose environmental damage compensation on these violating units. The drive will continue for the coming days to ensure that all water-polluting units are removed from this area,” DPCC said in a statement on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/66-dairies-six-dyeing-units-shut-down-in-east-delhi-101625596156203.html

According to the revised excise policy that the Delhi government has put in the public domain recently, microbreweries has been incentivised with the restaurants installing them to be allowed to supply draught beer to bars and also provide takeaway services.Gurugram already has several microbreweries. A microbrewery is a small unit that produces limited quantities of beer for captive consumption. Rajinder Rawat, general manager of the Yellow Chilli restaurant, where the microbrewery was set up, said they applied for a licence in September 2019. “In 2020, due to coronavirus pandemic the application process was delayed. We received the final approval in March 31, 2021. We set up the microbrewery at the ground floor of the restaurant and now the freshly brewed beer is supplied through a pipe to the first floor dining hall,” Rawat said. Himanshu Bhakuni, bar manager, said the restaurant attracts customers from Noida as well as from Indirapuram and Vaishali in Ghaziabad. RB Singh, district excise officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “We have also received applications from two restaurants in Garden Galleria mall. The licences will be issued on completion of all formalities of the procedure,” he said. The annual licence fee for setting up a microbrewery in Noida has been fixed at ₹2.5 lakh. Gautam Budh Nagar records a monthly consumption of 15 lakh bottles of beer and 7 lakh litres of foreign liquor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-gets-its-first-microbrewery-two-years-after-state-nod-101625596095615.html

The Aadhaar card, a copy of which is with HT, was prepared on a Neb Sarai address. Bobby, and Ganesh Kumar, the property dealer who got the deal fixed, said they have submitted the copy of Khalid’s Aadhaar card to the Neb Sarai police. They have told the police that Khalid introduced himself to them as an Indian citizen, who is involved in the supply and sale of dates. The rent agreement was prepared last month and the four arrested men began staying in the farmhouse around June 26-27, the investigators said.“We are carrying out another operation to nab more drug dealers associated with the syndicate. As far as investigation regarding the Aadhar card and other documentation regarding the rented farmhouse is concerned, we will investigate everything once we complete our operation,” said Tushar Gupta, ASP Garhshankar police (in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur), who led the raiding party during the crackdown on the farmhouse.On Sunday, around 5pm, a Punjab Police team raided the farmhouse number 227, in Sainik Farms and arrested four Afghans for running a heroin-manufacturing unit there. A total of 17 kilogram heroin, assorted chemicals, acids and lab equipments were seized from the farmhouse.The raiding team caught Khalid when he reached the farmhouse to meet his alleged accomplices. The raiding team took Khalid with them for questioning, as the farmhouse was taken on rent in his name. He is yet to be arrested, said a Punjab Police officer, who asked not to be named. “Khalid came to me with the reference of a property dealer in Malviya Nagar, who helped him purchase a flat in Neb Sarai. The Aadhaar card that Khalid gave us for preparing the rent agreement of the farmhouse has the address of the same flat. Khalid told me that he sold that property and wanted to move into a farmhouse with his wife, whom he introduced as an Indian citizen,” said Ganesh. According to Ganesh, the farmhouse leased on a monthly rent of ₹1.6 lakh and Khalid paid ₹4.80 lakh as advance rent and two months of security money. “As a property dealer, I followed all the procedures while renting out the property. Apart from the rent agreement, I also applied online for the tenant’s verification,” he said.Additional deputy commissioner of police (south), Delhi Police, Mandava Harsh Vardhan said a case under Indian Penal Code’s section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) has been registered at the Neb Sarai police station against the farmhouse owner for not getting the tenant verified from the police. Asked if Khalid could have prepared a fake Aadhaar card for obtaining the farmhouse on rent, the additional DCP said, “We will look into all the aspects pertaining to the case that we have registered.”Another police officer, requesting to remain anonymous, said holding an Aadhaar card means that the card holder is residing in India. But, according to the Aadhaar Act, 2016, even a foreigner who has stayed in India for more than 182 days is eligible to apply for an Aadhaar card.“Khalid has told the police that he was staying in India as an Afghan refugee for the past six years. This information has to be verified, before we find out how he got an Aadhaar card,” the officer added.About the case and the charges against him, Bobby said he did not violate any law because the tenants never told him that they were foreigners. “I would have never rented out my property or had alerted the concerned agencies, if I knew that the tenants were foreigners. Being a responsible citizen, I will cooperate with the police in their investigation,” said Bobby.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmhouse-drug-bust-afghan-man-gave-aadhaar-card-for-registering-rent-agreement-101625596096258.html

They are talking about stopping the demolition of a building. Bajpai is asking the MCD engineer to stop his JE (junior engineer) from demolishing a particular building. When the engineer replies that the demolition took place on the complaint of the mayor, the MLA, exposing the Delhi BJP, pointed out that he has not demolished other illegal and unauthorised constructions under the mayor’s protection. This way, the BJP MLA has confessed about rampant corruption in MCD. He said the BJP-ruled MCD doesn’t demolish the buildings where it gets bribe. Dozens of such buildings were left untouched,” Bhardwaj said.Meanwhile, Bajpai said he was just trying to help a poor family which was about to lose their home: “I did or said nothing wrong. If houses are being demolished, then every such unauthorised construction should also be demolished. Why selectively target the poor?”EDMC mayor Shyam Sundar Agrawal too denied the allegations as “baseless”. “If this is the case I would request the AAP to show where it has happened and we will surely take action if anyone is found guilty. There are many wards under AAP councillors where people neither pay the taxes nor get their house maps approved. There are many 25-30-metre houses for which we have never received the drawings from owners to be approved by the civic body. I have even sent a suggestion for the new Master Plan in the making to make a provision for all houses to be built as per approved design,” said Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-alleges-corruption-by-mcds-in-building-construction-101625596036263.html

Farmers can ready their documents and settle the issues,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority.Abadi lands are habitation areas in villages. But what is termed habitation area by farmers is referred to as encroachment by the authority that wants to acquire it for development.As per the Abadi guidelines brought out by the government, if the habitation has been around before 2011, then the authority will not acquire it and leave it for farmers’ use.Officials hope to complete the formalities by July 17.On Tuesday a team from the authority conducted surveys in Jhatta, Raipur Khadar and Bahlolpur villages.So far 18 farmers of 18 villages including Nagli Wazidpur, Raipur, Agahpur, Kakrala, Hazipur, Harola and Chhaproli among others have filed applications to settle issues.“Other village farmers can file applications to settle issues. They should submit an application, affidavit and other land details to process their applications,” said Maheshwari.Farmers said that the survey should be conducted properly.“The authority should conduct survey in a manner so that farmers get justice and the applications should be solved without further delay,” said Subash Singh a Nagli farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-takes-first-step-to-resolving-abadi-issue-101625596035622.html

Close to 800 metres of the 107km-long Delhi-SNB Urban complex (Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror) Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor, which is part of the Delhi-Alwar RRTS line, will pass through the Delhi Zoological Park at a depth of 80 feet, as per the alignment proposed in the detailed project report. The alignment is yet to be approved by the central government. The NCRTC has asked experts from the Central Road Research Institute (CSIR-CRRI) to do an assessment to gauge the impact of the vibration caused by the trains running underground as well as the construction work.“The stretch below the Delhi zoo will be constructed at a depth of around 80 feet. CRRI will carry out the vibration study in zoo premises after minimisation of Covid impact to establish the current baseline data for vibrations,” a spokesperson for NCRTC said The Delhi-SNB corridor, along with the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut line will provide seamless connectivity in the national capital region by linking cities in the Capital’s east -- Ghazibad and Meerut, to those in south -- Gurugram and Alwar. In Delhi, both corridors will originate from Sarai Kale Khan in south east Delhi. These corridors will also connect all these cities to All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Safdarjung, one of country’s biggest hospitals. Of the total 107 kilometres, 83kms of the Delhi-SNB corridor will be constructed in Haryana, 22 kms in Delhi and 2 kms in Rajasthan. While the corridor in Haryana and Rajasthan will be mostly elevated, it will be completely underground in Delhi. Except for Sarai Kale Khan station, the remaining three stations at INA, Munirka and Aerocity will be underground. Nasim Akhtar, senior principal scientist at transportation planning and environment division, CSIR-CRRI, said, “We will study the current ambient vibration levels in the zoo, both during day and night, and will ensure that they do not exceed the present levels during the construction and operation of the RRTS line.”Akhtar said the first part of the study was done last year before the lockdown to record the day time ambient vibration levels. But the study had to be stopped after a lockdown was imposed again in April this year in view of an unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases. Even though a gradual unlock process has begun, the government is yet to reopen the zoological park.  “The day time ambient vibration levels in the zoo is around 75-76 VdB. The vibrations are caused by a railway track nearby, and the movement of vehicles inside the premises. But we couldn’t do the study at night due to the lockdown. We will do the remaining part of the study once the zoo reopens,” he said.When contacted, a senior Delhi zoo official said, “The matter was discussed last year. As of now, no permission has been given to carry out the study, as the zoo is closed due to the pandemic.”Stressing on the need for night time study, Akhtar said, “The train operations will continue till late at night. The ambient vibration levels at night are much less than day time; we don’t want animals and birds’ sleep patterns to get disturbed because of train movement. Our recommendation regarding vibration control to NCRTC will be based on the vibration levels at night time.”The NCRTC spokesperson said that it will be ensured that there is minimal impact of the train movement on the ground level. “The proposed tunnel is very deep in this zone and NCRTC is going to use special track structure to mitigate vibration,” he said.Akhtar said there are a several technologies which can be incorporated during construction to minimise vibration. “According to the soil report from the area, there is sand filling till 17-20 metres depth. This is a good thing, as the vibration will get absorbed. If the night time level is less than 70 VdB, then we might recommend NCRTC to use technology such as a floating chamber to kill vibration at source.”Anish Andheria, CEO of Wildlife Conservation Trust, said animals are far more sensitive to vibrations than humans, and if an alternate alignment of the corridor is possible, then it should be considered. He said if the current alignment is allowed, it should be ensured that there is minimal disturbance to the animals, especially during construction. “The executing agency should put in the public domain the technology they plan to use to minimise vibration impact from the perspective of animals. They should also look at similar projects carried out in other parts of the world to ensure that the most effective technology is deployed,” Andheria said.While the Centre’s approval is awaited, NCRTC has started pre-construction work. “We are working on preparing the detailed designing of structures, geo-technical investigation work, initial pile load test, topographic survey work, shifting of utilities such as electric high-tension lines, water and sewer pipelines etc,” the NCRTC spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ncrtc-ropes-in-experts-to-study-impact-of-underground-rail-corridor-on-delhi-zoo-101625595975605.html
06-07-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Master Plan-2031 promises more residential land||In the upcoming Master Plan-2031 for Ghaziabad, around 95 hectares more will be made available for residential purposes as the city population is expected to grow by at least 1 million in the next 10 years, said officials.The new residential areas will be carved out of agricultural land and so too will be land for industrial and commercial purposes.According to the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA), the plan is in its advances stage of preparation and will soon be sent to the state government for approvals. Master Plan-2021 will lapse next year.The projections in the new Master Plan are that about 10-15 hectares each of residential land will be made available in the area plans for Modinagar, Muradnagar and Loni, while about 50 hectares will be made available for Ghaziabad city. “In all, we will have about 90-95 hectares of residential land available for group housing or plotted development and most of this land will be converted from agriculture land use. Ancillary activities like commercial and industrial will also be earmarked from the agriculture land use. The MP-2031 is more or less ready and will be implemented from 2022 to 2031. We expect a growth of about 1 million more people in the next 10 years,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, chief architect and town planner of GDA. Ghaziabad’s population currently is around 4.5 million. A master plan is a broad layout of a city and clearly lays out different areas as per their land use like residential, commercial and industrial among others. The new plan takes advantage of the geographic information system framework to analyse spatial location and all details will be made available online.As per officials, about 42% of total land use in a master plan for the city will have to be marked for residential use, while 5% would be for commercial land use and 7-8% is earmarked for industrial land use. “The housing development will either be taken up by GDA or by private sector. Once the land use is defined, it will also be accompanied by infrastructure development like roads, highways, etc.,” Shivpuri added. The officials expect that with projects like the regional rapid transit system (RRTS), Delhi-Meerut Expressway, Eastern Peripheral Expressway and Delhi-Dehradun highway, the city will attract more homebuyers. Developers said that new areas have huge potential for housing development as places like Indirapuram and Vaishali are almost saturated. “Areas like Muradnagar and Modinagar did not see much development due to connectivity and infrastructure issues. However, with the new projects coming up, this may be solved to a great extent. If the government can provide us with basic infrastructure like connecting roads, sewer network, electricity infrastructure, etc, developers will be more than willing to take up planned housing development in new areas,” said Gaurav Gupta, president of CREDAI – Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-master-plan-2031-promises-more-residential-land-101625595915652.html
06-07-2021||Noida||GB Nagar residents fret over ‘complex’ process for vaccination of those undertaking foreign travel||Several Gautam Budh Nagar residents have described the process to get the second Covishield dose on priority for those undertaking foreign travel as “highly complicated” with multiple trips to the chief medical officer’s (CMO) office in Sector 39 both before and after the vaccination administered at the Sector 30 District Hospital.Last month, the central government had allowed those travelling to other countries - Olympic athletes and those going for study or for jobs- to get their second Covishield dose after just four weeks of the first dose, same as that for Covaxin, instead of the regular 12-to-16 week gap. Gautam Budh Nagar started this facility on June 16.“First, an application has to be submitted to the CMO office (Room no 1, Block no 2) along with a copy of the passport, copy of first dose vaccination certificate and a proof of travel with reason. The above documents can be collected with authorisation letter for the vaccine on the next working day and get the vaccination at the Sector 30 District Hospital at 2 pm. After the vaccination, they need to come back to the CMO office with all documents for certificate attestation,” said CMO Dr Deepak Ohri.Although it may seem that the process will get over in two days, practically it is longer, said several people.“When we went to the CMO office the day after submitting the documents, we were told to come the next day again. On the third day, we finally got the approved documents and proceeded to the District Hospital. There we were told to get a photocopy of all the documents. We had to go outside the hospital to get the copies and then get the vaccine,” said Sector 50 resident Rahul Dwivedi whose daughter had to leave for the USA to resume college. “Then we had to wait for around two hours to get the vaccine and then go to the CMO office again. This to and fro is a hassle.”Sector 45 resident Mandhata Singh’s daughter too had to leave for the USA for her education and they too had a similar experience.“The whole process should be at one stop centre so that residents do not have to run from one place to another. If the document approval and vaccine administration process is all done at one place, it will be convenient for the beneficiaries,” said Singh.Rajiva Singh, president of the Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations suggested that the district follow the Delhi model. “In Delhi, there is a separate vaccination centre where the documents are checked and vaccines administered,” said Singh. The two centres in Delhi are the Navyug School in Mandir Marg and the Kautilya Government Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya at Chirag Enclave.According to CMO Dr Ohri, so far around 250 people have been vaccinated on priority this way.“In one day only around 25 beneficiaries undertaking foreign travel are being given second dose of vaccine and creating a special centre for them is not feasible. Moreover, no such issue has been formally raised to the department so far,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-residents-fret-over-complex-process-for-vaccination-of-those-undertaking-foreign-travel-101625595855621.html

Under this initiative, the façade and outer walls of buildings will be remodelled on the pattern of temples. This remodelling will give tourists a feeling of arriving in an ancient city. Locations around prominent temples in Ayodhya have been selected for this make-over. According to ADA officials, this concept is part of the vision document prepared by the international consultant LEA Associates, South Asia Private Limited, hired by the state government. The ADA is also assisting the consultant. Larsen and Toubro and Kukreja Architects are assisting the international consultant in executing the project.The development authority has carried out survey of Dharmhari, Swargdwar, Ramkot, Hanuman Garhi, Kanak Bhawan and other locations for this project. “Possibilities are being explored to remodel these areas giving them a spiritual look,” said Ved Prakash Gupta, Ayodhya’s BJP MLA. The focus will not remain only on areas adjoining Ram Janmabhoomi and the road leading to the Ram Mandir but also on other historic locations. For this project, the ADA also needs support of saints of Ayodhya and locals, as the remodelling will require some demolition. The Ayodhya administration will also carry out documentation of prominent temples of Ayodhya so that their details may be shared with devotees. While reviewing Ayodhya’s vision document on June 26 in a virtual meeting with CM Yogi Adityanath, PM Narendra Modi had stated that Ayodhya was being envisaged as a spiritual centre, global tourism hub and a sustainable smart city.

Diesel in Pune crossed the ₹95 per litre mark on Sunday. According to traders’ associations, the fuel price rise along with factors like lockdown restrictions is creating an increased demand for vegetables, resulting in a supply shortage. The price of edible oil too has increased by between ₹30-40 per litre.Tomatoes are currently selling at ₹60 per kg, drumsticks at ₹40 per kg, green peas at ₹70, brinjal at ₹25 and potato at ₹20, all per kg. Vilas Bhujal, president of the Pune Commission Agents Association, said, “The fuel price increase has led to the increase in wholesale prices of many vegetables. Potatoes, which cost Rs10 per kg in wholesale a week ago, are now being sold at ₹20 and even higher. The price of onions has increased from ₹20, to ₹30 per kg, in the wholesale market. Transportation costs are rising due to the high diesel prices. Similarly, rains have also slowed down supply last month. With the state government imposing fresh restrictions , there has been a spurt in vegetable demand leading to shortage of vegetable supply during last few days. It is the citizens who will have to bear the brunt of the price rise.” Vegetable trader Sandeep Darekar said, “Most of the vegetable crop was destroyed due to the pre-monsson rains and there has been shortage of vegetable supply in the market. The lockdown restrictions have also increased our difficulties leading to price rises.”Pune gets vegetables come from districts like Satara, Sangli, Ahmednagar and Solapur. Supplies also come from Himalchal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.Baba Shinde, president of the Maharashtra State Vahan Chalak Malak Pratinidhi Sabha, said, “The price rise was a foregone conclusion doe the increase in fuel cost. There has been an increase in the prices of all commodities including vegetables.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vegetable-prices-in-city-have-up-by-30-as-transporters-blame-rising-fuel-costs-101625595136380.html

The data also showed that senior citizens, aged above 60 years, were the first from the general population to become eligible for Covid-19 vaccination, and close to 50% of this vulnerable population has got the jab.Of the district’s entire population of 11,748,636, 74.4% or 8,742,160 are eligible to get the jab. Of these 198,295 are registered health care workers and 269,811 are registered front-line workers. In addition to this, from the general population, 5,217,569 are from the age group 18-45, of which 34,906 have got the second shot, 2,362,651 are from the 45-60-year age group which forms 20.11% of the district population, of which 333,370 have got both doses; and of the 1,161,940 people from the above 60 years of age, only 406,335 have got both doses. With more age groups and categories being declared as eligible for the vaccine, the gap between two doses has been increased from an initial four weeks to 12 week now. While shortage of vaccine supply has been one of the reasons to extend the gap between doses, less than 50% of the 60-plus age group which was first declared eligible among the general population has got both the doses. The vaccination drive for 18 plus was started since May 1 in the state, while for senior citizens the drive began from March 1. The pace of vaccination for the senior citizens which was high in the first few weeks became sluggish. Most senior citizens who got the first shot since March, became eligible for the second shot in May. In April the city saw its second deadly covid19 wave, more severe than the first wave, most beneficiaries did not step out while some of the elderly population who got infected after the first shot, or did not take the first shot in March, would now be eligible only after three months of recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/11-of-pune-district-s-eligible-adult-population-fully-vaccinated-101625595135633.html

While the hospital that was found to have overcharged a patient has been asked to refund over ₹3 lakh to the patient’s family, the other has been directed to take action against its paramedics for medical negligence, the committee president said. The committee was set up on May 21 this year after the Allahabad high court, on May 11, directed the Uttar Pradesh government to set up a three-member committee in each district to look into complaints regarding difficulties faced by the public in availing of Covid treatment at government and private hospitals.Civil judge Sushil Kumar, who was appointed the president of the committee in Guatam Budh Nagar, said the committee heard over 30 complaints over the past one month.“The maximum number of complaints -- 17 -- was regarding overcharging for HRCT scan ( a technique to get cross-sectional images of organs such as lungs) by various hospitals and labs in the district after the government capped its price at ₹2,500. Such cases were resolved immediately and the establishments concerned were ordered to refund the excess amount. Now, only seven complaints are pending which will be heard soon,” he said.He further said the committee has not received any new complaint in the past one week.Asked about the two hospitals against which action has been ordered, Kumar said the committee had received a complaint of overcharging against Yatharth Hospital in Greater Noida . “On June 28, a meeting of PPGC was convened to look into a complaint in which a man had alleged that Yatharth Hospital overcharged him for the Covid-19 treatment of his father who was admitted to the hospital on April 15 and discharged on May 7. The complainant’s father died three days later on May 10,” Kumar said.The hospital charged ₹8 lakh for the 22-day stay at the hospital, which was ₹3.39 lakh more as per the rates fixed by the state government, Kumar said. “The committee asked the hospital to refund the excess amount of ₹3.39 lakh to the complainant within 10 days. If the hospital fails to do so, action will be taken against it as per the rules of the Epidemic Act,” said Kumar.When asked, Dr Sunil Balyan, chief medical superintendent at Yatharth Hospital, said the hospital will comply with the orders issued by the committee.In another case heard by the committee, a complainant alleged that her husband died at Kailash Hospital in Sector 71 due to the medical negligence of its staff.“The complainant alleged that on the night of May 17, the paramedics removed her husband’s oxygen mask and told him ‘now you die’. The patient’s wife had complained regarding this to the hospital authorities, including the medical superintendent,” said Kumar.“The arguments of the hospital and the complainant were heard by the committee on June 28. We found that the two paramedics on duty on the night of May 17-18 led to the patient’s death and they were guilty of medical negligence,” said Kumar.Consequently, the committee ordered that the hospital management take action against the two paramedics within a weekand also inform the panel about the action taken by it.However, the authorities of Kailash Hospital said no such order has been sent to the hospital yet. “We did take part in the hearing, but we have not received any order as yet,” said Dr Rajesh Parasher, medical superintendent at Kailash Hospital, Sector 71.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/panel-probing-complaints-from-patients-orders-action-against-two-noida-hospitals-101625595076244.html

Over 4,200 slots are available for the second shot of Covaxin. For Covishield, there will be 750 slots for the second dose, including 50 for those travelling abroad. Also, at least 100 doses will be available for those living in slums, through mobile vaccination van, and 50 for the second dose at Huda City Centre Metro station,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. The second dose of Covishield will be administered at the government school in Fazilpur, a community health centre in Farrukhnagar, subdivisional hospitals of Sohna and Pataudi, Sector 31 polyclinic, Nathupur health centre and Civil Hospital in Sector 10.On Tuesday, at least 1,677 doses of the two vaccines were administered at the government health centres, of which 1,358 were second doses.

06-07-2021||Gurugram||Accident response team solves 10 hit-and-run cases in 10 days||A six-member accident response team (Art) of the Gurugram Police is revisiting black spots and hit-and-run cases to identify drivers who fled the spot after hitting motorists and pedestrians this year. The police said on Tuesday that the team has solved 10 blind cases in the last 10 days. The team, constituted on March 25 in Manesar, has been visiting accident spots and scanning footage from closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to check the cause of accidents. Officials said they decided to start with Manesar as the industrial area witnesses the highest heavy vehicle movement, as well as motorists and pedestrians. The exercise will start across the city by the year-end, the police said. Varun Singla, the deputy commissioner of police, Manesar, said that the officials were tasked with identifying the errant drivers in cases where there were no leads. “We have solved 65 cases out of 85 accidents cases, including 10 blind cases, in the last three months. The team visited the spot, scanned the area and questioned daily commuters. The task is challenging but once these cases are solved, it will reduce the number of accidents as taking action against drivers, who have a casual approach, will set an example,” he said. Officials said that the team would reach accident spots within minutes and cordon off the area to ensure there is no manipulation at the spot to mislead the investigators. The officers record eyewitness accounts in a document, which helps in nabbing the suspect. The police said that the aim of constituting such a team is to reduce fatalities on city roads, identify black spots and ways to make the commute safer at these spots.Commuters alleged that accidents take place repeatedly at black spots and despite regular monitoring, the police are unable to make the spot accident-free. “Drivers, especially of trucks, regularly using the stretch, take advantage of a lack of CCTV cameras and low police presence. They flee the spot after accidents. There have been repeated accidents by same persons but they do not face any action,” said Ram Niwas, an executive working with an automobile firm in Manesar, who met with an accident in February this year. He said his brother was severely injured on the expressway on June 25, after a speeding truck hit him from behind and fled the spot. The police said the mandate of Art is to undertake photography of the crime scene for better prosecution, tracing unknown cases and ensuring that the guilty parties are held responsible. The team will also help victims with first aid and take them to a hospital if an ambulance does not reach the spot quickly. They will ensure that the investigation officer files the requisite Form 54 of MACT [Motor Accident Claim Tribunal] to help victims’ families to claim insurance. Investigation strategyThe police said that between June 21 and June 30, 10 accidents took place in the Manesar area, majorly on the expressway. The injured were hospitalised and there were no clues leading to the suspects in any of the cases. The drivers had fled the crime scene and there were no eyewitnesses either, said officials. In one such incident, wherein a biker was severely injured after being hit from the rear, Singla said the team scanned CCTV footage of the area and recovered videos in which they spotted a logo of a bread manufacturer on the truck. However, they could not decipher the registration number or any other details.The team started deploying members on the route to intercept the truck and after 10 days, they managed to locate one, following which they were able to locate the company and subsequently, identify the person responsible for the incident.Singla said the team employed a similar strategy in other cases as well, and followed up with transport and automobile companies whose vehicles were spotted in the area around the time of accidents.Singla said, “Tampering of evidence is a common practice, so the crime spots need to be cordoned off till all pieces of evidence are collected. The team admits victims to nearby hospitals. They question eyewitnesses and people near the accident spot.” Pilot projectKK Rao, the commissioner of police for Gurugram, said that this was a pilot project to reduce the number of accidents in the area. “The Art collects crucial details of accidents, victims, suspects, vehicles used in the crime, times, and other factors to prepare a report for insurance claims. This pilot project has improved the quality of investigation and also help families of the victims to receive justice on time,” Rao said. The police use Google forms to fill in details, after which mapping of the area is done and measures are undertaken to ascertain the reasons for accidents and reduce the same.Sarika Panda Bhatt, a road safety expert, said the initiative by the police will help identify all blackspots and the reasons for the accidents. “This way, action will be taken against the people who are responsible for the accidents and will prevent mishaps. This can be a useful exercise if done regularly and across the city, instead of focussing on one area. There are various other spots where the roads are unsafe; there are engineering faults and concerns of speeding, but they are still out of the police radar,” she said, adding that despite several awareness drives and increased deployment, motorists are not following safe practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/accident-response-team-solves-10-hit-and-run-cases-in-10-days-101625593999248.html

With the India Meteorological Department (IMD) initially predicting the arrival of the monsoon around June 12, officials of GMDA and MCG were scrambling to procure resources, such as motor pumps and suction machines, which are needed to tackle waterlogging across the city. On Tuesday, the IMD issued a fresh update, stating that the monsoon is expected to hit the National Capital Region by July 10.The four additional weeks, officials said, have allowed them to complete de-silting and drain augmenting measures across the city, including undertaking key works of widening of Khandsa drain, cleaning of four creeks in the Aravallis and building a parallel open drain along the Sector 4/9A railway line.Badshahpur drainOfficials of the GMDA said widening of the Badshahpur drain is almost complete, which is crucial to prevent waterlogging on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway.On the Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch, adjacent to the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway, a 33-metre stretch of the Badshahpur drain in Khandsa village was the focal point of the 2016 “Gurujam” incident, when commuters were stuck on the road for almost two days.Along the 33-metre stretch, the width of the city’s main drain — which carries 60% of Gurugram’s rainwater — reduces to such an extent that during monsoon, rainwater overflows onto the main carriageway of the National Highway 48 (NH-48) and inundates all its service lanes.The carrying capacity of the Badshahpur drain reduces from 2,300 cusecs to 800 cusecs.In the first week of June, GMDA officials, under the Disaster Management Act of 2005, acquired the 33-metre stretch of disputed land to widen the drain.“Excavation and widening work on the drain has largely been completed due to the extra four-week time period. The setting up of a retaining wall to ensure rainwater does not overflow though will be taken up post monsoon. In addition, eight motor pumps have been installed by GMDA and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to keep waterlogging in check,” said Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA.Golf Course RoadOfficials of the GMDA said that the delay in monsoon has allowed them to complete preparatory measures, slotted for this monsoon, with regard to four creeks in the Aravallis, located in sectors 26, 42, 54, and 56, to curb waterlogging on Golf Course Road.“The additional time has helped us construct check dams and chutes (spillways) as well as complete all de-silting measures along the Aravallis. C&D waste is also being removed from the area. These works will result in a large amount of rainwater seeping into the soil and reducing the amount of run-off rainwater reaching the Golf Course Road,” said Kumar.GMDA officials said they will also be working on the ecological restoration of the creeks so that native trees and shrubs can absorb rainwater and help recharge the groundwater table. The entire restoration is expected to take at least three to four years, said officials. “This year, no flooding will occur at most of the critical points. We have deployed teams at each key waterlogging point so that they can monitor the on-ground situation round-the-clock during monsoon and send real-time information to the GMDA’s integrated command and control centre. GMDA, MCG, and Gurugram police can then, accordingly, initiate counter-waterlogging measures,” said Kumar.Sector 4/9A roadWork on excavating a parallel open drain to channel rainwater to other outlets, and subsequently, towards a sewage treatment plant in the vicinity, will be completed in a week, said officials.On Saturday, a joint team of the MCG and GMDA officials inspected the Sector 4/9A stretch between Laxman Vihar and Dhanwapur. According to MCG officials, the stretch is the lowest point in Old Gurugram and thus, remains susceptible to waterlogging.The MCG’s long-term plan for this stretch is to widen the existing stormwater drain and extent it up to the Dhanwapur sewerage treatment plant (STP), where rainwater can be disposed of. A plan in this regard has been sent to the Haryana government for approval.During the visit, MCG executive engineer Tushar Yadav said the excavation work is being done at a fast pace and will be completed within a week. “Work will be completed soon and through the open drain, water will be channelled into a drain located on the other side of the railway line,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/monsoon-delay-helps-gurugram-authorities-prepare-for-waterlogging-101625593998248.html
06-07-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: Active cases fall below 100 in Gurugram||Fewer than 100 people in the district are currently battling Covid-19, according to the district health department data, with the active caseload dipping below the century mark for the first time in over a year. This is a big turnaround, said officials, as the district was devastated by the second wave of Covid-19 less than two months ago. According to Tuesday’s health bulletin, there are currently 95 active Covid-19 cases in the district, which, as of May 6, was at a peak of 39,682 following a rapid surge in cases from March-end. As many as nine new cases of Covid-19 were detected on Tuesday. Dr Jai Prakash, the district surveillance officer for Covid-19, said, “Active cases have finally dropped below 100, which is a landmark (going by the numbers) over the past year. Testing has been ongoing, with about 28-30 testing camps being organised in market areas, congested areas and at borders in Kapashera and Kherki Dhaula. Even if the cases are few, the teams are directed to collect samples to check clustering of infection in any pocket of the district.”To prevent a repeat of the situation witnessed during the second wave, when hospital infrastructure was overburdened and oxygen supply ran low, the state government is now focussing on tackling the next wave of Covid-19. Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Tuesday directed all district heads to constitute a Covid-19 monitoring committee, comprising the deputy commissioner, police commissioner, chief medical officer and members of Indian Medical Association (IMA), to make preparations in advance. Officials said that Tuesday was the fourth consecutive day that the district recorded fewer than 10 infections in a day. Over the past week, the district added an average of nearly six cases per day, according to the government data. The decline in cases comes after the district’s fight against Covid-19 for almost two months, in April and May, when over 100,000 contracted the infection and 455 succumbed to it. The surge led to a lack of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilator beds in hospitals, even as medical facilities and residents in home isolation scrambled to get their oxygen supply. Now, the state government has set a deadline of July 10 for the district administration to submit details of bed availability, ventilators and oxygen supply in the district. All private hospitals having a bed capacity of 50 and higher were also directed to set up oxygen plants before July 10. Vij said that government institutions above the level of community health centres are also setting up oxygen plants. Apart from this, 40 oxygen plants will also be set up in the state by the Central government, as part of a nationwide plan announced earlier. The chief medical officer for Gurugram, Dr Virender Yadav, said, “There are at least 28 hospitals in the district having more than 50 beds, of which only 15 hospitals have their own oxygen plant.” During the peak of the second Covid-19 wave, the test positivity rate, the proportion of positives out of the sample tested, touched almost 39%. The positivity rate is a metric to gauge the prevalence of infection. The positivity rate has dropped considerably since the last week of May and is currently 0.1%. On the other hand, almost 11 people died due to infection in the last six days, while 83 deaths were reported in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-active-cases-fall-below-100-in-gurugram-101625593996959.html

06-07-2021||Gurugram||Warehousing transactions maximum in Gurugram as e-commerce firms increase footprint||Despite a 20% year-on-year decline in warehousing transactions in Delhi-NCR [National Capital Region], the industrial corridor of Gurugram, Manesar and KMP [Kundli-Manesar-Palwal] Expressway witnessed maximum transactions in the region as demand from e-commerce companies helped steady the local market in 2020-21, according to a study by a private real estate consultancy on Tuesday. A report released by Knight Frank, a real estate consultancy, stated that warehouses on NH-48, Kundli, Manesar and along the KMP Expressway accounted for 73% of the warehousing deals (from March 2020 to March 2021) in NCR. Mudassir Zaidi , the executive director, north, Knight Frank India, said, “The disruption in economic activity caused by the pandemic has influenced lower than expected transaction volumes for NCR’s warehousing market in financial year 2021 . While transactions were mostly muted in the industrial sector, e-commerce witnessed an expansion in its warehousing footprint. ”The KMP Expressway emerged as the major e-commerce hub, with top companies renting major top quality properties in the area, the report stated. It further identified areas on the outskirts of Gururgam, such as Farrukhnagar, Bilaspur-Tauru-Sohna road and Pataudi-Luharu road, as those of strategic importance for warehousing industry due to the location, competitive rent and future opportunities for expansion. The report stated that these locations offered significant advantages to e-commerce and other players due to easy connectivity to adjoining states, high level of industrialisation and availability of land for incremental increase in warehousing stock. Overall, the warehousing industry witnessed a 23% year-on-year decline in volume, which has been attributed to the disruptions caused by Covid-19 pandemic and the associated lockdowns that brought the entire economy to a standstill. A number of companies also deferred new leasing decisions, which led to a decline in the volume of transactions, the report stated. The NCR saw warehousing transactions to the tune of 6.9 million square feet, which was 20% less than the transactions in the previous financial year of 2019-2020. “E-commerce accounted for 61% of the region’s [NCR’s] warehousing transactions. Third Party-Logistics (3PL) players accounted for 26% . The increased reliance on online shopping during the lockdown has resulted in many companies expanding their last-mile delivery footprint and drive higher volumes. 3PL players, servicing the e-commerce sector are taking up Grade A warehousing space to ensure the seamless expansion of the last-mile delivery mechanism,” the report stated.As far as rentals are concerned, Greater Noida in Delhi-NCR led the pack, at ₹22- ₹ ₹30 per square feet, followed by Gurugram-Binola area, where the rent was in the range of ₹22- ₹26 per sq ft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/warehousing-transactions-maximum-in-gurugram-as-e-commerce-firms-increase-footprint-101625593935432.html

RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that the process of identifying offences is underway and junior engineers have been asked to conduct a detailed survey. “We have received directions from the director, DTCP, that action should be taken against owners of plots and developers who have constructed multiple flats or apartments on small plots without taking any permission from the authorities. The law clearly states that subdivision of plots is not allowed and vertical subdivision is also against the rules. Fifteen such properties have been identified and notices will be issued beginning next week,” said Bhath. Officials said that action would be initiated under the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975. The DTCP will work in coordination with municipal authorities to clamp down on violations, they said.If the owners don’t take corrective action, the properties will be sealed and the district administration will be asked to stop registration of such properties, said officials. In a related development, the enforcement wing also held a meeting to discuss violations in areas under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM) and decided that a detailed survey will be done to identify the violations.“It is being observed that large-scale construction of shops, commercial structures and houses is taking place in sectors and villages of MCM. The violators want to take advantage of the fact that this body is still in its infancy and they can carry out violations without any check. We have also received several complaints and now, action would be initiated,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-to-crack-down-on-illegal-construction-of-multiple-flats-on-single-plot-101625593935992.html

This change has resulted in the story “The Home Coming” by Rabindranath Tagore and the essay “The Women’s Education” by S Radhakrishnan besides AL Basham’s ‘The Heritage of India’ getting removed from the curriculum of class 12.Likewise, RK Narayanan’s story “An Astrologer’s Day” and “The Lost Child” by Mulk Raj Anand, both of which were part of class 12 syllabus, have also been taken out of the curriculum. Even poems of renowned poets like John Milton and PB Shelley will no longer be taught to class 12 students. On the same lines, Sarojini Naidu’s poem “The Village Song” that was part of class 10 syllabus has now been removed just like the works of Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, WM Raeburn and R Srinivasan.Though UP Board officials are reluctant to comment on the change as it is yet to be put up on the official website of UPMSP, senior officials confirmed these changes citing an approval received from the state government recently. “Within the next few days itself, the new curriculum would become online,” said one of these senior officials in the know about things.Officials said the NCERT syllabus means the students would need to study lesser number of books now. There were four books besides grammar in class 12 of UP Board till now but now just two books “Flamingo” and “Vistas” will be taught.In high school, however, while there were two books earlier and now also two books “First Flight” and “Footprints Without Feet” will be taught, they added.

The parking facility is the nation’s first to accept payment via the UPI (Unified Payments Interface) mode. This system is part of DMRC’s multimodal integration of transport services initiative.“For the first time in the country, a FASTag-based and UPI-based cashless parking facility was launched on Tuesday at the Kashmere Gate metro station by Mangu Singh, managing director, DMRC, in the presence of senior officials of the DMRC and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI),” the DMRC said in a statement.The parking facility located at gate 6 of the metro station is exclusively cashless. It can accommodate 55 four-wheelers and 174 two-wheelers. Two wheelers can use their DMRC card with parking. The DMRC said that only vehicles bearing FASTag will be allowed to park at this facility.“The entry and exit and payment by the riders of four-wheelers can be done through FASTag. The parking fee will be deducted through FASTag, which will reduce the time for entry and payment. Only vehicles bearing FASTag will be allowed to park at this facility,” DMRC said. It also said that two wheelers will not be charged and the smart card swipe is used only for registering the time of entry and exit and fare calculation.The officials said that the parking fee for the two-wheeler can be paid using UPI-based apps by scanning a QR-code. Provisions will be made at a later stage for commuters to use their Delhi Metro smart card and the NCMC (National Common Mobility Card), officials told news agency PTI.These facilities are aimed to help the commuters travelling to and from the Kashmere Gate station, which is connected to a major inter-state bus terminus (ISBT) and several offices around the station.“The cashless parking project is a major step as part of the government's 'Digital India' initiative. We have taken this up as a pilot project. After observing the response, we will plan similar systems at more parking facilities at our stations,” the DMRC chief Mangu Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dmrc-launches-india-s-first-fastag-based-parking-facility-at-kashmere-gate-metro-101625593019894.html
06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab BJP puts ex-minister Joshi on notice for ‘anti-party’ outbursts||With former minister Anil Joshi continuously attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high command and state leadership for mishandling the farm agitation, the party’s Punjab unit has finally initiated disciplinary action against him.“You are continuously giving statements against the central government, party’s central leadership and state leadership. Such activities are anti-party... Please file your reply within two days of receiving this notice as (to) why disciplinary action should (not) be initiated against you,” reads the notice sent by Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma to the two-time former MLA from Amritsar North.. The notice has the approval of the state BJP chief, Ashwani Sharma. According to a senior party functionary, the action is being taken against Joshi after getting consent from the senior central leadership. Joshi had been critical of the party’s style of handling the farmers’ agitation, and has taken on state leaders, including Ashwani Sharma, party’s Sikh face Harjit Grewal and former minister Surjit Jyani, for giving “wrong feedback” to the Centre on this critical issue. In a series of well-planned interviews given to different media houses a few days back, Joshi had also accused the BJP central leadership of having an adamant attitude in dealing with farmers. He has also demanded withdrawal of the contentious agricultural laws as being sought by the farmer groups. The former minister made fresh salvos on the senior leadership a couple of days back in Ludhiana, where he also announced the candidature of former deputy mayor RD Sharma, who has supported his statements, for the assembly elections from Ludhiana North. Even as Joshi’s outbursts against the party have got support of a few other senior leaders too, the Punjab BJP has not issued notices to them. ‘Ready to face 100 such disciplinary actions’Joshi, when contacted, said he was not afraid of any notice and would reply to it in detail. “I am ready to face 100 such disciplinary actions for speaking for Punjab and farmers. However, it is unfortunate that the party high command is playing in the hands of leaders like Ashwani Sharma and his coterie, who are not at all aware of the ground realities. I talked for farmers and I am proud of it,” said Joshi. A few leaders close to Joshi said the former minister was not in a mood to relent and has already made up his mind to tour the entire state on the issues he has been vocal about. A senior BJP leader, who did not wish to be named, said even the party was in no mood to spare Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-bjp-puts-ex-minister-joshi-on-notice-for-anti-party-outbursts-101625593036125.html

Many labourers contracted the virus in the second wave, and some died too, stalling the construction,” said Dr Devgan, adding the situation has improved and almost all workers have been vaccinated. The principal said sufficient funds are being received from the government, and the process for recruiting doctors and nurses has begun. About the instituteThe institute will be a state-of-the-art 150-bed complex that will provide world-class treatment facilities to cancer patients. It will house all the latest medical technology, including high-end linear accelerator, advanced operation centre, modular operation centre and advanced machines to execute image-guided radiation therapy.Besides departments of surgical oncology, medical oncology, nuclear medicines and radiation oncology, it will have a special rehabilitation unit and department for palliative treatment, said Dr Devgan. “With the help of this institute, we will be able to handle three times the number of patients we’re handing right now,” he said. Meanwhile, minister OP Soni, during a meeting on Monday, said: “Once the institute is inaugurated, patients from the region who have to go to the PGIMER, Chandigarh, and other hospitals in neighbouring states will be able to get cancer treatment in Amritsar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-state-cancer-institute-misses-june-deadline-101625592976260.html

The police refuted the allegation, saying some unidentified people had vandalised their houses. All the 11 accused were absconding. SP (Azamagarh) Sudhir Singh said village head Munna Paswan and his accomplices were reportedly passing obscene comments on girls passing by a street in Palia Bazar on June 29. Subsequently a self-styled doctor, Littan Biswas, started making a video of their act. Enraged over it, Munna and his accomplices assaulted Biswas, after which he fell unconscious.Soon after, two constables, Vivek Tripathi and Mukhram Yadav, tried to rescue Biswas. Munna Paswan and his accomplices attacked the cops and Tripathi suffered head injuries. He was admitted to hospital and underwent a surgery.Thereafter, Biswas and the cop filed separate complaints at the Raunapar police station. Two cases were registered against 11 villagers, including village head Munna Paswan, under relevant sections of the IPC on June 29 night, he added.Meanwhile, women of the families of the accused alleged that police vandalised their houses and misbehaved with them.

On the pretext of the loan proposal, Kumar duped him of ₹1 lakh. After being cheated, the complainant’s son went into depression and later committed suicide.The applicant’s plea was that he had not cheated the deceased and the allegation against him was that he was arrested along with main accused when they were travelling in an SUV and some mobile phones were also recovered from him. The government counsel argued that such crimes are an organised and widespread phenomenon, where innocent people are psychologically caught in their weak moments to part with money on the pretext of loans or rewards under various schemes. The accused was part of an organized racket, who were duping people of their hard earned money. “The deceased could not withstand the shock of losing a sum of ₹1 lakh to cheats and frauds and ultimately committed suicide,” argued the government counsel. The court, after hearing the parties concerned, observed: “Indeed, the act of cheating a person, seemingly by a well organised gang, in times thatare so hard and dear on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, where scores of citizens have lost their jobs, is an enormous crime. It has to be dealt with an iron hand. As far as the applicant is concerned, he has been caught red-handed along with those men, from whose custody mobile phones etc have been recovered, that were employed in perpetrating this fraud.”While rejecting the bail application, the court observed: “This court feels that it is high time when the state police must take widespread action to immediately bring to book all offenders, who call up citizens and make them cough up money by offering alluring schemes for the provision of loans or TV show rewards or lottery bonanzas. This court is convinced that no case for bail is made out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/take-steps-to-trace-gangs-duping-people-on-pretext-of-loans-lucky-draws-hc-101625591175309.html

Bais’s appointment is part of shuffle and appointment of governors across eight states by the Centre. Bais, currently Governor of the northeastern state of Tripura, will be replacing incumbent Governor Draupadi Murmu, who will relinquish office in Raj Bhawan after a long tenure of over six years. The only woman to have held the post in the state since its creation in 2000, Murmu, who hails from neighbouring Odisha, was appointed the ninth Governor of the tribal state in May 2015. Bais is from Chhattisgarh and has represented capital Raipur in Lok Sabha for seven times. He served as a Union minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. In the 2019 general elections, Bais was denied ticket by the party. However, the Modi government at the Centre, soon after returning to power, appointed Bais as Governor of Tripura. Bais is expected to arrive in the state soon and will take over the charge from the outgoing Governor after taking oath, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/ramesh-bais-appointed-new-jharkhand-governor-101625586975128.html

But very soon we will achieve the target of providing support to 1,000 such children, “ Sushil Kumar Modi, former deputy chief minister of state and patron of the Dadhichi Dehdaan Samiti, said. The Samiti had earlier announced to provide financial support of ₹500 a month to 1,000 children who lost either one or both the parents during the Covid-19 pandemic. These children will be given this kind of support for three years, Modi added. Modi said Samiti has been the first organisation that has launched this kind of financial support for the children of the Covid victims.Bimal Jain, Dehdaan Samiti general secretary, said that out of the target of 1,000 children, only 582 have been identified now. “We are trying to achieve the target of 1,000 within a month.

06-07-2021||Patna||Vaccine shortage holds back Bihar’s daily target||Shortage of Covid-19 vaccines pulled back Bihar’s effort to administer 4.54 lakh doses of vaccine daily to its target adult population of 7.22 crore, as the state could complete 100,004 vaccinations on Tuesday evening (6pm). The state vaccine depot in Patna exhausted its stockpile of over 1.81 lakh vaccine vials, which translated into 18.11 lakh doses, available between June 30 and July 5 after the state launched its vaccination mega drive on July 1. Bihar would expect a lull in terms of vaccination even on Wednesday, as the next tranche of 959,220 doses of the Covishield vaccine is expected from Pune today (Wednesday) in the afternoon. With no inventory left, the state health authorities had to shut down several vaccination session sites on Tuesday. The 1,106 vaccination session sites functional on Tuesday were a little over one-third its targeted 3,000 static session sites the state health department wanted to be functional at least four days a week till December. No vaccinations took place at Saharsa, Gopalganj and West Champaran, while Madhepura reported one and Khagaria six. Four other districts, Darbhanga (19), Rohtas (65), Kishanganj (71) and Jehanabad (30), reported double-digit vaccinations till 6pm on Tuesday. Thirty-six of its 46 vaccination session sites were shut in state capital Patna due to unavailability of vaccines on Tuesday. A day before, 32 session sites were closed. “Most of our session sites are closed today due to unavailability of vaccines. They will reopen as soon as we get vaccines,” said Dr SP Vinayak, district immunisation officer, Patna. The state capital, he said, had been vaccinating an average daily 30,000 doses of vaccine against its capacity to administer 1 lakh doses. “We have not been given any daily target due to uncertainty of vaccines. We have simply been told to exhaust vaccines by administering them to people in the shortest possible time after getting them,” said Dr Vinayak. The Patna district administration hopes to saturate administering at least one dose of the vaccine to the eligible population in urban Patna this month itself. “We have achieved 57% first dose vaccine coverage against a target population of 14.36 lakh in Patna urban,” said Dr Vinayak. However, Patna’s rural coverage, like most other districts, has not been satisfactory. The first dose vaccine coverage was only 24% against its 29.12 lakh target population in rural Patna. The 70-odd “Teeka Express” or mobile vaccine vans, plying in Patna, were inoculating 150-175 people on an average against its daily target of 200. The vaccination coverage through “Teeka Express” was less in rural areas as compared to urban areas, even as officials contended that the rural population was fast shedding their vaccine hesitancy. For the next six months, Bihar has set itself a target to administer daily 4.54 lakh doses four days a week, barring Wednesday, Friday (reserved for routine immunisation) and Sunday. It had administered 1,333,980 doses during the last five days since the launch of the vaccination mega drive on July 1. Another 100,004 doses were administered till 6pm on Tuesday, taking the cumulative vaccination doses to 1,74,76,123. Of this, 1,50,06,336 were first dose vaccinations and remaining 24,69,787 second dose. Chief minister Nitish Kumar has set a goal to fully inoculate the state’s target population by December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/vaccine-shortage-holds-back-bihar-s-daily-target-101625586795070.html

Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary of education department, said, “At the recent meeting of crisis management group, it was decided to resume classes at varsities, colleges, senior secondary schools and coaching centres with 50% strength from July 12. All educational institutions are supposed to thoroughly sanitise their premises before reopening.”The SOPs released by department mandate that hostels and school buses will have to be sanitised once before schools reopen and then twice a day after reopening. Schools and other institutions have also been directed to constitute different teams to look after sanitisation, cleanliness and social distancing.Kumar said, “50% students can be called on alternate days for attending classes. Though classes have not resumed for students of class 1 to 10, schools have been permitted to call 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff daily.” The guidelines also say educational institutions should to avoid organising functions and ensure availability of medical staff for any emergency.Association of Independent Schools ( AIS) and Private Schools and Children Welfare Association (PSCWA) welcomed the decision.CB Singh, president of AIS, said, “We assure the government that all CBSE affiliated schools would follow Covid-19 safety protocols. Teachers have been facing a financial crisis for last 15 months due to closure of schools. Reopening is likely to give some respite to them through employment opportunities as many teachers lost their jobs during pandemic.” Shamael Ahmad, national president of PSCWA, said, “We appeal the state government to soon resume physical classes for students of Class 1 to 10 as online schooling is affecting health and holistic development of children. Besides, schools are facing huge financial crunch as majority of parents are reluctant to pay school fees despite availing online class facility which has mounted financial burden.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-educational-institutions-coaching-centres-to-partially-reopen-from-july-12-101625586735696.html

Medical teams have also started sample collection from shops of all the areas where the residents fell ill,” the DM said. The ‘prasad’, which was made of milk, was apparently contaminated and led to the illness, civil surgeon Dr Harendra Kumar Alok said, while quoting police and health department officials . Samples of the prasad have been sent to the laboratory for examination, he added.According to sources in the district administration, more than 250 people were invited at a function at one Mahesh Koda’s house on Monday evening, and were given ‘prasad’. After consuming it, most of the attendees complained of stomach pain, loose motion,dizziness and vomiting, officials said. Initially, around 22 people complained of vomiting and other symptoms of food poisoning. Gradually, the number increased and they were rushed to medical shops and village doctors, who failed to contain the situation. On being informed, the civil surgeon sent a health care team to attend the victims at around 11pm. The patients were treated on the street due to increasing numbers of patients. Dr N K Mehta, who treated the village residents, said of the total 170 people, 90 were discharged and the rest are under treatment. “Everyone is out of danger,” he said. Besides, 15 persons were admitted to a nearby community health centre as a precautionary measure as they showed symptoms of dehydration, the civil surgeon said. “It was only a preventive move and all of them are recovering fast. All of them will be discharged by Tuesday evening,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/munger-170-villagers-fall-ill-after-consuming-prasad-stable-101625586735135.html

06-07-2021||Patna||JD(U) set to join union cabinet, Nitish silent on numbers||Amid indications of an imminent reshuffle of the Union cabinet, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday did not rule out the possibility of his party Janata Dal (United) joining the central government, but parried questions on the number of berths, saying party president R C P Singh was the person authorised to speak on the matter.“I have no knowledge about any formula but our party’s national president has the authorisation for this,” Kumar told reporters in Patna.Asked about the numbers of ministers to be inducted from JD (U) quota, Kumar said with a smile, “I have no idea about how many numbers are being discussed. Whatever Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants will happen.”RCP Singh, who left for Delhi from Patna on Tuesday, told news agency ANI, “Whatever our leader has said is true. You will see soon.” Sources in Bihar said four ministers could be inducted from Bihar — two are from JD (U), one from LJP faction led by Pashupati Paras, and one from the BJP. A top JD (U) leader said the party wanted to have four ministers. “BJP has 17 Lok Sabha MPs in Bihar and five ministers at the Centre. But JD (U) has 16 MPs and not a single minister. We have asked for four ministerial posts, two of them of cabinet ranks and rest as ministers of state,” he said. In 2019, JD (U) had refused to join union cabinet, demanding proportional representation. “What happened at that time is over. I was the party president at that time,” Kumar said, dropping cleat hints of JD(U) joining the union cabinet this time.Bihar has 40 Lok Sabha seats, of which BJP won 17, JD(U) 16, LJP six and Congress one in the 2019 parliamentary polls. Names of JD(U) doing the rounds for a berth in union cabinet were R C P Singh and Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh. “Party’s national president (RCP Singh) will take the final decision (on who will be made ministers). All I can say right now is that we are going to be involved (in the proposed expansion of the Union Cabinet),” JD(U)’s Bihar president Umesh Kushwaha said.Meanwhile, LJP leader Pashupati Paras left for New Delhi after reportedly receiving a call from Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jdu-set-to-join-union-cabinet-nitish-silent-on-numbers-101625586615042.html
06-07-2021||Patna||Chirag writes to PM amid buzz of a Cabinet berth for Paras||Amid the buzz of a possible expansion of the Union Cabinet and a berth for Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Chirag Paswan on Tuesday said he has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi that nobody from his party’s breakaway group of five MPs should be inducted from the LJP quota. Paras, who is Chirag Paswan’s uncle, recently led a rebellion by five of the six LJP MPs and was later declared leader of the party in the Lok Sabha by the Speaker.Both Paras and Paswan factions claim to be the real LJP, which has been a constituent of the ruling National Democratic Alliance at the Centre. “If any of them gets included in the Cabinet from the party’s quota, I will certainly have objection to it and I may have to take legal recourse. If any of them is made a minister as an independent or from some other party, I have no problem. But as far as LJP is concerned, its constitution allows me to be the president and the matter is before the Election Commission as well as the Lok Sabha Speaker,” Paswan told reporters in Patna. A day after launching his “Ashirvad Yatra” from Hajipur, Paswan said LJP continued to be with the NDA at the Centre and whatever happened in the party was akin to stabbing late Ram Vilas Paswan in his back. “I have already written to PM Narendra Modi as well as the EC in this regard. The common practice is that the party president is consulted if anyone from the party has to be included in the Cabinet,” he said. The Jamui MP said his uncle engineered the split in LJP only to become a minister, at the behest of Nitish Kumar. “Nitish Kumar always tried to insult my father, but my uncle chose to sit in his lap at the cost of the family and party, which gave him everything,” he said. Attacking Kumar, Paswan said the Bihar chief minister did not even pay tributes to his father on his first birth anniversary after death, though the Prime Minister, home minister and several others did. “But this is nothing new with Nitish Kumar. He did not even seek to know about his health when Ram Vilas Paswan was admitted in the hospital and that is why the actions of his uncle pains him more,” he said. “I am not eager to become a minister. My first objective is to build the party as a viable alternative in Bihar. Even when my father was around, attempts were made to break the party, but LJP continued its march. It will continue its march and I am overwhelmed with the response of the people for my Ashirvad Yatra the very first day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/chirag-writes-to-pm-amid-buzz-of-a-cabinet-berth-for-paras-101625586555004.html

06-07-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray dismissive about talk of patch-up with BJP||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday dismissed rumours that the Shiv Sena and BJP may come together again, and also slammed the opposition party for its conduct during the state legislature's just-concluded monsoon session.Speculation was rife in political circles in the last few days over possible reconciliation between the Thackeray-led Sena and the BJP which parted ways after the 2019 Assembly elections. "Something which didn't happen when we were together for 30 years, what can happen now, " he said to a question about whether the two parties would join the hands again. Talking to the media after the two-day session ended, the chief minister said the actions of the BJP members were not the sign of a healthy democracy.Twelve BJP MLAs were on Monday suspended from the Assembly for one year for allegedly misbehaving with presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav in the Speaker's chamber. "What was the need for the BJP to create a hue and cry over a resolution asking the Centre to provide census data of 2011 to enable the State Backward Class Commission to prepare empirical data of OBCs....should we say its animosity for OBCs came to the surface?" Thackeray asked. The conduct of BJP MLAs "made us hang our heads in shame", he said. "Even if you feel the resolution wouldn't yield anything, couldn't you still support it? What was the need to create ruckus. If the Centre is not providing us the data, how do you know there are mistakes in it," Thackeray said. "If there were mistakes, why did the Devendra Fadnavis government seek information about it in 2019," he asked.Monday's ruckus was an attempt to destablize the Sena-NCP-Congress government, Thackeray alleged, adding the attempt failed and it had failed in the past too. "The BJP blames us for murdering democracy and called the MLAs' suspension a black chapter, then what are ED and CBI doing, painting the democracy white?" he further said.To a question on the pending election for Assembly Speaker, the chief minister said his government applies Covid-19 rules to itself too. "During a pandemic, the health of people and legislators is important. I underwent a Covid test on Sunday and got the report on Monday morning. (But) What about MLAs from rural areas, how can the 72-hour period for RTPCR test be implemented," he asked.Justifying the delay in holding election for Speaker and short duration of the session, he said in two days "we could do a lot of work which will help people".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-chief-uddhav-thackeray-dismissive-about-talk-of-patch-up-with-bjp-101625582999731.html

06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: Two Indian army sepoys held for spying for ISI||The Punjab Police have busted a cross-border espionage network with the arrest of two army sepoys, who are accused of providing classified documents to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).They have been identified as sepoys Harpreet Singh and Gurbhej Singh, both 23. Harpreet belongs to Cheecha village in Amritsar and was posted in Anantnag. He joined the Indian Army in 2017 and belongs to the 19 Rashtriya Rifles. Gurbhej is from Punian in Tarn Taran, belongs to 18 Sikh Light Infantry and was working as a clerk in Kargil. He had joined the army in 2015. Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta on Tuesday said that the espionage network was unearthed after the Jalandhar rural police recovered confidential documents related to the functioning and deployment of the Indian Army from cross-border drug smuggler Ranvir Singh, who was arrested with heroin on May 24. During interrogation, Ranvir disclosed that he got the documents from Harpreet, who was his friend as they both belong to the same village. “Ranvir motivated and lured sepoy Harpreet Singh with financial benefits for sharing defence-related classified documents, following which the latter inducted his friend Gurbhej into such anti-national spying activities,” said DGP Dinkar Gupta. As Gurbhej was working as a clerk in the 121 Infantry Brigade Headquarters in Kargil, he could get easy access to classified documents containing both strategic and tactical information related to the Indian Army, said the DGP.Drug smuggler with contacts in Pak held tooGupta said the two armymen had already shared photos of over 900 classified documents — pertaining to defence of the country and national security — with Ranvir Singh over a period of four months between February and May 2021. Ranvir had further passed on these documents to the Pakistan ISI operatives, either directly or via Gopi, said the DGP. Gopi, who belongs to Dauke village in Amritsar, has been identified as the main drug smuggler with links with Pakistan-based drug-smuggling syndicates and ISI officials, who invariably work in tandem.Following Ranvir’s disclosures, police have also arrested Gopi, who has confessed to having transferred the classified documents to Pakistan-based drug smuggler Kothar and ISI operative Sikander in lieu of heroin and financial benefits, the DGP said, adding that all the photographs were transmitted through encrypted apps.

Visuals shared by news agency ANI showed a large number of people gathered to get their jabs, and were also seen not maintaining social distance.The chief medical superintendent told ANI that the crowd was formed because several people were not able to get inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine jabs in the last two days. The official said that the reason behind this was that the hospital did not have enough stock of vaccines. Therefore, as soon as the hospital received sufficient vaccine doses, people began thronging to the place to get their jabs, ANI reported.“On Monday, we got 3,000 vaccine doses. Our staff is there to make people aware of Covid norms. We also made a new centre,” the chief medical superintendent was quoted as saying by ANI.Noida | People throng District Hospital, Sector-30 to take vaccine jab, defying social distancing norms For last 2 days, we were getting less dosses.

The court rejected the submission of amicus curiae that it was impossible for the four eye witnesses to see at night the face of the man, who had committed the murder.The man in question is one Mukesh, who is currently lodged in Jaipur jail, after the trial court awarded life sentence to him in the murder of a fellow villager named Gopal Lal in July 2012, PTI reported. In April 2019, the Rajasthan high court dismissed his plea challenging the trial court’s order.During the latest hearing in the top court, advocate Pijush Kanti Roy, who has been appointed amicus in the matter, said that at the time of the murder in an isolated place, it was a dark night and that there was no way all the four witnesses in the case could have seen the face of the petitioner.The bench, however, upheld the order passed by the high court that all the witnesses saw the face of the petitioner in the light of a motorcycle’s headlight. “It’s like Sherlock Holmes telling Dr Watson, ‘You see, but you do not observe’,” Justice Nariman said, PTI reported.The division bench of the apex court also told Roy that he has done “more than the duty of amicus curiae.”“You are flogging a dead horse…There is a clear-cut finding,” the bench added, as per the PTI report.In his plea, Mukesh said that the high court ought to have appreciated the fact that there was no enmity between the petitioner and Gopal Lal, and that he had no intention to kill him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/you-see-but-don-t-observe-sc-quotes-sherlock-holmes-while-dismissing-plea-101625579534991.html

06-07-2021||Lucknow||‘UP govt exploiting youths, Dalits’: Priyanka asks Cong workers to stage protest||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi on Tuesday held another virtual training programme for youth Congress workers and party workers ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. During the training programme for party workers in Jhansi, Priyanka said that the Yogi Adityanath-led government in Uttar Pradesh is exploiting Dalits as well as the people from the deprived sections of society. She said that the government failed to give relief to the people.“Crimes are on the rise in Uttar Pradesh. The prominent agenda of the Yogi Adityanath government is exploitation of the Dalits, the deprived and the exploited sections of the society. The silent support to criminals is making the situation explosive. The government is far from giving any relief to the people,” Priyanka was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Priyanka, who earlier held a similar session with workers from Mathura and Lucknow, reiterated that party workers need to stand firm with the people of the state. She said every worker should play an active role in tackling the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Priyanka said that the nation is adversely affected because of the ‘anti-people’ policies of the government and Congress can take the leading role in tackling the challenges.“Spiralling inflation, poverty, malnutrition, crime and challenges before the democratic values, Constitution and Constitutional institutions, can only be tackled by the Congress. For this, everybody has to play an active role,” Priyanka told the party workers. She further added that Congress workers know how to sacrifice everything for the country. She reiterated that Congress workers need to work with the people as the BJP ‘committed the sin of pushing people into problems’.“Stand with them, share their pain, and work hard to help them get rid of the pain,” Priyanka said. She also instructed the Congress workers to question the BJP on inflation, unemployment, increasing prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas by staging protests over these issues.Priyanka attacked the government over unemployment in the state and said that the recruiting process is corrupt and selected candidates are struggling to get their appointment. “The BJP government has no vision. It is cheating the youth and the unemployed persons, and doing injustice. Instead of answering questions, it speaks lies, and avoids accountability,” Priyanka further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-exploiting-youths-dalits-priyanka-asks-cong-workers-to-stage-protest-101625572726147.html
06-07-2021||Delhi||Sainik Farms drug bust: Afghan national used Aadhaar to take farmhouse on rent||The farmhouse in south Delhi’s Sainik Farms, where Punjab Police on Sunday unearthed a heroin-manufacturing unit, was taken on rent by an Afghan national, Najibullah Khalid, who used an Aadhaar card to identify himself as an Indian resident while getting the rent agreement for the property, said owner of the farmhouse and the property dealer who finalised the deal. Afghan nationals Mujahed Shinwari, Mohammad Lal Kaker, Jannat Gul Kakar, and Samiullah Afghan, who were allegedly running the unit, were arrested from the farmhouse during the raid. Khalid was caught later when he arrived there to meet his accomplices. The raiding team took Khalid for questioning as the farmhouse was taken on rent in his name. He is yet to be arrested, said a Punjab Police officer who did not want to be named.Also Read | After Mumbai, cases of Avascular Necrosis reported in DelhiKhalid’s Aadhaar card, a copy of which is with HT, carries a Neb Sarai address. The farmhouse owner, Pravesh Kumar alias Bobby, and the property dealer, Ganesh Kumar, said they have submitted to the Neb Sarai Police the Aadhaar card’s copy, rent agreement, and other documents that they obtained from Khalid while renting out the property. The two told police that Khalid had introduced himself as an Indian citizen into the business of supply and sale of dates. The rent agreement was prepared last month and the four men started staying in the farmhouse around June 26-27. “Khalid had come to me through the reference of a property dealer in Malviya Nagar who had helped him purchase a flat in Neb Sarai. The Aadhaar card that Khalid produced for preparing the rent agreement of the farmhouse has the address of the same flat. Khalid told me that he had sold that property and wanted to move into a farmhouse with his wife, whom he introduced as an Indian citizen,” said Ganesh. He said the farmhouse was rented out to Khalid on a monthly rent of ₹1.60 lakh. Khalid paid ₹4.80 lakh as one-month advance rent and two months of security money. “I followed all the procedures while renting out the property. Apart from the rent agreement, I had also applied online for the tenant’s verification,” he said.Additional deputy commissioner of police (south) Mandava Harsh Vardhan said a case under Indian Penal Code’s section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) has been registered at the Neb Sarai police station against the farmhouse owner for not carrying out tenant verification. Asked if Khalid had prepared a fake Aadhar Card for obtaining the farmhouse on rent, the additional DCP said, “We will look into all the aspects pertaining to the case that we have registered.”Another police officer, who did not wish to be named, said holding an Aadhaar card means that the card holder is residing in India and as per the Aadhar Act, 2016, even a foreigner who has stayed in India for more than 182 days is eligible to apply for an Aadhaar.“Khalid told the police that he has been staying in India as an Afghan refugee for the past six years. This information has to be verified first before finding out how he got an Aadhar card,” the officer added.About the case and the charges under which he has been booked by the Neb Sarai police, farmhouse owner Bobby said he had not violated any law because the tenants never told them that they were foreign nationals. “I would have never rented out my property or had alerted the concerned agencies, had I known that the tenants were foreigners. Being a responsible citizen, I will cooperate with the police in their investigation,” Bobby said.On Sunday around 5pm, around a dozen personnel from the Punjab Police raided Bobby’s farmhouse number 227, spread in nearly 1,700 square yards, and arrested four Afghan nationals for running a heroin-manufacturing unit there. A total of 17 kilogram of heroin, assorted chemicals, acids and lab equipment were seized from the farmhouse.“We are carrying out another operation to nab more drug dealers associated with the syndicate. As far as investigation regarding the Aadhar card and other documentation regarding the rented farmhouse is concerned, we will investigate everything once we complete our operation,” said Tushar Gupta, ASP Garhshankar police (in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur), who was leading the raiding party during the crackdown at the farmhouse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sainik-farms-drug-bust-afghan-national-used-aadhaar-to-take-farmhouse-on-rent-101625572694897.html

Under the scheme, the government will offer a one-time compensation of ₹50,000 to their kin. Monthly ₹2,500 will be given to families who have lost their earning members. Children, who have lost their parents to Covid-19, will be provided a monthly allowance of ₹2,500 till they turn 25. These benefits will be in addition to the ongoing social welfare scheme of the Delhi government such as old-age and widow pensions.Kejriwal urged officials to be empathetic towards the families during their visits to check the eligibility of the applicants for the scheme. He stressed that the families, at no point, should feel harassed during the entire process. Kejriwal added in the cases, where the required documents are unavailable with applicants, it will be the responsibility of the officers to get them completed for the application process.Also Read | Can’t take as long as you want: Court on Twitter’s non compliance of IT rule“Please do not put the families under stress because of any missing papers. If you do so, it will be like adding salt to their wounds. They are already going through a lot and are bereaved. It is our duty to help them in such tough times. We have to make sure that these families receive their dues swiftly as they will be intently relying on it since there is no one to look after them right now. Reassure the families, be empathetic, tell them we have been personally sent by the chief minister. Build a relationship with them and expedite the process so that the cheques reach them at the earliest,” Kejriwal said while launching the scheme.The scheme can be availed either by applying for it on www.edistrict.delhigovt.nic.in or through direct identification by the government representatives, who are expected to visit such families based on the database provided by the state health department.Kejriwal said the fourth wave of Covid-19 in Delhi was the most brutal of all. “The entire country may have seen two waves, but for Delhi, this was the fourth wave. Last year in June, we saw the first wave, in September, the second wave, in November, the third wave, and now the fourth wave. This fourth wave was very severe, widespread and almost every family was affected by it. It was also very lethal. We lost a lot of lives because a lot of children became orphans, a lot of families lost their breadwinners. There is no one to look after them now, which is why the Delhi government has come up with this scheme.”Also Read | When a demolition drive destroys a villageThe scheme was notified on June 22. Those who have died, and their dependents should be from the national capital to avail benefits under it. Also, the dependents can get the benefits only if the deaths of their kin are certified to have been because of Covid as per the data with the Union home ministry or the death should have happened within one month of testing Covid-19 positive. The state health department will also verify such deaths as Covid fatalities.If a family is survived by only minor children, then the applicant or beneficiary will be the foster parent or guardian declared fit under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act by the Child Welfare Committee. The financial assistance shall be transferred to the joint bank account in the name of the minor child and the foster parent or guardian.According to a Delhi Commission For Protection of Child Rights survey, over 2,000 children in the national capital have lost either one or both their parents to Covid-19. As many as 67 of them lost both their parents since the pandemic hit in March last year.

The staff working with gram panchayats will become part of municipal staff. Right now, we don’t have exact numbers, but the ward officers have been instructed to collect the data.”One of the officials from PMC on condition of anonymity said, “As new staff will get added to PMC, it will create more financial burden. It is not clear whether PMC will add the teachers and health workers which are working with Zilla Parishad. Already PMC has planned to execute the 7th Pay Commission for its staff.”Recently, Kumar said that PMC revenue expenditure has already increased and so the civic body is not able to allot more funds for development projects and maximum money is going on salaries and maintenance work.Meanwhile, after the merger of the villages the city is now one of the largest in Maharashtra in terms of area.

The civic officials say the scheme will be launched in the next 15 days.The panel had given the nod to execute the scheme on June 30 to regularise the illegal water connections and instructed the administration to execute it on an immediate basis.Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the water department, said, “We proposed the amnesty scheme to the standing committee and after that, it was expected that it would go to the general body for final approval. But the standing committee asked the administration to start execution considering that the general body will approve it later. Now we need to put the proposal again in front of the municipal commissioner and later we would publish the scheme details in the newspapers.”“It is expected that the scheme will get launched in the next 15 days, after completing the administrative process. It would be for a limited time frame of three months. Later, PMC administration would also put the proposal in front of the general body for approval,” he said.Hemant Rasne, chairman of the standing committee, said, “As all parties supported the scheme, it is clear that the general body will approve it.”Pawaskar said, “The fee is less to regularise the water connections. It depends on the size of the pipe for the water connection. Even the rates are different for commercial and residential use of the water.”The officers from the water department said on anonymity, “Citizens have already started inquiry for the scheme. We are expecting that this time the elected members themselves will appeal to the citizens to regularise the water connections. They will also benefit from the 24x7 water scheme. Even as it is an official scheme, there are no chances to take any action for illegal water connection.”Maximum defaulters are from government offices, which include BSNL, Railways, and many central government officials.

06-07-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: A mobility forum for women, by women||Anita used to walk to school. After Class 10, when she got admission to a junior college about 12km away, her family’s first thought was how will she travel every day? Fortunately, they found at least one direct bus route from a bus stop just 300 metres away, and several possibilities involving one change. Anita and her mother checked out the bus and were happy to find it a workable option. Sadly, this is not the case for a large number of children, women, and the elderly in Pune. Travel modes and patterns of men and women are different. Many more women walk to work as compared to men. The top reasons that women and elderly people use cycles are convenience and affordability. Women are much more likely to use sustainable modes – walk, cycle, public bus, shared rickshaws – but often face an unsafe, unfriendly road environment and inconvenient services. This is the case in many other cities too. For example, Shriya Khelurkar, studying urban planning at CEPT University, in her research at Ahmedabad found that some girls could not continue their studies, while women found it difficult to travel for work, as it was not easy to even reach the bus stop. No first- or last-mile connectivity, lack of street lights, lack of footpaths, and presence of gambling dens due to a lack of jobs made the journey a daily battle.Long waiting times, lack of proper shelters at bus stops, poor road conditions, aggressive traffic, lack of street lights, and harassment are some very common and yet unaddressed issues that a majority of women face. The only concession made for women, of reserving the left side in buses for them, has often met with hostility and non-cooperative attitudes among staff and male commuters, but is a step in the right direction. Unsafe and inadequate transport means that women and girls have fewer opportunities for education and livelihoods! In 2013, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) prepared a framework for a women-friendly city with the help of the All India Institute of Local Self Government. It details out a number of improvements towards safety, education, health, culture, transportation, water, sanitation, informal sector and housing which all influence women’s everyday lives. Years have passed since then. An online discussion last week with women leaders, activists and professionals emphasised taking women’s safety and mobility up a few notches in Pune. Kiran Moghe, president of Pune Zilha Gharkamgar Sanghatana, who was part of this exercise for gender-sensitive planning in Pune said, “The report was an important step, but we need to see implementation.” “The transport sector and services are typically planned in a gender-neutral way, with little consideration for the specific needs of women,” said Pranjali Deshpande, a transport planner. Lakshmi Narayan from Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat, felt that, “Pune should be a city that is conducive for women as commuters, of course. But, we would also like women as drivers, operators, managers, designers and decision-makers in the movement of people, services and goods in the city.” It is clear, Pune needs a “mobility forum for women, by women”. Such thinking resonates with a new report by the Kerala Government with support from GIZ which recognizes that reforms in public transport must integrate a gender orientation. The formation of metropolitan transport authorities, using technology for data collection and analysis, and moving to electric buses, should help focus attention on and respond to women’s specific travel and safety needs, the report suggests. Women’s participation in the transport sector in different ways is key to develop a conducive environment for women working in the sector and for women as users. The leadership of women corporators would be necessary to ensure each ward has a participatory assessment and action for women’s safety and mobility. Women corporators would need to assert themselves and ensure that municipal budgets and programmes, the public bus service and other transport facilities, and the police, become responsive to gender and mobility concerns. Will Pune’s political parties step up? We would like to see election manifestos present the vision for how Pune can be a city where women and girls have safe, comfortable, convenient and affordable mobility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-a-mobility-forum-for-women-by-women-101625568135624.html

06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Caught off guard, taking the interviewer for a ride||It was a chilly morning of the early ’70s. Standing at the Ambala railway station with a lit cigarette in hand, I was waiting anxiously for a train to Hisar. It was a different world then. You could conveniently smoke on a crowded platform, but it was not convenient to reserve a seat on a train. I wanted to reach Hisar that evening. The next day, there was an interview for the post of lecturer in English at CRM Jat College that I desperately wanted to attend. With an air of despondence, I was looking at the crowded trains entering the platform, stopping to disgorge a mass of people, and then departing after sucking more of them. I was wondering whether I would get a toehold on my train. But what happened next was no less than a miracle. The train for Hisar arrived and I was pushed by a crowd into a compartment. A gentleman occupying a window seat gestured me towards the seat facing him. Perhaps, it had been vacated by the person who had come to see him off. I sat depositing my airbag beneath the seat, heaved a sigh of relief and then regarded my benefactor. He was an elderly man with a suave, clean-shaven face and bright eyes shining from behind the rimless spectacles, an air of sophistication around him. Wrapped in a spotlessly clean white shawl, he could be a political bigwig or a highly placed bureaucrat. Our conversation took off from my expression of gratitude and telling him how important this travel was for me. I told him about my interview the next day. Some people are such avid listeners that you tend to talk your heart out before them. He was such a person, listening to me intently with a genial appreciative smile, punctuating my narrative with appreciative “Really so?” or “Oh! That’s great!” and the like. At one place, he asked, “So you must have prepared hard for this interview?” I told him that I had been appearing for such interviews for a while after my post-graduation and I had developed a technique of my own. “Now I know how to take the expert interviewer for a ride,” I said with a boastful grin. “He will surely ask what my favourite field in literature is. I shall declare it’s modern fiction. Then the next question will naturally be who my best-loved author is. Thus, we shall reach Aldous Huxley, which is my cherished territory! I have read the synopses of all his works with notes and commentaries.” Throughout the journey, my companion cautiously evaded my questions regarding his identity or whereabouts by changing the topic or by simply ignoring me. I lost him in the crowd when we got down at Hisar without having any chance to say a proper goodbye. The next morning, I was sitting before a panel of a five-member interview board. It was a prestigious college with a reputation for fair selection of lecturers. Just satisfy the expert at the interview and you will be in, I was told. The centrally seated chairman asked me a few questions about my antecedents and handed me over to the person sitting on the left edge of the table, “Your witness, Mr, Bombwall!” I turned left to face Mr Bombwall and was shell-shocked. He was the man I met on the train the day before. He was wearing a well-tailored business suit instead of a white shawl and his bright eyes were laughing silently behind the rimless specs. A mocking smile curled round his lips when he addressed me, “So Mr Parmar, let us cut it short and start directly with Aldous Huxley. I’m ready for the ride.” Anyway, I was selected for the post. The man on the train, Mr KR Bombwall, turned out to be an angel of a person. I found out later that he was a consummate scholar and noted educationist of Haryana. parmar.ranbir@gmail.com The writer is a Shimla-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/caught-off-guard-taking-the-interviewer-for-a-ride-101625567414915.html

Like other post-Covid ailments, recently we are seeing Avascular Necrosis of the femoral head in the bone and joint segment. This is because of steroids used in the treatment of Covid-19. This is not an immediate effect and it might take between three months to one year to show effects of steroids in joints," Dr Ishwar Bohra of BLK Institute for Bone said.In the backdrop of these cases, experts have warned against neglecting joint pains, especially those in the shoulder and the hip."Steroids soften the bone, but cartilage starts collapsing and reduces blood supply too. It is steroid-induced necrosis of bone," Dr Bohra further said, adding that the cost of operating on patients to treat AVN may range between ₹3-4 lakh.AVN, also known as osteonecrosis, is among various fungal infections seen among patients who recovered from Covid-19, the other being mucormycosis (black fungus), candida, along with common pain, breathing difficulties, hyperlipidemia, malaise, fatigue and hypertension. In it, a lack of blood supply leads to the death of bone tissue; a broken bone or a dislocated joint can interrupt the blood flow to a section of bone.The infection can lead to tiny breaks in the bone, eventually causing the bone to collapse.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-mumbai-cases-of-avascular-necrosis-reported-in-delhi-101625562735432.html

06-07-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal launches social security scheme for families affected by Covid-19||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday launched the “Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojana”, a social security scheme for families affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Kejriwal said the Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojana was launched as many children lost their parents and families lost their sole breadwinners to Covid-19.“India has seen two waves of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first wave was in 2020 and the second was in April this year. But in Delhi, this was the fourth wave. Last year, the first wave hit Delhi in June, second in September and third in September. However, the fourth wave was extremely severe. There would be very few families which didn’t get infected during this wave,” Kejriwal said while addressing the launch event virtually.The scheme was notified by the Delhi government on June 22. Under it, an ex-gratia of ₹50,000 will be provided to families who have lost their loved ones to Covid-19. An additional pension of ₹2,500 per month if the deceased was the family’s sole breadwinner.The notification also stated that the deceased and the dependent should be from the national capital. “Death should be certified as Covid-19 death or death within one month of testing Covid positive and verified by the health department as Covid death,” it added.Kejriwal also pointed out on Tuesday that orphans, including those who lost one parent to Covid and the second parent due to any other reasons, will be given financial assistance of ₹2,500 per month till the time they attain the age of 25.Representatives will visit the homes of the affected families and help them in documentation work, he said.“I want to tell all such representatives not to conduct scrutiny of applications. If the families lack any document, we will help them obtain it. We have to make sure that we make this happen. Don’t find faults with their documents... don’t make them unhappy, encourage them,” the Delhi CM further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-launches-social-security-scheme-for-families-affected-by-covid19-101625561356677.html
06-07-2021||Delhi||Young medics in the pandemic: Exhausted, overburdened and fearful||Since the pandemic struck, life has certainly turned topsy-turvy for one segment of frontline workers, that is, doctors. From working in shifts 24X7 to consoling the patients’ families, while putting their own lives as well as their families’ lives at risk, most docs have been doing it all. But this time has been especially challenging for the young medics, many of who started their careers right in the midst of the pandemic. And having overcome most of the challenges, what still pains them is the treatment that they are meted out, whenever a situation goes awry. Reportedly, in the recent most incident, two doctors from AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital were “teased” for “spreading corona”, and attacked by locals in Delhi’s Gautam Nagar area. But this is just one of the many cases of violence against doctors and other healthcare workers across the country. Dr Saif Ashraf, who works at Hindu Rao Hospital’s surgery department, says, “I’ve always been someone who likes to keep my work arena fun no matter how sad the situation gets. But this one day, during my shift at the Covid isolation ward, I had three critical patients. One moment I was sitting there sweating in my PPE kit, and the next moment I was trying to revive a crashing patient, who unfortunately couldn’t make it.” Recalling the subsequent horrifying incident, he adds: “What followed was a distressing encounter with the patient’s attendants who came in howling, blaming me for the death! They had to be calmed down. But in the very next moment I had to rush to another patient who had started gasping, and I couldn’t save her either. I remember crying in my suit at that very moment... What people don’t realise often is that we (doctors, nursing staff, ward boys and other healthcare workers) are also emotional beings, who are somehow getting up every day with positivity, risking their own lives, and dragging their bodily limits until it reaches the brim of tolerance.”“They make it seem like we are in the midst of a war and that we are the ones who can help save lives and then suddenly the narrative takes a heartbreaking turn and we are the villains!” states Dr Diksha, who works in Respiratory Medicine at Safdarjung Hospital. She feels that young Covid warriors need a proper redressal for their concerns and the masses in general need to be sympathetic to the cause of the doctors who are burning the midnight oil to serve the patients even now when the situation seems quite ‘normal’. “It’s a vicious loop. The relatives get agitated when a doctor doesn’t respond to their queries, and the doctor is hesitant because of the incidents happening around, which could make him or her end up with the same fate as their peers. The doctors are unable to dispel even half of the rumours that are abuzz in the public domain because we cannot drag you from your homes to give a treatment; the patients have to come and seek it! We cannot run around telling people that we aren’t the villains of their story. Actually, we are at the lowest step of the hierarchy of people who are making all the decisions, yet we are bearing the brunt of it all,” she adds.The Capital has started to breathe easy due to the respite from the scary second wave that jolted most. But, the young doctors in the Capital, many of who started their careers with intensive Covid-19 duties, confess that they are feeling exhausted, overburdened, and continue to work in fear of being attacked whenever things go wrong. Overcoming the grief and chaos, these young medics are also struggling to deal with the anxiety of an impending third wave. “It’s so disheartening to see the morale in the hospitals. We are doing 36 hour shifts! There is stress, pain and concern all around yet doctors have continued to serve even while dealing with their personal losses, non-payment of salaries at various hospitals, and not to forget the strenuously long working hours,” says Dr Noopur Gupta, a post graduate resident in ENT at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. She informs how treating cases of mucormycosis or black fungus turned their work into a war scale fight, and adds, “When we had started out, we were showered with praises. But soon after we had to face the scorn of people whose family members could not be saved. We are young, we are working harder than we possibly can, and doing all this only to see our patients recover. But now, we need to address the stress that the medical professionals are reeling under, and not be casual about it, else a third wave wouldn’t be far behind!” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/young-medics-in-the-pandemic-exhausted-overburdened-and-fearful-101625559381863.html

Transporters associations have demanded the increase saying it is needed to cope up with the losses because of the rising fuel prices.

06-07-2021||Delhi||Want to feel normal again: Denizens queue up @restaurants||In the current stage of unlock, one thing seems to bind the residents of Delhi-NCR, and that is food served at the restaurant! Many are heading back to their favourite eateries, rather than opting for home delivery, so as to treat themselves some yummy delicacies alongside enjoying an outdoor experience. Despite the scorching heat, they don’t seem to mind waiting in queues, to get a table at their preferred food joint, where they have missed going during the recent lockdown. Be it Khan Market, Connaught Place or CyberHub, the view is the same almost everywhere. And. the management of these places are leaving no stone unturned to make it a safe outing for their patrons.Lohit Bharadwaj, an IT professional, didn’t mind Delhi’s searing heat to try hi favourite cuisine. He says: “The food at some places in CP is amazing, and that’s why I don’t mind waiting for it. It’s very hot and it’s indeed tough to wait, but since the food will be rewarding, I’m only thinking about it. One of my favourite restaurants is here, and I was waiting to try the variety they serve.”Manjari Purwar, a dietician and nutritionist, adds: “We had been waiting to come here, and we are surely going to enjoy our meal... It has been a tough time for all of us. Everyone is adjusting to the new normal, but it’s very boring to be at home all the time. The government is taking good precautions and we’re feeling more confident in stepping out now.”Feeling refreshed at the sight of his fave place, Ashish Roy, a banker from Malviya Nagar, says: “We want to feel like things are normal again which is why we came here today. We are happy and are already feeling refreshed. We know that the restaurants are taking precautions. We love the food here and we are so thrilled to be back.”Shipra Tomar, a fashion student from Ghaziabad was eagerly waiting to revisit her favourite restaurant. And the wish was fulfilled. “Waiting time here in Khan is more than an hour! Yet, we’ve been waiting eagerly at one of our favourite restaurants; we checked its other branch in Saket and there too, there was a waiting of 90 minutes. Ab toh yahin wait karenge, and will go in for lunch,” she says. Aurindam Mukherjee, a digital advertising professional, who ventured out after a really long time with his wife at CyberHub, says: “We went out after February 2020 on a Sunday. Although we did go out in September but that was an outdoor cafe and we were absolutely paranoid. This time around, after getting our first vaccine and ensuring to be home for three weeks for antibodies to be developed, we figured it was time to be less anxious and go out and do the things we loved. In a couple of restaurants we went to, the seating was occupied at 50% and though the staff were regularly sanitizing their hands, and were fully masked, some of the restaurants we didn’t go to were completely packed with families waiting to get inside.”Megha Bhowmik, a digital marketing executive, who too went out after four months, says: “We have our masks matching with our dresses. This is the new normal! And accepting to start living with it, we’ve come to our fave joint in CyberHub. I feel here in Gurugram, it’s quite safe.” Echoing similar sentiments, Gurugram-based CA Aman Gupta, was thrilled to be back with friends. He adds: “We were planning to meet since long time. But due to Covid-19 situation, we weren’t able to. The sanitation process at Cyber Hub was really good. I am feeling relaxed after a long time, thanks to this outing.”Sarthak, a Noida-based Banker, had a tough time looking for a place to eat at CyberHub, and was unable to find a table around 8:30pm. “Hume table hi nahin mil rahi. Dhoondh rahe hain bahut der se, because 50% capacity hi allowed hai sab restaurants mein yahan CyberHub mein. But if that’s how everything is to be conducted, to follow all social distancing norms, then why not; it’s Ok to wait. We’ve to come out a little bit,” he shares.

06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Dalai Lama turns 86 amid low-key celebrations during pandemic||Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama turned 86 on Tuesday amid low-key celebrations in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The kashag (cabinet) of the Tibetan government-in-exile in McLeodganj held a small celebration at its headquarters, while all monasteries and settlements were directed to avoid congregations and instead mark the day by offering mandala and white scarves to the spiritual leader’s portrait. Also read: Dalai Lama’s birthday: Facts about the Tibetan spiritual leaderThe Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was born at Taktser, a hamlet in Tibet’s Amdo province’s Kumbum region on this day in 1935 as Lhamo Dhondub. He was recognised as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama at the age of two. The Chinese invasion and subsequent circumstances compelled the then 16-year-old to shoulder the spiritual and temporal leadership of Tibet in 1950. Six decades ago, he escaped to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. He spent a year in Mussoorie before shifting to McLeodganj. Expresses gratitude for love, respect and trust In a video message on his birthday, the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner described himself as just another human being who wants to express “deep appreciation and thanks to the people who have shown me love, respect and trust”. “In spite of my old age, my face is quite handsome and many people show genuine friendship. Some say they love my smile,” he said, chuckling. The spiritual leader said that he would remain committed to serving humanity and protecting the environment. Appreciates India’s secular values He said since he became a refugee and settled down in India, he has valued the freedom and religious harmony in India. “I appreciate India’s concept of secular values, not dependent on religion but honesty, karuna (compassion) and ahimsa (non-violence),” said the Dalai Lama. I am committed to these principles till my death, he said, and it would be a birthday gift for me, if all friends, brothers and sisters also commit themselves to these values. Can reorient Sino-Tibetan history: Kashag The kashag paid tributes to the spiritual leader, describing him as the founder of nascent Tibetan democracy-in-exile and for his efforts for the peaceful resolution of the Tibet issue. “The Dalai Lama is one of the foremost guides of our time and is one of the few individuals who can reorient Sino-Tibetan history in a positive direction,” the kashag said in a statement. It said the Chinese government should, therefore, recognise that he is the key to resolving the Sino-Tibetan conflict. “It should use this opportunity offered by taking the mutually beneficial middle path to foster a harmonious environment where Tibetans and Chinese can co-exist amicably,” it said. We appeal to the Chinese government to invite the Dalai Lama to Tibet and China on pilgrimage without any preconditions, the kashag said. The Dalai Lama has expressed his wish to return to Tibet and visit the sacred Buddhist sites in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dalai-lama-turns-86-amid-low-key-celebrations-during-pandemic-101625550854015.html

However, lockdown restrictions are yet to be eased for pubs, schools and cinema theatres and according to the government, these will take some time to open.Following the lifting of lockdown, markets are brimming with people. The Yeshwantpur regulated market has come back to its usual hustle. Stocks of vegetables, staples, fruits and many other essentials are traded mostly during the day on Mondays and in the early morning on Tuesdays. The Krishnaraja Market, Russel Market and Johnson Market are operating to their fullest extent.After the temples opened their doors to devotees, shops dealing in flowers and few other things have also reopened. Public offices opened fully with 100 per cent attendance. However, those officials who were found to be positive were allowed to continue working from home or even given full leave of absence.Since it was the first day in the last three months when traffic opened fully, many cities in the state experienced traffic jams. Many places in Bengaluru, including K R Market, Chamarajapet, Kalasipalayam witnessed traffic snarls. Roads of Mangaluru, Mysuru and Belagavi were also teeming with motorists.However, experts are wary of the emerging situation and have conveyed their warnings to the government. They fear that over-enthusiasm and complacency among people after lockdown might give rise to the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. People were found to be going about their daily work without wearing masks or maintaining social distance.City bus service in Mangaluru was seen carrying people at full capacity of the vehicles, with no regard to Covid appropriate behaviour or safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-gets-back-to-normal-as-lockdown-lifted-101625550156455.html

Singh has been asked to report to the police headquarters in Raipur.The three-day searches were conducted at around 15 locations linked to Singh, an additional director general-rank officer, from July 1 to July 3. Singh allegedly owns movable and immovable assets worth over ₹10 crore.Also Read | State not suffering, says C’garh health minister amid reports of rift with CM“After a preliminary probe into complaints against Singh for allegedly amassing disproportionate assets during his service period, the EOW registered a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act. He seems to be involved in activities that are not expected from a government official. Singh’s alleged act is against the All-India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968. Therefore, disciplinary action should be taken against him,” said the suspension order issued on Monday.The ACB on July 3 said the documents seized during searches at Singh’s premises established he allegedly amassed assets disproportionate to his known source of income and indulged in “a massive exchange of money”.“Singh also allegedly tried to commit money laundering by investing in shell companies,” the ACB said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/top-police-officer-suspended-in-chhattisgarh-over-alleged-disproportionate-assets-101625547073879.html
06-07-2021||Lucknow||BJP sets sight on UP block pramukh polls this weekend||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh has relaxed some of its rules for party members for the block pramukh polls scheduled for this weekend.The July 10 elections are the last of the rural polls before the 2022 UP assembly elections, and the candidates have to be nominated by July 8. “We are a party that is always poll-ready,” said UP BJP general secretary JPS Rathore who was in charge of zila panchayat polls that the party swept recently, and is also entrusted with block pramukh elections. Like the zila panchayat chairpersons’ poll, in which BJP won 67 of the total 75 seats [including one seat won by its ally Apna Dal], these polls too won’t have a direct public participation as elected block development council (BDC) members will elect the block pramukh. There are 58,000 gram panchayats in UP and each block comprises roughly 70 gram panchayats, an official said. Nearly 77,000 BDC members would vote for 825 of the 826 block pramukhs (block chairpersons) coming Saturday. The election for the pramukh’s post in Mujhena block in Gonda district will not be held yet, as more than six months are left for the tenure to get completed there. For these elections, the BJP has decided to let party lawmakers or their families contest block pramukh polls. During the zila panchayat elections, party functionaries were allowed to contest only after quitting party posts. “There is no bar on candidates anymore. If an MLA wants to project their family for block pramukh polls, we will not have a problem. However, preference would be first given to party cadres,” Rathore said. In the recently concluded zila panchayat chairpersons’ polls, Opposition parties had alleged massive malpractices and misuse of official machinery, a charge that the BJP rejected. “These block pramukh polls have their importance in an election year for political parties. Riding on its recent success in zila panchayat chairperson polls, the BJP would surely look to continue to expand its rural imprint. The Opposition Samajwadi Party, which did well in elections for the zila panchayat ward members, would also look to make an impression,” said Professor Manuka Khanna, head of the political science department of Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-sets-sight-on-up-block-pramukh-polls-this-weekend-101625546173864.html

06-07-2021||Patna||Pvt centres in Bihar concerned about charging for Covid vaccine while govt jabs free||Private healthcare facilities are shying away from participating in the government’s Covid-19 vaccination drive in the absence of clarity on the return of unused vaccine vials. Meanwhile, the government wants private players to buy the vaccines and charge a fee from beneficiaries, while administering the doses free of cost at its own centres. Amid uncertainty of footfall and no return policy, most private hospitals are now cagey about blocking their money by paying upfront for bulk order of vaccines. “We have placed an initial order for limited 50 doses or five vials of Covishield because we are not sure about their consumption, given the fact that the jabs are free at government centres while private centres like ours will charge fee from the beneficiaries who come for inoculation,” said Dr Shaswat Kumar, medical director of the Medipark Healthcare Pvt Ltd in New Patliputra Colony, Patna. Also Read | No clinical trial of Covaxin on children as of now: BMC“We had inoculated around 10,000 beneficiaries between February and April when the government was supplying us the vaccines free of cost. Later, it changed the policy (on May 1), and made the vaccines chargeable at private centres. Enquiries for vaccination at our facility have reduced since then,” added Dr Kumar. The Netaji Subhash Medical College Hospital (NSMCH) at Bihta had also ordered only 50 doses of Covishield on a trial basis. “We ordered a small quantity of vaccines because of some confusion as the government authorities told us that the indent required to be placed was only for the last four days of June. The supply is already delayed. We are ready to place fresh orders of over 500 doses for July. We will, however, appreciate if the government comes out with a return policy for unused vials of vaccine, which otherwise dissuades us from placing bulk orders,” said Dr Uday Kumar, medical superintendent of the NSMCH and former principal of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, an autonomous institute under the government of Bihar. The Mahavir Vaatsalya hospital and the Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, run by the Mahavir temple trust in Patna, had placed orders for Covishield 100 doses each. The nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination at the Mahavir Vaatsalya hospital Dr Upendra Prasad Sinha was critical of the government frequently changing its policy. “If the government wanted to put a cap on the minimum order for vaccines, it should have told us earlier. Why did they accept our advance payment towards the end of June and come up with fresh guidelines by July 3. Revising our order will lead to further delay in arrival of vaccines. There is no clarity on return of unused vaccine vials either,” said Dr Sinha. The SS Hospital in Patna had placed an order for 10 doses of Covishield, which is just one vial of the vaccine. A senior functionary of the BIG Apollo hospital was critical of the frequent changes in the vaccine policy and the delay on the part of the state government in allotment of coronavirus vaccine centre (CVC) identity number. The hospital has purchased vaccines through its corporate office in Hyderabad and was inoculating people for a fee, which the government had capped at a maximum price per dose of ₹780 for Covishield, ₹1,410 for Covaxin and ₹1,145 for Suptnik V. Manoj Kumar, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, said in light of the revised guidelines, private players seeking a low number of doses will be asked to revise their order. The government, last Saturday, revised the vaccine procurement guidelines for the third time in as many months, specifying the minimum consignment size for dispatch of vaccines. As per the new rules, each private facility, empanelled for vaccination with the state government or the Union territory, has to order minimum 500 doses of Covishield and 160 doses of Covaxin. Similarly, a vaccine consignment has to be of minimum 6,000 doses of Covishield and 2,880 doses of Covaxin for dispatch to the state government, said Kumar. A senior government officer, handling vaccination, said the Central government order was silent on the return policy of unused vaccine vials. Amid uncertainty, only 10 of the 76 private health facilities empanelled with the state government for Covid-19 vaccination had so far paid in advance for cumulative 3,010 doses of vaccines, of which 2,660 doses were Covishield and 350 Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pvt-centres-in-bihar-concerned-about-charging-for-covid-vaccine-while-govt-jabs-free-101625545273592.html

Of the total 31 MLAs in the state, majority are faithful to Hooda.After almost six years, the Haryana Congress is beginning with an organisational reshuffle.“We discussed organisational matters pertaining to the state unit as for many years district unit presidents have not been appointed… political situation in the state in the backdrop of ongoing farmers’ agitation, upcoming panchayat polls… all these issues were discussed,” MLA Kuldeep Vats said while addressing reporters on Monday, according to PTI.Four days back, 19 MLAs from Haryana met the state’s affairs in charge Vivek Bansal in the national capital on July 1, where they sought a strong leadership for the party and also pushed for a key role for Bhupinder Singh Hooda and a greater say in all organisational matters.Post the meeting, Bansal said the MLAs had not met for a long time due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and hence it was decided to take their feedback about the political situation in Haryana and also seek suggestions with regard to Congress’ organisation structure along with the upcoming panchayat elections.On the other hand, a senior Congress leader, who was a part of the July 1 meeting with Vivek Bansal , pointed out the MLAs requested for a change of leadership at the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC)-level in order to strengthen the party.During both these meetings, the MLAs said the Congress has not had any district unit presidents for the last eight years.The fast paced developments in Haryana Congress come at a time when the party is facing infighting in neighbouring Punjab, where senior leader Navjot Singh Sidhu is at loggerheads with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.

The number is an all-time low during a period of decline. A similar weekly infection number (534) was reported in February first week following which the Covid cases had started increasing. Asked for a projection on the possibility of a third wave, state nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary said they will have to keep tabs on trends in other states such as Delhi, Punjab, Kerala and Maharashtra. “We will also have to keep a watch on whether there is an increase in the number of influenza-like-illness (ILI) cases,” he said. The virus curve has been flattening after the havoc caused by the contagion between March end and mid-May. As of Monday, there were 1,113 active cases with about 40% in home isolation. Eighteen districts have less than 100 active cases and fifteen have 50 or less active cases. The four districts with more than 100 active cases are Hisar, Panipat, Gurugram and Sirsa. Data showed the weekly number of fatalities due to viral illness came down to 101 last week.

The third serological survey was planned to determine the prevalence of Covid antibodies in the community and in children aged 6-17 years. Population based surveys of antibody sero-positivity are conducted to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection. When asked about the deferment of the third round of sero survey, the health minister said that he wanted vaccinated individuals to be included in the sero-survey. “We also need to know how many of those vaccinated have formed anti-bodies,” said Vij. Health officials said the minister wanted that anti-spike protein test should also be a part of the serological survey. The number of antibodies, produced in the human body after vaccination, which counter the spike protein of coronavirus can be found out from the spike-protein antibody test, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/weekly-covid-cases-hit-a-five-month-low-in-haryana-44-inoculated-with-first-dose-101625517372140.html

Under some pressure, Singh had generated two posts and appointed two persons with a politically influential background at a handsome salary. What forced the V-C to make these appointments without any prior advertisement at a time when the varsity was closed due to the pandemic situation,” he added.The two high-profile appointments are said to be that of Dilawar Singh, who has been made the chief consultant, hospitality, and Rajveer Singh who was hired as chief consultant, security, on contract basis. It is learnt that Rajveer Singh is a relative of Rohtak MP Arvind Sharma and Dilawar is said to be close to the V-C himself.In a sharp attack on the V-C, Deswal said he had waived off fee to the tune of ₹2.54 crore of students of state university of performing and visuals arts (SUPVA).“The students had paid the exam fee but the authorities of (SUPVA) had not made the payment to MDU. The V-C waived off ₹2.54 crore. It is a big scam. Why did he not waive off ₹11 lakh of students studying at Jat College in Rohtak. He has flouted rules in making the appointments and waiving off this amount,” he added.Responding to Deswal’s charges, MDU vice-chancellor Professor Rajbir Singh said the appointments of chief security and hospitality consultants were made after it was passed in the executive council’s meeting.“Similarly, we had waived off fee to the tune of ₹2.54 crore of students in an EC meeting. All allegations against me are baseless and false.

A proposal containing the names of eight IPS officers has been sent to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for shortlisting three senior-most officers. Officials said the proposal containing the names of the officers who are eligible for empanelment as DGP and sent to UPSC was approved by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Apex court’s directionsAs per the directions of the Supreme Court, the state DGP shall be selected by the state government from amongst the three senior-most officers of the department who have been empaneled for promotion to that rank by the UPSC on the basis of their length of service, very good record and range of experience for heading the police force. “And, once he has been selected for the job, he should have a minimum tenure of at least two years irrespective of his date of superannuation,” the apex court had said in the landmark Prakash Singh judgment of 2006. The SC had in March 2019 clarified that recommendation for appointment to the post of DGP by the UPSC and preparation of panel should be purely on the basis of merit, and of officers who have at least six months of service prior to the retirement. Officers in reckoning for the top police chair Technically, seven officers who have put in 30 years of service are eligible for empanelment. They are 1988-batch officer PK Agrawal, 1989-batch officers Mohammad Akil and RC Mishra, 1990-batch officers Shatrujeet Kapoor and Desh Raj Singh and 1991-batch officers Alok Roy and Sanjeev Kumar Jain. Though the name of the incumbent DGP, Manoj Yadava also figured in the list of eligible officers sent to the UPSC, it’s a mere technicality since he has sought repatriation and has not given his consent for being considered for the job of head of police force.However, the three IPS officers who will make the cut will actually be the top contenders for the job. Officials said that a realistic assessment of the eligible officers indicate that on the basis of their service record, seniority and range of experience only four officers will be actually will be in contention for making it to the UPSC panel of three officers. They are PK Agrawal, Mohammad Akil, RC Mishra and Shatrujeet Kapoor. After shortlisting three names, the UPSC will send the panel to the state government for selecting the next DGP. The state government will have the discretion of picking one officer from the panel and appointing him as the DGP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/next-haryana-police-chief-proposal-with-upsc-to-pick-3-eligible-officers-101625516231652.html

As per vigilance sources, Kumar confessed before the vigilance team that Panipat additional deputy commissioner Vatsal Vashisht and two officers of municipal corporation’s account branch used to take their share from bribe taken in lieu of clearing the pending bills. It is also learnt that Kumar has been given one-year extension after his retirement. The vigilance had arrested Kumar on Thursday night for demanding 10% commission as bribe to clear the pending bills of a private company, IND Sanitation Solutions, which has been given the contract of cleaning roads in Panipat town. “During questioning, Kumar confessed that 4% of the commission went to former Panipat municipal commissioner Vatsal Vashisht, who is posted as Panipat ADC now, and 2% went to auditor Pradeep Punia and senior accounts officer Sunil Dahiya. Kumar himself used to take 2% of the commission amount and the remaining 2% was being distributed among other staff members. The 10% commission was being paid every month to clear the pending bills. All payments were being made through Sudheer Kumar,” officials revealed. Vigilance officials said they will call Panipat ADC Vashisht, Punia and Sunil Dahiya for questioning in the case. Panipat district and sessions court had given anticipatory bail to ADC Vashisht on Friday with directions to appear before the vigilance bureau by July 7 to join the investigation. The ADC had gone for a seven-day leave. The court had also granted bail to Punia and Dahiya against a bond of ₹50,000 each on June 23. Narsingh Ahlawat, deputy superintendent of the vigilance bureau’s Rohtak range who led the raiding team, said the complainant was given the tender to ensure that roads within Panipat’s MC limits were clean. An employee of the company, however, approached the bureau to complain against Kumar. The complainant brought along audio call recordings in which Kumar was purportedly heard demanding a bribe to clear the dues from the accounts branch of Panipat MC. In his complaint to the vigilance bureau, Chankit Dalal, administrative officer, IND Sanitation and Solution Company, said the tender for road sanitisation in Panipat, Rohtak, Bahadurgarh, Sonepat and Panchkula had been awarded to their company. Sudhir reportedly spoke to Krishan Kumar, company director, on his cell phone and demanded 10% commission as bribe in lieu of passing the outstanding bills of ₹1.37 crore and further extending the tender, he said. Panipat ADC Vatsal Vashisht could not be reached for a comment. Activist PP Kapoor said senior accounts officer Sunil Dahiya, whose name has now surfaced in the case, had been transferred from Sonepat to Panipat municipal corporation and he may influence the probe. “Why is Dahiya being transferred to Panipat even though he is facing bribery charges. He may try to distort the evidence. Sudheer Kumar is also under scanner in connection with a project of garbage lifting from outside the houses and involvement of other officials could not be denied,” said Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/graft-case-arrested-mc-official-claims-panipat-adc-two-others-took-their-share-101625515871657.html

In a video message on Monday, Charuni said that after the duo’s expulsion, some facts regarding the usage of funds came to his notice that appeared to be true. “Navdeep refused to appear before the inquiry committee twice while Jai Singh failed to prove the charges were false. But later, the funds use was found to be genuine, so they are now free of the charges. But due to the indiscipline they created in Panchkula, their expulsion will continue,” he said. The duo was dismissed after they had allegedly gone against the union’s plan of action during the governor house gherao on June 26 and got into a brief scuffle with fellow protesters for breaking the police barricades. A top union leader said the father-son duo has been given a month’s time to appear before a five-member discipline committee, comprising Rampal Chahal from Karnal, Azad Palwa from Jind and other leaders. “The fund that was mentioned earlier, amounted to ₹25,000, but now they’ve clarified its usage. However, they have to appear before the other committee on the Panchkula issue if they believe that our decision was wrong,” the leader said. Meanwhile, Navdeep said the fund was collected by activists of the same region to utilise it for campaigning, purchasing milk for Shambhu border or travelling to Singhu border. “It was a volunteer fund of Ambala-1 and 2 blocks, not of jathebandi as claimed. It was used in the interests of the union but some people conspired against us to implicate us, but all allegations were proved to be false,” he said.

06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Captain to meet Sonia in Delhi on Tuesday amid infighting in Punjab Cong unit||Punjab chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh is slated to meet Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday amid efforts by the high command to resolve the factionalism in the party’s state unit ahead of the assembly polls due early next year. Amarinder will leave for Delhi in the morning and call on the Congress president late in the afternoon, people familiar with the matter said. The chief minister was in Delhi twice last month to meet the three-member central panel constituted under Rajya Sabha member Mallikarjun Kharge to look at the crisis in Punjab, but did not get an audience with the Gandhis. He had sought time from the Congress president who has now called him for a discussion, according to sources. The CM’s meeting with Sonia comes days after disgruntled ex-minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, who is at loggerheads with him, met former party president Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Sidhu has been counting on Priyanka and Rahul for support in his standoff with the two-time chief minister. “Tuesday’s meeting is an indication that discussions on resolving the rift in Punjab Congress have entered the phase of final decision-making on how to accommodate Sidhu,” said a senior state leader who did not want to be identified. While Sidhu wants to head the Punjab Congress, the chief minister is opposed to having him in that role. All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge Punjab affairs Harish Rawat had, on June 24, stated that the Congress president would take a decision on the government and organisational set-ups by July 8-10. While Sidhu’s team said he is back in Patiala, his continued attacks on the chief minister and the state government on the ongoing power crisis and power purchase agreements (PPAs) have left some of his party colleagues confounded and some of them are apprehensive about the rift worsening in case there is no quick decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/captain-to-meet-sonia-in-delhi-on-tuesday-amid-infighting-in-punjab-cong-unit-101625515752360.html
06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab runs out of vaccine stock||A few days after inoculating a record 6 lakh people in a day, Punjab has run out of vaccine doses with only a few left for administering the first jab. Only 25,000 shots were administered on Monday due to the shortage and the state is likely to remain out of stock for another 4-5 days as the health department may not get more doses from the Centre before July 9. “Around 1 lakh doses of Covishield are expected on July 9. It may get delayed till July 11 as was communicated by the Centre,” a senior health department official involved in the inoculation drive said. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the state will not be able to run the vaccination drive for next few days as they are out of stock now. “We don’t have the stock to administer the second dose,” he said. On July 3, the state administered over 6 lakh jabs in a day having received 6.75 lakh doses two days before. A senior government official said the strategy behind consuming maximum doses in a day was aimed at conveying to the Centre that the state has the capacity to administer such a large number of jabs and that it was not being given adequate doses. State health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the Centre’s distribution strategy for the opposition-ruled states like Punjab is completely biased. “Earlier, the Centre was accusing us of not administering enough jabs. Now, when we have shown our capacity by vaccinating 6 lakh people in a day, they are not providing us more shots,” said Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-runs-out-of-vaccine-stock-101625515332603.html
06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Cancel PPAs if it ensures cheaper power: Sukhbir Badal to Punjab govt||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday asked the Congress government in Punjab to cancel the power purchase agreements (PPAs) with three private thermal plants if it translates into cheaper electricity for state residents. The SAD chief said the government should provide affordable and 24-hour electricity in the state as was done by the erstwhile dispensation led by their party instead of politicising the issue of fixed charges paid to thermal plants to cover up mismanagement. Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, he said, “Punjabis want cheap power. If that’s possible by cancelling the PPAs with three private thermal plants then do it. But chief minister Amarinder Singh should take the responsibility of covering the shortfall of 4,500 megawatt (MW) power at cheaper rates so that Punjab residents do not suffer due to this.”The SAD chief said the issue of fixed charges was being politicised by both the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) even as they know the truth that this cost is applicable on private and government thermal plants as well as power purchased from outside the state. “The Congress government is playing politics on the issue of setting up of private thermal plants which came up after much thought due to huge power shortfall in 2007. This shortfall occurred because the then Congress government (2002-07) led by Amarinder Singh did not add a single megawatt power to the state kitty. The SAD government took the decision to make Punjab power surplus and followed a standard PPA document created by the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government at the Centre to establish captive thermal plants in the private sector,” he added. The PPAs were signed to purchase electricity between ₹2.86 and ₹2.89 per unit, the cheapest at the time, he claimed. “The erstwhile SAD government spent ₹5,000 crore on upgrading the transmission and distribution network,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cancel-ppas-if-it-ensures-cheaper-power-sukhbir-badal-to-punjab-govt-101625515331591.html
06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Kejriwal making false promises on free power: Amarinder||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday slammed Arvind Kejriwal for making “false promises” on free power in the state with an eye on the 2022 assembly polls. “The Kejriwal government has completely failed the people of Delhi on all counts, with no free power to the farmers in the villages located in the national capital and excessively high power tariffs for the industry,” said Amarinder.The people of Punjab have already rejected the Delhi model of governance, he claimed. Last week, Kejriwal had announced to provide 300 free electricity units to each household if the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) forms government in Punjab in 2022. “Delhi is charging ₹9.80 per unit for industrial power and the Punjab government is levying a subsidized tariff of ₹5 per unit to attract industry in the state which has received more than ₹85,000 crore investment in the last four years,” Amarinder said.In a sharp contrast, the CM said, the Punjab government is giving free power worth ₹6,735 crore to 13.79 lakh farmers while the AAP regime in Delhi has made no effort to support to the agricultural community. “The Delhi government is befooling people by offering 200 free power units for domestic consumers and taking away even higher amount by charging high tariffs on shopkeepers, industry and farmers for commercial and agriculture power,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kejriwal-making-false-promises-on-free-power-amarinder-101625515271572.html

Why he waited till the next elections to raise this issue. He is just doing politics to defame the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are hand in glove and they just want to defame the party of Punjabis to take the control of the state,” she added. “The entire Punjab has taken to the streets. There is chaos for electricity. Forget about setting up new plants, they have closed down the existing ones. The industry is closed for two days and timings of government offices have been reduced. The farmers are the worst-hit as they are not getting electricity for irrigation,” the Akali MP said. “The government departments had electricity bill dues to the tune of ₹2,200 crore. If the common man doesn’t pay bills their connections are snapped but nothing is done when government’s own departments and MLA are not paying bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-should-have-cleared-power-mess-by-accepting-ministry-instead-of-giving-suggestions-harsimrat-101625515213761.html

Different types of vehicles were being purchased for officers appointed after retirement to statutory, non-statutory, constitutional bodies, commissions, authorities etc in the absence of any specific provision regarding entitlement of staff car, according to a July 2 order of the government. Officials said issuing new instructions had become imperative as the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP government was often grappling with this issue of post-retirement entitlement of staff car for retired officers appointed as chairpersons or members. “After careful consideration, the state government has now decided that whenever any government officer (including an All-India Service officer) after retirement is re-employed/appointed...under Haryana government, he/she will be entitled to a staff car the cost of which will be up to 10 times the last basic pay drawn by the officer. This condition will be subject to a ₹20 lakh ceiling, excluding taxes,” the government has said in a communiqué to the administrative secretaries, heads of departments, divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners. In case the officer re-employed after superannuation doesn’t want to avail the facility of staff car and opt for a private vehicle (with own driver) to undertake official duty at the headquarters and outside the headquarters, the government will pay road mileage allowance @ ₹18/per km up to 5,000 kms in a month. The journey beyond 5,000 kms in a month will be treated as private. Haryana government has been offering plum posts to retired officers as has been the practice during earlier governments too.In April, the government had appointed former IAS officer Navraj Sandhu (1984-batch) as the chairperson of the police complaint authority, and Kameshwar Kumar Mishra, IPS (retd), and Ramesh Chand Verma, IAS (retd), as members. The chairperson and members of the police complaint authority hold the posts for three years from the date of joining. Last month, TC Gupta was appointed as chief commissioner of Right to Service Commission within weeks after he superannuated from the IAS. Earlier, the government had appointed former IAS officer Dhanpat Singh as the state election commissioner (SEC) and former chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora, as chairperson of Haryana Water Resources Authority. All the officers given post-retirement assignments in these statutory, non-statutory, constitutional bodies, commissions, authorities etc are entitled for perks including staff car, bungalow and service of a battery of personal staff such as peon and clerk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-sets-20-lakh-limit-to-buy-staff-car-for-babus-re-employed-after-retirement-101625515212756.html

The accused has been identified as Sandeep Bhardwaj.The complainant, Kuldeep Singh of Azad Nagar, said he had come in contact with the accused in 2018. “Sandeep claimed that he had links in the Haryana Police department and can help his son in securing a job,” he told the police. Kuldeep added that he had paid the total amount to the accused in instalments, but to no avail. “In 2020, when I asked the accused to return my money, the accused issued a cheque of ₹20.3 lakh to me, which was dishonoured by the bank due to insufficient funds. Later, the accused started threatening me,” he said.

The Division Number 1 police initiated an investigation after reaching the spot. At the time of the incident, the CCTVs installed in the bank were not functioning.Lalita, 44, of Chhawani Mohalla and her daughter Ritika, 18, said they had bought a house in the same locality. “To buy the house, we had borrowed some money from our relatives.

06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Inmates tweak Ludhiana Central Jail’s security, officials clueless about smuggling channel||Despite claims of tight security inside the Ludhiana Central Jail, inmates manage to smuggle mobile phones and other contraband easily. This could be gauged by the fact that at least 300 mobile phones have been seized from the central jail in the past three years. In such cases, police do not get custody of the accused for questioning, due to which the secret of sneaking in a mobile phone inside the prison remains a mystery for the cops as well as jail officials.Officials claim that the inmates manage to smuggle mobile phones through their accomplices, who simply fling these items over the compound walls of the prison. As per the jail officials, they conduct surprise checks frequently. They also claimed to have increased patrolling outside the compound wall to curb the menace. According to the police, in case of recovery of mobile phones or any other contraband, they register an FIR under the Prisons Act, which is a bailable offence. They do not get custody of the inmates for questioning, so they fail to get to know from where and how contraband is smuggled inside the jail.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP) (East) Davinder Chaudhary said SIM cards used in mobile phones recovered from the jail are mostly procured on fake identity documents. “When we questioned the people who talked to the inmates over phone, they made excuses that they were not aware that the caller was lodged in the jail,” he added. He said to investigate the matter thoroughly, the police need to secure custody of such inmates. “When we do not get their custody, investigation in most of the cases remains affected,” he added. It has been learnt that a local court had turned down the police’s request for the remand of six inmates who were booked for partying, enjoying booze and hookah in the prison. Balkar Singh, superintendent of Ludhiana Central Jail, said most of the mobile phones and contraband are thrown inside from the outside. “We are highly alert and recovering contraband on a daily basis. We have also increased vigil outside and inside the jail,” he added. It is pertinent to mention here that a nexus between jail officials and prisoners had surfaced with the arrest of three jail officials – including two head warders Makhan Singh and Ravinder Singh and nurse Sachin Kumar – who had helped in smuggling contraband inside the Ludhiana Central Jail. Sunday night seizureMeanwhile, six mobile phones and as many sachets of tobacco were recovered from six jail inmates on Sunday night during a special checking. Assistant jail superintendent Kashmiri Lal lodged a complaint stating that items were recovered from Jagdev Singh, Manoj Kumar, Jasvir Singh, Jaskaran Singh, Sunny Kumar and Gurjant Singh.ASI Karnail Singh, who is investigating the case, said police will bring the accused on a production warrant for questioning to ascertain how did they manage to get mobile phones inside the prison.A case has been registered under Sections 52 A (1), 42 and 45 of the Prisons Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/inmates-tweak-ludhiana-central-jail-s-security-officials-clueless-about-smuggling-channel-101625515091544.html
06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab to phase out open plinths being used for storing grains||The covered area plinths (CAPs), also called open plinths, for storage of food grain in Punjab will be phased out gradually. The state’s food and civil supplies department has given a roadmap of three years in a proposal sent to the Centre. Food grains stored in the open plinths are vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and most of the grain damaged in the past was from open plinths. The cost of damaged grain runs into crores of rupees. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) that regulates public distribution system in the country has asked the state to phase out open storage and come up with a proposal. “We have proposed to build covered godowns to store 63 lakh tonnes of grain. As per the roadmap suggested by us, in the first year(2022-23), storage capacity of 16 lakh tonne (25%) will be built, and for next two years, 22 lakh tonne (35%) and 25 lakh tonne (40%) will be added,” said an officer of the state food department. At present, the entire open storage (plinths) capacity is 95 lakh tonne in which around 92 lakh tonne wheat is stored and the rice is stored in covered godowns. Department officials revealed that 60 locations have been identified for building covered godowns and most of them will be where the open plinths existed. A storage capacity of 19 lakh tonne in silos has also been sanctioned in the state for which a separate proposal is being rolled out. As 45% of the total (640 lakh tonne) food grain stocks in the country is stored in Punjab (around 300 lakh tonne) and there is no space in the state godowns to store more, the state government has asked the Centre to increase the grain movement. According to FCI, the average daily movement from the state is 35 rakes which earlier were 15 rakes. According to director of state’s food and civil supplies department, Ravi Bhagat, discussions are on to have 2 lakh tonne capacity in each godown. “The private players who have shown willingness to build covered storage spaces want a guarantee on minimum storage, time frame and rent offered. Once these issues are sorted, the things will be smoothly done,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-phase-out-open-plinths-being-used-for-storing-grains-101625515034628.html

The team was deployed in the vicinity from Sunday evening and after getting confirmation that Khan is present in the locality he was intercepted in the wee hours on Monday,” said an NCB officer. He was then brought to the NCB office.Apart from the drug factory case, Khan was also involved in another case where a lady trafficker, Iqra Qureshi, was arrested along with a commercial quantity of Mephedrone in Mumbai. Khan and Pathan are cousins and are relatives of late gangster Abdul Karim Sher Khan alias Karim Lala.Meanwhile, NCB on Sunday intercepted two persons on Mohammed Ali Road and allegedly seized 57 gms of MD from them. The arrested have been identified as Mohammed Asif Iqbal Shaikh, a resident of Mohammad Ali Road, and Pranav Shah, a Borivli resident.The accused were going to deliver the contraband material to local customers when they were arrested by the agency.

The police, who questioned him for almost a day, were shocked to learn that the boy was actually a girl in disguise. The girl had run away from her home in Pune eight months ago to work in Mumbai and landed in Bhiwandi. When she failed to get a job and was forced to stay on streets, she cut her hair and dressed as a boy for self-protection, said the police, adding that the girl also changed her name to Samir Shaikh and started doing odd jobs. After hearing her story, the police reunited the girl with her family on Monday. The girl stayed in Mumbai till she was 10 years old, after which her family shifted to Hadapsar, Pune. She said she did not like Pune and left home to work in Mumbai. She only had ₹1,000 as her savings after doing odd jobs with her parents. Her father works as a plumber while her mother does odd jobs.According to the police, the girl first went to Dadar by train and looked for a job. She did not find any job and went to Bhiwandi. Senior inspector Sheetal Raut of Shanti Nagar police station said, “After wandering for days, she landed in Bhiwandi and met a group of homeless people who suggested that she change her attire and live as a boy so that nobody takes advantage of her. She also changed her name and started living on streets. Few social workers and residents realised the person is new in the area and offered help, but she refused to speak to anyone.” Some of them informed the patrolling officer about it, who took the teen for questioning to the police station. Raut said, “During questioning, we came to know that she is a girl, though she refused to give any more details to us apart from some basic information. Our officers contacted Pune Police and found her name in the missing complaints and made a video call to her mother. She broke down while talking to her mother and agreed to go home.” The officers got the girl new clothes and took her to her house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/15yearold-girl-stays-in-bhiwandi-as-boy-after-leaving-pune-home-101625514970938.html

She approached the police on May 19 this year to complain about several objectionable videos and pictures of her that were circulated on social media through multiple accounts. The police said that the victim was in a panic as she had never posed for any of the pictures or videos, and the repeated emergence of such content on Facebook and Instagram was causing problems in her married life.The police registered a case against unknown persons and started investigating the matter. Details of all the pictures and videos were collected and, with the help of the Thane Police cyber cell, the Ambernath police sought Internet Protocol addresses and other data from Facebook and Instagram. The data, which was received after several days, included a cell phone number, and the police then obtained Call Detail Record and registration details of the number. “Based on these inquiries, we picked up the accused, identified as Maqsood Ali Khan, 28, a hardware engineer by profession. We examined his cell phone and found four Facebook accounts as well as three Instagram accounts that he was using to upload the objectionable content. His phone also had apps that generate nude photos and videos on the basis of normal photographs of the victim,” senior inspector Sanjay Dhumal, Ambernath police station, said.Dhumal added that Khan had been committing the offence for the past 10 months. “Khan and the victim had studied together till junior college and he had proposed to her.

A provision of ₹1,150 crore was also made for implementing Hybrid Annuity scheme to develop roads and bridges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-assembly-state-seeks-additional-23-149-crore-101625514791550.html
06-07-2021||Other||747 MLD of untreated sewage let out into rivers||A total of 747 megalitres of untreated sewage is released into four rivers in Mumbai each day, a civil appeal petition filed by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) in the Supreme Court (SC) stated. These include the Mithi River, which receives the highest quantum of dry weather flow (DWF) at 285 megalitres per day (MLD), followed by Poisar river (67MLD), Dahisar river (56MLD) and Oshiwara river (17MLD). One megalitre is 1 million litres.BMC officials said tenders for infra works, which will divert sewage away from these water bodies and into the municipal treatment and disposal systems, are close to being awarded. Broadly, they involve laying down new sewer lines, building retaining walls, constructing small capacity sewage treatment plants and installing drainage interceptors at strategic locations. However, the commissioning of these works is still some time away. “As per National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) instructions, we have floated the tenders. Financial packages have also been opened, and we’re in the final process of awarding the work to contractors. But the work, undertaken as part of the municipal sewerage improvement programme, is expected to complete only in three-four years,” said additional civic commissioner P Velrasu.A review of MCGM’s submission to SC (challenging NGT’s order from last October order to penalise the civic body for repeatedly polluting city’s rivers, creeks and drains), however, reveals that the planned interventions may not be sufficient to fix the problem. “On completion of the river rejuvenation works, major DWF of 426 MLD will be diverted into the existing municipal sewer lines/STPs,” stated MCGM’s petition (a copy of which is with HT). This still leaves nearly 321MLD, for which MCGM does not seem to have a clear action plan, as per documents. “This is a glaring problem which MCGM has not even acknowledged before SC,” said Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti, whose petition in NGT led to its October order. Velrasu said, “We’ll aim to divert as much untreated sewage as possible, as well as reduce the quantum of DWF being generated.”Meanwhile, MCGM has proposed to carry out a range of infra works along the Mithi River in four packages. In package one – which runs from Filter Pada to the WSSD Garage in Tilak Nagar – an 8MLD STP is being built for the treatment of wastewater to meet revised effluent standards, as prescribed by NGT. “The work commenced from 27.11.2018 and was likely to be completed within the period of 24 months. However, due to the present pandemic, the same is delayed... Due to the revision of the effluent norms the project extended further by 14 months and is scheduled to be completed by 31.12.2021,” the MCGM has told the apex court. Fresh sewer lines, 1.65kms in length, are also being built to channel DWF to the upcoming STP. Also, the construction of... 24 MLD Influent pumping station is in progress. The physical progress of work is till date 70% (sic),” stated MCGM’s civil appeal.In package two (from WSSD garage to CTS Bridge) works are further divided into four different tenders. They include building an 8-km sewer, installing 102 drainage interceptors, building a retaining wall of about 3km and a service road of about 9km. Though the work order for these has been issued, MCGM has not specified the degrees of progress achieved as on date. “Time period for package-2 works is 24 months (excluding monsoon months),” the corporation has submitted.Work on packages three and four are yet to commence. Package three (from CTS Bridge to Mahim Causeway and Vakola nullah) involve construction of fresh sewers (8km), retaining wall (also 8km) and service roads (7km), in addition to installation of more drainage interceptors, gate pumps, sewage pumping stations, and beautification of the riverfront. It is unclear whether tenders for the works have been awarded. The specified time period for this work is at least 36 months.Package four comprises construction of a 6.5-km tunnel to divert 168MLD of intercepted DWF (from Bapat and Safed Pool nullahs) to a proposed STP at Dharavi, which will be commissioned only in 2026. Tenders are invited. The contract period for the work is four years from date of award. Similar interventions have been proposed along the Poisar, Dahisar and Oshiwara rivers. In all, about 17.5km of fresh sewer lines, 16.5km of stormwater drains, 16 drainage interceptors and 17 small capacity sewage treatment plants will be built over the next four years. Key locations for installation of STPs include Sukurwadi and Indira Nagar along Dahisar river; Kranti Nagar, Gokul Nagar, Durga Nagar, Poisar Subway and Sanjay Nagar along Poisar river; and area near Hindu cemetery in Aarey Colony, which is aimed at tackling a significant quantity of wastewater that is discharged from the dairy industry there.The corporation has received 10 bids from contractors. BMC’s tendering process, their civil appeal shows, has been considerably delayed due to the pandemic. Tenders that were invited last April and May are yet to be awarded for works on the three smaller rivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/747-mld-of-untreated-sewage-let-out-into-rivers-101625514790933.html
06-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Assembly: 2 resolutions to seek Central help on quotas||Amid the struck down reservations to Marathas in jobs and education and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in local body elections, the state moved two resolutions on Monday seeking Centre’s intervention. The government has asked for empirical data of OBCs for restoration of political reservation and also demanded constitutional amendment by the Centre to remove the reservation cap of 50% put by the Indra Sawhney ruling. A resolution was passed in both the houses of the legislature demanding the Centre should relax the 50% ceiling in reservation by moving constitutional amendment. While quashing the reservation for Marathas on May 5, the five-judge bench had cited three reasons, one being the 50% cap on the reservation. It was also struck down as the state had lost its power to give reservation after 102nd amendment and raised questions over the Gaikwad commission which ratified the backwardness of the community. A review petition filed by the Centre challenging the verdict over rights of the states was also dismissed by the SC last Thursday. “Even if the states got the powers, (if Centre took such constitutional steps) we would not be able to give reservation until there is a cap on it,” said public works department minister Ashok Chavan.Chavan, who also heads the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, said the BJP had tried to create confusion among people by levelling baseless allegations over the powers after 102nd amendment. The resolution was passed in the absence of the members from opposition benches as the opposition had boycotted the proceedings of the house. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the state’s attempt is to shrug its responsibility. “The committee of retired high court judge appointed by the state has recommended the government should constitute Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes and collect data to establish the backwardness of the community. Instead, the state is demanding removal of the ceiling,” he said. Earlier in the day, a resolution was passed unanimously seeking empirical data by the Centre, collected under Socio Economic Caste Census 2011, for restoration of political reservation to OBCs. In the resolution moved by food and civil supplies minister and OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal, the state has stated the empirical data, as pressed for by the Supreme Court, is with the Centre. “The SC in K Krishnamurthy case has clearly stated that the empirical data needs to be collated by constituting MSCBC,” he said. Fadnavis said the Centre did not share the SECC data because it had more 80 million errors, of which 6.9 million errors were from Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-assembly-2-resolutions-to-seek-central-help-on-quotas-101625514731462.html

No one was injured in the incident,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway (CR). Due to the incident, four trains suffered detention on the down line and three on the up line.“The gas tanker was fully-loaded, and while it on its way to Mumbai, it lost control due to technical issues and entered the tracks,” said VD Shardul, senior inspector of Government Railway Police (GRP), Kalyan. With the help of cranes, the tanker was removed from the tracks and services towards Kasara resumed at 9.10pm, while trains towards Kalyan started operating at 9.30pm. As per CR, a major mishap was averted due to the alertness of track maintainer Dilip Narayan Wagh, 30, who reported this incident to control room through the senior section engineer and train services were immediately halted.A case has been registered against the truck driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/local-trains-on-kalyan-kasara-route-hit-after-gas-tanker-reaches-tracks-101625514730858.html
06-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Assembly: 12 BJP MLAs suspended for a year||Amid high-voltage drama in the Maharashtra legislature, 12 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators were suspended for a year over alleged abusive language used against the presiding officer, Bhaskar Jadhav, and misconduct in the state Assembly. The BJP denied the allegations and said the action was taken with an intention to reduce the party’s strength on the floor of the assembly. The suspended legislators are Ashish Shelar, Girish Mahajan, Atul Bhatkhalkar, Yogesh Sagar, Parag Alavani, Sanjay Kute, Harish Pimple, Ram Satpute, Jaykumar Gore, Bunty Bhangdiya, Abhimanyu Pawar and Narayan Kuche. They won’t be able to enter the legislature premises during suspension. State parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab moved the proposal, which was passed through a voice vote by the ruling parties with a comfortable majority. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis admitted to use of objectionable language against the presiding officer, but denied use of abusive language. He said they have apologised to Jadhav for the unruly behaviour. He alleged the ruling parties have used the incident to reduce the number of opposition legislators in the state Assembly. Both the ruling and opposition benches were involved in a heated argument on Monday after a resolution was moved to seek empirical data from the Centre to provide political reservation to Other Backward Classes (OBC) in local body elections. Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the Centre had conducted Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) and the OBC reservation issue would be resolved, if the Centre provided it to the state. He also said the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis government too tried but failed to acquire the data. Fadnavis said the resolution is unlikely to give desired results as the Supreme Court in its order specifically mentioned collecting empirical data and the state was wasting time. The resolution was passed in the pandemonium following which a few Opposition legislators reached up to the chair of the speaker and tried to snatch the mike and the mace. Jadhav was presiding over the House proceedings. Later, the BJP legislators reportedly used abusive language against the presiding officer in the speaker’s cabin. Jadhav said, “I have never seen such behaviour of legislators in my legislative career of 36 years. The BJP legislators tried to corner me and used abusive language in the cabin. I requested Fadnavis, who was also present in the cabin, to ask their legislators to calm down but he refused.” “Some of our legislators used objectionable language, but no one abused the presiding officer. The brawl started after Sena legislators reached the cabin. There could have been a scuffle had I not intervened. I even apologised to Jadhav for the misconduct. Despite that, the ruling parties passed the resolution to reduce the number of opposition MLAs,” Fadnavis said in the lower House. “It was Bhaskar Jadhav who used objectionable language in the deputy speaker’s cabin,” he told reporters. In the evening, all suspended legislators met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and requested him to seek a report from the government and take action. “A conspiracy was hatched to suspend BJP MLAs. We have been accused of what has not happened. The government has assured us to do the needful,” Shelar said after meeting Koshyari at Raj Bhavan. Fadnavis denied the possibility of Speaker’s election. “There are rulings where the courts have said the election cannot be held if MLAs are in suspension.”In March 2017, the Fadnavis government had suspended 19 MLAs of Congress and NCP for interrupting budget speech of state finance minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-assembly-12-bjp-mlas-suspended-for-a-year-101625514671558.html
06-07-2021||Other||Unable to act against illegal structures due to SRA: Mumbai civic body to HC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), while responding to the observations made by retired justice JP Deodhar in his preliminary report on the building collapse at Malvani in Malad, informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the existing laws on slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) did not permit the civic body to take action against unauthorised structures that have mushroomed across the suburb. BMC submitted that the ill-fated structure – which collapsed on June 9 killing 12 – had come up in 2012. However, due to the state’s policy which “protects encroachers”, the civic authority could not take action against it under section 351 of Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act, BMC submitted. The HC, however, observed that BMC could not shrug off its responsibility for the tragedy by shifting blame to the state authorities. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing the suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) initiated last year after the Bhiwandi building collapse. Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, who represented BMC, informed the bench that the civic authority had a limited role to play with regards to the unauthorised structures that had come up in Malvani. Chinoy added that out of the 8,485 structures in Malvani, 4,900 were ground-plus-one, of which 4,540 were probably unauthorised. He submitted that most of the ground-plus-two and three structures had violated the 14-foot height restriction mandated in the slum rehabilitation scheme. Chinoy said that the slums prior to 2000 were protected and even if they were above the 14-foot restriction, they could not be demolished. He added that as the slums were under SRA, BMC could not carry out any action against unauthorised structures. Chinoy submitted that action under section 351 of MMC Act could be initiated against structures that had a plan. However, as these structures were constructed illegally without any plan, the said section could not be invoked for demolitions. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said only those structures which were within the 14-foot restriction were covered by the policy.The hearing will continue on Tuesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unable-to-act-against-illegal-structures-due-to-sra-mumbai-civic-body-to-hc-101625514670915.html
06-07-2021||Other||‘Name unknown persons mentioned in FIR along with ex-Maharashtra min Anil Deshmukh’||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to disclose the names of the ‘unknown persons’ mentioned in its April 21 first information report (FIR) registered against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. HC said that as over two months had lapsed since the registration of FIR, it expected names of all the accused to be disclosed and directed the central agency to clearly mention the names of the unknown persons, which may include members of the panel which was responsible for reinstating former assistant police inspector (API) Sachin Vaze. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing Deshmukh’s petition challenging CBI’s case against him and unknown persons on charges of bribery, corruption and criminal conspiracy, was informed by senior advocate Amit Desai along with advocate Kamlesh Ghumre that the Central agency had failed to take the state government’s consent before registering the FIR and commencing investigations. Desai reiterated that CBI had bypassed the provisions laid down under the Prevention of Corruption Act by not availing prior approvals from the state to investigate a public servant. He termed CBI’s action as illegal and arbitrary, and in breach of law. Before Desai could continue, the bench sought to know from additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi – representing CBI – who the unknown persons mentioned in the FIR were. “In FIR, you have mentioned petitioner and other unknown persons as the accused. We usually see that in robbery, theft and dacoity cases. You have conducted the preliminary inquiry; then who are the unknown persons? It was your responsibility to mention the names of everyone involved and not just Deshmukh. We want to know the status of the investigation by CBI so far. Give us the investigation progress report in a sealed envelope; we will see and then return it.” The bench also drew the attention of the agency to HC’s words in the April 5 order that directed CBI to conduct a probe against Deshmukh and said that the inquiry was ordered to restore public confidence in administration. Hence, the names of the other accused should also be mentioned. The bench clarified that it was not forming any opinion but was just an observation while having a dialogue with the lawyers. Desai then said that the FIR was vague and it seemed that there was an attempt to protect certain people by not mentioning their names in it. He then added that there was no doubt in CBI’s ability. “Please don’t misunderstand me. CBI has done exceptional work in some cases. But I’m arguing on point of law. Public confidence will be upheld only when the investigating agency abides by the provisions of law for all individuals,” said Desai. In the post-lunch session, when Desai sought to continue his arguments, the bench stopped him as it was informed by the lawyers of Elgar Parishad accused Stan Swamy that the 84-year-old had passed away in Holy Family Hospital, Bandra, due to cardiac arrest. The court said that it would have to pass a detailed order in Swamy’s case, and hence, adjourned the hearing of Deshmukh’s plea to Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/names-unknown-persons-mentioned-in-fir-along-with-ex-maharashtra-min-anil-deshmukh-101625514612719.html
06-07-2021||Chandigarh||SIT quizzes Dhadrianwale, records his statement in Kotkapura firing case||The newly constituted special investigation team (SIT) quizzed Sikh preacher Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale on Monday and recorded his statement in the Kotkapura police firing incident occurred on October 14, 2015. A three-member team led by additional director general of police (ADGP) LK Yadav reached the circuit house in Patiala and questioned Dhadrianwale, who is a key witness in the case, for nearly three hours. It may be mentioned that the SIT called Dhadrianwale on July 2 to Faridkot to record his statement along with other preachers, Panthpreet Singh and Rupinder Singh Panjgrain, but he failed to appear before the SIT. Dhadrianwale said the SIT came up with multiple questions on what actually happened on October 14, 2015, and what was the mood of protesters before the police action. “I am recording my statement for the fourth time before different SITs since the incident, and briefed them what exactly happened and how the police resorted to lathi-charge, used tear gas shells and fired in the air to disperse the crowd,” he said. “I have deposed of before the new SIT that not only the civil and police administration present at the spot, top senior police officials and political leaders of the then government were well aware of the ground situation. The police action was carried out with the approval of political leaders and top police officials,” Dhadrianwale said. He said many leaders and officers may be denying that they had any information on the police action, but they (protesters) knew the reality. “The SIT asked me about why this particular issue was raked up that much. I clearly told them that the matter was related with the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib which is supreme for the community,” he added. Dhadrianwala was among other preachers who were booked for instigating protesters to attack police personnel. However, he was given a clean chit by former SIT chaired by IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh last year. The preacher said the Sikh community was hopeful that the new SIT will take this matter to its logical conclusion. caption: Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwala coming out after recording his statement with SIT at Patiala on Monday||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sit-quizzes-dhadrianwale-records-his-statement-in-kotkapura-firing-case-101625514612208.html
06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu, Bajwa demand concrete steps to make PPAs redundant||Punjab Congress leaders Navjot Singh Sidhu and Partap Singh Bajwa on Monday pressed for immediate action on the power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by the previous SAD-BJP government with independent power producers in the state, questioning the delay. Sidhu, who has been taking digs at his party’s government for its handling of the power sector, demanded a white paper on PPAs to make Badals accountable and new legislation to make them (agreements) redundant. “A White Paper on PPAs must be brought in Punjab Vidhan Sabha to make Badals and other authors of these corrupt agreements accountable to people...I have been demanding this since 2017, but bureaucratic control of department corners people-elected ministers to mere showpieces,” the former minister tweeted, raising questions over the working of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. The Amritsar East MLA, who has been at loggerheads with Amarinder ever since he quit the state cabinet in 2019, alleged that Badal-signed PPAs are looting Punjab and legal options against them are limited due to their protection from courts. “Only way forward is new legislation in Punjab Vidhan Sabha with retro-effect capping power purchase prices to make the anti-people agreements redundant,” he claimed. Sidhu had resigned from the cabinet after his portfolio was changed to power and renewable energy from local government. Bajwa, who has also been critical of Amarinder throughout his (Capt’s) second term as CM, favoured renegotiation of these agreements immediately to stop the continued organised loot of the state exchequer. “Why is it that concrete steps have not been taken till date to do the same in Punjab? There has been a valid precedent and yet after four years of governing the state, the PPAs signed by the SAD-BJP government are still enforced. These agreements have caused irreparable financial burden to the state,” he said, citing the permission given by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) on July 1 to BSES to renegotiate its PPA with the NTPC-Dadri power plant. The Rajya Sabha member said the officers who negotiated these anti-Punjab PPAs on behalf of the previous government are still holding important positions in the present dispensation. “These individuals can create a roadblock for any long-term change to the status quo,” he claimed. He further demanded 300 units of free power to every household, stating that the Congress had already sought to ensure 200 units. “The state government should focus on promoting the creation of new renewable energy infrastructure like solar power,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-bajwa-demand-concrete-steps-to-make-ppas-redundant-101625514433594.html
06-07-2021||Other||‘Allow all citizens on Mumbai local trains or face protests, BMC poll boycott’||As local train services have been suspended for general commuters for over two months now, passenger associations have threatened to protest and not cast their votes in the upcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections. Stating that travelling within the city has become impossible for citizens, passenger associations said they would stage protests along with commuters if no immediate action is taken by the Maharashtra government. Local train services were suspended for general public for the second time since March 2020 after an increase in coronavirus cases in the city on April 15. Earlier, the state government had permitted citizens to travel by locals during stipulated time periods. They were allowed to commute during non-peak hours, excluding 9am to 12pm and 4pm to 9pm, resulting in nearly 3.3 million passengers (2 million on Central Railway and 1.3 million on Western Railway) travelling by local trains every day. “People have been approaching us to tell about their difficulties in commuting. They are forced to travel for around six hours every day by buses for work. What kind of an unlocking process is this? If there is no action taken, there will soon be a time when people will sit on the railway tracks and roads to protest,” said Subhash Gupta, president of passenger association Rail Yatri Parishad. Associations have also stated that if no respite if given to passengers, they would ask citizens to not vote in the upcoming BMC elections. “We have been urging people to use social media to bring the attention to the travelling situation in the city. As trains have not been resumed, we will ask people to not vote in the elections,” added Gupta. Passenger associations have suggested the state government and railways to allow vaccinated passengers to travel by local trains. “It becomes impossible for somebody to travel from Thane to south Mumbai for work every day amid the suspension of local trains. At major workplaces, employees are required to take the vaccine. The state government should start allowing passengers who have taken the vaccine or permit people to travel during stipulated time periods like before,” said Lata Argade, secretary of Suburban Railway Passenger Association, which is another body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allow-all-citizens-on-mumbai-local-trains-or-face-protests-bmc-poll-boycott-101625514434020.html
06-07-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government claims consistent increase in revenue recovery||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday claimed a consistent increase in its revenue recovery, collecting tax of ₹30,156.58 crore from April 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021. The amount represents about 67.3% of the target of ₹44,826.89 crore set for the first quarter of 2021-22.The state’s total tax collections were ₹10,963.05 crore during the same period in 2020-2021. This sum was about 69.7% of the target of ₹15,721.85 crore. On the non-tax revenue front, the recovery was about ₹1953.43 crore, about 32.2% of the target of ₹6067.85 crore. The state government’s non-tax recovery was ₹1020.63 crore, 50.4% of the target of ₹2026.00 crore.Uttar Pradesh minister for finance Suresh Khanna expressed satisfaction over revenue collections and said he was hopeful of further increase in the pace of recovery. He gave a breakup of the collections made under different heads and said revenue recovery had improved considerably in June 2021.The tax and non-tax revenue was ₹11,164.11 crore in June 2021, up by ₹2129.28 crore against collections of ₹9,034.83 crore in the same month in 2020. He said the recovery of revenue from mining and minerals was ₹243.48 crore, 72% of the target of ₹338.00 crore for June 2021. He said it was lower than the amount of ₹337.07 crore recovered in the same month in 2020.As the Covid-19 restrictions ease further in the coming weeks, the revenue recovery is likely to go up further, though a wide gap between the collections and the targets remains a cause for concern. The state government’s recovery of revenue has increased considerably, but its tax collections in the first quarter were only 16.2% of the annual target. The state government spends a large chunk of its revenue on payment of salaries and pension and the expenditure under this head is likely to go up further.The state government will need to step up recovery of revenue further in the coming months to fund ongoing development projects and ensure their completion before UP goes into poll mode for the 2022 assembly elections.“These figures point towards the state government’s economic recovery and it is hoped that this trend will continue in coming months as well. Since the recovery is short of the targets for the period, the state government will need to work to mobilise both tax and non-tax revenue. Augmented revenues will be essential to accelerate developmental activities at this point when the government will be in a hurry to complete the mega projects in coming months in view of coming assembly elections,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor at the department of economics, Lucknow University.The state government may present its first supplementary budget for 2021-22 to fund some of the recent announcements that include schemes for children who have lost their parents to Covid-19. A scheme for Covid-19 affected women, who have lost their husbands, is also being worked out. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath may announce some public welfare schemes and make announcements in coming months as the polls draw closer. The state government will, therefore, have to get ready to make token financial allocations for such schemes and see their implementation before the announcement of the 2022 UP assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-govt-claims-consistent-increase-in-revenue-recovery-101625514371696.html
06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana Cong MLAs meet senior leader Venugopal, seek ‘leadership change’||Amid infighting in its Punjab unit, trouble is brewing for the Congress in Haryana as a group of party MLAs met senior leader KC Venugopal on Monday, apparently lobbying for a key role for former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. The meeting comes a few days after some MLAs sought a “strong leadership” for the party in the state when they had met another senior Congress leader in the national capital. The two meetings indicate rumblings in the Haryana Congress, even as the party’s top leadership deals with factionalism in neighbouring Punjab. On Monday, the meeting was held at Hooda’s Delhi residence. Hooda is the Leader of Opposition in the Haryana assembly, while Kumari Selja is the state Congress president. Barring Hooda, 22 MLAs visited AICC headquarters to meet Venugopal, the Congress general secretary in charge of the organisation. Later, some of the 22 legislators held a meeting with him, party sources said. Of the 31 legislators that Congress has in Haryana, a majority of them are considered Hooda loyalists. “We discussed organisational matters pertaining to the state unit as for many years district unit presidents have not been appointed… political situation in the state in the backdrop of ongoing farmers’ agitation, upcoming panchayat polls… all these issues were discussed,” Congress MLA Kuldeep Vats told reporters on Monday. Replying to a question of reporters in Delhi after the meeting, BB Batra, who also went to meet Venugopal, denied that there was any infighting in the state unit. Senior Haryana Congress leader Kiran Choudhary, who is a sitting MLA and a former minister, met Venugopal separately. Choudhary, however, described her meeting as a routine one. “He is our general secretary in-charge of the organisation. He is a senior leader, I keep meeting him from time to time. There was no specific agenda of my meeting today. In routine, I keep meeting the senior leadership,” she said. According to the sources, some MLAs will meet Venugopal on Tuesday also. The Haryana Congress is in for a major revamp, which is pending for a long time. Four days ago, 19 Congress MLAs from Haryana had met AICC general secretary and party’s Haryana affairs in-charge Vivek Bansal in Delhi. During the two meetings, the MLAs sought a key role for Hooda in the state unit and a greater say in organisational matters, with some of them saying this was necessary in the present scenario as farmers’ agitation is going on and former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, who was serving a 10-year term in the teachers’ recruitment scam, has been released from the prison. The legislators were of the opinion that only a “strong leader” could counter any advantage which the INLD might get owing to Chautala’s release from jail. After his meeting with the MLAs on Thursday, Bansal had told reporters that as the legislators had not met for a long time due to the Covid pandemic, it was decided to take their feedback about the political situation in the state and seek suggestions about the party’s organisational structure and upcoming panchayat polls. However, a senior Haryana Congress leader, who had attended the meeting with Bansal, said the MLAs conveyed that there should be a “change of leadership at the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC)-level” to strengthen the party. Reacting to the meeting of the legislators with Bansal, Selja on Friday had downplayed the matter, saying nothing wrong with MLAs meeting their party’s Haryana affairs in-charge. “The MLAs can meet their party affairs in-charge. I don’t see any indiscipline if party legislators go and meet the party’s state unit in-charge and say something. It is their right. Bansal sahab later clarified what the meeting was all about,” she had said. Selja had also separately met the senior leadership of the party after the legislators’ meeting with Bansal on Thursday. The developments in the Haryana Congress have come amid infighting in the Punjab unit of the party, where senior leader Navjot Singh Sidhu is at loggerheads with chief minister Amarinder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-cong-mlas-meet-senior-leader-venugopal-seek-leadership-change-101625514193712.html

06-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC: Passport renewal can’t be denied if applicant barred from leaving country||The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that passport authorities can’t refuse renewal of the travel document on the ground that the person has been barred from leaving the country. The high court was dealing with a case of denial of renewal of passport by Regional Passport Office, Amritsar, in the case of one Harjit Singh Chadha. The passport authorities had argued that Section 6(2) (g) of the Passports Act, 1967, prohibits the renewal of a passport when a competent court has restrained a person from travelling abroad. The bench of justice Sudhir Mittal observed that the clause cited by the passport authorities entitles the passport authority to refuse a passport or travel document in case a court prohibits the departure of the applicant from India. However, the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) order being cited by the authorities in the case in hand passed in June 2019 does not prohibit the petitioners from leaving India. The order only restrains them from leaving the country without prior information. Thus, the clause does not get attracted in this case, the court added. “…there can be no apprehension of petitioner No.1 escaping his prosecution in India. Every citizen of the country is entitled to a passport and Articles 19 & 21 of the Constitution of India give every citizen the Fundamental Right to travel,” the court observed. The passport had expired in September 2019. In a loan dispute case, proceedings against Chadha stood initiated before the DRT. It was in these proceedings that the DRT had passed an order restraining the petitioner from leaving the country without prior information to the court. The bank was also directed to ensure compliance by sending the order to the passport officer concerned. In 2018, an FIR too got registered against him in which he was a co- accused but, in that case also, the court had given permission for release of his passport for renewal and deposit it after the process is completed. But authorities had refused to renew the passport in view of restrictions on his travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-passport-renewal-can-t-be-denied-if-applicant-barred-from-leaving-country-101625514011696.html
06-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Doctors turn saviours for Covid orphans||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, a group of city doctors is providing school fees to children from poor economic backgrounds who have lost either or both of their parents to the Covid-19 infection. This group has already managed to help 36 such children with their annual school fees, which generally range between ₹30,000 and ₹35,000. Dr Amit Thadhani, a surgeon, along with his fellow friends from the medical fraternity, is reaching out to such needy students across the country through his non-government organisation (NGO), Prime Education Health Learning Services (PEHL). So far, they have received 90 applications across India from students who have lost their parents to the Covid-19 infection. Of these, two applicants have been orphaned after Covid claimed the lives of both of their parents. Already, 36 of them have been helped with this year’s school fees. A Google document has been circulated through social media to submit the details for the grant. “This is the time of school admissions and due to Covid-19, many families who have lost their sole breadwinners are struggling to pay their school fees. We are trying to help such students. Once selected, we would pay their school fees for the three subsequent academic years. We have a target to help 100 such students,” said Dr Thadhani. “The fees are directly sent to the school’s bank account,” he added. The NGO has six-seven doctors on board, who are working closely to facilitate it. All applications undergo scrutiny before getting the approval. “We have three project coordinators who look after three different parts of India — west, north and south. Once we get an application, we check essential documents such as Aadhaar card, ration card and death certificates of the deceased parents. Also, we check the mark sheets of the previous two years to confirm that the students didn’t drop out,” said Dr Anjana Thadhani, developmental paediatrician and director of PEHL services. In most cases, they are getting applications from families where the fathers have died because of Covid-19. “In some cases, if we find the family belongs from a very poor economic background, then we also provide school fees to the other siblings in the family,” she added. On an average, they are providing ₹30,000- ₹35,000 as annual school fees. But recently, they have provided ₹1.15 lakh to a student who is studying engineering. It is the highest amount that has been paid so far to a student. Other than getting financial support from different trusts for the campaign, doctors also are also chipping in money from their own pockets to support the cause. “Most of the money that is being donated through the campaign has been mostly contributed by doctors and members who are part of the NGO. We are also getting fellow peers who are coming forward for help,” said Dr Thadhani. In the state, since the outbreak of the pandemic, till July 4, a total of 123,030 individuals have succumbed to the infection. ‘Father died in April, mother struggled for son’s school fees’On April 18, Sunil Kundale, 43, a resident of Nagpur, succumbed to Covid-19 infection, leaving behind his wife and two children—a one-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old son. Amid the loss, his wife, Deepali Sunil Kundale, had to knock at people’s doors to collect money for his son’s school fees. Kundale used to work as a manager in a local coaching centre. In the first week of April, he contracted Covid-19 and was hospitalised. Most of his savings were spent on his treatment which has now left the family penniless. “I didn’t want my son to leave school. So, when a relative sent me a link to apply for the financial grant, I immediately applied. Last week, they transferred ₹30,000 to the school’s account for my son. Now, at least, I won’t have to feel guilty for my inability to pay my son’s school fees,” said Deepali, who is looking for a job to support her family. ‘It was a year of struggle after my husband’s death’Mandakini Dubey, 32, lost her job as a sales advisor, when the malls closed down owing to the pandemic. Soon, hell broke loose on her when her husband, Sunil Dubey, 32, died because of Covid-19 last year in July. The situation turned more problematic when she ran out of her savings this year and failed to pay her seven-year-old son’s school fees. “My husband, who used to work at a security company, lost his job early in the pandemic. We both were dependent on our savings. Last year, when he died, I wasn’t in a condition to work so my brother helped us financially. But this year, I didn’t even have the money for my son’s education,” she said. Later, the NGO came forward and submitted ₹21,750 to his son’s school in Mulund. “The doctors spoke with my son on video call and even inspected our house. Later, they deposited the money and my son was raised to Class 1,” she said. “I have no way to thank these doctors who helped us in this situation,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-doctors-turn-saviours-for-covid-orphans-101625513950868.html
06-07-2021||Mumbai||No Speaker poll yet, 12 MLAs suspended from Maharashtra Assembly||The monsoon session of the state assembly did not witness the much-anticipated election for the post of the Speaker – which would have signalled the strength of the ruling coalition government that has seen a rocky year, including a high-profile resignation of the state home minister – even as 12 Opposition legislators were suspended for misbehaviour on Monday. The election was expected to take place during the two-day monsoon session which ends on July 6, but neither a meeting of the state cabinet on Sunday nor those held by various leaders of the coalition last week, was able to reach a unanimous decision on the date. While the Congress, a junior partner in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition was keen to hold the election soon, the Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) were not. “Eleven legislators from the treasury benches are absent as they have been affected by Covid. In such a situation it was not advisable to hold the poll,” Congress legislator Balasaheb Thorat said.The post has been lying vacant after Nana Patole resigned to head the state Congress in February. Deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal has been presiding in the absence of the Speaker. As per the power-sharing pact between the three allies, the post would be held by a Congress legislator. The election is held via a secret vote and is a bellwether of the strength of the government as it indicates how many members of the legislative assembly (MLA) are in support of the ruling party – or, in this case, the MVA coalition.“The election to the post of Speaker is held by secret voting, making it difficult to avert the cross voting. Proving the majority would not be an issue, but keeping the votes we received during the confidence motion in 2019 intact is important. Reduction in even a few votes is assumed to be the technical defeat of the government. It would have been senseless to spend the strength on efforts to garner support when the ruling parties are facing volatility,” said a senior Shiv Sena leader on the condition of anonymity.The MVA government had won a floor test in 2019 by polling 169 votes in 288-member House. Besides the strength of 154 MLAs from three parties the ruling alliance, 15 MLAs from smaller parties and independents also supported the government. The BJP claimed to have the support of nine MLAs from smaller allies and independents.The unwillingness to conduct an election that could signal support – or the lack of it – comes at a time when the MVA government has faced a series of controversies in the past six months, and BJP leaders have dared the MVA to prove their majority on the floor of the House during the election. Last week, BJP leader Ashish Shelar – one of the 12 MLAs suspended on Monday – said that they would ensure the MVA’s defeat on the floor of the House. In April, former home minister Anil Deshmukh resigned after the Bombay high court directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct an enquiry into his alleged role in a possible cash-for-transfer scam involving police personnel and politicians. The allegation, made by Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, was based on a report brought out by former state Commissioner of Intelligence Rashmi Shukla. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned Deshmukh, an NCP leader, and his son, Hrishikesh, in connection with this case. In March, former Mumbai Police Commissioner Parambir Singh also alleged that Deshmukh ran an extortion racket and directed top cops in Mumbai to collect money from various establishments including hookah bars and restaurants.Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s relatives are also under the ED scanner in separate cases for purported financial irregularities. State leaders said that the pressure being built by the investigative agencies, under the BJP-led Centre, are attempts by the BJP to pull down the MVA government. In the past week itself, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray as well as other top ruling coalition politicians to discuss means of “combating the pressure by the Centre”, a senior Congress leader said.Fadnavis’s meetings with BJP’s top leadership, especially with Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi this week has led a section of BJP leaders to speculate on the longevity of the state government. “Fadnavis has made it clear that he would not be part of the Union cabinet, which is expected to be expanded in the next few days. It seems that he has convinced the party high command that changes in Maharashtra are possible only if he is camped in the state. If pulling the government down is not possible immediately, it could happen in the near future,” a senior BJP leader and former minister said.However, in past few days, the Shiv Sena and the BJP have made overtures towards ending the impasse, prompting political experts to contend that it was likely that the Shiv Sena deferred the Speaker election because of talks between the two parties whose political alliance dates back to 1995 and broke only prior to the formation of the current government. Shelar met Sanjay Raut of Sena this past Saturday; a day later, Fadnavis also said that Sena and BJP may have differences of opinion but they were not enemies. “We have parted ways due to some differences but we are certainly not enemies. Sena and BJP’s fight is not a long- standing traditional war.”Though the strength of the BJP legislators has been reduced following the suspension of 12 MLAs, including former ministers Shelar, Sanjay Kute, Girish Mahajan, and Jaykumar Rawal, the MVA government is still unlikely to conduct the Speaker election. “They might have an advantage whenever the election is held, but to conduct it during the ongoing session, the government needed to have intimated the Governor in advance. The proposal to that end needs to be passed in the cabinet meeting. With only one day of the session left, the government would have no time left to complete the procedure,” an official from the parliamentary affairs department said on Monday.The legislators were suspended during the resolution moved by state government to seek empirical data from the Centre in order to restore reservation granted to members of the Other Backward Classes (OBC) which stands to be abolished following a recent Supreme Court order. There is a 27% reservation in local self-government body elections for this category. As the discussions became heated, Opposition legislators approached the seat of presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav and tried to snatch the microphone and remove the mace on the table. Jadhav announced the passing of the resolution and adjourned the proceedings for 10 minutes. He later told the members of the Assembly that the MLAs hurled abuses at him and tried to manhandle him.“This has been unprecedented in my more than three decades legislative career. I was abused by the BJP legislators who also tried to physically assault me. They were supported by leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis,” said Jadhav.The BJP however refuted Jadhav’s claims with one of the suspended MLAs, Ashish Shelar accusing the MVA government of “putting the Taliban to shame”.Fadnavis said that the government used the ruckus as an excuse to suspend MLAs. “Our legislators did not abuse the presiding officer. In fact Jadhav used filthy language which I cannot mention. The clashes between Shiv Sena and BJP legislators took place in the cabin when Sena legislators started creating ruckus. We apologised to Jadhav, despite which they suspended our MLAs without discussion.”The suspension of BJP legislators would not have helped the ruling coalition, Fadnavis said. “The suspension of 12 members would not help the government in winning the speaker’s election as one Supreme Court ruling has mandated against it. The apex court has clearly said that such suspension to facilitate any such floor test is invalid.”The Assembly on Monday passed a resolution urging the Centre to provide the 2011 Census data to enable the State Backward Class Commission to prepare empirical data of the OBC population, in a bid to restore political reservations for its members in local bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-speaker-poll-yet-12-mlas-suspended-from-maharashtra-assembly-101625513710923.html

He also reviewed the preparations for the assembly elections scheduled next year.On a three-day tour of his home state, Nadda emphasised on building leadership. He also pulled up party workers and leaders of Mandi segment for not promoting the policies and programmes of the central government among the people. Displeased over many workers not remembering the names of the central schemes, the party chief told them to self-reflect and see where they stood.“The workers should have complete information about all central and state schemes, and the figures on their tips,” said Nadda while instilling confidence and enthusiasm among the workers. He also gave them leadership tips and discussed how to build the workforce, asking the party cadres to gear up for the polls.Bypolls are due for the Mandi Lok Sabha seat and Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly constituencies. The Mandi seat fell vacant on March 17 after the demise of MP Ram Swaroop Sharma, while the Fatehpur segment was emptied after Congress legislator and former minister Sujan Singh Pathania’s died on February 12. Jubbal Kotkhai seat vacated upon former minister and BJP chief whip Narendra Bragta’s death due to post-Covid complications.State unit reflects on achievements BJP state chief Suresh Kashyap said BJP was getting stronger in Himachal under Nadda’s leadership. “We performed well in the Panchayati Raj elections held earlier and the public is continuing its support to BJP,” said Kashyap, adding that a conference would be organised soon to further strengthen the organisation.Heaping praises on Nadda, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said they have seen the former work hard in Himachal and that they took pride in him being the national president of the largest political party in the country.“It is our target to again form a BJP government in the state in 2022. Our three-and-a-half-year tenure has been full of achievements, and all the initiatives have reached the people,” said the CM assuring to exert full force and win all the three seats in the upcoming by-elections.Visit to Atal Tunnel Earlier in the day, Nadda visited Atal Tunnel along with CM Jai Ram Thakur. He described the tunnel as one of country’s biggest engineering marvel created by Border Roads Organisation.He also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for envisaging personal interest in realising the dream of former PM Atal Behari Vajpayee to construct a tunnel to connect the land-locked hinterland Lahaul-Spiti with rest of the world. He said the tunnel was also important from strategic point of view as it would ensure uninterrupted supply of logistics and other support to the army manning the frontiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nadda-discusses-poll-strategy-with-party-cadres-in-himachal-101625513651459.html
06-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Millennium City’s monuments||Nobody associates Gurugram, the so-called Millennium City, with monuments. That’s a mistake. Here are some landmarks that add history to this ultra-new metropolis of malls and high-rises.Kaman SaraiIt is one of the city’s few public buildings to be nearing 200 years. Kaman Sarai gateway was built around 1825 and housed a police station during the British era. The gateway is sandwiched within bazaar shops, near the town’s bus stand. Weedy grass has taken over this edifice of stone and lakhori bricks. The roof is broken. The gateway’s arches support a tunnel-like corridor; the backside has many picturesque windows and niches. Out of the original four chattris at the top, only one stands.Ghamandan SaraiThis is the most picturesque landmark of Gurugram’s Sadar Bazaar, if you don’t include the beautiful Jama Masjid, which is just across a garden. While it is impossible to know the exact age of the gateway, it certainly came up after 1820, before which this area was a jungle. The pavement traders sitting about it marvel that the edifice is entirely made of stone—no brick or wood has been used. A few decades ago, locals say, parts of the gateway were demolished to make way for a narrow lane. In the evening’s soft light, the gateway looks sublime.Agricultural HallSwatantrata Senani Zila Parishad Hall, in Civil Lines, originally had nothing to do with swatantrata senani, the freedom fighters. The building was called Gurgaon Agricultural Hall. It was built in 1925 to honour the memory of the then district commissioner’s son. Two old canons stand outside. The side garden is more sombre. It has a tower inscribed with the names of the area’s soldiers who were killed in the First World War, as well as those of Indian Army personnel from the district who died in the “Chinese aggression in 1962”, the “Indo-Pak conflict of 1965” and the “Indo-Pak war 1971”. The memorial is surrounded by a row of frangipani trees. The flowers frequently fall on the ground.Church of EpiphanyTucked in a corner of Civil Lines, the church was consecrated in 1866 by the Bishop of Calcutta for a handful of British officers. The building is of Colonial-era aesthetics—the tall thin lancet windows, the tiny bell tower, and the gabled roof that slopes down on both sides as harmoniously as a slow-moving sonata. Inside the tiny church, the ceiling rests on a frame of timber roof truss—its coffee-coloured wooden beams feels like secret keepers of the bygone time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-millennium-city-s-monuments-101625513147020.html
06-07-2021||Mumbai||No clinical trial of Covaxin on children as of now: BMC||Clinical trials of indigenous vaccine Covaxin on children between the age of 12 and 18 years is unlikely to happen in the city, said civic officials. BMC had planned to start clinical trials on teenagers between the age of 12 and 18 years for Covaxin developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV), and had according sent a proposal to the central government in the last week of May 2021. However, the Central government has not given a go-ahead for the same.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We have not got any response from the state or central government directing us to start clinical trials on children from the age group of 12 to 18 years. Hence, we will not conduct any trials for now. We are expecting that maybe at a later stage we might be asked to join the clinical trials.”The Central government had in mid-May announced that it would start clinical trials of Covaxin on children in the age group of two to 18 years, following which five medical institutions in Kanpur, Patna, Mysuru, Hyderabad and Nagpur had been approved by the ethics committee to conduct the clinical trials.Meanwhile, on Monday 69,626 citizens were vaccinated in the city. So far, a total of 5,723,972 citizens have been vaccinated in the city since January 16. On Tuesday, owing to shortage of doses, vaccination will be conducted only for three hours between 2pm and 5pm at civic and state-run government centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-clinical-trial-of-covaxin-on-children-as-of-now-bmc-101625513410822.html

Students can expect their results by the end of this week or early next week,” said an official from the board of examination and evaluation, MU.As of Monday, the university has declared results for 28 subjects, the exams for which were held at the end of the summer semester in May. However, the consolidated results for BA, BSc and BCom courses are yet to be announced.The university is facing a staff crunch amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are working with almost half the number of people in the office owing to travel restrictions. However, we are doing our best to release the results on time,” said the official.Students planning to study abroad will require mark sheets in time to apply for admissions starting from August. For such students, if the papers have been evaluated and marks allotted, the university will provide a confidential result to the university that the students apply to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-to-announce-ug-final-year-results-soon-101625513351528.html
06-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Chaos at RN Cooper Hospital as it runs out of vaccine for students||Chaos broke out at civic-run RN Cooper Hospital on Monday as several students, who are to fly abroad for studies and have to mandatorily get vaccinated before flying out of the country, were asked to go back home due to non-availability of vaccine doses.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has designated several vaccination centres in the city where students going abroad for educational purposes are given vaccines. A total of 5,000 such students have been inoculated till Monday, after the dedicated drive started 45 days ago.On Monday, BMC had allotted four centres — Dahisar Jumbo, RN Cooper, Rajawadi and Kasturba Gandhi Hospitals — for vaccination drive for such students between 9am and 5pm. But due to shortages of doses, the centres were given only 200 doses each, which was not adequate considering the high demand among students.Ayush Tripathi, 26, who had gone to RN Cooper Hospital on Monday, said, “When I went to Cooper hospital around 11am, there was complete chaos and students were shouting and asking for jabs. However, hospital authorities said they do not have vaccines available.”He added, “Later, police were brought in and we were asked to go back home. But to my surprise, when I went back in the evening, I was told to directly go inside where I was given the shot. The management can be better prepared to ensure there is no repetition of chaos like today.”Sana Sattani, 26, said, “I got my first dose of Covishield on May 25 and now I need my second dose before July 15 as I am headed to the USA for further studies. But looking at the management at the hospital today, I have very little hope left.”Sattani added, “If I do not get the second dose before July 15, I might have to wait for another year to start my studies abroad. I feel the Cooper hospital authority should understand and give priority to students going abroad rather than giving excuse of shortage of vaccine doses.”Several students also took to social media and alleged that those waiting from 6am were not given the shots while some were given preference by giving back-door entry. BMC clarified that they had distributed tokens and only those with tokens were given vaccines, and added that it was not done based on reference.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “Each centre was given 200 doses for the students. At Cooper hospital, the vials got over faster while the demand was quite high. We would still look into the incident for further clarification.” Meanwhile, Cooper hospital administration blamed lack of vials as the reason behind the chaos. “We get over 400 students daily for inoculation, but we aren’t getting enough vials. Students start lining up from 6am. Also, we have been instructed to prioritise beneficiaries for the second dose so, we cannot use their doses for the students,” said a senior doctor who is looking after the vaccination drive at the centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-chaos-at-rn-cooper-hospital-as-it-runs-out-of-vaccine-for-students-101625513350855.html
06-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra revokes GR calling for reopening of schools in non-Covid zones||Hours after a government resolution (GR) from the school education department was released on physical reopening of schools for classes 8 to 12 in areas with zero Covid-19 cases, it was removed from the government website. An official from the school education department told HT that the implementation of this GR has been stalled by a few days.“Due to the lockdown, children from across the state have been holed up in their houses and missed out on quality education. Their education is limited to what they learn online, which is leading to other troubles such as addiction to screen time and even depression in some cases. Drop-out rate has increased in rural parts and the only solution for this is reopening of schools in a phased manner,” the GR had stated. It further clarified that schools and junior colleges will follow basic standard operating procedure (SOP) and maintain social distancing and regular temperature check of students when on campus.In November last year, the school education department had released a similar circular announcing re-opening of schools for classes 9 to 12 in a phased manner. In January this year, another circular was released directing for reopening of physical classes for students from classes 5 to 8 while maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour on campus. “Both the circulars were revoked once Covid-19 cases started rising again and the state government called for another complete lockdown in mid-April,” said a state education department official.This new GR, however, was quickly removed from the official website. “The Covid situation in the state is still precarious and therefore, reopening of schools cannot be implemented across all districts. We will hold the implementation of this GR by a few weeks until we get a final go-ahead from the state government and the chief minister’s office,” said another official.School administrations feel that instead of confusing schools and students with reopening rules, classes should continue online till the Covid situation is under control and maximum people are vaccinated. “Reopening schools for some students in some districts while others still study online will cause unnecessary confusion. The state should instead focus on bettering technical infrastructure in rural Maharashtra to ensure that students do not miss out on basic education,” said the principal of a suburban school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-revokes-gr-calling-for-reopening-of-schools-in-non-covid-zones-101625513171605.html
06-07-2021||Mumbai||Police stop residents from protesting against Ulhasnagar civic body||Residents of Ulhasnagar were stopped by the police on Monday morning from carrying out a protest against Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) for disconnecting power and water supply of dangerous buildings. Around 20-25 residents who started with an indefinite strike outside the UMC headquarters, were not allowed to continue the strike and five of the residents were detained by the police.“Many residents were supposed to join us. However, the police stopped them. Our protest will continue in some or the other way in the coming days,” said Ram Wadhwa, 33, a resident of Ulhasnagar and secretary of Sai Vasan Shah, an NGO that initiated the protest.However, by noon the civic body assured the residents to restore the water and power connections of the buildings and a few of them were, indeed, restored.Earlier, the UMC had disconnected the water and power supply of 47 dangerous buildings after serving a notice period of 15 days to do a structural audit.“Connections for one of the buildings were restored on Monday itself and the rest will also be done,” added Wadhwa.UMC PRO, Yuvraj Badane, said, “We did not allow the protest considering the ongoing pandemic. The police bandobast ensured that there was no gathering on the streets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/police-stop-residents-from-protesting-against-ulhasnagar-civic-body-101625513170838.html
06-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Teachers struggle to reach junior colleges to work on HSC results||Two days after Maharashtra school education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced that Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) results will also follow the 30:30:40 formula, giving 30% weightage each to Class 10 and 11 marks and 40% weightage to Class 12 internals marks and students’ performance in the year, teachers are struggling to find a convenient way to reach schools and colleges, especially with travel restrictions in place.Gaikwad has requested schools and junior colleges to release Class 10 and 12 results by the end of this month, but education institutes and teachers are finding it difficult. “How do we reach our college without using trains? No one will pay for cab to and from college and it will take us a long time to travel by local buses. The government needs to look at the entire picture before announcing deadlines,” said a teacher from a junior college in Charni Road. A resident of Bhandup, the teacher, like many fellow teachers, is finding it difficult to make it to college in order to start work on HSC results.On Saturday, in a letter addressed to state school education minister and secretary, deputy director of education Sandeep Sangve requested for allowing Class 10 and 12 teachers to travel by train at least till the results are announced.“Since the final result will include marks of Class 10 and 11 as well overall performance of students in Class 12, it will not be possible to do this while sitting at home. Teachers will have to start visiting respective schools/junior colleges and work with the admin staff to get Class 10 and 11 marks and put this together,” said a teacher, adding that without permission to travel by trains it would be very difficult for many teachers to reach their respective institutes.At present, colleges are trying to work out a timetable to bring teachers on campus on a rotational basis so that everyone does not have to stress about travel. “Some of our non-teaching staff reside in Titwala, Navi Mumbai and Nallasopara; so, it is impossible for them to travel to college unless they are allowed to travel by train. But we have no choice but to announce results in time, so teachers are willing to adjust and work out a plan to ensure the work on results is not affected,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of Jai Hind College, Churchgate.Another principal said that teachers are now resorting to traveling ticketless in trains to reach their colleges in time. “We, teachers, are being pushed to break the law because we are not being sold train tickets without a pass approved by the government. Some of my teachers are traveling without tickets to beat the system,” said the principal of a south Mumbai college, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-teachers-struggle-to-reach-junior-colleges-to-work-on-hscresults-101625513111440.html

The state recorded 6,740 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the tally of active cases to 116,827, down from 188,027 active cases recorded a month ago on June 5 and 641,596 recorded on May 5.Pune topped in terms of active cases this month at 16,960, followed by Thane at 16,742. Kolhapur occupied the third spot with 12,716 active cases.Last month of the total 188,027 active cases, Pune led with 22,280, followed by Kolhapur with 18,130 and Mumbai 18,118.On May 5, which marked the peak of the Covid-19 second wave, the number of active Covid cases in the state was a whopping 641,596, with Pune leading with 114,254 cases, Nagpur with 58,944 and Mumbai 56,153 cases.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19 management, said the decline was due to the proactive steps taken by the state government. “We ramped up the number of tests and isolated patients, thus limiting the spread. Lockdown played an important role in cutting down transmission rates and consequently interrupt the surge of the virus,” said Salunkhe.Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general of Organised Medicine Academic Guild, said the decline in active cases indicates the waning signal of the second wave. “Maharashtra has done very well in containing the virus. Active cases would have been much lesser today, had some districts not witnessed such a continuous surge. Districts like Kolhapur, Sangli, Pune and Satara are still clocking high number of cases, thereby increasing the tally of active cases,” said Gilada.Mumbai on Monday clocked 486 new Covid-19 cases and 10 deaths, bringing the case tally to 725,161 and toll to 15,554. On Thursday, 169,517 tests were conducted while the number of recoveries stood at 13,027.The total number of Covid cases in the state now stands at 6,104,917 and toll at 123,136. Pune topped with 16,895 deaths, followed by Mumbai at 15,554.Meanwhile, facing defiance from traders in Kolhapur, the authorities allowed them to open shops after three months. However, the timings for the same has been restricted to 7am to 4pm while maintaining all Covid-19 guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-decline-in-active-covid-19-cases-in-last-2-months-101625513110828.html

The state government also said that regular students of II-year PUC will be promoted by giving 45% weightage for their SSLC marks, 45% for I PU marks and 10% for the internal assessment marks of II PU. The government submitted an affidavit giving out details of its policy of promoting before a division bench comprising justice BV Nagarathna and justice Hanchate Sanjeevkumar during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by SV Singre Gowda, the managing trustee of Gnana Mandira Education Trust, Bengaluru. Hearing this, the division bench disposed of the petition which had challenged the different yardsticks adopted by the state for promoting repeaters, private students, and fresher students for the second PUC exam amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Even the private candidates, who are appearing as repeaters, will be declared as passed by giving grace marks. However, the court was told that the private candidates, who are appearing for the II PUC for the first time, will have to appear for the exam that would be conducted when the Covid-19 situation in the state subsidies. The affidavit said the results of the second PUC will be announced before July 31, as per the direction given by the Supreme Court. The bench on June 17 had directed the government not to declare the results of the II PU course till the decision be taken based on suggestions to be made by an expert committee, which was set up to study methodology to be applied for promoting repeater students. “Pending a comprehensive decision to be taken by the state, it shall not announce results of those who have not taken the second PUC exams,” the court had directed. The department of pre-university education (DPUE) had announced its decision to promote regular/fresher students of second PUC based on the first PUC exam while deciding to hold examinations only for repeaters by way of a notification dated June 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/repeaters-to-be-passed-with-grace-marks-in-puc-exams-state-to-hc-101625512630793.html
06-07-2021||Noida||Noida Metro: New stations to have commercial space||The Noida Metro will build stations on the proposed Noida-Greater Noida corridor on the lines of the Delhi Metro with commercial space for eateries, retail outlets and bars.At present, the Aqua Line, which the Noida Metro operates, does not have any such space and its revenue sources are ticket sales and advertisements. The Delhi Metro formula for stations, said Noida Metro managing director Ritu Maheshwari, will help earn more. “We have decided to develop more commercial space at all Metro stations to be built on this new corridor. We have observed that Delhi Metro stations have commercial space. Therefore we have decided to increase floor area ratio to use as much space as possible for commercial purposes to earn more revenue,” said Maheshwari who is also the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Noida authority.But to make this happen, the authority has to amend its building by-laws and the city’s Master Plan 2031 to increase the floor area ratio to 4.5 from the current 2.5. This will allow the Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) to use more ground and vertical coverage for commercial purposes. Authority officials said they have started this process and it is expected to be completed soon. The changes will be applicable to the Metro project only.“The stations will in a way be able to function as small shopping malls, wherever there is adequate space, thereby earning more revenue,” said a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to media.The NMRC will build five Metro stations on the 9.15km corridor that will branch out from Aqua Line’s Sector 51 Metro station and connect to Greater Noida West’s Sector 2. The corridor will later be extended by nearly 6km to reach Knowledge Park 5 in Greater Noida and four other stations en route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-metro-new-stations-to-have-commercial-space-101625512270759.html

It will also start a helpline number for quick redressal of complaints related to waterlogging, officials said.“We have developed two sump wells at the DND (Delhi-Noida-Direct) Flyway and near Mahamaya flyover. Besides, we will start a helpline for waterlogging complaints on Tuesday,” said RP Singh, senior manager (water works) of the Noida authority.The authority has built one sump well on a road that connects Sector 126 to Amity University from Mahamaya flyover, and another at a road coming from Greater Noida side and going towards DND Flyway. “These are two major points of waterlogging that hassle commuters. But going forward, commuters will not face any inconvenience during rain,” said Singh. According to the officials, a sump well, which is a temporary pit, helps trap rainwater that can later be pumped into nearby drains.According to the authority, there are 22 low lying areas in the city where it will temporarily set up pumps to drain water. Besides, the authority has also de-silted the city drains in order to prevent waterlogging, said the officials. The drains get choked with plastic and filth thereby causing waterlogging in different areas of the city, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-sets-up-two-sump-wells-to-tackle-waterlogging-101625512211447.html

Temperatures are also likely to rise again and hover around 41° Celsius (C) over the next two days, following a mild rainfall last week, they said.The city people, however, won’t experience any heatwave, the weather analysts added.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), there are predictions of rainfall over the next five days, and temperatures may also rise on Tuesday and Wednesday.“There’s a delay in the monsoon, and it may arrive around July 9-10. This is the maximum delay since 2016, as the monsoon usually arrives in Noida and adjoining regions by June 27. At present, the region is receiving moisture laden south-westerly winds, and not the dry and warm westerly winds. However, the mercury may rise over the next two days, and reach up to 41° C. There are chances of light rainfall, depending on a slight shift in trough or moisture laden winds, but the chances are very low,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.According to the IMD, Noida recorded maximum and minimum temperatures at 38.6° C and 29° C on Monday, against 38.6° C and 24° C a day earlier. The Safdarjung monitoring station, which is considered as an average for the National Capital Region (NCR), recorded maximum and minimum temperatures at 39.5° C and 28° C, respectively, on Monday.Air quality likely to deteriorateMeanwhile, pollution monitoring agencies expect the air quality in Noida to deteriorate over the next few days.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) in Noida on Monday was recorded at 168, against 147 on Sunday. On a scale of zero to 500, the AQI in Greater Noida was recorded at 209, against 174 a day earlier. Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 180 on Monday, against 155 a day earlier.An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 ‘severe’.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), due to the transport of dust, pollution levels are likely to increase for a short range of time. “Surface winds are moderate and westerly. Dust long-range transport from western dry arid regions and local emissions are likely to continue in the coming days. Dust (particulate matter / PM10) will be the lead pollutant for the next three days. The AQI is likely to be in the ‘moderate’ category for the next three days,” according to a SAFAR statement on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mercury-to-rise-but-no-heatwave-in-noida-101625512210813.html

06-07-2021||Delhi||Positivity rate now 0.09%, Delhi adds just 54 Covid-19 cases||A day after the number of active Covid-19 cases in the city fell below 1,000 for the first time since April last year, Delhi marked an important landmark in its pandemic fight on Monday as the test positivity rate fell below 0.1% for the first time ever, and daily infections fell to a nearly 15-month low, showed the state government’s daily health bulletin.The test positivity rate — proportion of samples tested that return positive for Covid-19 — dropped to 0.09% on Monday, the lowest ever recorded in the city since the pandemic broke out in early March last year.Click here for Covid-19 coverageExperts and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a test positivity rate below 5% for at least two weeks in a region for an outbreak to be considered under control. The number in Delhi has been below this mark for 46 days, and below 1% for 36 days.Daily infections on Monday also fell to their lowest since April 15, 2020, as Delhi added just 54 fresh Covid-19 cases. This took Delhi’s overall case count to 1,434,608, while two more deaths took the toll to 24,997.The city added an average of 88 new cases every day over the past week, the joint-lowest since the week-ending April 21 last year, when Delhi logged an average of 85 new cases.The number of active cases — people currently battling Covid-19 — which on Sunday dropped below 1,000 for the first time since early April last year, fell further to 912, showed Monday’s health bulletin.Of these, 566 people are admitted in hospitals across the city, even as a majority of Covid-19 beds in the Capital remain vacant. Over 96% of the 14,662 hospital beds earmarked for Covid-19 patients are empty, according to state government records.“The number of cases going down is natural; our study in collaboration with WHO has shown a very high sero-positivity [in the city]. A wave of any infection can happen only when there is an adequate pool of susceptible people. For example, we see dengue cases increase every four or five years in Delhi because there is a susceptible population by then,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).“There will be some ups and downs in the number of cases, but the delta variant was so infectious that a very high proportion of people in Delhi have already been exposed, protecting them against another infection from at least six to 10 months, as the current evidence suggests. In the meanwhile, we are also expanding the vaccination net; people who do not have immunity from a previous infection will get it through immunisation,” said Dr Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/positivity-rate-now-0-09-capital-adds-just-54-cases-101625511826532.html
06-07-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: DME’s rail overbridge turns traffic bottleneck||With traffic returning to the roads after two months of Covid-induced curfew, thousands of commuters using the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) are forced to brave long snarls during rush hour at the under-construction rail-overbridge (ROB) at Chipiyana (near ABES College), which has become a traffic bottleneck. Currently, the 16-lane ROB (which is 125 m long on one side and 90 m on the other) has only four lanes active. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials said that they were scheduled to open six more by July, but that has been now pushed to August 15 because the curfew that affected work. The ROB is the only major structure yet to be completed on the DME’s 19.2km Phase 2 spanning UP-Gate to Dasna. The section serves short distance commuters travelling to Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Noida and Delhi, while it is also a link to long distance commuters travelling to Moradabad, Bareilly and even to Meerut. “For the past 10-15 days, the ROB has turned into a bottleneck and thousands of commuters get stuck during peak hours. It takes anything from 30 minutes to even an hour to navigate the ROB. The traffic police are deployed but they struggle to manage such a massive traffic,” said Namita Gaur, a resident of Crossings Republik Township. “The problem is more acute for local travellers as they have to battle snarls and jams at the ROB every morning and evening and there is hardly any alternative route available,” said Nishant Sinha,a resident of Nehru Nagar. NHAI said the traffic at the ROB section was around 70,000 passenger car units (PCUs -- which is a measure of traffic taking into account the different vehicle sizes and types) whereas the section could accommodate only around 30,000 to 40,000 PCUs, which was the daily amount of traffic during the partial curfew in April and May.“We have just opened four lanes of the ROB and six more were to be opened in July but now they will be opened only by August 15. The rest are scheduled to open by the end of December,” said Mudit Garg, project director from NHAI. He said the authority suggested some traffic regulations, but Ghaziabad traffic police did not accept them. “We requested traffic police to regulate the vehicular speed at other points on the expressway so that the ROB section does not clog but they did not implement it,” he said. Traffic police officials said they had deployed personnel there to manage traffic, but the volume at the ROB was exceptionally high. “If we regulate speed of incoming traffic on the ROB and at other points, we risk having a jam all along the expressway. Likewise, we cannot put up barriers as they will hinder traffic flow. We have asked the NHAI to expedite the work. Once the monsoon arrives, there may be further delays in opening the lanes,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-dme-s-rail-overbridge-turns-traffic-bottleneck-101625511970757.html
06-07-2021||Noida||Gyms in Noida reopen, members being urged to get vaccinated||Noida: Gyms and wellness centres in the city, which reopened on Monday after over two months, witnessed a decent footfall on day one with owners urging the members to get vaccinated before visiting the centres.The gym managers and owners said that while they are following all Covid-19 protocols, they will be working on slots to ensure their centres are not overcrowded. “The day was quite encouraging as a number of members showed up. This time we are ensuring that all our members are vaccinated. The good thing is that about 80% members have received their first dose. We will keep reminding those who have not received the Covid-19 vaccine yet,” said Rajiv Kumar Pathak, who manages Gold’s Gym centres at sectors 30 and 104.Pathak further said that they are also urging the members to get their slots for workout. “It’s important to ensure the floor is not crowded. So, we are giving slots to the members and ensuring that not more than 30 of them are there at a time,” he added.As per the new guidelines issued on July 3 by the UP government, gyms in the state have been allowed to operate at 50% capacity from Monday.According to Ankur Arora of La Fitness in Sector 18, the members are willing to visit the fitness centre.“A number of members have been vaccinated. On the first day, the strength was about one third of what we used to get before the Covid curfew. We are receiving a number of calls from our members who have recently recovered from Covid. We have asked them that if they are feeling weak, then they should take rest before resuming the workout,” said Arora.Fearing the possibility of a third wave of Covid-19, some gym owners said that they are trying to encourage the members by making up for their lost membership days.“It’s a very good response for the first day. Though we have suffered losses due to the lockdown, we are encouraging our members by compensating for lost days on memberships,” said Nupur, who runs a branch of Anytime Fitness in Sector 77.Deepa Ahuja, who operates two centres of Anytime Fitness in sectors 48 and 104, said that they have extended the membership of their customers by two months. “Our businesses have suffered, but we are trying our best to make it up for our customers,” said Ahuja.The gyms and wellness centres had been closed since April 30 when the partial Covid curfew was imposed in Gautam Budh Nagar following the second wave of Covid-19. While the restrictions were gradually lifted from June 7 after the active cases in the district went below 600, the gyms had been asked to remain closed. Poonam Bishnoi, district sports officer, GB Nagar, said that the swimming pools will remain closed till further orders. “The gyms will have to remain closed on the weekends,” Bishnoi said.Last year, the gyms in Noida were closed from March 15 to June 10, about 10 days before the nationwide lockdown kicked in on March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gyms-in-noida-reopen-members-being-urged-to-get-vaccinated-101625511910727.html
06-07-2021||Noida||GB Nagar restarts walk-in vaccination for 18+ today||Gautam Budh Nagar resumed walk-in registrations at its government vaccination centres from Monday after having suspended them for a week due to a paucity of vaccines.As per officials, the district got around 39,000 more vaccines - 14,000 Covaxin and 25,000 Covishield doses - from the state on Sunday, enough to meet the district’s target of 10,000 vaccinations at government centres for three days. The private sector buys it directly from the government’s Co-WIN platform. “On Monday we had a total of 57,000 vaccines. We hope to get more from the state health department soon,” said district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri. To manage crowds at the centres, the district has deployed police. “They can provide information regarding session capacity at each centre. This will help manage the crowd at the centres as only a limited number of walk-in doses will be administered,” said Dr Ohri.Though it has been advised that beneficiaries should book their slots on the Co-WIN portal for convenience, those who are unable to do so can opt for walk-in vaccinations, he added. District immunisation officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi said that the district inoculated 17,908 beneficiariesacross 113 government vaccination centres on Monday. “Out of this, the 11,629 people in the 18-45 age group got their first dose and 593 got the second dose. Of the 45-60 group, 1,918 got their first dose and 2,003 got their second dose, and 722 under the 60+ age group got their first dose and 1,005 got their second dose,” said Dr Tyagi. Last week, the district health department had to suspend the administration of Covishield on June 29 (Tuesday) and all vaccinations the next day as well. This was due to the state government reducing vaccine supply to districts in order to launch a mega vaccination drive from July 1 when it targeted to vaccinate 1 million people a day.On July 1, vaccinations resumed at government centres but walk-in registration was suspended and only those who had booked slots on the Co-Win portal were given the vaccine. As per the official data, the GB Nagar health department had aimed for 10,500 vaccinations on July 1 but only 6789 vaccinations took place for 18-45 age group. Similarly on July 2 and 3, 6,397 and 6,198 vaccinations took place for the same age group respectively.The number of government Covid vaccination centres (CVC) carrying out vaccinations has now increased to 113 now from 36 last week.Even the 39,000 vaccine doses provided to the district is for the next three days is in stark contrast to the district health department’s earlier plan to inoculate at least 40,000 people a day in July.District Magistrate Suhas LY said, “Yes, vaccinations are currently not going as per the plan. But we are in a better position than last week when were only able to inoculate around 6,000-7,000 people at government CVCs.”He added that the total number of vaccinations done in the district including private CVCs is around 20,000 which is a ‘good number’. When asked whether near-to-home cluster vaccinations will start across GB Nagar, he added, “It all depends on the number of vaccines we will get from the state health department. We are hoping to get more vaccines this week”.According to the Co-WIN portal, till Monday as many as 12,52,171 doses have been administered in the Gautam Budh Nagar district, of which 10,87,939 people have taken their first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-restarts-walk-in-vaccination-for-18-today-101625511850694.html
06-07-2021||Delhi||L-G, govt tussle again, this time over advocates for Jan 26 cases||The appointment of special public prosecutors (SPPs) for cases pertaining to the violence in the city on Republic Day during a tractor rally taken out by farmers protesting against the new farm laws has emerged as the new sticking point between the Delhi government and Raj Bhavan, according to official documents seen by HT.On February 26, Delhi Police sent a proposal to the state government’s home department seeking appointment of 11 law officers or advocates to represent the state in all cases related to the farmers’ agitation. However, the Delhi government said it wanted its existing team of SPPs to argue the cases.On July 1, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Delhi home minister Satyendar Jain held a meeting on the matter, but the matter could not be resolved. The same day, Jain added a note to the file saying that he urged the L-G “not to insist on appointing SPPs on the behest of the Delhi Police”.“...The SPPs should not be appointed at the behest of the investigation agency in the interest of justice and fair trial as the investigation and prosecution are two different facets in the administrations of criminal justice. Prosecutors have duties not only to bring criminals to justice according to the rule of law, but also have duties to the accused so that an innocent person is not convicted,” Jain said in his July 1 note.On July 2, L-G Baijal wrote a letter to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal requesting him to convene a meeting of the council of ministers to decide upon the disagreement within a week.“I have also received his (Jain’s) note dated July 1, 2021 pointing out that the SPPs should not be appointed on the request of Delhi Police. No doubt, the public prosecutor represents the State by the virtue of his/her office, he/she is also an officer of the Court and is required to render assistance to the court in arriving at a just and equitable decision. While discharging these duties, the public prosecutor acts in a manner that is fair to the Court, to the investigating agency as well as to the accused in accordance with the guiding principles of the spirit of law based on precedence, common sense and equity. Therefore, there is no reason to suspect that the Special Public Prosecutors wouldn’t perform their duty fearlessly and impartially as officers of the court,” the L-G said in his letter to Kejriwal.Raghav Chadha, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national spokesperson, on Monday said the L-G’s and the police’s request was part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s “vengeful attempts to harass and defame innocent farmers”.“No complaint against the Delhi government’s lawyers has been received. Still, the L-G wants to replace them with BJP’s lawyers to teach the farmers a lesson,” Chadha said in a press conference.“The country has been witnessing ‘BJP vs Kisan’ for the last eight months and the BJP’s anti-farmer face is showing day by day,” he added.Officials in the L-G’s office who spoke on condition of anonymity said keeping in view the “enormity and sensitivity” of the matter, Baijal called the relevant file from the state home department on March 24 and tried to discuss the issue with the government on several occasions.“It was then (March 24) that the L-G found out that the state home minister rejected the Delhi Police’s proposal. On April 7, the L-G urged Jain to reconsider his decision and hold a discussion with him through video conference. However, Jain cancelled the meeting. The L-G again requested a meeting around June 1-2, but the minister urged him to convene the meeting once the fourth wave ebbs. Accordingly, the meeting was finally held on July 1,” the official said.Scores of farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws are from Punjab, which is going to polls in 2022. The Aam Aadmi Party is the principal Opposition party in the Punjab assembly.The Delhi government and the L-G’s office had a similar disagreement last year over the appointment of state lawyers to argue the north-east Delhi riots cases. In 2018, difference of opinion surfaced over appointment of SPPs in the case of alleged assault on former Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash.In these cases, the L-G’s decision prevailed since the matter was finally referred to the President, who approved the L-G’s decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lg-govt-tussle-again-this-time-over-advocates-for-jan-26-cases-101625511420217.html
06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh sexual harassment case: GMCH staffer denied anticipatory bail||The district court on Monday dismissed the anticipatory bail application filed by an OT technician, who allegedly sexually harassed a third-year medical student of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Sector 32.The complainant stated in the FIR that on June 27, she was on evening duty and when she went to the store room to get some medicines, an OT technician, named Kamleshwar, followed her: “As I tried to run away, he held me from the front and molested me. As I managed to get out of the store room, he threatened that he would kill me if I ever complained about it,” the student complained.The accused, who is a resident of Mullanpur, was booked under Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (Criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code on June 28.In the court of an additional sessions judge, complainant’s counsel Terminder Singh argued that the complainant had specifically mentioned in the FIR that the accused had molested her.Accused alleges regionalismIn his plea, the accused stated that because he was from Bihar, everyone used to address him as “bhaiya”, because of which a heated argument had taken place and a “false” case had been registered against him.The complainant argued that it was a serious matter and she had no motive to falsely implicate him, adding that custodial interrogation was required. After hearing the arguments, the court dismissed the bail petition.Students protest on premisesThe police are yet to arrest the accused, and the slow action by the authorities has angered the medical students, who could be seen protesting outside the police post on the hospital premises on Monday. The students raised slogans and held placards.The doctors have also been anguished as it took the authorities almost a week to suspend the accused.A letter dated July 3 mentioned that the accused had been immediately placed under suspension in view of the complaint, for not appearing in front of the internal complaint committee of sexual harassment of women at workplace, and a case against him was under investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-sexual-harassment-case-gmch-staffer-denied-bail-101625511312134.html
06-07-2021||Other||TN minister seeks Delhi’s mediation in dam dispute||Chennai/Bengaluru: Tamil Nadu’s water resources minister S Duraimurugan flew to Delhi on Monday to meet union minister for Jal Shakti, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, a day after the state’s chief minister MK Stalin responded to his Karnataka counterpart BS Yediyurappa urging him to drop the Mekedatu project. “I am going to speak about Mekedatu and river Markandeya. We will discuss several problems related to Tamil Nadu,” Duraimurugan said about his meeting scheduled on Tuesday afternoon. The Mekedatu issue has evoked emotions on both sides of the border as it is an extension of the century-old Cauvery river water dispute that has defined generations in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.Yediyurappa on July 3 made a fresh bid to resolve the issue on construction of the reservoir in Mekedatu across the Cauvery river by proposing bilateral talks with Stalin. But Stalin has stuck to the stance of his predecessors that the project would affect the state’s agrarian community and affect its water resources. He didn’t address the call for a meeting.At different points, the Mekedatu project often came to the fore only to be relegated to the background as it went through several litigations. The long-winding legal battles have been used as a political currency in the past as well as an active tool to deflect attention away from other issues. This time with a new chief minister at the helm, the main arguments over the project have resurfaced. It’s one of those few issues where regional parties concur with each other to take the side of their respective states. While every elected Karnataka chief minister has been keen to roll out the project, Tamil Nadu’s chief ministers have objected. Delegations from both states have over the years met Prime Ministers in Delhi with Tamil Nadu urging the union government to stop Karnataka while they in turn asked for the Centre’s cooperation. Tamil Nadu petition filed in 2018 challenging the project is still pending in the Supreme Court. The suit says that the proposed projected violates the final order of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, and that the construction would impound and divert the flows coming in Cauvery in the intermediate catchment below the Krishnaraja Sagar and Kabini reservoirs, and Billigundulu in the common border of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.Stalin on Monday in his letter said that Karnataka’s objective to construct “such a major reservoir”, which is too far away from Bengaluru to meet its drinking “does not sound valid”. In a letter to Stalin on Saturday, Yediyurappa said that two projects proposed by the Tamil Nadu government--Kundah pumped storage Hydro-electric project and Silahalla pumped storage Hydro-electric project in Bhavani Sub-basin of Cauvery basin--was done without consulting Karnataka, making a veiled attempt to barter consensus on projects on either side of the border. But Stalin said that it wasn’t appropriate to compare them.Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s minister for home, law and parliamentary affairs on Monday said that Tamil Nadu continues to object to all projects since Krishna Raja Sagara (Dam).“Our intention is that their government has changed. This project is for drinking water and generating power and would be helpful in distributing water during distress years. This is what we have been trying to communicate to them but the Chief minister’s (Stalin’s) “tone and tenor” is not correct,” he said. Bommai said that Karnataka will continue to fight the legal battle in the Supreme Court and complete the project.The state unit of the Congress party, which is in alliance with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu, said there was no need to write a letter to Stalin.“Look. Yediyurappa writing a letter to Tamil Nadu chief minister is wrong. If he writes to Tamil Nadu chief minister and asks him to agree, will he do that? There is no need to ask them. The court has not said it nor has the tribunal. We are doing it on our part. According to the tribunal order, they have the right only to ask for the water that has been alloted to them but to make a balancing reservoir here is something we do not need to ask them to make,” Siddaramaiah, former chief minister and leader of the opposition said on Monday. To be sure, Karnataka has already received a nod in favour of the project and the Tamil Nadu’s Kundah pumped storage too has been accorded environmental clearance in February this year while the Sillahalla project is under consideration.The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government, soon after it came to power in 2013, announced the construction of the project which would cost ₹5912 crore to help use the excess water to quench the thirst of surrounding districts, including Bengaluru. Then Tamil Nadu chief minister, (now late) J Jayalalitha wrote to the union government not to give the project an environment clearance as it would disrupt the natural flow of water from the upper riparian state.The DMK says they wouldn’t budge either. “This is against the principles of federalism where an upper riparian state cannot dictate terms,” says advocate and DMK spokesperson, A Saravanan. “They (Karnataka) are raking up the issue now because the BJP is fragmented so they want to divert attention by putting up a united front on the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tn-minister-seeks-delhi-s-mediation-in-dam-dispute-101625511190724.html

A bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy posted the matter to appear in four weeks. Section 9 of the Act pertains to a Bar Council to constitute one or more disciplinary committees. The petition moved by advocate Karthik Ranganathan argued that these disciplinary committees should have retired judges as members and not the present system where lawyers decide on cases involving their peers.Section 9, states, “A Bar Council shall constitute one or more disciplinary committees, each of which shall consist of three persons of whom two shall be persons elected by the Council from among its members and the other shall be a person co-opted by the Council from among advocates who possess the qualifications specified in the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 3 and who are not members of the Council, and the senior-most advocate among the members of a disciplinary committee shall be the Chairman thereof.”The court asked for the copy of the petition to be sent to the office of the Additional Solicitor-General, R Sankara Narayanan. “Mr Rajesh Vivekanandan, learned Senior Panel Counsel, accepts notice for the first respondent. Issue notice to the respondents 2 and 3; returnable four weeks hence,” the court said in its orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/madras-hc-issues-notices-to-centre-bar-council-on-constitution-of-disciplinary-committee-101625511130672.html
06-07-2021||Other||Madras HC upholds bail to man booked over FB post||Chennai: The Madras High Court recently upheld the decision of a special court of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to grant default bail to a man accused under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (UAPA) over a Facebook post. The court dismissed two criminal appeals filed in the case by the NIA.A bench of Justices PN Prakash and R Pongiappan in their order dated June 28 said that the state had acted in a cavalier manner and that there was no diligence in the investigation. The order was made public on Monday.The appeals challenged the validity of two orders passed by the Special NIA Court in Chennai on May 5 which rejected police custody of the accused and granted him bail. Accused, Vivekanandan alias Vivek, allegedly uploaded an offensive post in his Facebook account, for which, Inspector of Police of Thallakulam Police Station in Madurai, registered a case under Section 13(1)(b) of the UAPA and Section 505(1)(b) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was arrested in December 2020. He was produced before the Judicial Magistrate No.2 in Madurai who remanded him to custody. “Seemingly, the Judicial Magistrate No.II, Madurai, has been placing Vivek (A.1) in judicial remand from time to time under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C.,” the court said in its orders.The NIA filed a chargesheet against Vivek and several others on June 11 and according to their press statement released then, his Facebook post in April denigrated Independence Day celebrations as a sham.“Investigation and scrutiny of posts uploaded on social media accounts of accused persons have revealed their support and active role in propagating (the) cause and ideology of proscribed terrorist organisation CPI (Maoist) and its frontal organisations,” the agency said in a statement.Earlier, local police had said that the post was ‘against the spirit of democracy’, threatened the integrity of the country and therefore posed a threat to public peace. The time period prescribed for default bail under Section 167 Cr.P.C. is 90 days and the 90th day fell on 15 March 2021. An order from the union government dated three days before that had transferred the case to the NIA. The central agency re-registered the case. However, the Thallakulam Inspector was proceeding with the investigation of the case in terms of Section 6(7) and 10 of the NIA Act. “Seemingly, another FIR in Cr.No.2594 of 2020 was registered against Vivek in which he was arrested by the State police and was being remanded in custody from time to time,” the court said.Since a charge sheet was not filed either by the State police or by the NIA before the 90th day, Vivek filed a petition for default bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. before the Judicial Magistrate No.II, Madurai, who returned the petition on the ground that the case has been transferred to the NIA. It deprived him of his indefeasible right to be released on bail, Vivek said in his application to the NIA’s special court in Chennai. The Special Court heard Vivek’s plea for bail and the NIA seeking police custody and passed two separate orders. Human rights activists point to the excessive use of the draconian UAPA. “It is obvious that the FB post cannot and did not disturb public peace or attract any offence defined under UAPA,” says senior advocate and human rights activist Sudha Ramalingam. “This is just throttling the fundamental right of freedom of expression and speech. For a post that went unnoticed from April to Sept or so when the case was registered, there is no material to substantiate the accusation. But the courts did not go into the merits of the case. Now what is granted is bail on technical ground.”The court said given the facts of the case at hand, the Supreme Court judgement in Rambeer Shokeen vs. State (NCT of Delhi), as relied on by counsel for the NIA, cannot be pressed in this case. “In this case, we find that there was absolutely no diligence at all,” the court said.“The State should have ensured that Vivek was being produced before the Principal District and Sessions Court, Madurai, for remand. Unfortunately, they did not do that,” the court said. “However, the Public Prosecutor had approached the Principal District and Sessions Court, Madurai, with a manifestly defective report under Section 43(D)(2) of the UAPA by combining two crime numbers. This shows how the State had acted in a cavalier manner for extinguishing the statutory right of a prisoner to be released on default bail…”“The case alleging that the accused Vivek had posted on Facebook a message that was against the spirit of democracy is as vague as it can be,” says Ramalingam. “That it was threatening the integrity of the country is vaguer and should be seen as conjecture with no factual information.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/madras-hc-upholds-bail-to-man-booked-over-fb-post-101625510950694.html

06-07-2021||Lucknow||CISCE reduces English, Hindi syllabus for Class10, 12||Students of ICSE (class 10) and ISC (class 12) appearing in board examinations in 2022 will have to study truncated syllabus for English and Hindi now.“On the basis of the revised syllabus sent by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), the syllabus has been reduced by 30%,” said the teachers at these schools.In view of the lockdown and prolonged closure of schools, the CISCE has initiated the process of syllabus review for various subjects at the ICSE, ISC levels specifically for classes 10 and 12 for examination year 2022 to identify portions of the syllabus which may be reduced without compromising on the quality of content, according to a letter issued by Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the council in a letter addressed to all heads of CISCE-affiliated schools.“Candidates will be tested only on the portion of the syllabus that is prescribed for Class X. For class 10 English Literature (English Paper II) students will have to study --The Merchant of Venice Act III, Act IV and Act V only. However, for English Language (Paper 1) grammar portion remains the same for class 10 and 12 both. There is no change in that,” a teacher said.For class 10 students now there will be 4 poems, 4 short stories. Similarly, class 12 students will be tested on the portion of syllabus prescribed for ISC which is 5 poems and 5 short stories.Similarly, class 12 students would have study Act III, IV, V for Shakespeare’s play --The Tempest and Act I and II in class 11. This bifurcation of syllabus is good, a teacher said.As for Hindi there is not much reduction.Arathoon said modified syllabus for the exam year 2022 is available on CISCE website (www.cisce.org) under the publication section.“As we moved into second year of COVID-19 pandemic, schools across the country continue to struggle to cope up with disruption in educational activities brought due to extended lockdown in the country. In addition to a significant loss of instructional hours during the past years, teaching learning processes have also been impacted due to the various alternate modes of syllabus transactions that needed to be adopted due to closure of schools,” he said.The board has asked the schools to make sure that the concerned subject teachers cover the syllabus according to the sequence of topics. “This will ensure that all CISCE affiliated schools are broadly teaching the same topics at any given point of time as well as facilitate subsequent reduction in syllabus, if required,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cisce-reduces-english-hindi-syllabus-for-class10-12-101625510532650.html
06-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh heritage committee reduced to a bystander||The municipal corporation’s recent move to unilaterally replace heritage manholes without taking the Chandigarh Heritage Conservation Committee (CHCC) on board, has added credence to the growing view that CHCC is being “ignored” on crucial heritage protection issues.The MC recently floated tenders inviting firms to replace the more than 2,000 heritage manholes with ordinary manholes.As per CHCC’s mandate laid down by the union government, it should be on board when changes are made to the city’s heritage. But, as MC chief engineer Shailender Singh conceded, the CHCC wasn’t consulted in this decision. Rather, it followed from a MC general House resolution passed in December 2019.“Our immediate concern is to safeguard heritage manholes. There were number of instances when they were stolen. For the time being, these will be kept in a store,” said Singh.But, this is not the first time when the city’s governing apparatus moved on with its plan, without even consulting the CHCC or taking its consent. The Tribune Flyover, the Sector 17/16 pedestrian underpass and the rejuvenation plan of Sector 17 are some instances wherein the CHCC has been largely reduced to as a bystander.The committee’s roleThe UT administrator constituted CHCC as per the ministry of home affairs’ decision on April 20, 2012. CHCC derives its mandate from the approved report of the Expert Heritage Committee and the letter-dated December 23, 2011, conveying approval of the Union ministry of home affairs. This report was incorporated in Chandigarh Master Plan (CMP)-2031.It’s defining function is the preservation, conservation and the maintenance of the city’s heritage. The mandate also includes taking requisite steps in a time-bound manner for completion of incomplete projects of the original plan and declaring heritage buildings and heritage zones to prepare a conservation management plan and frame conservation regulationsIt is headed by UT adviser and comprises senior UT officials, representatives of Union government and subject-experts.‘Heritage committees have no power’Speaking at a seminar, a CHCC member had said, “There are heritage committees, no doubt, but these are unable to do anything and are helpless.”Another member of the committee, requesting anonymity, said, “Generally, the administration takes the route of appointing a consultant to bypass the committee. This happened when some committee members objected to the construction of the Sector 17/16 pedestrian underpass.”Similarly, the full details of the rejuvenation plan of Sector 17 hasn’t been shared with the committee. “It is a major heritage hub of the city. Major changes being made to it, like the city’s map being engraved on the plaza floor, should be under the purview of the committee,” said the member.In the case of the Tribune Flyover, the administration had gone through with the project, even though CHCC hadn’t given approval. Only a sub-committee had given conditional consent.SD Sharma, member of the CHCC and a chairman of the CHCC sub-panel, said, “The administration does seek the committee’s approval on major issues. But, sometimes it comes to know about changes only after they have already been made. For instance, the walls of a building in PGIMER were recently painted white. There should be law to penalise any damage done to a heritage building.”Rajnish Wattas, former principal of the Chandigarh College of Architecture and member of the CHCC sub-committee, said, “Agenda and mandate can be streamlined. A city like Chandigarh cannot be replicated now and we need to preserve its character.”Advocating that the CHCC should be headed by an expert, Shilpa Das, practising architect and secretary, Act! Chandigarh, said, “This will provide it necessary autonomy and not just make it a forum to serve UT officials.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-heritage-committee-reduced-to-a-bystander-101625510291441.html
06-07-2021||Jaipur||Ramgarh Vishdharito be the fourth tiger reserve in Rajasthan||The ministry of environment, forest and climate change on Monday approved the conversion of the Ramgarh Vishdhari Sanctuary in Rajasthan’s Bundi district into the fourth tiger reserve in the state.Making the announcement on Twitter, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said: “Happy to sanction one more tiger Sanctuary, Ramgarh Vishdhari Sanctuary which will link Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in the Northeast & Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve on the southern side. Increasing numbers of Tigers and other apex predators certify our robust biodiversity.”According to a 2018 tiger census, there are 102 tigers in three reserves -- Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in Sawai Madhopur, Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar, and Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve in Kota — in the state.The proposal for converting the Ramgarh Vishdhary Sanctuary, which is spread across 1,071 square kilometre, into a tiger reserve was recently approved by the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s technical committee, a senior forest official said.The state government will soon issue a notification in this regard, he said.Last year, the Rajasthan government announced its plan to develop the Bundi sanctuary as a tiger reserve to provide a second habitat for tigers in the Ranthambore Reserve.According to experts, there is overcrowding at the Ranthambore reserve, which houses 77 tigers.Over 300 sq km area in the proposed sanctuary will be left as a critical habitat for the animals, while the rest will be a buffer zone, the officials familiar with the matter said.The NTCA is now expected to send a committee to review the Bundi sanctuary, a second official said. Tigers from Ranthambore can only be translocated to the new sanctuary after the NTCA’s approval.Upgrading the sanctuary would resolve the space crunch at Ranthambore reserve, the second official said.Officials also hope to connect Ranthambore to Ramgarh and Mukundra. “To strengthen the prey base, the state has already approved shifting of chital (spotted deer) from Ghana Bird Sanctuary (Karauli) to Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve, Keoladeo National Park, and Ramgarh Vishdhari,” said third forest official who did not want to be identified.A fourth official said that the proposed sanctuary is known as a breeding place for tigers. According to a 1985 census, there were nine tigers there. At least three big cats have strayed out of Ranthambore to Ramgarh since 2013. This shows that tigers are migrating there naturally, the official said.Wildlife expert and founder secretary Sariska Tiger Foundation, Dinesh Durani, said the move to increase tiger population and reduce territorial infights is welcome.“But the focus should be on improving the existing tiger habitat and corridors for their easy disbursal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/ramgarh-vishdharito-be-the-fourth-tiger-reserve-in-rajasthan-101625509634832.html
06-07-2021||Delhi||Markets in Delhi walk tightrope between business, safety||As more markets in Delhi get pulled up for Covid-protocol violations, traders and shopkeepers said that while they respected the importance of distancing and masking norms, the sheer rush of customers has made the rules difficult for them to impose, even as they underlined their desperation for business in the face of two lockdowns that devastated their businesses.The government ordered the closure of all shops in Lajpat Nagar’s Central Market and the Rui Mandi in Sadar Bazar on Monday after an inspection by district authorities showed gross violations of the protocols put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19. Markets in Delhi were opened on June 7 with restrictions under a phased unlock after a lockdown was imposed in April following an unprecedented spike in new cases and deaths of the infection.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMembers of traders’ groups said enforcing curbs was a difficult ask, and said they will ask authorities to bolster the deployment of civil defence volunteers to crack down on violators.“Every time I see visitors in the market without a mask, I request them to mask up. However, many people get aggressive. But I continue to warn people since we don’t want our market to aid the spread of Covid,” said Bharat Ahuja, president of the Delhi Electrical Traders Association, Bhagirath Palace.He said the market association has asked for a meeting with the north Delhi district administration to enforce Covid-appropriate protocols. “People often don’t take us seriously. If civil defence volunteers start issuing fines, people will be more wary of violations,” said Ahuja.Vijay Kumar, president of the Photo Market Association in Chandni Chowk, said he doesn’t expect Chandni Chowk to be shut, with the main stretch becoming a no-go zone for motorised vehicles. “While the main stretch is barely ever crowded, internal roads or narrow roads face different challenges,” said Kumar.Mohd Sabir (38), who runs a footwear store in Ballimaran, said while shopkeepers were taking steps and asking customers to wear masks properly, they have no control over passersby. “We can ask customers in our shops to wear a mask. Most visitors already wear a mask in any case. However, one cannot ask other visitors or locals to abide by rules. They only listen to the police,” he said.Several visitors to Chandni Chowk said that while they recognised the need for caution, trips to the market were essential. Shweta Kalyanwat (26), a shopper at Dariba Kalan, said, “I have stepped out for the first time in over a year, because my best friend is getting married. I couldn’t avoid it. While I have received the first vaccine dose, I am still hesitant about going out since there are concerns about a possible third wave.”Others, however, were less doubtful about stepping out.Dhwani Kapur, 28, who was shopping at Ballimaran in old Delhi, said it was her second visit to the market in a fortnight. “I have been visiting markets along with my family because of a wedding,” said Kapur.Delhi witnessed a peak of over 28,000 cases a day during the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/markets-in-delhi-walk-tightrope-between-business-safety-101625509270603.html
06-07-2021||Delhi||Busted heroin unit was rented for foreign patients||The farmhouse in south Delhi’s Sainik Farms, where a heroin-manufacturing unit was busted on Sunday in a raid by the Punjab Police, was taken on rent a fortnight ago to keep patients from Afghanistan visiting Delhi for treatment, local police officers and people living in the neighbourhood said on Monday.The Delhi Police on Monday said they have booked Pravesh Kumar alias Bobby, the owner of the farmhouse, for not informing the local police about keeping foreigners as tenants, and not getting their credentials verified by the local police. A case under Indian Penal Code’s section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) was registered against Pravesh at the Neb Sarai police station.The station house officer (SHO) of Neb Sarai police station and four other police personnel were also sent to district’s lines and a departmental enquiry was initiated against them since the farmhouse is in their jurisdiction, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.Four Afghans, who were living in the farmhouse, were arrested by the Punjab Police for allegedly running the heroin-manufacturing unit late Sunday evening. The Punjab Police director general Dinkar Gupta announced the raid in a tweet on Sunday evening. “Punjab Police unearth & bust a major heroin manufacturing unit in South Delhi. Around 17 kg heroin, assorted chemicals, acids & lab equipment recovered. 4 Afghan nationals arrested,” tweeted DGP Gupta.Gupta on Monday said the accused have been identified as Mujahed Shinwari of Nangarhar in Afghanistan; Mohammad Lal Kaker, Jannat Gul Kakar and Samiullah Afghan from Kunduz province of Afghanistan. The police have also recovered assorted chemicals and lab equipment used to manufacture the drug, from the Neb Sarai unit. The arrests and seizure came on the basis of leads from Hoshiarpur police’s investigation into a drugs case, Gupta said.A case under relevant sections of NDPS Act has been registered at Garhshankar police station in Hoshiarpur district, said Punjab Police officers.“Until the police raid on Sunday, we did not know that four Afghans were living in the farmhouse. All we knew was that some foreigners shifted there around a fortnight ago. We saw one or two of them coming in or going out in auto during this period. They never interacted with anyone in our neighbourhood,” said Vinod Singh, owner of an adjacent farmhouse.According to Singh, the farmhouse where the heroin-manufacturing unit was busted, belongs to his brother, Pravesh Kumar alias Bobby. Pravesh lived there with his family till last year, Singh said.Pravesh shifted to their other home in Dwarka and the farmhouse was rented out to the Afghans through a local property dealer, Ganesh Kumar. The property dealer was questioned by the Punjab Police.When contacted Pravesh said, “The tenant who finalised the deal told us that they were Indians and also produced his Aadhaar card to confirm his identity. We prepared a rent agreement and also applied online for tenant verification. As far as the illegal activities are concerned, I wasn’t aware of it. I will co-operate with the police in their investigation and provide them all assistance.”The farmhouse is located in the Forest Lane in Sainik Farms, and spread over nearly 1,000 square yards. It is built on one portion of an acre-long property (plot number-227) that belonged to the family of Singh and Pravesh. The property was subsequently divided into five plots, three of which are now owned by Singh, Pravesh and their relative. A serving Delhi Police inspector lives with his family in another property adjacent to the farmhouse where the raid was conducted.“We have learnt that the property was taken on rent on the pretext of keeping some ailing Afghans after their treatment in a Delhi hospital. However, except the four arrested foreigners we had never seen anyone else visiting the farmhouse. The four never looked like patients to me,” said Manish, Singh’s son.The main entrance of the farmhouse has a big black iron gate with an electronic call bell and a CCTV camera. Three locks were hanging on the gate on Monday when HT visited the spot. The two wooden doors of the three-bedroom house inside was also locked. Tyre marks of some cars were visible on the granite-floor behind the gate. A white plastic bag containing a half-filled cold drink bottle and some snacks was hanging on the main gate.Nobody in the neighbourhood had any idea what was happening in the farmhouse until the local police and some mediapersons reached there and told them about the heroin-manufacturing unit, said the woman, who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/heroin-unit-busted-farmhouse-was-rented-on-pretext-of-keeping-afghan-patients-visiting-delhi-for-treatment-101625509271230.html

Firstly, no action has been taken against any student for expressing a viewpoint that is different from the government and the university, unless the said statement damages the social fabric of our country or is against our constitutional values. Secondly, since the student was expressing her viewpoint against the government as reported in the media, the matter first should have been brought to our notice before initiating any against her,” Sisodia, who is also Delhi education minister, said.“A university should be a safe space for students to freely voice their opinions, debate and develop their points of view. No students should be punished for exercising their right to free speech within the University space,” Sisodia added.He asked the principal secretary to ensure that the fine imposed on the student be cancelled and that she faces no action. “The principal secretary should issue relevant directions to all universities that come under the aegis of the Delhi government to ensure that no such action is taken against students in future also for expressing their opinions unless they are damaging to the social fabric of the country and go against our constitutional values,” he said.A university official said the fine has been withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sisodia-orders-ambedkar-university-not-to-fine-student-for-remark-about-cm-101625508910556.html
06-07-2021||Gurugram||‘Three generations have lived here, authorities now say our home is illegal’||After living for over six decades in Faridabad’s Khori village, 64-year-old Jamila Devi finds it hard to believe that her home is an “illegal encroachment on forest land” that is to be demolished soon.“My father started working in the mines here -- it was mostly stone and minerals -- in the 1960s after leaving our village in Rajasthan. When I came of age, I too started working in the mines as a labourer and we settled in Khori village as it was close to the mines. Since then, three generations of our family have lived here; we have no roots left in our village in Rajasthan. But now, the authorities are now saying the settlement is illegal,” said Devi, who worked in the mines in the 1980s.On June 7, the Supreme Court ordered the eviction of thousands of residents of Kori village, as the settlement was encroaching on the Aravalli forest area in Faridabad district, and said there cannot be a compromise or concession on forest land. Since then, the residents have been demanding rehabilitation.Devi said till the early 2000s, most Khori residents worked in the mines as labourers, drivers or stone crushers. “There was no concept of forest land or government land till the 1990s. It is only after 1992 that this area was taken over by the municipal body of Faridabad, but those who worked in the mines continued to live here.”In 2002, the Supreme Court banned mining within five kilometres of Delhi and mass mining stopped in Khori. Following that, illegal developers started selling plots in the village to the urban poor, with the promise that they would have complete ownership ”soon”.In 2009, the Supreme Court imposed a blanket ban on all mining of major and minor minerals in the eco sensitive Aravallis of Faridabad, Gurugram and Mewat, which, residents say, led to an unemployment crisis. However, many still chose to buy land at cheap rates in Khori village, using their savings, so that they could have a place to live.“In 2010-11, one square yard was sold to us at ₹1,000, and I bought 50 square yards. At that time, the only concern was that I will be able to have a house of my own and not pay rent. Thinking on similar lines, many bought plots on the assurance that there would be no issues. We were not even given a receipt of the land sale, but we believed that the colony was set up with due permissions from officials,” said Santosh, a resident of Khori.Ishita Chatterjee, a PhD scholar from the faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning at the University of Melbourne, who has been studying Khori village said, “During the 1970s to 1990s, first, the quarry workers settled down here as they could not go back to their home states since they were stuck in a vicious cycle of debt to the contractors. Later, by the early 2000s, after mining was completely banned in this region, inhabitation picked up in this region, as people from different bastis in Delhi started purchasing land here. Along with this, people from nearby states also started moving to Khori, after selling all of their lands in their villages, which is why many of the residents do not have savings anymore.”“Mostly, none of the residents knew that this was a settlement on government land when they purchased it. In 2012, after the officials from the tourism department visited the area and discovered the settlement, a demolition drive was conducted, and that is when the residents first realised that this was government land. An association of the residents under the name of Khori Goan Colony Kalyan Samiti approached the High Court of Chandigarh next, and a legal battle has been going on since then,” said Chatterjee.Locals said despite the court case, the sale of plots continued in the village as word had spread that plots were available at cheap rates in the village. Given its proximity to the national capital, many who worked as drivers, carpenters and construction workers in Delhi also decided to settle down there.Siyaram Pal, who works as a driver, said, “I bought land in Khori in 2011 at ₹2,000/square yard thinking that this area is close to Delhi, and it will be good for us, as children will have access to education and jobs. As these areas were mining pits, we first filled the land, levelled it and then constructed our house. This did not happen overnight, and if it was illegal, then authorities should have pointed it out then itself as we would not have invested our life savings.”According to satellite images, the sale of plots continued till 2019, with Khalsa Colony being one of the latest settlements to come up on the higher terrain of Khori. Residents of Khalsa Colony, which came up in 2014, said they were not given any proof of purchase for their plots and alleged that they had to pay officials of various departments before starting construction.Arun, a resident of Khalsa Colony in Khori village, whose house was already demolished in a drive in April, said, “We are already living in the ruins of a demolished house. What more will they demolish now? When we shifted here in 2016, we had to pay money at each step. When bricks and other construction materials would leave the factories, the truck drivers would immediately inform the local police and officials would come and take money from us before even one brick was placed. But now, none of these officials can be traced. They never share their contact numbers and we are unable to file a complaint.”Senior officials, meanwhile, said if the residents file complaints, action will be taken without discrimination.Speaking about allegations against police facilitating land mafia, Anshu Singla, the deputy commissioner of police (NIT), said, “At present, we are following the orders of the Supreme Court. If there are any specific complaints against anyone, then action will definitely be taken against them, irrespective of who they are, what they are and from where they are.”Raj Kumar, the divisional forest officer for Faridabad, said, “I am not aware of what happened when the colony was being set up around eight to 10 years ago. We have not received any complaint against any forest staff so far.”Over the past few weeks, the situation in Khori has remained tense, with first the district administration on June 14 prohibiting gathering of five or more persons “within a radius of 200 metres of village Khori”, fearing a possibility of unrest. On June 16, a 70-year-old man died by suicide, fearing that his house, which he recently constructed for ₹3 lakh, would be demolished.Last Wednesday, the Faridabad police booked over 400 persons for violating prohibitory orders on gatherings in Khori village and pelting police personnel with stones, following a clash, as residents started congregating for a mahapanchayat.Owing to the tense situation, the commissioner of Faridabad Police declined to comment on the allegations made by the residents.Residents also said that if they were away from their houses for long, the land mafia would threaten to sell off their properties to others (as there was no documentation proof) and to avoid it, they paid a monthly fee of ₹300 to them.“My sons go out for work and my husband, on his way to work, drops our daughters at his sister’s place in Malviya Nagar every morning. I guard the house throughout the day and in the evening, they all return. The situation is so hostile that we are fearful of approach the authorities. We fear that if we complain, it will hardly take any time for the land mafia to send people and hurt us,” said Sheila Devi, a resident.Yashpal Yadav, the deputy commissioner of Faridabad district, could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/three-generations-have-lived-here-authorities-now-say-our-home-is-illegal-101625506275047.html
06-07-2021||Pune||Residents of Hinjewadi alert authorities to sand mining on Mula riverbed||PUNE Thanks to the residents of Hinjewadi, illegal sand mining, allegedly going on in the Mula river, has once again been brought to the notice of the authorities.Following complaints from residents, officials of the state irrigation department visited the site and found deep holes on the riverbed where miners had scraped sand from. “We did a site inspection after we got a call from the residents that sand was being illegally mined and we went to check, but they had left in a hurry. We saw track marks and a JCB was used for loading. Tonight we will depute officials to catch them red handed and keep a vigil,” said Ashok Late, junior engineer, irrigation department. Walkers and joggers, on Monday, spotted activity close to the Mula at 6am. This digging was continuing at a fast pace along a small bridge on the river near Blue Ridge Towers 18 and 19. “I saw an earth moving machine digging the sand from the riverbed and there was a dumper standing next to it where they were filling the sand in. This was at around 6 in the morning and the dumper was almost full... that means they were doing it from very early in the morning and were about to leave. However, the dumper got stuck in the sand on the riverbed, and few people who were there tried to push the dumper out. After their failed attempt, they emptied the sand and only then could they move the dumper from that spot,” said Ravi Kiran Reddy, a resident of Blue Ridge. There is a heap of sand along the side of the bridge.Local representatives, along with the Hinjewadi residents’ welfare association (HIRWA), informed the police officials. Reddy pointed out that although he has witness to the sand mining in action for the first time, he has seen trucks carrying sand away from the river. “These people should be punished for their actions as it creates an environment hazard for us, that could lead to a flood next to our society,” added Reddy. Vikram Sakare, sarpanch, Hinjewadi said, “This is the first time I have heard of sand mining on this side of the river. We have spoken with the other members of the panchayat and will keep a vigil to catch the people illegally sand mining. We will work together with HIRWA and residents to make sure that the river is protected.” Residents to the rescueIn November 2020, a group of alert citizens kept vigil and managed to catch illegal sand miners red handed. A chance observation by an alert citizen, followed by co-ordinated efforts of residents of Aundh, Baner and Pashan helped crack down on a sand mafia operation going on within the city. “We realised that the gang had already destroyed the eco-sensitive confluence of Ramnadi with the Mula river, altering its very structure, with most of the excavation done under water, making it invisible,” said Pushkar Kulkarni, resident of Baner, who caught the culprits red handed. “The current status of the river is such that from being more than 30 metres wide, it has now become only 17 metres wide and the banks have been eroded. Thus, when gates of the dams open, the flow of the river will accelerate and erode faster to cause flooding,” said Kulkarni. “When we got closer to the spot we noticed that there were two trailers without registration numbers that were being loaded with sand from the excavators. The damage outside the river is visible, but they managed to extract the sand from the basin where the water level is intact making the damage immeasurable. We are still keeping a vigil on the river,” added Kulkarni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-of-hinjewadi-alert-authorities-to-sand-mining-on-mula-riverbed-101625505431599.html
06-07-2021||Pune||Pune vax drive back on track with 32k doses received on Monday||PUNE After a two-day lull for Covid-19 vaccinations at Pune Municipal Corporation centres (PMC), the city has finally received 32,000 doses of Covishield. On Sunday and Monday, the centres had to be shut due to a shortage of Covishield and on Monday, only Covaxin shots were given at selective centres. On Monday evening, the PMC received Covishield doses which will now speed up the vaccination process on Tuesday.The city saw 54,136 get the vaccine on Sunday across age groups, as private hospitals continued to vaccinate. Of the 54,136 doses administered on Sunday, the majority were from the 18-45 year-age group; 29,964 got the first shot and 1,977 got the second shot. The huge gap in demand and supply is leading to a shortage of vaccines in major cities and July could see this gap widen further, as most the 45-plus age group, who got their first shot in April, are now due for their second shot in July, completing the 84-day period in between. In addition to this, the 18-plus age group and pregnant women who are now eligible for the vaccine will also be in line for the Covid-19 vaccine.Assistant health officer PMC, Dr Vaishali Jadhav, in charge of the Covid vaccination drive, said, “We have received over 32,000 doses of Covishield which will again boost the vaccination in the city. On Sunday and Monday our centres were shut for Covishield beneficiaries as we did not have any vaccines left.” Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner said, from Tuesday vaccination for 18-plus, for both doses, and both vaccines, would begin at 197 centres within the PMC jurisdiction. Earlier to this, PMC had witnessed record vaccinations in the city as over 202 Covid vaccination sites were operational on June 29. This shortage of vaccines is also likely to affect PMC’s other vaccination drives, like vaccination drives in the slums where vaccine hesitancy and lack of internet literacy has hampered vaccinations, or the “Vaccine on Wheels” initiative which vaccinates the most vulnerable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-vax-drive-back-on-track-with-32-000-doses-of-covishield-received-on-monday-101625505430894.html
