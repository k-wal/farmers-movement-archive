The state government has also allowed hospitals to conduct vaccination drives in housing societies to boost the vaccination process. In addition, some social organisations are also tying up with hospitals to conduct the drive in slums.Dr Ameet Mandot, director, Gut Clinic, said it was imperative to speed up the process. “The Covid-19 menace still continues and will be there for some time. In this situation, vaccination will blunt the intensity of the virus and will play an important role in saving lives,” said Dr Mandot.Mumbai on Wednesday recorded 656 new cases with 21 deaths as its toll reached 15,472.The total number of Covid-19 patients right from the outbreak last year has now reached 6,070,599.

01-07-2021||Other||Students indulging in malpractice in MDU semester exams||Students appearing for postgraduate first semester exams and Pre-PhD course work exams through the online mode under Rohtak’s Maharshi Dayanand University are taking advantage of technology for cheating and the invigilators are facing a tough time to cope with the situation.Over 18,000 students are appearing in the exam and the exams for distance education students will start from July 3.After downloading the question paper, students are to write answers in separate sheets, which are to be scanned and uploaded. In addition, students also have to send in the hard copies via post.Three hours are provided to the students to write their answer script and one extra hour to upload it in a PDF format.The answersheets are purchased by students themselves and they have to write their name and roll number on every page of the copy.Flagging the issue, state president of JJP’s student wing India National Student Organisation, Pradeep Deshwal, alleged the MDU vice-chancellor Rajbir Singh’s “lackadaisical and incompetent nature is responsible for giving only online mode option to students”.“The students had paid the exam, university and other fees but they are using their own sheets to write the answers in the exam and using their own mobile data. Then why is the varsity charging these expenses from students? The university wants to keep rural students away from education and has failed to keep a tab on students indulging in malpractice,” he added.An MA (English) first semester student said he and his friends used to write answers of expected questions in advance in separate sheets and use the same after three hours.“I had never indulged in such malpractice earlier but I had no option now as my friends are doing the same. If I do not follow them, they will score more marks and it will hurt my academic performance,” the student added.Another student pursuing MA (mass communication) said many students write answers by taking help of notes and book as the screen of their phone is too small and the invigilators can only see the candidate’s face and not their activities.“If the university wants to conduct online exams, the questions should be prepared of higher-order thinking and open books should be allowed. If this is done, those who have studied the syllabus can answer the questions,” she added.Two invigilators, requesting anonymity, said it is difficult to keep tabs on students appearing for the exam from their homes.“The moment students switch off their video, move away from the screen or try to minimise the screen, we ask them why they are doing so. But it is difficult to ascertain whether they had switched off video for cheating or if there was some technical glitch,” they said.“After cheating issues raised by some students, the university has decided to provide both modes to students in the upcoming semester exams starting in the third week of July,” they added.MDU controller of examination BS Sindhu said there can be some issues with the online mode but the exams are going on smoothly.“We have asked the teachers not to ask direct questions so that students’ can’t attempt cheating. We have not received any complaint that students are indulging in malpractice during the exams. In the even semester, we will provide both online and offline options to students,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/students-indulging-in-malpractice-in-mdu-semester-exams-101625163818470.html
01-07-2021||Mumbai||Maratha reservation: State asks Centre to amend Constitution to restore state powers||Responding to the fresh verdict of the Supreme Court (SC), the state government and Maratha outfits have demanded that the Centre should amend the Constitution to restore state powers and remove the 50% cap on the reservation.Public works minister and head of the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation said, “This has been a shocking ruling by the court. It has been reiterated that the powers to give the reservation are with the Centre. The Central government now needs to amend the Constitution to restore the state powers and also to do away with the 50% cap on the reservation. We do not want to politicise the issue and want all the political parties to join hands in the interest of the reservation. The Centre should take a call on it, in the ensuing monsoon session of the Parliament.”Vinod Patil, one of the petitioners for the Maratha reservation said that the state and Central governments need to have their own laws. “The SC has reiterated on its stands that there is no need to review its earlier verdict related to 102nd Constitutional amendment. This also means that the Centre has the power to give reservation to any community based on backwardness. The state and Central governments can take a clear stand with due deliberation in this issue and enact their own laws,” he said.Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Chandrakant Patil said, “We will request the Centre to clarify its stand on the reservation in the Parliament, but the state government should comply with its duties related to restoration of the reservation. The SC had clearly stated that the President can order the state to enact a law for the reservation. The state government should complete the process required for it by collating the required data through backward classes commission.”Leader of Opposition in legislative council Pravin Darekar said, “The Central government clarified its stand by filing review petition that it did not intend to take away the powers of the state governments to give reservation based on backwardness. I have not read the SC’s fresh verdict, but I am sure the Centre will take all steps required in the interest of reservation. Not only the petition related to the Maratha reservation but also the petition by few other states are pending before the Apex court. A collective view needs to be taken in that context. BJP will do everything required to restore the Maratha reservation.”Reacting to the development, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said that the Central government will have to make the Constitutional amendment and if not, then it would prove that they are against the Maratha community. “We have been saying the same that the matter is in the hands of the Central government, post the SC judgment against Maratha reservation. The Centre will have to make an amendment in the Constitution to give the states their rights back to provide reservation to a socially and educationally backward community. If the Centre did not do this, then it will prove that they are against Maratha reservation,” said Nawab Malik, chief spokesperson of NCP and minority affairs minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-reservation-state-asks-centre-to-amend-constitution-to-restore-state-powers-101625163457691.html
01-07-2021||Lucknow||More than 342,000 get Covid jabs in Uttar Pradesh, over 16,500 vaccinated in Lucknow||As many as 16,574 beneficiaries took the Covid vaccine jab in Lucknow and 342,959 across Uttar Pradesh on Thursday. In contrast, 4,956 beneficiaries were administered the Covid vaccine in Lucknow on Wednesday and 68,693 across the state as the health department had increased the focus on routine immunisation for children on the day. On Wednesday, the focus was on vaccinating children against TB, measles and other diseases. Hence, the number of vaccination centres was reduced to 20 government ones and eight in the private sector here. “In June, we had a target of administering one crore doses and we gave 1.29 crore doses,” said additional chief secretary (medical health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad. A total of 109 sites conducted Covid vaccination, including 98 sites at government health facilities, on Thursday. For Friday, 71 government vaccination sites were allowing slot booking for beneficiaries, apart from the 10 private hospitals running vaccination centres in Lucknow. “We are vaccinating the beneficiaries as per the availability of vaccines every day. As soon as more stock arrives, we shall increase the number of vaccination centres. On Friday, the number of beneficiaries shall go up slightly,” said Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar, chief medical officer of Lucknow. UP likely to get 19.1 million doses in July Uttar Pradesh is likely to get 1,91,16,830 (1.91 crore or 19.1 million) doses of Covid vaccine for July that would be administered to people between 18 and 45 years of age. The central government has proposed to send 1,58,64,000 doses of Covishield and 32,52,660 doses of Covaxin for this age group that has a population of 15.04 crore in the state.

01-07-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka Covid-19 vaccine wastage cross 1 lakh since inoculation drive began||Karnataka has reported wastage of more than 1 lakh Covid-19 vaccines, since the beginning of vaccination drive in January. The state wasted 2.29 % doses per district on an average, according to report published in Prajavani on Wednesday citing a state health department official.Among the districts, Bagalkot reported the highest vaccine wastage with 22,196 doses at 12.66% followed by Hassan with 17,028 at 8.01%.One of the reasons for the wastage is vaccination of less than 10 people from each vial during the first vaccination drive, the state health officials informed. “Ideally, at least 10 people should get vaccinated within four hours of opening a vial containing 11ml of vaccine that remains effective for four hours,” a health department official said.Bagalkot district health officer Dr Ananth Desai said wrong statistics on the CoWIN portal about the doses administered has also caused wastage in Bagalkot’s Gulegagudda taluk. He clarified that the portal showed only 34,000 doses as being used, even though Guledagudda taluk had used 54,800 vials of both Covaxin and Covishield vaccines. “Due to the erroneously published data, Guledagudda taluk had wasted over 20,000 vials of vaccine. We are rectifying the data on the portal,” Dr Desai said.Deputy commissioner of Dharwad, Nitesh Patil said “all precautions have been taken to stop the vaccine wastage or minimise it in the district.”Despite the wastage of vaccines, 10 districts of the state have also achieved more than the targeted vaccination. Shivamogga, by administering 6% more doses than the target, has topped among these 10 districts. This could be achieved due to increased awareness and monitoring of the optimum use of vaccines, informed Shivamogga deputy commissioner KB Shivakumar.The rest of the nine districts that have vaccinated above the target are Udupi, with 5.57 %, Dakshina Kannada with 4.71%, Dharwad with 4.25%, Haveri with 4.16%, Uttara Kannada with 3.65%, Chikkamagaluru with 2.25 %, Belagavi with 1.72%, Kodagu 1.36%, Bengaluru with 1.29% and Mysuru with 0.13%.The supply of vaccines also played a role in achieving above the target in 10 districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-covid-19-vaccine-wastage-cross-1-lakh-since-inoculation-drive-began-101625162017028.html

The charpoy was found close to the half-naked burnt body.Her father told police he was sleeping with his wife on the roof of the house. His children were outside the house on the ground floor.“We slept by 8 pm, she was there then. When I woke up, I thought she might have gone to attend the nature’s call in the field. She did not come home for long then I became worried,” father told the police.“I sent my sons and others to look for her. She was found in the mango orchard brutally murdered. We could identify her with the clothes, her face was burnt apparently to make the identification difficult, he said.Hundreds of people gathered at the orchard and at the house expressing anger at the incident. Police had a tough time in controlling the villagers who were demanding immediate arrest of the accused.SP Kanpur Dehat Keshav Chowdhary said the girl was burnt alive and the body had been sent for postmortem.On father’s apprehension that feared she was raped before she was killed, the police said the postmortem report would clear whether she was raped or not.The family, however, has denied any enmity angle as being probed by the police, which called the forensic experts to the spot.ADG Kanpur zone Bhanu Bhaskar and IG Kanpur range Mohit Agarwal also visited the spot.

01-07-2021||Lucknow||Doctors’ 100% effort gives two 90+ Covid patients new lease of life in Uttar Pradesh||Amid the many challenges posed by Covid-19, doctors in Agra and Jhansi did wonders by restoring two nonagenarians to health. While one patient was aged 98 years, the other was 95.The recovery of a 1923-born Covid-19 infected man from UP’s Agra district was one of the biggest testimonies to the perseverance of the doctors.“I still remember the Covid first wave. In the absence of the line of treatment and vaccine, even the doctors were clueless how to tackle the deadly virus that had gripped the state. And at the same time, we came across the case of a 98-year-old Covid patient, Gyan Chand Gupta, who was suffering from breathlessness and fever,” said a doctor at Agra’s Nayati Hospital where Gupta was admitted.Prashant Agyani, media advisor with Nayati Hospital, said Gupta, who was 98 years’ old, approached the hospital on May 29, 2020.“He was in a serious condition, suffering from UTI (urinary tract infection), weakness, breathlessness and other ailments. Because of his age, we got him hospitalised under the most vulnerable patient category,” said Agyani. He said initially Gupta was put on five-litre oxygen support.A dedicated team of doctors and paramedical staff was tasked with handling the case, he said. With regular treatment and proper medication, a massive improvement in Gupta’s health was witnessed.“We all were happy with the improvement and the way his body responded to the treatment. It took around 13 to 14 days for him to recover completely, and, on June 12, 2020, he was discharged,” he added.Gyan Chand Gupta’s son Arun Kumar Gupta thanked the doctors and called them the “real saviours”.“Indeed, it was a tough situation, but with the help of the doctors, my father has now recovered completely and by God’s grace he is healthy,” said Arun Kumar Gupta. His father had retired in 1983 as an executive engineer in the irrigation department and stays in the Gandhi Nagar area of Agra.On the senior Gupta’s recovery, Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh had tweeted: “97 years old Mr Gupta, a Covind 19 patient, discharged hale and hearty from L2 facility Nayati Agra. He is a motivation to all of us and ray of hope to all Covid patients, especially those of old age. Salute to Mr Gupta.”This was not the lone example showing the never say die spirit of doctors in UP.Another befitting example was of Maan Kunwar, 95, fondly known as “Jhansi Ki Rani”. Kunwar was admitted in the Covid ward of Rani Laxmi Bai Medical College in Jhansi on July 19, 2020. She won the battle against Covid in a mere seven days.“This happened because of her indomitable spirit and the medical staff did not mind her flare-ups,” said Dr Anshul Jain, superintendent in-charge of the Covid-19 hospital. She was asymptomatic but the RT-PCR test had found her positive, said her son Chote Lal, resident of Talpura, Jhansi. Recollecting his experience of treating Kunwar, Dr Jain said initially the patient was worried as she was away from her family members.“Patients at this age take time to adapt to the hospital environment, but later she gelled well. The junior doctors made her talk with her family on the phone and arranged video calls,” Dr Jain said.After recovery, she was discharged on the evening of July 25, 2020, but advised seven-day home quarantine in accordance with Covid protocol. Jhansi district magistrate Andhra Vamsi said whoever had good immunity and did not lead a sedentary lifestyle had fairly a good chance of overcoming this infection.“Healthy diet, physical exercise and boosting the immunity through balanced lifestyle and diet improves the lymphatic activity,” he said.There were several other elderly patients who were given a new lease of life by doctors.In Uttar Pradesh, Covid-19 has affected more than 17 lakh people, suggested data available with the health department. Of these, the data suggested that 1,90,000 people who got affected were over 60 years of age. Over 22,000 deaths have been reported in Uttar Pradesh so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/doctors-100-effort-gives-two-90-covid-patients-new-lease-of-life-in-uttar-pradesh-101625161718116.html

Police officers said the complainant Avinash Bidaya, 32, from the marketing department of Kwan Company, located on New Link Road, Andheri (West), approached the police claiming that Dr Rajesh Pandey introduced himself as the employee of Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital on June 1 and offered to organise a vaccination camp for their 218 employees.On June 3, Pandey sent an invoice of ₹294,840 and on July 4 he conducted the camp by giving the employees saline water instead of the Covidsheild vaccine. On July 8, he again sent an invoice of ₹12,636.When the employees did not receive the certificates and heard about the scam, they approached the Amboli police to complain.“We have booked Dr Rajesh Pandey and his accomplices. We are now investigating to find out who else among the 13 accused were present during the vaccination camp at Kwan,” said a police officer from Amboli police station.Vishwas Nangre Patil, joint commissioner of police (law and order) said that till now 10 FIRs have been registered, nine in Mumbai and one in Thane against the accused.The vaccine given by the accused after April 23 was saline water, however, the vaccine given to people before this date (April 23) could have been a mixture of expired Covidsheild and saline water or the doses admixture could have been less. The police are still to establish the source of the Covidsheild which was procured by accused Dr Shivraj Pataria, his wife Nita and Dr Manish Tripathi.The vaccination scam came to light after Hiranandani Heritage society in Kandivli approached the police complaining they were duped by Mahendra Singh and four others who administered fake vaccines to their society members on May 30. The society members claimed they received the vaccination certificates, but they had names of different hospitals and different dates, but when the residents checked the Co-WIN portal, their status was shown as “yet to receive the first dose.”Thereafter, eight more cases have been filed at Versova, Borivli, Bangur Nagar and Khar, Samta Nagar police stations against the same group. So far, police have arrested 13 accused and are on the lookout for two more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-vaccination-scam-ninth-fir-registered-218-from-andheri-firm-given-saline-101625161537568.html

The society will also have to inform the nearest police station to have one police officer present at the site. The BMC has also asked housing societies to do due diligence to verify the genuineness of the vaccine and the hospital staff giving it. Citizens have been requested to download their vaccine certificate on the spot. The BMC has also asked societies to hold a meeting and approve the plan in the general body meeting. The BMC has reiterated the societies should sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the private hospital undertaking the drive. The SOP issued by the health department of the BMC dated June 29, read: “In view of various instances of illegal vaccination drives brought to the notice of BMC, it is necessary to reinforce roles and responsibilities of Private Covid Vaccination Centres (PCVC) and housing societies mentioned in earlier guidelines. The housing society will have to display the details regarding the date of vaccination, the name of the PCVC engaged, charges per dose for a beneficiary on the notice board of the society.” The SOP adds: “It is the responsibility of the housing society to inform the details regarding the date of vaccination, name of the PCVC engaged to the respective medical officer of health and local police station at least three days in advance. The society should also intimate the local police station to ensure a police officer is present at the site of the vaccination drive.” The BMC had in May issued guidelines for conducting vaccination drive at housing societies and at workplace. However, in second of week of June, a major vaccine scam broke out in a housing society at Kandivli, wherein over 390 citizens were given fake vaccines. Post this, multiple first information reports (FIR) were filed with the Mumbai Police. The BMC’s investigation into the Kandivli incident had also found that the society did not sign MOU with the hospital, nor did it verify the credentials of those promising the vaccine. The housing society had also not informed the nodal officer of the BMC before undertaking such a drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vax-drive-in-mumbai-societies-new-sop-makes-informing-police-must-101625161417533.html

On its part, the BMC on receipt of a request for such a camp will verify the registration of private Covid vaccination centres (PCVC) on the Co-WIN portal. The BMC has also written to the registrar of cooperative housing societies and higher and technical education authorities to intimate all housing complexes and educational institutions under them the SOPs and guidelines. The division bench of chief justice Dipanbkar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Mumbai resident Siddharth Chandrashekhar, was informed that as per the directions of the court on July 29, and previous hearings guidelines and SOPs for organising vaccination camps, had been prepared and the same would be published for the public after it was approved and signed by the concerned officer. Chandrashekhar’s PIL had sought directions for booking vaccination slots on the Co-WIN portal, easy and accessible to the general public and the elderly. After advocate, Anita Shekhar-Castellino, who represented Chandrashekhar drew the attention of the bench to news reports of fake vaccination camps, the court had directed the police to take strict action against the perpetrators and also asked the BMC to frame mandatory guidelines to be followed by organisers of such camps. While making submissions on behalf of the police, chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare informed the bench that investigations had revealed that the 2,053 victims had been injected with saline water and no adverse effects were reported from those who were inoculated with the fake vaccines. Sakhare submitted the draft guidelines which mentioned that a member of the housing society, commercial entity or educational institution would be appointed as a nodal officer and would be entrusted with the task of monitoring vaccination activities at the camp. The BMC and police would provide support to the camps as and when required but it would be the responsibility of the nodal officers to ensure that all vaccination centre protocols were followed diligently. After hearing the submissions the court expressed satisfaction and directed the BMC to ensure that the same was made known to the general public as soon as possible and posted a hearing of the PIL for next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-submits-vax-guidelines-to-high-court-101625161297578.html
01-07-2021||Mumbai||15K reconciliation Covid deaths added; Maharashtra to study pattern in first, second wave||In the second wave of the pandemic, around 15,000 backlog deaths related to novel coronavirus have been added to the cumulative fatality in the state. Now, the state Covid-19 death audit committee will conduct a study on the fatalities reported in the first and second waves to understand the epidemiological characteristics of Sars-Cov-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) and its variants.In the state, till May 30, a total of 121,945 citizens have succumbed to the Covid since its outbreak in March 2020. However, the experts have observed that district-wise death rates have varied in the first and second waves. For instance, in the first wave, the highest death rate was recorded in Bhiwandi, Latur, Nagpur rural and Solapur, while in the second wave, rural areas like Nanded rural, Malegaon, Kolhapur, Sangli, Ratnagiri, Amravati rural have registered the highest fatality.Taking this into consideration, experts from the state Covid-19 death audit committee have decided to study each death to find out any hidden clues about the changing pattern of the new virus which is still 16 months old.“We have decided to start a comparative study of the deaths recorded in the first and second wave which may help us to understand the new characteristics of the virus. We need to check if symptoms of infection among the deceased patients varied from last year. If we can find any hidden clue, it may also help us in the third wave,” said Dr Avinash Supe, in charge of the committee.It has been observed that many of the rural areas have recorded a high fatality rate. Experts believe that this could be attributed to the variant of Sars-Cov-2.“A few variants of Sars-Cov-2 have been found in Ratnagiri where the fatality rate has been high. So, there is a possibility that it is related to the mutated virus but until we do the study, it would be unscientific to confirm any hypothesis,” he said.The state’s overall case fatality rate stands at 2.01%. In the first wave, the case fatality rate in the state was 2.7%, which means that for every hundred positive cases, Maharashtra witnessed around three deaths. During the second wave, the mortality rate has fallen to 0.71%“The disease load was tremendously high in the second wave but the fatality was under control. This could be because of a variant that is more infectious but deadly. This has been observed in all age groups,” said Dr Pradip Awate, surveillance officer in Maharashtra’s epidemic control department.Dr Sanjay Salunke, civil surgeon at Sangli, said most hospitals mention Covid-19 as the primary cause of death on the application. But it is officially confirmed only after the auditing team puts a confirmation stamp on it. “All districts have Covid death audit committees that examine health complications or casualties that are part of the deceased patient’s medical reports before confirming the death as Covid or non-Covid. If a deceased patient had too many health complications which the district-level experts fail to categorise, then it is referred to the state audit committee,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/15k-reconciliation-covid-deaths-added-maharashtra-to-study-pattern-in-first-second-wave-101625161177607.html

A series of protests in 2019, followed by the pandemic, derailed the project, said university officials“The executive council approved that an elaborate feasibility report and a proposal be made and submitted to the government for approval and funding of JMI medical college and 350-bedded hospital,” the university said in a statement on Thursday.The university will also appoint consultants for the proposal and start the project afresh, said the vice-chancellor. Akhtar said, “I had met the Prime Minister in 2019 and discussed the demand for a medical college put forward by the Jamia fraternity. The government gave us an assurance on the project but then the pandemic disrupted everything. There were some issues with procuring land as well. But this is the first time a statutory body has undertaken the task of preparing a proposal and sending it to the government for funding.”After losing several teachers, staff, and students to Covid-19, the university is also planning to set up a 50-bed Covid care centre on its campus ahead of the expected third wave. “The executive council approved starting of a 50-bedded Covid care centre under Ansari health centre of the university for JMI staff and wards only. It will provide preliminary care to patients affected during the expected third wave of Covid-19,” said university officials. Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University are also planning to set up Covid care centres on the campus.“We will have oxygen facilities at the centre.

Metro officials said the Dhansa bus stand metro station on the Dwarka-Najafgarh-Dhansa bus stand corridor will be the first ever underground metro station of the network to have an entire underground floor dedicated for parking vehicles. “The parking facility will be integrated with the main station area, where vehicle users will be able to park their cars and two-wheelers and then proceed to the concourse of the station directly using lifts and escalators,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. Officials explained the Dhansa bus stand station has been designed as a four-level underground structure, with the platform at the bottom—at an approximate depth of 18 metres, followed by the concourse, and then an entire floor for parking above it. The parking facility will have space for about 110 cars and 185 two-wheelers and will be connected to the station by lifts and escalators. The design has also made provision for property development activities at the ground level. “The parking facility will benefit local residents as the adjoining areas are extremely congested with very little space for parking vehicles. There will be two entry/exit facilities, which will connect the parking lot both with the surface above and the platform below. The Delhi Metro currently operates parking lots in about 100 metro stations across the network,” said DMRC officials. The 4.3km Dwarka-Najafgarh section on the Grey Line is already functional and was opened for public in October 2019. However, a small section of the corridor, extending the line up to Dhansa bus stand located at the Delhi-Haryana border, is still under construction. The DMRC on Thursday said the work on the 1.8km stretch connecting Najafgarh with Dhansa bus stand is “almost complete”. Metro officials said the section connecting to Dhansa bus stand maybe made operational by July end. “With the completion of this section, the Dwarka-Dhansa bus stand Grey Line corridor will be 6.1km long with four stations. This extension will immensely benefit the residents of the interior areas around Najafgarh. All efforts are being made to open the Najafgarh - Dhansa bus stand section sometime later this month after complying with all statutory requirements,” said Dayal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dmrc-builds-its-first-ever-underground-integrated-parking-at-dhansa-101625161058812.html

The minimum temperature was recorded at 31.7 degrees Celsius, four degrees above the season’s normal. According to IMD records, both in 2012 and 1987, the maximum temperature in Delhi touched 43.5 degrees Celsius on July 2. On Wednesday, Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 43.5 degrees Celsius, which was the highest of the season. The minimum temperature on Wednesday was 28.2 degrees Celsius.

In the plains, heatwave days are classified – when the maximum temperature crosses 40 degrees Celsius, and when the day temperature exceeds the region’s normal maximum temperature by 4.5 degrees Celsius. A severe heatwave is declared when there is a departure of 6.5 degrees Celsius or above from normal temperatures.Met officials said a brief breather from the heatwave is expected on Friday, forecasting light rain and thunderstorm in parts of Delhi and NCR, which is expected to bring down the temperatures by 1-2 degrees. “There will be a brief relief from the high temperatures, but temperatures are still expected to be above the 40-degree mark,” said a senior Met official. Officials said that the monsoon is unlikely to reach Delhi till at least July 8. “The monsoon arrival is unlikely before July 8, and till then the temperatures are likely to remain high. Usually, such high temperatures are seen in Delhi till June second week, but this time we are receiving hot and dry westerly winds that are keeping the mercury levels up,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (climate change and meteorology) at Skymet Weather, a private forecaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-registers-highest-max-temp-for-july-in-last-nine-years-imd-101625160999253.html

One of the doctors was taken to the red area in the AIIMS trauma bay earmarked for the most serious cases. The doctor was taken for a CT scan to assess the injury sustained from a metal rod, said a doctor from the hospital. “(The) fight started over a discussion on how Covid-19 is being spread by doctors in Gautam Nagar and all local residents are being put at risk by letting them (doctors) stay there,” said the doctor. The incident comes to the fore on National Doctors’ Day, which is celebrated on July 1 every year in honour of legendary physician and former chief minister of West Bengal Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy, whose birth and death anniversaries fall on the same day. The Indian Medical Association declared the theme of this year’s celebration as Save the Saviours Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said on Wednesday night, the two doctors went to an eatery named Bhagat Singh Verma Paranthe Wala in Gautam Nagar and allegedly consumed alcohol with the owner of the shop, Bhagat Singh. Later, an argument broke out and both the parties assaulted each other. “The two doctors as well as Singh and his son Abhishek sustained injuries in the fight, Their statements were recorded for legal action. Later, both the parties compromised and resolved the issue among themselves. However, we have initiated our legal enquiry into the matter. Further action would be taken accordingly,” said Thakur. On the allegations of the doctors that they were referred to as carriers of Covid-19 and assaulted for protesting against such remarks, police said both the parties have made allegations that are being looked into.The incident did not go well with the medical community. The AIIMS Resident Doctors’ Association came out with a tweet which read, “Gift on doctors’ day. Junior resident doctor of AIIMS beaten by goons and shopkeeper in Gautam Nagar at midnight saying that you doctors are spreading COVID 19! Shocked. Can @DCPSEastDelhi assure us some action? Culprits must be arrested immediately.” The Federation of All India Medical Associations (FAIMA) demanded a central protection law be brought in to punish those who assault doctors and other health professionals. In June, the organisations had held a black ribbon protest after several instances of violence against doctors surfaced from across India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-junior-doctors-hurt-after-scuffle-with-shopkeeper-101625160997488.html

01-07-2021||Other||Delhi govt outlines fee rules for 460 private schools||New Delhi: Three days after the Supreme Court refused to stay the Delhi high court order on annual fee collection by 460 private schools, the Delhi government on Thursday issued guidelines for the process of collecting last academic year’s annual charges and development fee retrospectively for these schools. On May 31, the high court set aside two orders, prohibiting private schools from collecting annual charges and development fees during the Covid-induced lockdown, issued last year. The court directed that schools may collect these charges for the last academic year retrospectively in six monthly instalments starting from June 10, but only after applying a 15% reduction on total school fees in lieu of facilities not used by students during the lockdown. The court also allowed schools to charge the whole fee, including tuition fee and other charges, for the 2021-22 academic year.“In order to clear the confusion and give much-needed relief to parents, Delhi government has issued an order to private schools to charge fees on monthly basis, under approved heads only but with a 15% deduction in the fees for academic year 2020-21,” said a statement issued by the government on Thursday.For instance, if the monthly fee of the school in the academic session 2020-21 is ₹3,000, the schools are entitled to collect monthly fee of ₹2,550 following a deduction of 15%. “If the school has collected the fee in excess to the direction referred above, the same shall be refunded to the parents or adjusted in the subsequent month,” the statement said.The clarification came after several parents said that the schools were offering a 15% rebate in the annual and development fee component instead of the tuition fee.On Thursday, the Directorate of Education (DoE) asked schools not to debar any student from ongoing activities of the school or strike off their names from the school rolls if the parents are unable to pay the fee. The state education department also said that the order is applicable only on the 460 schools which petitioned the high court.“If any individual request is made by the parent/ward finding it difficult to remit annual fees for the academic year 2020-21 in the above terms, the school management (is) to consider such representation on a case-to-case basis sympathetically,” stated a circular issued by Director (Education) Udit Prakash Rai to private schools on Thursday.The order directed that schools cannot charge transportation fee, collect fee on a quarterly basis, increase their fee this academic session until further orders. A senior education department official said that apart from the 460 petitioner schools, the remaining private schools cannot charge annual and development fee. “The petitioner schools had moved court for the annual and development charges and we are now enforcing the court order on it. The remaining schools will follow DOE orders issued in April and August last year,” the official said.“[petitioner schools] shall neither stop payment of monthly salary nor reduce the existing total emolument to the teaching and non-teaching staff of their schools in the name of non-availability of total funds and arrange the funds in case of any shortfalls from the society/trust running the school,” the order stated.Advocate Kamal Gupta, who appeared for the Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools in the case, said “These directives are in contempt. What has been dealt with and allowed in courts is annual and development charges with a discount of 15%. Tuition fee or reduction in it was never an issue in the court and was thus, never dealt with or reduced. If we charged other earmarked levies like transport, caution money, registration and admission fee, computers, medical and activities, then we would have given a 15% discount on everything. But when schools are charging on three heads, where is the question of giving a discount on tuition fee?”Activists and parents welcomed the government intervention. Advocate Shikha Bagga, secretary at NGO Justice for All who represented parents in the case, said, “The DoE circular was much needed to clarify the actual fees that can be charged as per the orders from the high court. This is also subject to the outcome of the appeals scheduled in the high court on July 12. Schools would now need to refund the amount collected in excess, after deliberate misreading of order.”Delhi Parents Association president Aprajita Gautam said they had been receiving multiple complaints from parents on the fee collection issue. “This is a welcome order but the order mentions petitioner schools. What about the rest of the private schools? The order isn’t clear about that. In case of violation of the order, the education department should opt for takeover instead of passing the order for inspection. Also, since a double-bench hearing is scheduled for July 12 on the same matter in the high court, the department could have waited before issuing these directives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-outlines-fee-rules-for-460-private-schools-101625160877576.html

01-07-2021||Noida||Gang involved in over 500 vehicle thefts in NCR busted||Noida: Five members of a gang involved in over 500 cases of vehicle theft in Delhi-NCR were arrested on Thursday, police said. Ten vehicles were recovered from them, they said. The suspects were identified as Harun, Gulfam, Amit, Sajid and Yusuf.According to police, the gang had been active for over seven years and its leader, Harun, has been nabbed for the first time. At least four more members of the gang have been identified and efforts are on to arrest them, police said. “The suspects were involved in a few thefts under the Sector 24 police jurisdiction a while back and were captured in the CCTV footage. They were arrested in a joint effort by teams from sectors 24 and 58 police and the anti-vehicle theft unit,” said a senior police official. Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), zone 1, said that the gang would roam around and target a parked luxury vehicle. “They kept tools and master key fobs with them, along with requisite softwares to break into cars. In June alone, they have stolen 18 vehicles in NCR and over 500 so far in the past seven years. They would change the engine and chassis numbers of the vehicles and sell them in Delhi, Punjab, Bihar, Jharkhand, Nepal, and Jammu and Kashmir. The gang was also involved in vehicle modification,” said the ACP. The gang would use code ‘pigeon’ for the vehicles and was known as the pigeon gang in its circle, said police. “We have also identified a Delhi-based scrap dealer to whom a lot of vehicles were sold by the gang. SUVs like Fortuner or Innova were sold for over ₹3 lakh, while Scorpio for ₹2.5 lakh,” said Verma. According to police, the suspects would also steal vehicles involved in accidents which were sold for parts and their specifics used to produce documents of other stolen cars. Police said they have also recovered several sets of duplicate number plates, key fobs, and tools from them. The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gang-involved-in-over-500-vehicle-thefts-in-ncr-busted-101625160397444.html
01-07-2021||Noida||Traders at Sector 18 market ask Noida authority to waive off parking charges||Noida: Traders have claimed that the footfall at the Sector 18 market is almost zero due to “high” parking rates in the area and asked the Noida authority to waive off the parking fees for a few months.According to SK Jain, president of the Sector 18 Market Association, high parking charges are a deterrent for shoppers to come to the market. “We earlier used to have walking crowd in the market because of the large number of offices located here. But now, since most of the offices are closed, we can only rely on those customers who prefer to visit the market for shopping. But even such shoppers are driven away from the market due to the high parking charges here,” said Jain.The parking rates at the Sector 18 market for four wheelers are ₹50 for the first two hours and ₹50 for subsequent hours. Similarly, for two wheelers, the charges are ₹25 for the first two hours and ₹25 for each subsequent hour.Amit Jain, who owns a watch showroom at the market, believes that the high parking charges have not just reduced the number of shoppers, but almost stopped them from coming to the market. “The business has been badly hit due to the Covid pandemic. On top of that, the high parking charges are driving customers away from the market. A shopper usually spends 2-3 hours at the market. Why would they pay ₹100 for parking charges when they can easily order online the same product?” said Amit.Last week, the market association wrote a letter to the Noida authority chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari, requesting her to waive off the parking charges in the market until all restrictions are lifted by the district administration.“After the lifting of lockdown last year, you had accepting our demands and waived off the parking fee in Sector 18 for about four months. We sincerely thank you again for providing this facility. Now since restrictions have not been removed completely, with weekend and night curfew still imposed, we request you to keep the parking free at least till the restrictions imposed due to the pandemic are removed completely.” When asked, Maheshwari said that the authority has no plans to reduce the parking charges or waive off the fees.“We had accepted the association’s demand last year. However, there are no such plans this year — neither to reduce the parking charges nor to waive off for a limited period,” said Maheshwari.Another issue that the traders say has been a nuisance to shop owners as well as shoppers is the frequent clipping (jamming of tyres) of four wheelers and lifting (in case of two wheelers) of vehicles by the parking contractors.As per the Noida authority officials, the frequency of clipping of cars parked in ‘no parking’ zone has been increased after allegations that the contractors were making money by charging for cars parked in that zone as well.“After these allegations were raised by the Sector 18 Market Association, the contractors were told that if any vehicle is found parked in the ‘no parking’ zone, they will be held responsible. Hence, they were told to clip the vehicles and fine them if found in the ‘no parking’ zone. Currently, around 25-30 vehicles are being clipped in a day at the market,” said an authority official requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traders-at-sector-18-market-ask-noida-authority-to-waive-off-parking-charges-101625160337473.html
01-07-2021||Noida||Noida: Govt school vandalised, some goods stolen||Noida: A primary government school in Noida’s Sector 12 has been allegedly vandalised by unidentified persons who also decamped with furniture and bathroom fittings, among other things. The school was closed in the wake of the pandemic, officials said.The incident came to the fore on Thursday morning when the school’s staff visited the establishment. “The locks were broken, and furniture and electrical fittings were missing. The miscreants have taken the sports equipment which had been purchased recently. Kits from science and computer labs were missing. They didn’t even leave washroom fittings,” said Sapna, principal-in-charge of the school. The rooms had also been vandalised, she said, adding that there are no CCTV cameras on the school premises. “We keep visiting the school every few days to keep an eye on things. The last inspection had taken place less than two weeks ago. The staff, who have to return to work from today, noticed the theft,” said Sapna. The school authorities have filed a complaint with the Sector 24 police station. “Our team visited the school. We have found a few footprints there. The thieves decamped with aluminium toilet fittings and electrical fittings, among other items. A probe in the matter is underway,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police, zone 1. Police officials said that they suspect some locals to be behind the incident and that the footage from a nearby CCTV camera is being looked at.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-govt-school-vandalised-some-goods-stolen-101625160337990.html
01-07-2021||Noida||Clash at UP Gate: Ghaziabad police book 200 unidentified farmers||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad police have booked 200 unidentified members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) in connection with an incident on Wednesday in which a group of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters and farmers protesting the Centre’s three farm laws had allegedly clashed at UP Gate on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME). Police said that they received complaints from both the groups, but prima facie found that the farmers’ group was the “aggressor” during the incident. The FIR was registered at Kaushambi police station under IPC sections for rioting, use of criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation, voluntarily causing hurt, and causing damages and criminal intimidation, police said. As per the FIR, unidentified suspects armed with sticks and swords attacked the BJP workers at the UP Gate and damaged their vehicles. “The FIR was registered against 200 unidentified farmers on the basis of complaint given to us. The farmers’ group also gave a complaint to us, but they seemed to be the aggressor group. So, their complaint was not registered. We held discussions with them on Thursday and will soon decide future course of action over their complaint,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2). “We have started an investigation in the case and are also trying to scan the available video and CCTV footages,” he added. The BKU said that they will launch a statewide protest against the “biased” police action. “Our farmers will protest at police stations across the state against the biased action. The incident on Wednesday was pre-planned and aimed to malign the farmers’ movement. They (BJP workers) came to our site area and the FIR was lodged against us. We condemn this,” said Dharmendra Malik, national media in-charge of BKU.The two groups had allegedly clashed when the BJP supporters were waiting on the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway to welcome a party leader who was to arrive from Delhi. The BJP supporters had alleged that unidentified farmers came from the other side of the DME and attacked them. Sanjeev Sharma, BJP city unit president, could not be contacted for a comment despite repeated attempts.Meanwhile, the farmers’ leaders said that the BJP workers were waving their party flags near to the camp of the farmers’ protest site and their cadres later started waving black flags in retaliation. In the melee, several BJP supporters, including women, suffered injuries and some of their vehicles were damaged, the BJP supporters alleged. However, the farmers’ leaders said that the BJP workers damaged their vehicles on their own and were trying to malign the “peaceful” protest by the farmers. “Our protest has remained peaceful. We came to know that police have not registered our complaint, but registered a case against our farmers. We will intensify our protest against this, and a decision will soon be taken in a meeting of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha. The FIR against farmers is uncalled for and the action is biased,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, UP Gate site spokesperson of Samyukta Kisan Morcha. The farmers are protesting at the UP Gate site since November 26 last year and demanding rollback of the three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/clash-at-up-gate-ghaziabad-police-book-200-unidentified-farmers-101625160278635.html

The enforcement team demolished the colonies, all of which were in the initial stage of development with demarcated plots, five to six under-construction structures, and boundary walls.RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that the developers had demarcated large plots, and planned to sell those to small factory owners and transporters. “They had not taken any permission from the department for developing a colony or changing the land use. The plots were being developed and sold illegally,” Bhath said.Locals have revealed that a resident of Dhana village was developing this colony illegally. “It appears that this person was also involved in developing illegal colonies in the area earlier. A case will be registered against these people within a week,” Bhath added.These three colonies were spread over 15 acres and the DTCP officials had to use two earth-moving machines to demolish the structures. “Five under-construction structures, 30 plinths, and boundary walls were cleared on this land. As many as 150 officials of the Gurugram police ensured law-and-order during the demolition drive,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, Gurugram.The enforcement team also said that it will conduct an awareness workshop in villages around IMT Manesar and tell landowners about how they could obtain licences and permissions from the DTCP to set up affordable projects, farmhouses, and similar developments without violating the rules. “This exercise will be carried out across the district,” said the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-demolishes-3-illegal-colonies-in-manesar-101625160098944.html
01-07-2021||Gurugram||Ambience underpass nears completion, city MO reviews work||With the completion of over 98% work on the Sirhaul underpass near Ambience Mall, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said on Thursday that it would be done by the end of July and opened for traffic in the first week of August.NHAI officials said this during a review visit by Gurugram MP Rao Inderjit Singh on Thursday morning. During his visit, Singh asked NHAI officials to expedite work on the project as it would help people, travelling to Delhi, avoid taking a U-turn at Rajokri.Earlier on Thursday morning, Singh took stock of the work and asked officials of the authority to complete the project at the earliest as it would largely improve the traffic situation at the Sirhaul border. “Several projects in Gurugram, which comes under the NHAI, are underway. Several projects such as underpasses at Hero Honda Chowk, Iffco Chowk, and Rajiv Chowk have been completed. These projects have improved the traffic situation, and this underpass will further make commuting easier for the residents,” said Singh.The deadline for the completion of work on the Sirhaul underpass, which had started on March 5, 2019, was September 4, 2020. However, the November 2019 ban on construction work due to air pollution, and the coronavirus-imposed nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020, stalled the project work twice. NHAI officials, however, said that they had continued working on the project despite intermittent breakdowns, and it is almost over.“About 98.67% of the work on the four-lane underpass is done and only a 15-metre stretch inside the tunnel is incomplete, which shall be completed by the end of July. We will open the underpass for traffic in the first week of August,” said Gaurav Mittal, senior manager, NHAI.The length of the U-turn underpass is 377 metres, while the entire stretch including access roads is 1.5-km-long — which includes a 559-metre-long and 7-metre-wide service road. The designated speed in this underpass has been set at 40kmph.NHAI project director Shashi Bhushan said that the width of the underpass is 14 metres and vertical clearance of the tunnel is 5.5 metres. LED lights of 75 watts have been installed, and signages and dividers have been constructed as per the NHAI norms.The flyover at Shankar Chowk, which is functional, was also built as part of this project. This grade-separated flyover has been designed for a motorable speed of 30kmph. It will be 455-metre-long with three lanes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ambience-underpass-nears-completion-city-mo-reviews-work-101625160097503.html

The elderly woman’s grandson Shubham spoke to the PM.“Shubham is very happy with Digital India, what is your experience with the telemedicine initiative?” the PM asked Dr Bhupendra Singh.“When the pandemic came a year ago, we were worried about how patients will get treatment as they won’t be able to come (to hospital)? But telemedicine has not only made it easy to prescribe medicines but also helps us understand the behaviour of patients just as if we were face-to-face,” said Dr Singh, who is treating the woman patient from Bihar.“E-Sanjeevani is a better alternative. Old records can be uploaded for reviews during consultations,” said Dr Singh.Earlier, after extending his greetings on the National Doctors’ Day, the PM said, “Doctors have served humanity during the pandemic.”“KGMU has till now given consultancy to over two lakh patients and this is the highest among all other such facilities in the country,” said Dr Sheetal Verma, nodal officer of the telemedicine facility at KGMU. The Digital India programme was started on July 1, 2015. “It is due to the confidence of patients that we have helped the maximum number of patients in India and still the numbers are being added every day,” said Dr Sheetal.Lt Gen (Dr) Bipin Puri, vice chancellor of KGMU, said that it was indeed a momentous occasion and a matter of immense pride that the beneficiaries of e-Sanjeevani and doctors from KGMU were chosen for the interaction with PM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-modi-enquires-about-kgmu-tele-medicine-facility-during-virtual-interaction-with-doctor-101625159980648.html

The two leaders exchanged pleasantries. Later, the chief minister also tweeted birthday wishes to the SP chief: “I pray to Lord Ram for your good health and long life.”Union minister Nitin Gadkari, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Supriya Sule and Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin also tweeted birthday wishes to Yadav. Stalin called the SP chief “my brother” in the tweet and posted a picture of his sitting with Akhilesh along with the tweet.Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) national secretary Anil Dubey called on Yadav at the SP headquarters and greeted him with a bouquet. Akhilesh Yadav thanked them all.A delegation of saints from Ayodhya came to the party office and wished the SP chief, gifting him idols of Ram-Sita-Laxman.Party leaders in Lucknow, several other districts and even the Uttarakhand unit organised celebrations. Former MLC Ashu Malik organised a mass wedding of 48 underprivileged Hindu and Muslim women from three villages in his native district of Saharanpur on the eve of the party president’s birthday. On Thursday, the newly weds sought blessings from Akhilesh Yadav through video conferencing. Akhilesh Yadav sent the couples ₹25,000 cash each as a wedding gift. In several districts, party outfits organised blood donation and fruit distribution in hospitals. Party members from other states such as Kerala and Maharashtra, also greeted him at the party office.The SP’s Lucknow city unit office at Qaiserbagh too held an event that included cake-cutting and distribution of sweets.Will take jab once everyone in UP gets it: AkhileshSamajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday said he too will take Covid vaccine once all the people in the state got vaccinated. He was speaking to newspersons on the sidelines of an event held at the party office to mark his birthday.“People want to take the vaccine, but they are not getting it due to shortage. The government is not able to make the vaccine available. The entire vaccination system has collapsed,” he said.In January, Yadav had said that he would not take the vaccine, calling it “BJP vaccine” but he changed his stance early in June, saying that he too would take the vaccine.The SP chief also took a jibe at the BJP and said: “Those who were causing infighting in other people’s houses now have infighting in their own house.”Earlier, while addressing party colleagues and workers on his birthday, he said the party had many challenges before it. Describing the “rival party” as extremely shrewd, he said it resorted to lies, made false promises and spread hatred.“And today, we get a new wave of energy through so many wishes and blessings pouring in. Our confidence has risen further,” he said. He reiterated the party will win the 2022 UP assembly elections with the support and blessings of people.In the last more than four years, the BJP violated the Constitution and did not even honour the promises it made in the manifesto, he alleged.“People now want change,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-dials-akhilesh-on-his-birthday-gadkari-stalin-too-wish-samajwadi-party-chief-101625159979280.html
01-07-2021||Gurugram||Monsoon prep: GMDA constructs breakers at underpasses to prevent flooding||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) constructed speed breakers at entry and exit points of all underpasses in the city to control the flow of water and avoid flooding during monsoon, officials said on Thursday.Pradeep Kumar, the chief engineer for infrastructure-II division of GMDA, said, “When there is excessive rainfall, a sheet of water flows on the road and enters the underpasses, affecting the movement of traffic. In areas such as Mehrauli Road, water that gets accumulated on the roof of the malls and shops also flows onto the roads, which leads to flooding. To control this, foot-high speed breakers have been constructed at the entry and exit points of all underpasses in the city which will control the flow of water.”Last year in August, when the city received 118mm of rainfall in about six hours, at least seven of the city’s 11 underpasses were heavily flooded. Most of the underpasses were shut for hours for commuters. Three underpasses on Golf Course Road (at DLF Phase 1, Genpact Chowk and Bristol Chowk), two in Cyber City next to Shankar Chowk, and two others at Iffco Chowk and Rajiv Chowk on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway were submerged in rainwater and had to be closed for commuters at various points.Even in 2019, the underpasses at Iffco Chowk and Rajiv Chowk on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway had to be shut for commuters due to flooding during the monsoon.Meanwhile, officials also said that check dams have made in Aravallis to arrest stormwater in the forest.“We have made diversions near Golf Course Road to ensure that stormwater flows into the forest areas of Aravallis and waterlogging can be controlled on roads. This will help in groundwater recharge, along with ensuring availability of water for fauna in the region,” said a GMDA official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/monsoon-prep-gmda-constructs-breakers-at-underpasses-to-prevent-flooding-101625159978066.html
01-07-2021||Gurugram||MCG hands over Aravalli park to Hero MotoCorp for maintenance and upkeep||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) formally handed over the maintenance of Aravalli Biodiversity Park to Hero MotoCorp on Thursday, officials said. In April, the MCG had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Hero MotoCorp Limited for the ecological restoration and conservation of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park till 2031, but the handover got delayed owing to the second wave of Covid-19. Subhash Yadav, nodal officer for environment and sustainability wing of MCG, said, “Since the past week, we had been in talks with HeroMoto Corp for the final handover of maintenance of Aravalli Biodiversity Park. On Thursday, the process was finalised. As the park is already saturated in terms of plantation and the private firm will work on setting up an interpretation centre, creating public conveniences and an office complex, among others.” Yadav said the MCG will continue to look after the security of the park. “Now, MCG will focus on the security of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park. There are 16 security guards at the park, the salaries of whom will be paid by MCG and we will also repair infrastructure on a one-time basis, including walls or fences that are broken, so that the security of the park is strong,” added Yadav. According to the MoU, Hero Motorcorp Limited will maintain and beautify the Aravalli Biodiversity Park for a period of 10 years and spend ₹1.25 crore annually on maintaining the park under its corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding.Bharatendu Kabi, spokesperson for Hero MotoCorp, said, “Conservation and sustainable development initiatives are integral to preserving biodiversity, and our adoption of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Gurugram is a constructive step in that direction. In partnership with the MCG, we will soon put in place a holistic plan to maintain the park and protect its key habitats and species.” Vijay Dhasmana, an eco-restoration practitioner, who helmed the development of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park and will now work as an advisor, said, “One of the most important things for us is to secure the land and MCG has assured us that they will help us with that. We will now work on the in situ interpretation, guided walks in nature trails once the Covid-19 situation improves and also enhance the biodiversity of the place.” The Aravalli Biodiversity Park is spread across 390 acres and has semi-arid vegetation, with around 300 native plants, 101,000 trees, 43,000 shrubs, and 185 different types of birds. IAmGurgaon, a non-government organisation (NGO), was looking after the maintenance of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park from 2014 till December last year when its contract with the MCG expired.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-hands-over-aravalli-park-to-hero-motocorp-for-maintenance-and-upkeep-101625159868455.html

Police said the suspects had been duping each victim of at least $250 ( ₹18,621.50) on the pretext of providing technical support and software development through bogus websites.The suspects — identified as Man Mohan Singh of Uttarakhand’s Nainital and Nishant Padhiar of Jharkhand’s Tata Nagar — live in rented accommodations in sectors 38 and 48, respectively. Their aide — Sunil Kumar of Haryana’s Hisar, who was also involved in the crime, is still on the run, according to the police.Police said that they made at least ₹2 crore in the past two years and paid their workers between ₹20,000 and ₹30,000 per month.Gurugram police commissioner KK Rao said that Singh and Padhiar had formed a company, Paciwire Innovair Solutions Private Limited, in 2018, and had an equal partnership. “Padhiar worked as a manager of the call centre for the past two years. Earlier, they used to work on domestic money projects, and the company started a website development project two years ago. But it didn’t do well. In 2019, they started a computer troubleshooting and software development company, and began duping US nationals,” Rao said.The company had 12 tele-callers who used to make calls and dupe US nationals, police said, adding that the employees were unaware of the company’s fraudulent activities.Rao said the suspects had downloaded RingCentral website’s dialer to operate string website to transfer payment and had created a website That’s Them, and they used to search for all area codes and cellphone numbers of US citizens. The executives used to call on the given numbers, and they had also uploaded two toll-free numbers to resolve technical issues faced by the customers.Police said the executives used to sell technical support to people facing issues with computers and laptops fraudulently. They also offered to develop software for them, but Padhiar, who allegedly used to handle technical operations, voice and accent training, along with process training, used to stop taking their calls once the payments were done.Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police, DLF, said the executives also duped people on the pretext of developing websites for them or their companies. “They used to send emails to people through a payment processing platform, allowing merchants to accept credit card payments on their applications and websites, where they provided a link of payments with different options. The money used to get transferred to their company account through the stripe website, which was synchronised to it,” Goel said.They had rented an office in IRIS Tech Park in Sector 48 for nearly ₹50,000 per month. The suspects could not give the victims the company’s registration certificate, DOT licence, source of customers, source of data, and mode of payment, Goel added.A case was registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 420 (cheating), and IT Act sections 66D and 75 at the Cyber Crime police station. The arrested two suspects were produced before a court on Wednesday and were sent to a 14-day judicial custody, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fake-call-centre-busted-for-duping-us-citizens-on-pretext-of-tech-support-101625159869109.html

Till now, 1,426,475 doses have been administered in the district, the highest in the state. “The department on Thursday exceeded its target of administering 50,000 doses in a day to observe Doctors’ Day. Now, the plan is to administer about 20,000 doses a day. Based on the availability of the vaccine, it can be increased further. However, due to Gurugram’s location, where migration is extremely high, it is difficult to say when the entire population will be covered. But the department will continue to conduct mega vaccination drive based on the state government’s directive,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer for Gurugram. According to the health department data, over 38, 778 people in the 18-45 age group and 12,066 above 45 years took the vaccine shot. Overall, 42,907 people took their first dose, while 8,334 took the second dose of the vaccine at 220 vaccination centres. At the Huda City Centre Metro station, the managing director of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), Mangu Singh, was also present during the inauguration. DMRC tweeted: “DMRC-MD Dr Mangu Singh and chief medical officer, Gurugram Dr Virender Yadav today inaugurated a vaccination centre at Huda City Centre metro station. The centre has been opened in order to facilitate everybody to get their vaccination (Covishield) done for free of cost without any registration or slot booking.”People stood in a queue at the entrance of the South Court of the Metro station from 8am. Divya Madan, a resident of Sector 11, who reached the site around 8.30am, waited for more than two hours to get the vaccine shot. “Many government health centres are overcrowded. It stopped me from getting vaccinated. I was not expecting that many people will be aware of the vaccination centre in a metro station.” YK Garg, 50, a resident of Sector 56, also reached the site to get vaccinated without hassle. “After reading about the vaccination centre in a newspaper, I directly reached the site.” Mudita, 26, who works in the merchandise sector, came along with her office staff to take the vaccine shot. “Huda Metro station is easily accessible. Therefore, I decided to come along with the staff, who cannot do online registration and slot booking.” According to Yadav, the target was to administer at least 250 doses, while they administered 333 doses, with 16 people taking the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-over-51k-take-vaccine-shot-333-at-huda-city-centre-metro-station-101625159866966.html
01-07-2021||Gurugram||Four held for forging death certificate of ‘alive and well’ man to claim insurance of ₹30L||The police on Thursday arrested four persons, including a former insurance agent, on charges of forging the death certificate of the chairman of a prominent university and attempting to dupe him and his family of insurance money of ₹30 lakh. The family is currently overseas and confirmed to HT that the chairman is doing well. They got wind of the fraud only when a claims surveyor visited their home in South City-1 for verification purposes on June 20 and the same day they alerted the police. While there were four policies in the chairman’s name, with a total claim amount of ₹10.5 crore, police said the fraudsters had initiated the process to claim only one of the policies that amounted to ₹30 lakh.After coming to know about the claim from the surveyor, the wife of the chairman complained to the police that a fraudulent insurance claim has been made on her behalf by impostors. “The data regarding my nomineeship in four insurance policies of my husband were leaked from the insurance company and resultantly, some nefarious elements hatched a plan to fraudulently dupe us of the insurance amount. It is outrageous how private and confidential data of this nature could be leaked by the insurance company and a proper investigation into it may kindly be undertaken,” she said in her complaint. She said the suspects falsely registered the death of her husband with the registrar of births and deaths at the Sector 10 government hospital and forged cremation records to obtain a death certificate dated April 11. Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said the family was fearful about the motives of the gang. “They were concerned over the safety of their personal information, which they said was in the hands of the fraudsters. They were apprehensive about falling victim to cybercrime such as hacking, counterfeiting of documents and data theft. So, we investigated all angles of the case,” he said, adding that the entire claims process was done online. Sangwan said they tracked the duo who raised the claim using their IP address and mobile phone records available with the insurance firm. One of the suspects had stolen insurance policy documents during his stint with the insurance company, he said. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said based on details of the policyholder and nominee, they prepared a fake driving licence and Aadhaar card in the name of the nominee. “They used these fake documents to open an account with the help of their friend, an agent of a leading private bank in the city. They sent all documents to the claims department and were expecting to cash the claim within 10 days,” he said. The suspects were identified as Rajnikant Kumar, the mastermind, who earlier worked with the insurance company, Durgesh Dubey, a call centre employee, Naval Kishore, who helped with the opening of the bank account, and Nitish Kumar, a Delhi-based property dealer. Another gang member, who arranged for the death certificate, has been identified and will be arrested soon, the police said. Sangwan said the gang members created a fake email account in the name of the nominee and sent the forged documents to claim the insurance money from that ID. “Of the four suspects, two earlier worked with insurance companies and were aware of the claims process and the documents required. Physical verification is not mandatory for insurance claims of less than ₹40 lakh. Aware of this fact, the accused made one insurance claim of ₹30 lakh. However, they were unaware that the policyholder had multiple policies with the same company, amounting to ₹10.5 crore,” he said. Once a policy claim with a death certificate is made, all other policies in the name of that person are merged into the claim application, following which the insurance company sends a team for physical verification. The fraudsters were unaware of the verification and the subsequent registration of an FIR at the Sector 29 police station. “The accused in question were on a temporary role in the back office for few months through a third party (outsourced),” said a spokesperson for the insurance company, adding that as a process, when an insurance claim is made (after death), the company checks its records and merges all insurance claims of a policyholder. This is done because the spouse/nominee may or may not be aware of all the insurance policies the policyholder had, or they might not have documents of all policies, the spokesperson explained. A case under sections 419,420,424,463,465,467,468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 43 and 66B of Information technology ACT 2008 was registered at Sector 29 police station on June 21. Sangwan said Kumar, a Jaipur native, moved to Gurugram in 2011 and in 2012, started working with an insurance company where he met Durgesh Dubey, who, at that time, was deployed in the back office of the insurance company. In 2014, Kumar moved to another insurance company where he worked till August 2019. In 2017, Dubey left the insurance company and started working with a call centre. Nitish and Kishore were school friends, while Naval was an acquaintance of Nitish, the police said. “Durgesh was seeking funds for his sister’s wedding when Kumar approached him with a plan to make money by forging insurance claims,” said Sangwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/four-held-for-forging-death-certificate-of-alive-and-well-man-to-claim-insurance-of-30l-101625159857701.html
01-07-2021||Gurugram||MCG to speed up revenue collection to stave off funds crunch||Facing a severe funds crunch, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja on Thursday directed officials to expedite revenue collection, during a review meeting at the MCG’s Sector 34 office.Ahuja called for a meeting on Wednesday night and issued an order stating that there is a “dire need to give impetus to revenue recoveries” as “revenue collections are far behind the budgetary targets.” So far, the MCG has recovered only 7% of its projected target of ₹235 crore through property tax collections, which is the main source of revenue for the MCG and accounts for more than 85% of its income.MCG’s cash crunch is a matter of concern, especially, given that it is the only government body in Gurugram which has a financial surplus and it regularly supports other agencies, such as the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran and even the National Highways Authority of India locally for developmental projects, both financially and with machinery.According to MCG officials privy to the matter, the civic body is yet to recover around ₹930 crore from property tax dues.While reviewing the property tax collections in the meeting, the commissioner said that dues from property tax defaulters, who have been given notices, should be recovered before the next meeting, scheduled for every second Tuesday of a month, as per the order issued on Wednesday.The MCG has compiled a list of more than 3,600 property tax defaulters, each of who owe the civic body more than ₹5 lakh in dues. Officials said that nearly half of the defaulters in this list have been issued notices warning of action unless they cleared their dues.“The commissioner has directed zonal taxation officer (ZTO) for taking whatever action is needed according to the rules for achieving full recovery and to complete the same prior to next review meeting. He further said that by imposing the duty of zone-wise employees, the property tax defaulters should be asked to deposit the property tax by giving information through the phone also,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO), MCG.As per the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, property owners are initially given 15 days to pay property tax dues after a notice is served, following which their sewerage and water connections may be cut if dues are still unpaid. If the property owner continues to default on the payment of property tax repeatedly, his or her property can be sealed and subsequently, auctioned off by the MCG to recover the tax dues.Ahuja also directed officials to make people aware of a 10% rebate on property tax payment currently on offer for the 2021-22 financial year, announced by the Haryana government, on pay property tax payments till July 31.He also directed officials that property tax bills for the financial year 2021-22 should be sent through registered posts immediately.Other decisions for increasing revenueAhuja directed all concerned zonal taxation officers to survey commercial institutions in their respective zones and send notices to the institutions located in the designated areas for procuring trade licences. He directed the MCG joint commissioners to supervise this work.Ahuja also directed officers concerned to collate data on all the mobile towers located within the MCG limits, to check how many are authorised, and to calculate the pending fees for the ones that are unauthorised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-speed-up-revenue-collection-to-stave-off-funds-crunch-101625159798096.html
01-07-2021||Noida||Light rain likely in Noida on Friday||Noida: Heatwave persisted for the third day in Noida on Thursday as the city continued receiving warm westerly winds, with no sign of southwest monsoon advancing towards the National Capital Region for the next seven days, experts said.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), there is a possibility of slight respite due to drizzling towards the evening on Friday and Saturday, however, the mercury will again spike from Sunday. The weatherman said that due to excessive heat and intrusion of moisture laden north-westerly winds in the region, there is possibility of formation of clouds that may bring some temporary relief.“There are chances of light rain due to the formation of convective clouds which are formed when the mercury is high and is accompanied by some moisture-laden winds. This could lead to drizzling on July 2, but possibly towards the evening. So there are chances that the heat wave could persist on Friday as well. The relief from the heat, however, would be very little on Friday and Saturday evening, and the temperature will rise again from Sunday. There are so far very less chances of monsoon advancement or arrival within the next seven days,” said Kuldeep’s Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.On Thursday, the IMD recorded a maximum and minimum temperature for Noida at 43.6°C and 33.6°C against 43°C and 30°C a day earlier.At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for the NCR, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 43.6°C, which is 6°C higher than the season’s average, and 31.7°C, which is 4°C higher than the season’s average, respectively.According to weather analysts, a heat wave occurs when the maximum temperature is either 45°C and above, or is over 40°C and at the same time above 5°C of the season’s average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/light-rain-likely-in-noida-on-friday-101625159317366.html

Learning from last year’s experience of issues with online education, this decision has been taken as many students were unable to study online due to issues with online connectivity. Funds of ₹1 crore for this quarter have been allocated for this project.“We realised that there are several issues and practical problems which students face while having online education. According to our study survey of last year’s studies, of a total of 232,000 students in Pune ZP 70,000 students were unable to study online. Also there is no accountability for students and nor for teachers. Children of Class 1 to 8 hardly study properly and parents need to be with them while online classes are going on,” said Ranjit Shivatare, vice-president of Pune Zilla Parishad.“We are now going to provide a physical revision practical book to each and every student from Class 1 to 8 for this academic year. These practical books will be subject-wise, and it will be delivered to the doorstep of every student. Teachers will be given the responsibility to take classes as per this practical book.” he added. Meanwhile to make it easy for students, Pune ZP is also developing a new mobile application. Through this app, a subject or a chapter will be taught in multiple ways, by adding videos, diagrams, pictures and audios. When asked about the implementation of this project, Shivatare said, “This project will start from this academic year, it will be on quarterly basis and our books are being checked and will now go for printing. In next 15 days the printing of these books will be completed and the project will be launched in all the schools of Pune ZP. In this quarter we have alloted ₹1 crore funds for this project and as per the further requirement more funds will be allocated in next quarter.”While students and parents have welcomed this move, Shantaram Kandale, a parent from Indapur taluka said, “Both my son and daughter, who are in Class 1 and 4 respectively, are struggling to study in online mode. We have only one smartphone at home and their school classes are mostly at the same time. Now if they get books at home, then it would certainly make studies easy for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/zp-to-hand-out-revision-practical-books-for-classes-1-8-in-rs-1-crore-project-101625159197452.html

Though the district health department had planned to inoculate at least 40,000 people without slot booking every day in July, with some 8,000-odd doses available it had no option than to give the jabs to only those who had booked their slots for Thursday.Going by sources, the situation is likely to persist in the first fortnight of July with fewer number of cluster vaccination centres administering jabs.District magistrate Suhas LY said that due to state-wide paucity of vaccines, the near-to-home vaccination is unlikely to take off in the first half of the month in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. “For the mega vaccination drive, we had sent a requisition of 100,000 doses for the first lot, before it was to kick off. However, as the state headquarters have to evenly distribute the available stock of vaccines, we could only get around 8,000 doses on Wednesday. As many as 6,789 persons were vaccinated at 37 government health centres on Thursday,” he said.Echoing similar views, district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that for Friday, the district health department has received around 8,000 doses. “Till more stock comes, we’ll continue vaccination with the available doses. The staff has been told to give jabs to only those who have booked their slots for that particular site. This practice will continue till further notice,” he said.According to the Co-WIN portal, till Thursday as many as 1,170,218 doses have been administered in the Gautam Budh Nagar district, of which 1,033,127 people have taken their first dose.In Ghaziabad as well, officials said they have been getting only 8,000-9,000 doses per day for the past two days.“For the cluster vaccination drive, we had planned to administer about 35,000-40,000 doses per day but the process has been hampered due to short supply. Still, we are creating sessions as per vaccine availability,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.Officials familiar with the development said they have learnt that supply will be restored within a fortnight. They added that during normal days, they run 90-100 sessions for vaccinations, which have reduced to about 40-42 sessions due to supply issues.“People come to our centre early to get the shots but with limited supply, we could only administer 200 doses in the morning and with great efforts, could manage 200 more doses by afternoon. There was a huge rush at our centre in the morning and we had to rope in the police for help. Normally, we administer 500-600 doses per day,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital.Under the cluster vaccination program which was to start from Thursday, the district had planned vaccination in 568 clusters in urban and rural areas with 9,176 sessions.“Several centres are not able to run their vaccination drives due to short supply. We are trying to provide doses to centres which have been initiated by local councilors or pradhans, however they are also getting few doses. We have told them that once the supply is regularised, sufficient doses will be provided,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/vax-shortage-mars-mega-vaccination-drive-in-noida-ghaziabad-101625159137396.html

01-07-2021||Kolkata||Dhankhar-TMC in face-off mode on eve of assembly budget session||A day before the beginning of the Bengal assembly’s budget session that Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar is scheduled to address, ties between Raj Bhawan and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) worsened further on Thursday with the ruling party releasing two photographs to insinuate a link between the main accused in the fake Covid-19 vaccination racket and Dhankhar. The TMC alleged again that the latter was an accused in the Jain hawala case in the 1990s.Though Dhankhar did not react to the allegations till 7 pm, political observers said his speech at the assembly on Friday may raise a storm.On June 28, chief minister Mamata alleged that Dhankhar was accused in the Jain hawala case and branded him “corrupt”. While rubbishing the allegation on that day, Dhankhar told the media that he was not bound to read out the speech prepared by the state government while inaugurating the budget session. “Am I supposed to read out everything that is written?” Dhankhar said on the evening of June 28.This triggered speculations because in February last year Dhankhar wanted to edit the speech prepared by the state for the budget session. The government rejected his suggestion. Dhankhar finally followed convention and read out the speech that was critical of the Citizenship Amendment Act.In January this year, Dhankhar criticised the government for not inviting him to the year’s first assembly session although the House conducted its business for only two days.On Wednesday, the Governor shot a letter to assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, saying he was “more saddened than anguished” at the allegation Banerjee made against him at the June 21 national speakers’ conference chaired by Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla.Banerjee complained to Om Birla that Dhankhar was interfering in the functioning of the assembly. Dhankhar also wrote to Banerjee that the allegation, that Raj Bhawan was not clearing some important bills passed by the assembly, is not true.“According to the intimation sent to me, the Governor will address the inauguration of the budget session tomorrow. As far his letter is concerned, I will reply to it later,” the speaker told HT on Thursday evening.During the day, TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy released two photographs, showing a man who allegedly worked as the security guard of Debanjan Deb, the main accused in the fake vaccination racket, standing near Dhankhar, his wife and two other women.“The man in the photograph is Arabinda Baidya, who worked as the security guard of Deb. In one photo, he can be seen standing behind Deb while in the other he can be seen standing near the Governor and his family,” Roy said at a press conference.Deb, an imposter who posed as an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer posted at the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), held at least two vaccination camps for the general public in Kolkata. Amikacin, an antibiotic, is suspected to have been used on a few hundred people. Deb also cheated some people of a few crores of rupees. The Centre has sought a report from the state on the fake vaccination camps.“We want the special investigation team formed by the Kolkata Police to probe this because we have learnt that that Baidya’s job was to take expensive gifts and envelopes to important people. It must be found out what he was doing at Raj Bhawan,” said Roy, implying that the photograph was taken at Raj Bhawan.Referring back to the Jain hawala case probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the 1990s, Roy said Dhankhar’s name is mentioned as an accused in the book ‘Bad Money Bad Politics- the untold hawala story’ written by Sanjay Kapoor.“The book says that Jagdeep Dhankhar, a former Janata Dal MP, received ₹12.25 lakh in three or four instalments. We all know that Dhankhar was a Janata Dal MP and served in the VP Singh government as a minister. Since the money transacted through hawala was used by terror groups, this angle should be probed as well as it involves national security,” said Roy.“The Centre should have probed the man’s background before posting him as a Governor. We will demand his recall and raise the issue before the President of India and also at the Parliament,” said Roy.Roy also referred to the death of Surendra Jain, one of the main accused in the Jain hawala case, three days ago. “Is it a coincidence that Jain died after Mamata Banerjee held a press conference and named Dhankhar, and journalist Vineet Narain, who conducted a probe, wrote on Facebook that Dhankhar should resign on moral ground? We are not drawing any inference but there is ground for suspicion,” said Roy.TMC Lok Sabha member Mahua Moitra has alleged that Dhankhar was involved in the allotment of residential plots that was cancelled by a full bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court. She tweeted, “Man of integrity Governor WB was beneficiary of illegal residential land allotment which later came to be cancelled by a Full Bench of Punjab & Haryana HC. Was this also constitutional, Uncleji?”Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh defended the Governor saying, “If the TMC government has any proof against the governor then it should make it public instead of bringing wild allegations against him every other day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/dhankhartmc-in-face-off-mode-on-eve-of-assembly-budget-session-101625158838183.html

01-07-2021||Pune||Pune admin to review Covid relaxations on Friday||Pune: The district administration is likely to review Covid restrictions at the weekly meet in the light of the demand from some traders to ease curbs. The city last week returned to Level 3, prompting administration to bring back some of the old curbs. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said that there will be a discussion about the Covid curbs based on facts and numbers. “We will discuss all the angles and the final decision will be taken after reviewing facts and figures. I cannot say right now whether there will be relaxations or not,” said Rao on possible Covid relaxations in the coming days. As the positivity rate had reduced in Pune, more relaxations such as increased timings for shops, restaurants and reopening of malls were announced. However, following the guidelines from the state government following reports of Delta Plus variant of coronavirus, the civic administration rolled back some of the exemptions, prompting business community to demand the increased timings to keep shops open and hoteliers have asked permission for dining in the evening hours. Currently, all shops are allowed to operate till 4 pm, the deadline also set for restaurants for dine-in facility. Meanwhile, the weekly RT-PCR positivity rate (June 23-June 30) of Pune district has dropped to 7.7%. Rao pointed out a marginal increase in the positivity rate of Pune city. “On Wednesday, Pune city recorded a positivity rate close to 8%. So, it will be too soon to say anything about Covid relaxations. Rural parts are still reporting a higher number of cases,” he said. Crowding in markets and tourist spots remains a challenge for the administration. Rao said that efforts are made to sensitise residents to remain indoors unless it is important to venture out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-admin-to-review-covid-relaxations-on-friday-101625157757244.html
01-07-2021||Ranchi||Cong legislator Amba Prasad booked for ‘obstructing public servants on duty’||Hazaribag police have booked Congress legislator from Barkagaon Amba Prasad for “obstructing public servants from doing their duty” after half a dozen tractor drivers, whose vehicles were seized and parked at Katkamdag police station, escaped with their vehicles allegedly in the presence of the legislator. The drivers of tractors allegedly carrying illegal sand, who fled with the vehicles, are said to be supporters of the legislator. Prasad visited the police station on Tuesday after learning of the seizure and the drivers drove away with their sand-laden tractors allegedly in her presence. Seven out of eight tractors were seized again and two FIRs were filed in the incident, one against tractor drivers and owners and the second against the legislator.

01-07-2021||Patna||Bihar: Interviews for hiring asst professors to begin July 15||The process for the long-awaited appointment of assistant professors for Bihar’s seriously understaffed universities and colleges is set to start from July 15.Bihar State University Service Commission (BSUSC) has started sending interview letters through email. Candidates will be required to report with the Covid-19 test report of the last 72 hours and all the original documents at the Commission’s office. BSUSC chairman Rajvardhan Azad said that in the first phase, interview for 25 subjects would be conducted and the second round of short listing for 15 subjects has been done by the experts. “We are starting with five subjects, including Angika, Puran, Prakrit, Persian etc., and after that, the schedule for the second lot of five subjects will be announced. The number of candidates called for interview is approximately three times the number of vacancies in that subject,” he said.BSUSC had advertised 4,638 vacancies for assistant professors in 52 subjects on September 23, 2020, just ahead of the announcement of state assembly elections. However, soon after the statute for appointment was notified, it had to be amended on the intervention of chief minister Nitish Kumar to give weightage to candidates from Bihar following opposition from many quarters.Bihar legislature had passed the Bihar State University Service Commission Act in 2017 to vest the power of recruitment back with the commission, which was earlier dissolved in 2007. Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, Bihar government had constituted the commission in February 2019 with Azad, former chief and professor of ophthalmology at the All India Institute of Medical sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, as the chairman.Bihar’s universities and colleges have perennially remained understaffed due to delayed appointments, one of the key factors blamed for poor show by state institutions in grading by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). Last time, the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) had advertised 3,364 vacancies in 2014, nearly 17 years after the previous advertisement in 1997, and the interview process got underway in 2015 and stretched up to 2020.Azad said there was a lot of delay owing to assembly election and Covid-19 pandemic, which led to extension of date twice for filling up applications. The last date for submitting online applications was December 10, while it was December 24 for submission of hard copy. “We have completed the first round of preliminary scrutiny for all the subjects and now the second round of scrutiny involving experts of the subjects is on in a phased manner,” he said.BSUSC has received over 69,000 applications. While the maximum number of applicants are from Bihar, followed by neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, applications have come from almost all states and union territories.“After first round of shortlisting, around 57,000 were found valid, as many candidates had left the application form incomplete or filled up multiple times. During the second round, the experts assessed the research papers and awards to find out if the research papers are peer reviewed or not. Academic points are calculated automatically and they are added with the scores for research papers, awards, work experience. Now, our effort is to carry out the process in a systematic manner and complete the exercise at the earliest,” he said.A big gap to bridgeIntro: Bihar’s universities and colleges have perennially remained understaffed due to delayed appointmentsVacancies: 4,638 Subjects: 52 No. of applications: 69,000 Applications found valid: 57,000||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/biharinterviews-for-hiring-asst-professors-to-begin-july-15-101625157217258.html

RJD leaders said party workers at the district, block and panchayat level have been directed to participate in the event and listen to Lalu Prasad, who had briefly interacted with party MLAs on May 9 through a video conference. After being discharged from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi days after he was granted bail by the Jharkhand High Court on April 30, the RJD chief has been staying at the residence of his eldest daughter and MP Misa Bharti. Prasad was being treated at AIIMS for various ailments.“This will be Lalu’s first interaction with party workers after a gap of several years. There is palpable excitement among the workers. We have sent online links to all our party units from panchayat level to the state level. Representatives from 26 states would be also attending the event. Key decisions would be taken about future programmes of the party at the event,” said Shyam Rajak, senior party leader and former minister. Top RJD leaders are also hopeful that the party chief will be returning to Patna by mid-July. “There are chances that the RJD chief would be returning to Patna after July 15. It will depend on his health condition. His presence will galvanise the workers,” said Rajak.Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, the RJD chief’s younger son and leader of the opposition in the Bihar assembly, had on Wednesday met his party’s office bearers and leaders and asked them to ensure that the event was widely publicised. On its foundation day, RJD will also pay tributes to Lok Janshakti Party founder late Ram Vilas Paswan, whose birth anniversary falls on the same day.Paswan’s son Chirag is currently locked in a bitter feud with uncle and MP Pasupati Kumar Paras to regain control over the party that was recently hit with rebellion. Birth of the partyLalu Prasad, then Bihar CM, announced the birth of RJD at a function in New Delhi on July 5,1997, after breaking away from the erstwhile Janata Dal following differences with Sharad Yadav over leadership issues in the backdrop of CBI filing a charge sheet against Prasad in fodder scam cases. Among the founding members were former MPs Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Kanti Singh. Prasad was elected as its president. He later resigned as chief minister on July 25 ,1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/on-its-25th-foundation-day-rjd-bets-on-lalu-to-fire-up-rank-and-file-101625157097281.html

If officers don’t listen to me, I won’t be able to get people’s work done. And if I cannot, I don’t need this,” Sahni told reporters. The minister said he was also not satisfied with the residence and vehicle provided to him.“For years, they (ministers) have been facing trouble and torture. They are not allowed to enjoy the perks and powers of ministerial posts. Even peons of the department do not listen to them... I will remain in the party and will follow the path shown by the chief minister, but I will resign from the post of minister,” said Sahni, who is a legislator from chief minister Nitish Kumar’s party, the Janata Dal (United).Asked if he had shared his grievances with the chief minister, Sahni said, “Why should I do so? He would think I am taking recourse to blackmail.”Asked when did he plan to hand over his resignation letter to his boss, the minister said, “It (the letter) is being prepared.”Sources familiar with the matter said the trigger for the minister’s outburst was the transfers and postings in his department in which he was overruled. On June 30, there was a big reshuffle of state government officials across departments.“Many officers have stayed put in the social welfare department for years and are working in an arbitrary manner. When I sought their removal, the additional chief secretary of the department (Atul Prasad) refused to listen. And it is not only me. Officials do not listen to any minister in Bihar. It is known to all that in the month of June, those officers who have been posted at the same place for three years are transferred. We sent the list of all those officers to the additional chief secretary, but it was ignored,” he alleged.Sahni also alleged that officers close to chief minister had created a lot of wealth.Reached for comment, Prasad said he was not aware of the allegations.This is not the first time a minister has entered into a fight with the top official of his department. A few months back, another minister had requested the government to transfer his department’s top bureaucrat, officials said.Meanwhile, BJP MLA Gyanendra Singh Gyanu took a swipe at Sahni, alleging that ministers took money in transfers and postings of officials. “We are constantly getting information about this from the officials of the department,” said Gyanu, who had raised a banner of revolt in the party after he was not inducted into the cabinet.He, however, did not reveal the names of ministers.Responding to Gyanu’s statement, RJD leader Shakti Yadav said Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav had always highlighted corruption in government. “Today, the BJP leader has made everything clear,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-minister-threatens-to-resign-says-has-no-say-in-transfers-postings-101625157037174.html

Many of the footpaths have been encroached upon on both sides of the road, while for the past two weeks, a knocked down traffic signal and a lamp post at the crossroads of Monish petrol pump, and Connaught place has made it impossible for residents to use the footpath. After several complaints to the local municipal authorities by residents the lamp post and the signal were removed on Thursday evening. A team of HT photographers confirmed the removal during a visit to the spot. Shenaz Setna who lives in the housing society behind the boat club main road often walks to the nearby shops for her daily groceries but for the past two weeks, this lamp post and knocked down traffic signal had become a major hurdle and has forced her to walk along the road, with oncoming traffic. “I usually walk towards Ganapati mandir chowk but now it has become a mess for there is no space left on the footpath with this huge traffic signal knocked down laying diagonally across the footpath, forcing me to walk on the road. With Metro work ongoing in the centre, it has already caused a lot of chaos and left no space for us to cross the road, this has now added to our woes,” said Setna. Speaking to DCP traffic Rahul Shrirame said, “The traffic signal maintenance and clearing of broken poles is with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and they have been informed of the fallen traffic signal pole and they are yet to take action. We will inform them once again about clearing it at the earliest.” Another resident, A Mukherjee, living near Gera Park also added that there is no median left for residents to cross the road at main road. “We have been writing to the authorities about the problems like locked thelas and shops still blocking the footpaths leaving us senior citizens no choice but to walk on the road. We even saw a maid getting hit by speeding car last week and yet no one from the officials is coming to help clear the footpaths,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/broken-traffic-signal-was-lying-unattended-for-two-weeks-residents-say-101625155357030.html

01-07-2021||Pune||PMC serves notices to property owners and beneficiaries of urban poor health scheme||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has served notices to around 4,000 citizens who paid property tax while availing the benefit of the urban poor health scheme, originally meant for poor citizens. The urban poor scheme is meant for those who have less than Rs1 lakh income per annum. PMC assumes that those who are pay property tax means they have their own home and enough income source. In its notice signed by health officers, PMC stated, “As the people owne a house in Pune city, it means their family income is surely more than Rs1 lakh per annum and they have duped the municipal corporation to take the benefit of the scheme.” The health department asked those people to submit their reply within a week to the notice served by PMC.Shiv Sena leader Vishal Dhanwade said, “PMC issued around 4,000 such notices. Instead of issuing notices to the citizens, ideally the PMC should ask the district administration about how they issue the income certificate?” Dhanwade said, “The income certificate is issued by district administration. If people took the benefit of the urban poor health scheme, it means they are needy and can’t afford the medical bills. There is no scheme for middle class people who use to pay all the taxes.” Shiv Sena demanded to withdraw all such notices within a week and stop torturing citizens, otherwise, Shiv Sena would do agitations. One of the official from the health department confirmed on anonymity, “The health department had done a scrutiny of the people who took the benefit of the urban poor scheme. It was found that many people having higher income are taking the benefit of this health scheme. Under this scheme, citizens can take the treatment in private hospitals. PMC use to bear 50 per cent of medical cost and rest of the bill should be paid by the concerned person. It is a very popular scheme. As many citizens found paying property tax and showing income below Rs1 lakh, the PMC is issuing notices to them.” Hindustan Times in its report on June 11 highlighted how around 1,900 people are under the scanner for availing benefit of the scheme. Additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal told Hindustan Times that the PMC is reviewing all the three schemes. As many as 12,000 citizens benefited from the urban-poor scheme in 2020 with PMC probing the financial condition of these beneficiaries and whether they have properties in their name. Of the total beneficiaries, 632 beneficiaries have been found to have properties in their names, Agarwal had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-serves-notices-to-property-owners-and-beneficiaries-of-urban-poor-health-scheme-101625154937052.html

Under the banner of the Bihar Association of Persons with Disabilities (PwD), a group of PwDs demanded here on Wednesday that in the forthcoming panchayat elections in the state, there should be reservations for the divyaangs also. They said they want 5% reservations in panchayat elections for the posts of mukhia, panchayat samiti, zila parishad sarpanch, ward members and panch, as per the provisions of the Rights of the Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016. They have threatened if their demands are not considered, they would resort to agitation. In the three-tier panchayat system in the state, some seats have been reserved not only for the members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes, but 50% of seats have been reserved for women belonging to both reserved and general categories.

01-07-2021||Kolkata||TMC alleges link between vaccination scam accused and Raj Bhawan||Adding to the acrimonious ties between Raj Bhawan and the West Bengal government, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Thursday released two photographs wherein a man who allegedly worked as the security guard of Debanjan Deb, the main accused in the fake vaccination racket, is seen standing near governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, his wife and two other women.“The man in the photograph is Arabinda Baidya, who worked as the security guard of Deb. In one photo, he can be seen standing behind Deb while in the other he is seen standing near the governor and his family,” TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said at a press conference. Raj Bhawan did not react to the allegations till 4.30 pm.Deb, an imposter who posed as an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer posted at the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) held at least two Covid-19 vaccination camps for the general public in Kolkata. Amikacin, an antibiotic, is suspected to have been used on a few hundred people. Deb also cheated many people of a few crores of rupees. The Centre has sought a report from the state on the fake vaccination camps. “We want the special investigation team formed by the Kolkata Police to probe this because we have learnt that Baidya’s job was to take expensive gifts and envelopes to important people. It must be found out what he was doing at Raj Bhawan,” said Roy, implying that the photograph was taken at Raj Bhawan. Reiterating the allegation, chief minister Mamata Banerjee earlier raised regarding Dhankhar’s name appearing in the Jain hawala case probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the 1990s, Roy said Dhankhar’s name is mentioned as an accused in the book ‘Bad Money Bad Politics- the untold hawala story’ written by Sanjay Kapoor. “The book says that in 1991 Jagdeep Dhankhar, a former Janata Dal MP, received ₹12.25 lakh in three or four instalments. We all know that Dhankhar was a Janata Dal MP and served in the VP Singh government as a minister. Since the money transacted through hawala was used by terror groups, this angle should be probed as well as it involves national security,” said Roy. “The Centre should have probed the man’s background before posting him as governor. We will demand his recall and raise the issue before the President of India and also at the Parliament,” said Roy.Roy also referred to the death of Surendra Jain, one of the main accused in the Jain hawala case, three days ago. “Is it a coincidence that Jain died after Mamata Banerjee held a press conference and named Dhankhar, and journalist Vineet Narain, who conducted a probe, wrote on Facebook that Dhankhar should resign on moral ground? We are not drawing any inference but there is ground for suspicion,” said Roy.TMC Lok Sabha member Mohua Moitra has alleged that Dhankhar was involved in the allotment of residential plots that was cancelled by a full bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court. She tweeted, “Man of integrity Governor WB was beneficiary of illegal residential land allotment which later came to be cancelled by a Full Bench of Punjab & Haryana HC. Was this also constitutional, Uncleji?”Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh defended the governor saying, “If the TMC government has any proof against the governor then it should make it public instead of bringing wild allegations against him every other day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-alleges-link-between-vaccination-scam-accused-and-raj-bhawan-101625145697113.html
01-07-2021||Bangalore||SC decision on dropping of KCOCA against Lankesh’s killer key to probe||The outcome of the plea filed by slain journalist Gauri Lankesh’s sister, challenging the dropping of charges under the Karnataka Control of Organized Crime Act 2000 (KCOCA) against one of the accused in the murder case, holds the key to the future of the murder investigation, say police officers and lawyers in the know of the developments. The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a notice to the Karnataka government and state police on a plea filed by Kavitha Lankesh. Kavitha Lankesh, a filmmaker, had approached the top court for staying the Karnataka high court order of April 22, 2021, which had quashed the charges under KCOCA against Mohan Nayak, one of the accused men on trial for Gauri Lankesh’s murder. KCOCA is a law enacted by Karnataka in India since 2000 to combat organised crime and terrorism. The Act was modelled on the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA).Also Read | SC notice to govt on dropping of charges against Lankesh’s killerAccording to police, if the charges of KCOCA are dropped against Nayak, it could set a precedence for the charges to be dropped against other accused in the case as well. “We, in our charge sheet, have provided evidence to suggest that a considerable amount of planning has gone into the murder. This clearly amounts to the conspiracy and murder being an organised crime. We will wait for the Supreme Court decision,” said a senior SIT official. A senior home department official, who was aware of the developments, said that the SIT had approached the government to file an appeal against the Karnataka high court decision, however, the government didn’t act on it. The home minister didn’t respond to HT’s call for a comment regarding this allegation. As per the charge sheet, Mohan Nayak is accused of providing accommodation for the killers on the outskirts of Bengaluru. He was arrested on July 19, 2018. Nayak was arrested after the main suspects in the case, including the shooter and the mastermind of the crime, were taken into custody. During the interrogation, Parashuram Waghmare, who pulled the trigger, told the investigators that three others and he were living in an acupuncture centre in Kumbalagodu on the outskirts of Bengaluru, before the murder; however, he didn’t know who provided the house. According to SIT officials, they found a vital clue in the diaries kept by Amok Kale, the alleged mastermind of the murder. They found a number from Kumbalagodu and found “MN Sampa”, written against it. When the cops checked the call details of the phone number, they found two Bengaluru numbers. These numbers belonged to two real estate agents, and one of them told the SIT he had rented out this house to a man to run an acupuncture centre. However, the real estate agents couldn’t identify the person. Since the number was last active in Sampaje in Kodagu, police realised that Sampa stood for Sampaje. Soon, police began looking for acupuncture professionals in the area, said the SIT official. With the initial MN, the SIT soon tracked down Mohan Nayak, who confessed to renting out the house and opened an acupuncture centre on the instructions of Kale, to house these men without drawing any attention. The arrest of Nayak also led the SIT to Rajesh Bangera, the man who allegedly trained the shooters. Bangera was arrested, and during the interrogation, he admitted having given arms training to the other accused at a farmhouse in Belagavi district. The SIT filed an additional charge sheet in November 2018, in which Nayak was named. According to the charge sheet, Nayak also took training from Bangera. On April 22, the Karnataka high court dropped the organised crimes charges against Mohan Nayak, one of the accused. Since the government didn’t appeal against this decision, Kavitha Lankesh approached the Supreme Court. Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, appearing for Kavitha Lankesh, pointed out Nayak’s involvement in multiple murders involving activists Narendra Dabholkar in 2013 (Pune), Govind Pansare in 2015 (Kolhapur, Maharashtra), and noted Kannada writer MM Kalburgi in Dharwad (Karnataka) in 2015. According to the petition filed through advocate Aparna Bhat, Nayak was involved in arranging logistics for the killers both before and after the crime. It stated that the high court erred in setting aside the order of the Bengaluru Police Commissioner passed in August 2018 invoking KCOCA against Nayak and the subsequent supplementary charge sheet filed by the Special Investigation Team under provisions of KCOCA. “In order for the KCOCA to be applicable in the case, there has to be at least two prior charge sheets against the accused. This is not so in the case. In such a situation, where KCOCA is not there, SIT had to file the charge sheet in 90 days. Since they took 180 days, bail should be given to the Nayak,” advocate Amrutesh NP, founder member of Hindu Vidhidnya Parishad, who appearing for some of the accused in the Gauri murder case. Nayak’s lawyers were not available for comment. Amrutesh further added that if KCOCA is removed in this case, he will approach for the removal of KCOCA against other accused in the case who do not have two charge sheets filed against them. A retired public prosecutor, who didn’t want to be named said that if the high court order is upheld, it would impact the trial. “Essentially, this would become a murder case, instead of an organised assassination of someone. The investigation so far, whatever information available in public, shows there was a well-planned conspiracy. We will need to wait and watch what the Supreme Court has to say,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/sc-decision-on-dropping-of-kcoca-against-lankesh-s-killer-key-to-probe-101625145576771.html
01-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro’s Blue Line services disrupted for second day, Yellow Line hit too||Services on the Blue Line of Delhi Metro were affected for the second consecutive day on Thursday forcing commuters to wait for a longer time to board the trains. Taking to Twitter, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC) wrote, “Slow movement of trains between Dwarka Sector 9 and Dwarka Sector 21. Normal service on all other lines.”A similar disruption was also reported on the Blue Line on Wednesday due to a signalling issue, an official said, as reported by news agency PTI. The official stated that the disruption caused the services to slow down for 10 to 15 minutes, but was soon rectified and services returned to normal.Interestingly, a few hours after the tweet by DMRC on Thursday morning, the company took to the social media platform once again in the afternoon to give an update on the disruption of services on the Yellow Line of Delhi Metro. “Delay in services between Huda City Centre and Sultanpur,” the tweet read.Later, the DMRC stated that owing to a technical issue at Huda City Centre, train services between the station and Sikanderpur were temporarily suspended.However, in less than 30 minutes the company tweeted again to inform that services have been restored on the Yellow Line.Yellow Line UpdateDue to a technical issue at Huda City Centre, temporarily no train services will be available between Huda City Centre and Sikanderpur. We apologise for the inconvenience.Yellow Line UpdateNormal services have resumed. Thank you for your patience.On Wednesday, after the services on the Blue Line were disrupted and later rectified, DMRC said that the average waiting time at Rajiv Chowk – one of the Blue Line stations, was 50 minutes. Later, after three hours, the company announced that the waiting time has become normalised.A few days before, addressing the matter of overcrowding outside Delhi Metro stations, DMRC said in a statement that “long queues are caused as single entry points are only permitted” at most metro stations because it is difficult to regulate the number of persons inside a mass transit system once their entry is permitted.Notably, Delhi Metro services resumed in early June after a gap of nearly one month, with 10 to 15 percent of its capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-s-blue-line-services-disrupted-for-second-day-yellow-line-hit-too-101625144427743.html

With the nationwide vaccination drive underway alongside the universal free-of-cost inoculation campaign, the Karnataka government has asked all vice-chancellors of universities to vaccinate all college students above 18 years by July 7 in order to facilitate the reopening of educational institutions in the state, news agency ANI reported.Karnataka deputy chief minister Dr CN Ashwath Narayan told ANI that students ought to be administered with Covid-19 vaccines by the stipulated date as per the “schedule of the vaccine drive” and that the vice-chancellors should try to make sure that the vaccination of all students is completed before the deadline. He added that if required, the deadline of July 7 can be stretched by another two to three days.According to the ANI report, the deputy chief minister, while interacting with the vice-chancellors during a virtual meet, highlighted that students are currently being vaccinated as a priority group so that physical classes pertaining to higher education can soon be restarted.However, Narayan noted that opening of offline classes in Karnataka depends on the success of the vaccination drive and that the state government is ready to extend all forms of cooperation.The state health minister Dr K Sudhakar reportedly recently told that parents of children, who are below 10 years, will also be administered Covid-19 vaccine jabs on a priority basis. According to reports, he added that educational institutions will be opened in the state step-by-step because while education is important for students, their lives have more significance.The deputy chief minister’s remarks come at a time India and the 11 other nations are fighting against the more virulent Delta Plus variant of Covid-19, which has also been identified in Karnataka. The variant – a subtype of the Delta variant, was first detected in India on June 11 and has until now claimed 50 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-deputy-cm-tells-v-cs-to-vaccinate-all-college-students-before-july-7-101625143422497.html

The minister said that the scientists be bestowed with a Bharat Ratna on this year’s Independence Day for their “patriotism, outstanding service and extraordinary work”.“Certainly, this will become a source of inspiration for young scientists,” the health minister was quoted as saying by ANI.Gupta further stated that it was because of the manufacture of the indigenous vaccines and a systematic and strategic vaccination programme that Indian citizens have been able to save their loved ones. The minister added that the vaccines and the vaccination drive not only strengthened the country’s immunity but also made India self-reliant on the international platform.His remarks come on the same day that he blamed the Centre for not rendering Jharkhand with sufficient Covid-19 vaccine doses. Accusing the Centre for slowing the process of distributing vaccine doses, Gupta said, “The central government demands an advance plan from us, which we duly provide. We don’t produce vaccines.

01-07-2021||Delhi||After lockdown, Delhi govt’s employment portal sees surge in job-seekers||The Delhi government’s online job portal established a record 75,000 connections between job seekers and employers in June, signifying a surge in people looking for employment as the national Capital opened economic activities after a strict seven-week long lockdown meant to curb the brutal second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Data shared by the government showed that in the month of June alone, the portal jobs.delhi.gov.in saw 1,000 new job seekers on an average every day. Accordingly, the number of avenues offered by employers also picked up in the same month with around 300 new jobs being posted on the portal on a daily basis, though the number of employment opportunities continues to be lower than the demand. Between June 1 and 30, a total of 34,212 job seekers were registered and 9,522 new vacancies were posted. On an average, 2,500 connections were made every day between job seekers and employers – through WhatsApp, phone calls and direct application to the employers. In total, 75,000 connections were made between job-seekers and employers in June, a government spokesperson said. Also Read | Heatwave warning for NW India, including Delhi, for next two daysAs on Thursday, the top three sectors with maximum available vacancies were customer support, delivery executives and sales and business development. Roughly about half of the vacancies (45%) were available for freshers. In terms of gender distribution, nearly 41% jobs were open for all, while 36% were for males only, and 23% were for females.The portal was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on July 27 last year, with the aim of helping those who had lost their jobs during the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25, 2020 because of Covid-19 and also for boosting the national capital’s economy.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the city’s employment minister, said the portal, has helped many to get jobs or at least apply for different posts. “The Kejriwal government is most concerned about the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and had therefore, launched the Rojgar Bazaar portal last year to provide job opportunities to unemployed youth. Lakhs of youth had registered and found jobs last year. It is a matter of their faith and trust in CM Arvind Kejriwal that even now, thousands of job-seekers and employers are registering every day in Rojgar Bazaar. We will do everything possible to help youth find jobs at this time of crisis,” he said. The minister said that during the lockdown, the “Rojgar Bazaar” portal helped businesses hire for delivery and customer support. Now, during the unlocking process, we have witnessed a surge in sales and office jobs again. “The Rozgar Bazaar has proved to be a one-stop portal for all segments - employers ranging from micro enterprises, street vendors looking for cooks, tailors, technicians, MSME looking for accountants/web designers/sales and marketing personnel to hospitals looking for staff. Along with the full time jobs, part time and work from home job options are also available on Rojgar Bazaar,” he said. Between July 27 and November 4 last year, the portal had more than 1.25 million job seekers, while at least 44,440 employers were registered on the portal and there were 826,603 job openings. In November last year, the Delhi government had blacklisted at least 207 registered employers from the portal for allegedly demanding money from job seekers whom they contacted through the platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-lockdown-delhi-govt-s-employment-portal-sees-surge-in-jobseekers-101625142936783.html

01-07-2021||Chandigarh||An awkward encounter at Punjab secretariat||Working with the government, a transfer always brings conflicting emotions of excitement and apprehension at the same time. The reasons for both being the same – moving out of the comfort zone, dealing with a new subject, meeting and working with new people. The transfer orders in August 2020 announced the inevitable for me, moving from the field to the intimidating secretariat at Chandigarh. Over the years, I have always romanticised the idea of moving back to Chandigarh – it’s the city where I spent most of my short career as a journalist. It brings back thrilling memories of zipping from spot-to-spot to cover the education beat as a cub reporter on my scooter after the iconic Press Club poolside morning meetings. Even though the second stint in the city was not expected to match the thrill, the prospect of catching up with old friends, making new friends and maybe picking up a hobby was incentive enough. As with most things in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic played a spoilsport here, too. I joined my new assignment at the peak of the pandemic, the usual apprehensions were double-fold. There were no friendly smiles from strangers – just masked faces, temperature checks and muffled sounds. Introductions and briefings that generally take days and copious cups of tea were limited to a quick exchange of user IDs. The new norms restricted all personal interactions. Meetings were to be attended online, agendas shared by email and e-files to be cleared on the portal. Staring at the screen all day long made the new environment stifling. To add to the uneasiness, I started hearing strange noises from the roof. As I didn’t want to alarm and sound eccentric to my new staff, I waited for it to stop. And it did! I heaved a sigh and went back to the screen. But as soon as I did, wild scampering started above my head. I gratefully realised it wasn’t the isolation playing with my head, as two screws of a ceiling light got unhinged and it drooped down. I rang the bell to announce to the staff that there’s a cat trapped in the roof. Expressions of disbelief from them made me point to the light as proof. We made a strategy to rescue the cat. A ladder was procured and a part of the ceiling panel removed. Cell-phone lights were flashed to locate the feline, but there was no movement or sight of life. I got some visitors in my isolated office, to offer solutions as word spread that there was a cat living in the roof. Since all the activity made the cat disappear, a bowl of milk was left, in the hope that it would climb down and leave for a safer place overnight. The next day, the milk was gone but the activity on the roof increased. My suggestion to leave the balcony door open for the cat to escape should it decide to climb down was met by strong opposition as monkeys could walk in. As the day went by, the bustle increased overhead and while attending an online meeting, I spotted the cat looking at me suspiciously through the opening in the roof with two kittens in tow. The AC vents were opened to help the cat lead the kittens to the corridor and down the stairs. This time round, the milk was left in the corridor. The next day, the cat and the kittens were gone. And so was my awkwardness. parneetshergill@gmail.com The writer is a Punjab-cadre IAS officer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/an-awkward-encounter-at-punjab-secretariat-101625142216931.html

01-07-2021||Chandigarh||‘Punjab no more power surplus, needs to diversify from paddy’||Patiala: Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad on Thursday denied that Punjab is a power surplus state, particularly during the peak paddy sowing season. He said the corporation had no choice but to pull the plug on industries for two days a week besides imposing shutdowns for domestic consumers, both urban and rural. Though the measures have not gone down well with farmers and consumers, the CMD said the state should look to diversify beyond water-guzzler crops such as paddy. Edited excerpts: Why is a power-surplus Punjab seeing cuts? The delay in the arrival of monsoon and the failure of the Talwandi Sabo Power Limited to produce electricity have forced us to impose restrictions. Punjab is no more power surplus, particularly during the peak season that lasts 15 days. We are short of power for paddy sowing. The demand has risen beyond expectation. Power supply from hydel stations has decreased due to low reservoir levels. How did Punjab suddenly become power deficit? Where is the problem? Punjab has a transmission system to meet the demand of around 14,000 MW, but at present the demand has gone beyond it. Power is available in the grid, but we can’t bring more than 7,500 MW from outside of state. Today, the unrestricted demand is above 15,000 MW. It’s because of the rising power load from the agriculture sector, which draws free power. As the water level has gone down, the farmers have installed higher BHP motors to draw water. This has led to significant increase of peak power demand. What is the solution? The solution is diversification. Day by day, the groundwater level is going down. We need more power to pull out the water. The Kandi and Malwa areas are worst affected. The permanent solution is that Punjab has to diversify from paddy. Otherwise, if we install motors of more capacity, it will lead to another aspect of paying fixed cost for around the year for drawing power for a limited period of a fortnight. Engineers blame the over-dependence on the private sector for the erratic supply. That’s wrong. The PSPCL shut the 800-MW Bathinda thermal plant and two units of Ropar thermal plant, while it added 800 MW power through solar net metering. Another 250 MW solar plant inside Punjab territory has been planned and a tender will be floated soon. We are planning to install a peaking station. Fixed cost is a problem, but Talwandi Sabo Power Limited has failed to deliver in the peak season. Any action against independent power producers (IPPs) ? We are going to serve a notice to the TSPL. Regarding penalty, there is no provision for penalising for supplying during the peak season. Still, I have decided to sort out this issue to ensure that in future PSPCL gets full power from power plants during peak season. When will the consumers get respite from power cuts? We are anticipating that the monsoon will arrive around July 3. With the onset of the rainy season, the demand for power will see a dip. The monsoon arrives, I’m hoping that by next week, we will be comfortable to meet the peak demand without any restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-no-more-power-surplus-needs-to-diversify-from-paddy-101625141496502.html

Mitra, who visited the site of the accident, said the matter was being looked into, and more details will be available after a thorough investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/motorcyclist-killed-19-injured-after-bus-hits-fort-william-wall-in-kolkata-101625137346611.html
01-07-2021||Pune||Taste of life: Poona bazaar shopping trip with an Anglo-Indian twist||Lady Constance E Gordon published the first edition of her cookbook “Anglo – Indian Cuisine (Khana Kitab)” in 1904. It took her 10 more years to publish the second edition of the cookbook. The first edition of the cookbook featured “Bazaar lists” of Poona (Camp), Bombay, and Calcutta. The second edition had another list added to it – that of Poona city. This was the only Anglo-Indian cookbook to have lists for both Poona Camp and the city.Most Europeans found the bazaars overcrowded and, because of lack of toilets, and ailments like typhoid, cholera, and malaria, they tended to avoid going out to buy groceries. The bazaars were particularly viewed as places that could contaminate food and water and where prostitution and venereal diseases were rampant. This fear was greater than another fear, that the food might be contaminated by native cooks.JK Stanford wrote in “Ladies in the Sun: The Memsahib’s India”, that “no lady should ever demean herself to visit the bazaar and buy her own food. She should leave that entirely to her native cook, for to enter and bargain in the meat or fish stall, quite apart from the smell, is bad for prestige. Nor should she ever enter their back premises, the ‘cookhouses’ in which their viands are prepared… people are satisfied if the cook produced, unwatched, edible food on a tiny charcoal fire and with a minimum of fuss.”Gordon clearly ignored this advice. She and her husband would often travel to Khandala and Mahabaleshwar on Sundays and during summer. The travelogues were often droll and recorded mishaps and quirky European characters. They would appear with some regularity in “Bombay Chronicle” and “The Times of India”. They never mentioned any recipes or her cookbook, but did mention meat, vegetables, and fruits they would find in the bazaars of the villages, towns, and cities they visited. In the write-ups, Gordon would often record the seasons in which certain fruits were available, their prices, and quality. She would note colours, textures, smells, and tastes. Her articles make one believe that she loved visiting Indian bazaars, especially those in Poona, Mahabaleshwar, and Khandala.Food supplies in the hills were more difficult to source than on the plains. Gordon believed that it was possible to have plain, but sufficient food at Mahabaleshwar and Khandala. These places had hillside estates for the cultivation of European fruits and vegetables to cater to the European population.Her articles suggest that she preferred buying vegetables from a garden twice or thrice a week to buying from the bazaar. Although the former was more expensive, Gordon wrote that eating vegetables from the bazaar was dangerous if the water used to wash the vegetables and fruits was contaminated.Gordon might have had a garden in her house in Bombay. One of her travelogues mentions how she would gift parsley, potatoes, and other fruits to her friends. She was especially proud of the “knoll khol” cultivated in her garden. She compared it with the “best quality from Poona”.According to Gordon’s list, “knolkhols”, turnips, beetroots, celery, lettuces, radishes, carrots, tomatoes, onions, green peas, French beans, artichokes, parsley, brinjals, math, chawali, fenugreek, ghole, mayaloo, chandanbatwa, and kapi-chawali were supplied to Bombay, from Poona, throughout the year. Watercress cultivated in Poona was supplied to Bombay between February and April. Bombay got its potatoes from Italy, Cawnpore, Karachi, Mahabaleshwar, and Talegaon, and some of it was brought to Poona by a few European shopkeepers.Poona also sent figs, pears, chikoos, jambhool, oranges, custard apples, ramphal, guavas, and papaya to Bombay. Gordon noted that some natives in Poona had built farms where they reared rabbits, grey pigeons, partridges, wild ducks, and quails. These were then sent to the markets in Bombay.According to Gordon, the prices in the markets of Poona were liable to more fluctuation than those of Bombay, owing to less regularity in the supply. In the season the principal articles of European consumption were generally a little dearer; if a quantity was required it should be ordered a day prior, she suggested.Gordon’s bazaar list for Poona (Camp) started with Mutton. Grain-fed Mutton, 4 lb., cost a rupee. So did 6 lb. of Saddle. A lamb cost Rs3 while the cost of Mutton Suet was 6 annas. 4 seers of prime pieces of beef cost a rupee. The “Poona Seer” was equal to 1 lb.“Prime pieces” of beef cost Re 1 for 4 lb. Hump cost 12 annas, while 8 lb. of Brisket cost a rupee. Soup meat and ox-tail were 1 anna per pound, while ox-tongue cost 4 annas. Gordon also provided prices for veal, poultry (these were available plenty in the market and included chicken, ducks, geese, country fowls, pigeons, turkey-cock, and turkey-hen), and “game meat” like quail, partridges, teal, wild duck, and hare.Gordon noted that since Poona (Camp) was chiefly dependent on Bombay for its supply of fish, whenever a quantity was desired a previous order should be given. Oysters were 6 annas per dozen. Salmon cost 6 annas per pound, while a turtle could be bought for a rupee. Bombay duck, pomfrets, prawns, phatte and murrrell were also available in Poona, “but were dearer than the markets in Bombay”.Poona (Camp) was “well stocked with various kinds of vegetables”, but “few were available throughout the year”, Gordon wrote. Many vegetables were specially cultivated all through the year to be supplied to Bombay, and if there was an extra demand from Bombay, some vegetables would not be available in Poona for a few weeks. The same was true for fruits.Gordon’s “bazaar list” for Poona city is testimony to the fact that she did not see the old cities and native bazaars as areas linked with dirt, disease, and prostitution. Her list also clearly shows the contrast between the bazaars of Poona Camp and the city. Only chicken, beef, mutton, and few varieties of fish were available in the markets of the city. Fruits and vegetables cost less than the Camp markets. A rupee could buy 13 seers of potatoes in the city, while the same cost a rupee and 2 annas in Camp. On the other hand, tea and coffee were dearer in the city markets.Lady Constance E Gordon’s cookbook has long been forgotten, but the recipes, and the “bazaar lists” help us reconstruct the charms of Poona. And the brilliant observation skills, scientific aptitude, and penmanship of Gordon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-poona-bazaar-shopping-trip-with-an-anglo-indian-twist-101625136686471.html

In fact, the vaccination campaign was not conducted at several centres across districts on both Tuesday and Wednesday, thereby reducing vaccine inoculation numbers even more.The state health department stated that only 99,920 doses of both Covishield and Covaxin were available till Tuesday evening. Nodal officer of the health department’s Information, Education and Communication (IEC) wing, Siddharth Tripathi said that another 58,950 Covaxin doses arrived in the state on Wednesday evening.Gupta, accusing the Centre for the shortage of vaccine doses, said that the state intends to “scale up vaccination” to combat a possible third wave. According to schedule, Jharkhand will receive six lakh vaccine doses on July 2 and a total of 9.5 lakh by July 15.Recently, Jharkhand’s additional chief secretary (health), Arun Kumar Singh wrote to the Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, seeking for at least 95 per cent of vaccine doses from the Centre. In the letter, Singh also cited that the central government decreased the share of vaccination in private hospitals from 25 per cent to 5 per cent to ensure “reasonable opportunity” for all citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-govt-allots-5-400-covaxin-doses-for-ranchi-covishield-to-arrive-soon-101625135615740.html

01-07-2021||Kolkata||Bengal receives 400,000 Covid jab doses; not enough, say officials||The West Bengal government, reeling under an acute shortage of vaccines, received around 400,000 doses from the centre on Wednesday even as health officials said that it was not enough to sustain the pace. The state government had to cut down on first doses of Covid-19 vaccines because of the shortage. “We received around 405,000 doses on Wednesday. Another 400,000 doses are expected by this weekend. The quantity is not enough to meet our requirement of 300,000 doses per day,” said a senior official of the state health department. Officials said the state has the capacity to administer around 500,000-600,000 vaccines per day, which can be stretched up to 700,000-800,000 doses per day, subject to availability. Also Read | Coronavirus pandemic: Will one dose of a two-dose Covid-19 vaccine protect me?The district administrations, civic bodies and state-run hospitals were directed to keep aside at least 50% of the available doses to cope with the shortage and the growing number of persons whose second dose was due. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday lashed out at the Centre, alleging that the state was being deprived of vaccines after Bharatiya Janata Party president JP Nadda attacked the Trinamool Congress-led government, alleging that Covid-19 vaccination numbers were the lowest in the state and fake inoculation camps were being organised in the state. “Uttar Pradesh received around 35,000,000 doses, Maharashtra received more than 30,000,000 doses. Even smaller states received more doses than West Bengal. I don’t have any problem with that. But why is Bengal being deprived? We had demanded around 30,000,000 vaccines from the Centre. They try to malign Bengal,” said Banerjee, while speaking to reporters. Data available with the state government revealed that as on June 29, at least 670,000 people are due for the second dose of Covishield vaccine while another 160,000 were due for the Covaxin vaccine. The total second dose due up to July 31 is around 3,790,000. The maximum overdue number of second doses was reported from Kolkata. While the overdue number of doses for Covishield in the city was 58,428 on Tuesday, for Covaxin it was 25,021. “Till June 29, Bengal had received around 19,900,000 doses from the Centre, of which 19,800,000 were used. There was no wastage and Bengal saved around 500,000 doses. Till Wednesday, around 21,800,000 doses were administered in the state,” said a senior health department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-receives-400-000-covid-jab-doses-not-enough-say-officials-101625134106582.html
01-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC stays trial against Hooda, AJL in Panchkula plot case||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday stayed the trial against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Associated Journal Limited (AJL), the publisher of National Herald newspaper, for alleged illegal allotment of a plot in Panchkula to AJL.The high court bench of justice Arvind Sangwan acted on the plea from Hooda and AJL. The detailed order is awaited. “Two petitions, one from Hooda and the second from AJL, were taken up and the order was passed, staying trial,” said Arshdeeep Singh Cheema, who appeared for the former CM. On April 16, a special CBI court had framed charges against Hooda and AJL.The trial court had acted on a CBI chargesheet filed in December 2018. The FIR was registered in 2016 during the BJP regime for the alleged offences in 2005 when the Congress leader was the chief minister.The pleas demanded stay on trial proceedings and quashing of the order on framing of charges.It has been argued that the order passed by the trial court suffered from selective reading of the material on record and cherry-picking of evidence. The trial court erred in failing to draw a distinction between an error of judgment or drawing a wrongful legal inference and dishonest or corrupt intention, it has been argued.The pleas further say that the entire case is motivated by political considerations and is an exercise for political vendetta. “It is not clear even from a compressive and critical reading of the chargesheet as to on whose complaint and how the matter came to be enquired into or registered,” the plea from former CM says. HOODA ALLOWED RE-ALLOTMENT PLOT ON OLD RATESAccording to the CBI, a 3,360 square metre institutional plot (C-17) in Sector 6, Panchkula, was allotted by Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) to AJL in 1982, but because the construction was not carried out in 10 years, it was taken back in 1992.In 1995 and 1996, an appeal and revisions were filed by AJL against the resumption of the plot, but these were also dismissed by the HUDA administrator and Haryana’s financial commissioner, town and country planning.However, when Hooda became the chief minister in 2005, he allowed the re-allotment of the plot to AJL on old rates. Charges were framed under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.ED PROBE IS ALSO UNDERWAYAt the time of the registration of the FIR, late Moti Lal Vora was the chairman of AJL and Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul were among the shareholders. The newspaper was launched in 1938 by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister.The CBI had alleged that Hooda, who was also the HUDA chairman, “blatantly misused his official position and dishonestly allotted the plot afresh in the guise of re-allotment to AJL at original rates in violation of the HUDA policy vide an order on August 28, 2005. Thus, he caused wrongful loss to HUDA and wrongful gain to AJL.”An Enforcement Directorate (ED) probe is also underway in the case. Initially, on May 5, 2016, the FIR was registered by the Haryana vigilance bureau regarding allegations of cheating and corruption against Hooda and others. In December 2016, the Haryana government recommended the CBI probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-stays-trial-against-hooda-ajl-in-panchkula-plot-allotment-case-101625132306146.html

We are creating the most modern health information system in Delhi. Due to Covid-19, there are some delays. Hopefully, it should start by March,” Kejriwal tweeted after a review meeting on Thursday which was also attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and health minister Satyendar Jain.Later in the day, a statement issued by Kejriwal’s office said, “He directed the officials to ensure the implementation of the HIMS project within the stipulated deadline...Along with the HIMS project, Health Helpline will also be started and special surveys will be conducted for issuing of e-health cards.Also Read | National Doctors’ Day: Delhi doctors recount the horrors of second wave“Health cards will be issued in the names of all the residents of Delhi, for which special surveys will be conducted by the government. This will ensure the availability of the benefits of the government healthcare services to every resident of Delhi,” it said.The system is also supposed to include a 24x7 call centre, or Health Helpline which will provide two levels of help — first where an operator will receive people’s calls and messages and provide them with requisite information and second, where doctors and experts will provide appointments based on the problem or immediately provide solutions for emergency cases, the statement said.The HIMS project envisages digital health cards which will essentially be a QR code-based system that will keep a record of clinical details such as health checks, follow-ups, surgeries, medications and vaccinations for each patient. The system is also supposed to include a mobile phone application as well as a 24x7 call centre to help patients with health-related information, fix consultations and other assistance, senior government officials said.In its first phase, which was supposed to be rolled out by August this year, the project is likely to cover all Delhi government hospitals and dispensaries. Central government hospitals and private hospitals are likely to be included in subsequent phases, said senior government officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/digital-health-card-may-be-rolled-out-by-march-2022-delhi-cm-kejriwal-101625129665756.html
01-07-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka's new sand policy will benefit buyers, says state minister Murugesh Nirani||Gone are the days when truckloads of sand used to be dumped on roads. In what comes as a first in the country, the Karnataka government has now planned to pack sand in bags for delivery to construction sites. The policy was announced by officials of the mines and geology department at the Vidhana Soudha, according to the Prajavani e-paper, which reported that the state government has devised this unique plan to benefit the buyers in various ways.With this new policy, the government aims to ensure accurate weighing and affordability of the sand for the people planning to build their houses. Besides, the branding of sand will also be done. The sand packed in bags will eliminate profiteering, hoarding, and speculation in the market as sand will be available at the same cost throughout the year.“Sand will be packed in waterproof bags, so they can be stored even during the monsoons when sand mining is banned," said Karnataka mines and geology minister Murugesh Nirani. "The packaging of sand will give 100% value to the buyers. Till now, the sand sold in truckloads contained impurities and caused a lot of wastage. Therefore, the buyer used to get the value of only 70-80 % of the purchased sand. But these quality-checked bags of sand will not have these issues,” he affirmed.The report said the draft proposal on the new sand policy is currently being examined by a committee of experts. The government will create a nodal agency under the department of mines and geology to coordinate with processes of procurement, pricing, packing, and delivery. The special nodal agency will function along the lines of the state-owned Beverages corporation limited.“In order to identify sand blocks on river courses and beds, the Karnataka state mineral development corporation limited will conduct a survey ordered by the state government. The state government will then chalk out a plan for extraction and setting up a bagging unit. All surveys will be done using drones”, Prajavani quoted Nirani as saying.Sandbags will be made available in packages of 25 kg, 50 kg, and 100 kg. “Five plants will come up, on an experimental basis in as many places. Sand will also be grouped into three categories A, B, and C, according to the usage,” Nirani explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnatakas-new-sand-policy-will-benefit-buyers-says-state-minister-murugesh-nirani-101625127477014.html
01-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi doctors teased, attacked over Covid spread on eve of National Doctors’ Day||Two Delhi-based doctors were attacked by locals in the national capital’s Gautam Nagar area, following a heated argument over the spread of the ongoing coronavirus in the city, Delhi police said on Wednesday, according to news agency ANI. The incident happened on the eve of National Doctor’s Day, which is being celebrated in the entire country on Thursday.In a statement, Delhi Police said that one of the doctors was from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), while the second one was from Safdarjung Hospital. According to the ANI report, both the doctors were admitted to the AIIMS Trauma Centre on Thursday after sustaining several head injuries.As per police officials, the incident occurred when on Wednesday, a few doctors went to the shop of one Bhagat Singh Verma in Gautam Nagar and allegedly consumed alcohol in the shop with the shopkeeper. An argument ensued between the doctors and Verma, and thereafter both the parties commenced to assault one another, police told ANI.The report further stated that the doctors were allegedly “teased” by saying that they “spread corona”, which in turn caused a war of words between the two parties. Police said that besides the two doctors, and the shopkeeper Bhagat Singh Verma, his son Abhishek sustained injuries during the fight.However, one of the doctors Dr Satish said that a parantha seller began abusing after which an argument ensued, and “he slapped” the former. “We got into a brawl and around 30 people came with iron rods. If police say we had consumed alcohol, ask them for evidence,” the doctor told ANI.“The statements of both the parties are being recorded and legal action will be taken accordingly,” police was quoted as saying by ANI.Incidents of assault on doctors over either the fear of coronavirus or after the death of a patient due to the virus have been abundant since the pandemic hit the country in March last year.In a recent case, Dr Seuj Kumar Senapati, who was posted at Udali CCC in Hojai district of Assam was assaulted by almost 20 relatives, including women, of a patient who succumbed to Covid-19 during treatment.The assault, recorded presumably on a mobile phone, showed Dr Senapati being hit with a broom, utensils and also kicked while laying on the ground. The video that went viral triggered sharp criticism, and Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma even tweeted that such “barbaric attack” won’t be tolerated. Later, special director general of police, GP Singh said three people were held.Meanwhile, in a recent data by the Indian Medical Association (IMA), it was revealed that as many as 798 doctors lost their lives in the second Covid-19 wave so far, up from 748 recorded during the first wave of the pandemic. With 128 doctors succumbing to the virus, Delhi recorded the highest number of deaths, followed by Bihar at 115 and Uttar Pradesh at 79.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-doctors-teased-attacked-over-covid-spread-on-eve-of-national-doctors-day-101625127369849.html
01-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab pulls plug on power for industrial consumers, imposes two-day shutdown||Unable to meet the rising demand for power despite imposing cuts in the domestic sector, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) on Thursday decided to impose two-day weekly offs for industrial consumers, barring those providing essential services, with immediate effect.The two-day weekly off for industrial consumers from 4pm on Thursday to Saturday is being imposed after nine years.Also read: HT Explainer: The monsoon is on a break. What does it mean?Switch off ACs, govt officers urged The PSPCL has appealed to government and public sector offices to restrict the use of air conditioners for the next three days to help the state tide over the shortage.Punjab, which is touted to be power-surplus, is banking on the arrival of the monsoon as the meteorological department has forecast rainfall from July 3.For the past 10 days, the PSPCL has been imposing long power cuts in the rural areas. The urban population has been reeling under power cuts for the past four days.Paddy sowing hit, farmers protest The agriculture sector is worst hit as it is not getting the eight-hour supply for sowing of paddy. Due to the prolonged dry spell, paddy transplantation in the state has been affected.Due to the delayed monsoon, the state is not able to meet the demand of 14,500 MW. Farmers continue to protest the short supply of agricultural feeders as Punjab has been maintaining a power supply between 11,791 MW to 12,842 MW after restricting the power supply to rural consumers, agriculture pump sets, and unannounced cuts in cities.Gap of 1,330 MW between demand and supply On Wednesday, the power demand in Punjab touched 14,142 MW, while the state supplied a maximum of 12,842 MW. There is a gap of about 1,330 MW between demand and supply, according to the report of the Northern Grid. The power shortage during evening peak hours is 2,100 MW with a supply of 12,380 MW.The PSPSL supplied 2,979 lakh units to the state on Wednesday and there was a shortage of at least 251 lakh units. On Tuesday, there was a shortage of 1,550 MW and 132 lakh units of power supply.State dependent on private thermal plants The thermal power generation in the state is 1,000 lakh units, comprising 325 lakh units by state sector thermal plants and 675 lakh units by the private sector. There is a breakdown in one of the units at the Ropar plant, while a 660-MW unit at the Talwandi Sabo plant has been out of operation since March 8.Hydel supply to the state is 223 lakh units of which the Bhakra dam project supplies about 75 lakh units.“Punjab can import a maximum of 7,300 MW from the northern grid. The state has its own generation of about 5,500 MW from all sources, including solar during the day. This implies under present circumstances, it can supply around 12,700 MW,” said a PSPCL management official. He said that overdependence on the private sector has dented the image of the PSPCL and drawn the wrath of consumers.We have our limitations, says PSPCL PSPCL director, distribution, DPS Grewal said the shortage is owing to the failure of a unit at Talwandi Sabo thermal plant in Bathinda district. “The PSPCL is finding it difficult to meet the demand of more than 14,500MW. The corporation is committed to providing uninterrupted power to all categories of consumers but we have our limitations. Thus, some restrictions have been imposed”, he said.“In view of the unprecedented situation, I appeal to all officials in government departments, boards and corporations to make judicious use of electricity in their offices and business centres by switching off lights, devices and appliances when not required and switching off high power consuming appliances such as air conditioners for the next three days,” Grewal said.PSEB Engineers Association president Jasvir Singh Dhiman has blamed the PSPCL management for the failure to make arrangements for the peak season. “Overdependence on the private sector and ignoring the advice of technocrats besides not having a regular chairperson and managing director (CMD) have led to this situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/unable-to-meet-demand-pspcl-wants-punjab-to-switch-off-acs-101625127146803.html

01-07-2021||Delhi||National Doctors’ Day: Delhi doctors recount the horrors of second wave||The second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic left even the most experienced doctors in tears as shortage of beds, medicines, and oxygen forced them to take a call on whom to save. On National Doctors’ Day, celebrated each year on July 1 to commemorate the birth and death anniversary of great physician Dr BC Roy, HT shares the experiences of doctors from city’s emergency and critical care teams who treated the most severe Covid-19 patients. So far, 798 doctors have died in the second wave of the pandemic, according to the registry by the Indian Medical Association, shooting past the toll of 748 recorded during the first wave. “Papa ghar ajayenge na?” Dr Ritesh Aggarwal, principal consultant of critical care at Max Hospital, SaketFor Dr Aggarwal, the most prominent story during the second wave of the pandemic is that of two young girls. He recounts a day in April when a woman in her early 30s with a six or seven-year-old girl walked up to him in the hospital. “We have been briefing the families of the patients on the phone so I did not know them; they saw my name and came to speak to me. I realised that they were the wife and daughter of one of my young patients – a 33-year-old engineer. Just as I was about to leave, the girl said ‘papa ghar aa jayenge na? Mere friend ke papa ghar nahi aye. (Will my father come home? My friend’s father did not.)’ I did not know what to say; why should young children have to deal with loss and death?” The other young girl was his six-year-old daughter who would usually complain about him not playing with her after work. “One day she came to me and said first you finish Covid and then we can play. My wife told me that she has been saying that papa should treat more Covid-19 patients after their class found out that their teacher died of Covid-19,” said Dr Aggarwal. He took his daughter’s advice seriously. When asked how he managed the emotional fallout of so many deaths and the sagging morale of team members, he said, “The best thing for me was to work hard. I knew there will be misses, I just tried to stay professional. As for my team, I led from the front. Whenever I saw the morale sagging, I would go into the ward and work with the team---put in a few extra hours, take some load off the team,” he said. However, working through the pandemic and having his phone buzz a few times every night during the second wave meant not much time for exercise in the morning. “It has definitely taken a toll on me. I have put on weight, my blood pressure has shot up, my lipid and renal parameters are haywire.” “We did not have time to cry, we kept working like zombies.” Dr Ritu Saxena, head of the emergency department at Lok Nayak Hospital For Dr Saxena, the city’s biggest Covid-19 treatment centre Lok Nayak Hospital, it was the death of a colleague’s wife that hit the hardest. “When one of our own doctors came to the hospital emergency department, we realised that his wife’s oxygen saturation was also low. But they had a nine-year-old son, so she decided to go home and wait for her family to come before getting admitted to the hospital. She was admitted a day later with just 84% saturation, she died the next day in front of her husband who was in the same ward,” said Dr Saxena. The second wave of the pandemic, she said, was like war. “The hospital was full; sometimes we had four patients sitting on one bed taking oxygen from a large cylinder because we had run out of oxygen ports. We had to triage; we had to take in patients whom we knew would have a better chance of survival. We were taking in younger patients,” she said. “When the oxygen crisis hit and we were asked not to take in any more patients, my doctors went outside the hospital gate without their coats and I took a round in my car to see whether there were sick patients we could help; we took patients in,” she added. Along with a gruelling day in the emergency department, she was also tasked with ensuring that all the bodies were disposed of on time. She recalled a day when there were nearly 100 bodies at the hospital and she kept dispatching ambulances throughout the day. “I had deputed 20 ambulances, yet I kept getting calls for more. That night, I dreamed of having to carry the dead in my car.” She said she had never faced a situation like the second wave of Covid-19 despite Lok Nayak being a high volume centre.And amid the entire crisis, there was no time to process grief. “We lost family members, we couldn’t even cry. We did not have the time. We just kept working like zombies,” she said. “We never thought there could be oxygen shortage.” Dr Rahul Kumar, associate consultant of the critical care department at Sir Ganga Ram hospital What he remembers about the second wave is the sheer number of patients. “The biggest problem – and I think this was true for all hospitals – was the huge number of patients and they were coming in when they were really sick. Patients who needed ICU care had to be admitted outside the ICU with non-invasive ventilators. We had to triage based on who was likely to survive and who wasn’t. There was staff crunch because people started testing positive. There was a shortage of beds, medicines, and even oxygen,” said Dr Kumar. He had never seen medicines or oxygen running out, he said. “Never in my life have I seen oxygen shortage; no one even thought such a shortage could arise. We had to plan for eventualities of oxygen running out, we had to have staff and oxygen cylinders on standby to take over if there is a dip in oxygen pressure,” he said. For him, the deaths of young doctors were the hardest. “There were young doctors admitted from other hospitals and seeing them die despite doing the best we could was hard. There were also these two pregnant Covid-19 patients under my care. One of the mothers survived after two months in the hospital; the other died. Both were young. The most difficult part is to tell their families, especially when a patient is young.” “After our shift, we were consulting patients over the phone or looking for medicines, oxygen for family members. It was traumatic.” Dr Abhijit Kumar, senior resident of anaesthesiology at Safdarjung Hospital Despite being a high volume centre, he said he had never seen such long queues outside Safdarjung Hospital. There were queues of ambulances waiting to bring in patients, he said. “The number of cases just shot up suddenly within a short duration. Preparations were made but none of us had expected the numbers that we received. The ICUs were full, there was a huge waiting list. There were patients in the wards who needed ICU care but we weren’t able to take them in. In a government hospital, we cannot really do triage at admission but we were trying to focus on younger, healthier patients who were more likely to survive,” said Dr Kumar. He remembers the four or five nights at the peak of cases in April when his phone kept buzzing incessantly. “It was friends, family, people I know asking for beds. But I knew the situation at our hospital and the others nearby. There just weren’t enough beds. It was traumatic emotionally for the doctors. Knowing that a patient needs care and having to refuse them. Knowing that if we left patients on their feet, they were likely to not survive,” he said. He said in a bid to help, he was working 24*7 even from home. “I would schedule consultations after work or try to find beds, oxygen for family members.” It was the hardest for him when despite putting in his best efforts when his friend’s father succumbed. “It was shattering for me to see him (school mate) deteriorate day by day despite my best efforts.” Dr Amit Kohli, intensive care specialist at Lok Nayak Hospital Dr Kohli, who was also dealing with the devastating second wave, had his school friend admitted in his ward and his father at another hospital at the same time. “One of my school mates – someone I grew up with, studied with for several years with, shared so many memories with – was admitted to my own ICU. I used to go up to him before my shift and talk a little. We would stay in touch on WhatsApp. It was shattering for me to see deteriorate day by day inspite of me doing my best. He died after 12 days,” said Dr Kohli. His father has recovered since and has come home. He still continues to need some oxygen from time to time. “Denying family members a bed or telling patients that some medicine or therapy would not work because it was too late was the hardest part,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/national-doctors-day-delhi-doctors-recount-the-horrors-of-second-wave-101625118625085.html

01-07-2021||Delhi||Doctors look back at the past for a better future||Since Covid-19 struck, the medical fraternity has been at the forefront of the battle, despite the challenges. From dealing with physical, mental and emotional pressures and fear of transmitting the virus to their families to never-ending shifts and adapting to digital consultations — all this while coping with personal losses, health care warriors went beyond the call of duty. On National Doctors’ Day, a few recall what the year taught them and what’s in store for 2021.Dr Rajeev K Sharma “In Covid-19 times, one thing we learnt was that we could forget that one is an orthopaedic surgeon or a cardiologist — all of us worked as doctors. We tried to advise our patients, friends and the community about how to protect themselves. The patients who had undergone operations, we checked in with them via calls and messages. The other challenge was delay in surgeries for those being admitted for elective surgeries like joint replacement as some of them had Covid-19 symptoms or were RT-PCR positive. And the chances of complications in such patients are plenty. I also feel that e-consultations should become a part of our life. And I think that, we need to stay prepared for the third wave. Social distancing and frequent hand washing should remain a part of our lives. Also, everybody should get vaccination,” shares Dr Rajeev K Sharma, chairman, Institute of Orthopaedics, Moolchand Medcity.Dr Anupam Sibal“The pandemic showed us how fragile our existence can be. It taught us to value our health. An annual health check is non-negotiable, and lifestyle changes need to be made. Another lesson was getting the work-life balance right. From the age of 18 till 24 (or 27 or 30 depending on training), doctors’ lives have been about studying and hospital duties. After that, it has been about patient care and updating knowledge. Finding time for other pursuits was never a priority. Nearly 1,500 doctors have sacrificed their lives fighting the pandemic. Their loved ones would have wanted them to spend time with their families, participating in what would be routine for most but is a luxury for doctors – anniversaries, birthdays, get-togethers. Another lesson was practising gratitude. One realised, more than ever before, the privilege we have of bringing back a smile and lending a shoulder. This pandemic also taught us humility and showed how little we have in our control. I learnt so much from not just medical staff but house keeping staff and technicians, who thought of new ideas to utilise resources, putting the goal of saving lives above all,” says Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director and senior paediatrician, Apollo Hospitals Group.Dr Manish Kulshrestha “Last year, everything was new and no one was ready. I’d say the country’s entire healthcare system crashed. Healthcare professionals were burnt out. We were scared for our families. Surgeries were exhausting — we could not breathe well, there was a lot of sweating in PPE kits and face shields would get fogged. Tele-consultation was a new thing for us. We were glad to get vaccinated and thought the pandemic would end but then the virus mutated. I got infected, too, but symptoms were mild due to the jab. We overcame this together... Hospitals also conducted mental health sessions. The vaccine now gives us some hope. But we must not be complacent,” says Dr Manish Kulshrestha, general and laparoscopic surgeon, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh.Dr Deepak Gupta“Fighting disease and death, this is what medical professionals go through, and SARS-CoV-2 was an onerous challenge. Late night online consultations , emergency treatment and wearing PPE suits for long hours was very challenging, but as doctors we have a duty to work regardless of the circumstances. When there was a shortage of beds and oxygen, I gave the patients the right medication and counselling to do their best at home. And I am happy to say that despite many cases in my area, there was no casualty. In our hospital, too, as I deal with tuberculosis patients, there were many patients who had Covid-19 themselves or a family member did. I counselled them with the right advice and there is no casualty amongst them, too. And I personally believe that with the right medications, precautions, care and trust, we can easily overcome Covid-19,” says Dr Deepak Gupta, who is a medical consultant at Safdarjung Hospital.Dr Rashmi Sharma“In the first wave, we lost a lot of doctors, para medical and medical staff. This time, too, there were challenges, but damage was a little less as many health professionals had been vaccinated. But the pandemic brought into notice the poor condition of health infrastructure. Even after putting in so much dedication, extended work hours, and putting own lives at risk, the blame comes on medical and para medical staff, who remain underpaid. Patients are losing faith in medical professionals, which is followed by violence against doctors in the form of assaults and threats. All of this leads to a defensive attitude. There needs to be stricter laws in place,” shares Dr Rashmi Sharma, director, Origyn Fertility and IVF, New Delhi, and joint editor, Indian Fertility Society.Young warrior on duty“The year gone by has been difficult and to start my internship during the peak of the pandemic was almost like trial by fire. Due to the immense number of cases, we did Covid-19 duties. We came face-to-face with human misery and also witnessed people give their all to come out of it and frantically arrange for resources amid the panic. So, at a very young stage of our careers, we were filled with sorrow, seeing first-hand many patients die in front of our eyes and breaking the news to the anxious relatives. The next few months also seem to be very challenging since it has been reported that the virus is mutating and is at times also able to evade the immunity provided by the Covid-19 vaccination. I hope our system is able to ramp up the facilities so that we don’t face similar problems of shortages like we did in the second wave. The healthcare workers have worked relentlessly to save the lives of patients, so we as young doctors will draw inspiration from the healthcare workers around us, and also work our hardest in any time of crisis or challenge,” says Dr Noor Dhaliwal, currently an intern at Lok Nayak Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/doctors-look-back-at-the-past-for-a-better-future-101625111020475.html

Jamwant,a special variety of black plum, with more than 90% flesh, that was produced by farmers in Bithoor, Kanpur was exported to London. It’s perhaps its medicinal properties that made it popular in the European market where it is categorised as exotic,” said CISH director, Shailendra Rajan. Rajan said the first batch of the fruit was sent in the first week of June by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (​APEDA). According to Dr CB Singh, AGM of APEDA, UP jamun holds a lot of export potential, just like mango. CISH officials said jamun has anti-diabetic properties. It contains high level of vitamin C and antioxidants, as well as bioactive compounds beneficial for human health. The bioactive compounds help in the improvement of heart health, digestion and gum health. Due to its numerous health benefits, some enthusiasts enjoy the pulp and then grind the seeds to consume the powder as asupplement.

On June 11, the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd floated an e-tender for wet-leasing a fixed-wing, twin-engine aircraft for three years. The aircraft should be air-conditioned and capable of night operation, said the tender notice, adding that the plane would be used by VIPs. The tender said the plane should be able to operate in any part of the country and be a super mid-sized aircraft equivalent to the Falcon 2000 or similar models. The aircraft would fly for at least 45 hours a month, the notice said.Also Read | West Bengal Covid-19: More relaxations in place from todayMocking the TMC, Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, wrote a tweet saying the aircraft was being hired at public expense to campaign for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Without naming chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Adhikari said a Pushpak Rath (the mythological flying chariot) was being procured for a “self-proclaimed Prime Minister.” “Pushpak Rath for (self proclaimed) PM??? Dissatisfied with helicopter’s range, process of acquiring a 10 seater Airplane has been initiated. Convenient for whimsical criss-crossing of the entire country for upcoming Loksava poll campaigning? On Govt expenses?” tweeted Adhikari. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “The government already has a helicopter. Why does it need an aircraft when there are only three operational airports in the state? This is wastage of public money.” TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said, “Many states in India have more than one plane. Adhikari should be aware that before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls Narendra Modi used the Gujarat government’s plane to fly between different states for carrying out campaigns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-takes-a-jibe-at-west-bengal-govt-for-planning-to-lease-aircraft-101625108544467.html

01-07-2021||Chandigarh||Political activities pick pace in Himachal ahead of byelections||Though the election commission is yet to announce the poll schedule, political activities have picked pace in the state, with the two arch-rivals – the ruling BJP and the Opposition –eyeing the byelections to Mandi Lok Sabha and Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly seats.Elections to the three seats were necessitated due to the death of sitting representatives. The Mandi Lok Sabha seat fell vacant due to the demise of MP Ramswaroop Sharma. Jubbal-Kotkhai MLA Narinder Bragta had died of post-Covid complications, while Fatehpur legislator Sujan Singh Pathania passed away due to prolonged illness.The byelection will be a litmus test for the BJP, particularly chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, whose popularity has taken a beating of late due to different controversies. The Congress is hoping to snatch the Mandi Lok Sabha seat and Jubbal-Kotkhai from the BJP. Fatehpur has remained a Congress stronghold, while the Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly segment has seen a change of guard in the last four elections.To strategise for the byelections, the BJP on Wednesday held a virtual meet of its state working committee, which was attended by all the senior leaders besides national vice-president Saudan Singh, state in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna, his deputy Sanjay Tondon and chief minister Jai Ram Thakur.State BJP president Suresh Kashyap said the party has already deputed in-charges and co in-charges for the bypolls.“We have directed the workers to pull up their socks and start working at booth-level,” said Kashyap, adding that the party’s election committee will meet soon to finalise the candidates.“We will win all the three byelections,” claimed the BJP chief, adding that the BJP had also prepared a roadmap for the 2022 election.Speaking on the occasion, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the Congress had played petty politics during the Covid pandemic. “The Opposition has no reason to criticise the government. Unemployment and inflation prevailed during Congress’ regime too,” he said.Meanwhile, the Congress has blown the bulge from its stronghold, the Fatehpur assembly segment, where the state party chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore held a “Jan Aakrosh” rally.Though the rally was against rising inflation, unemployment and government failures on various fronts, the real purpose was to gauge the public mood in the politically significant Kangra district. Taking on the government during the rally, Rathore said, the Congress would win the byelections as the public is disappointed with the current regime.“The Opposition won most posts in the Panchayati Raj Elections but the BJP misused government machinery to obtain the support of winning candidates,” he said.He also took pot shots at the BJP over the rising fuel prices and inflation and said the public will not only ensure defeat of saffron regime in byelections but will also show it the door in the 2022 assembly polls. The mega event was joined by senior leaders, including Mukesh Agnihotri, Asha Kumari, GS Bali and Chander Kumar, among others. Popular regional singer Karnail Rana joined BJP on Wednesday at his native place Dehra. Rana, a former employee of the state information and public relation department was welcomed into the party by forest minister Rakesh Pathania during the virtual meeting of state working committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/political-activities-pick-pace-in-himachal-ahead-of-byelections-101625088023303.html
01-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A perspective in the city||This is a city walk that gives a sense of the land our city stands on. Let’s start with the mysterious wall crisscrossing through what looks like a jungle. It emerges from a bunch of trees, runs along a couple of 100 metres over the red sandy earth, and disappears again into more trees. This is the view from the cliff, as you look below at what used to be a stone quarry. The wall must have been built when the quarry was active to mark the Delhi-Haryana interstate border.The cliff is a few steps away from the busy Gurugram-Faridabad road, in the hilly Aravalli landscape, within the National Capital Region. The spot is situated a short drive away from the city centres of Delhi and Gurugram. The area used to be excavated for Badarpur sand and stone—for centuries.The mining in this piece of scenery began in the early 1990s and, following a court order, ended a decade later. The place looks abandoned.One carefully walks down the rocky slope on which trucks once carried stones from the mine. The ground is red with Badarpur sand. The sides of the slope are made of the same sand; their depressions and fissures suggest that the surface is being eroded by water. The slender leafless stems of tamarisk, a rare tree in Delhi, is beginning to bloom with little pink flowers. The blue flowers of shankhpushpi are growing not an inch above the ground. The soil here is porous and does not retain water, and so only a narrow band of plants survives. Siras, ullu and sheesham are other trees growing here, along with the thorny vilayati keekar. One wonders if many centuries ago, most of the Delhi region with its present-day colonies, sectors, malls and markets resembled this bleak terrain.Somewhere beyond this silence, a cicada is singing.The walk goes down to a flat, parched ground. At one corner stands a datura plant, with a solitary white flower. A little further, on a slope, is a sand cave that houses a small community of monkeys, along with birds and insects. There are also signs of porcupine and palm civet. The cave’s packed sand could easily disintegrate and wash away in heavy rain, destroying the little habitat it nurtures.On climbing back the slope towards the busy road, the wilderness feels like a mirage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-perspective-in-the-city-101625086571809.html

01-07-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers gherao Punjab minister Dharamsot in Patiala over erratic power supply||Farmers protesting against erratic power supply for sowing of paddy and other issues gheraoed Punjab cabinet minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot at Chehel village of Patiala district’s Nabha sub-division on Wednesday. The minister was at the village for foundation stone laying ceremony of a road.The farmers were also protesting against the state government’s failure to waive their loans as promised in the 2017 assembly poll manifesto and its inability to resolve the issue pertaining to the three controversial farm acts. The protesters gathered around the minister as soon as he reached the spot and raised slogans against him. A heavy police force was deployed to keep situation under control. Baljit Singh, a farmer activist, said the farmers are facing a huge problem irrigating their fields due to erratic power supply. “We are not getting the 8-hour supply as promised. The same minister before 2017 sat on the same road with us demanding proper power supply against the then Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) government. But after coming to power, the Congress is following in the footsteps of its predecessor,” he said.A video of the incident also surfaced in which a woman is seen confronting Dharamsot for visiting the area after five years.“What is the need of visiting people with such heavy police force now when you (Dharamsot) came alone while seeking votes in 2017? It took you five years to get worried about the construction of the road,” she said.Dharamsot could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.In a press release, Dharamsot said the state government will fulfill all the promises made in its 2017 poll manifesto before 2022 elections.Also, farmers blocked the Ludhiana- Ferozepur highway near Dagru village in Moga district over poor power supply. The protesters said they were getting only 4-hour supply since paddy sowing started.They blocked the highway for at least 4 hours, causing inconvenience to commuters.BKU to block national highway tomorrow The Bhartiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) announced to block the Jalandhar-Ludhiana national highway on Friday over poor power supply during the paddy sowing season. Union’s Jalandhar district president Mandeep Singh Samra said the Punjab government is not providing 8-hour power supply to farmers as it is hand in glove with the Centre that wants to erode the ongoing protests in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-gherao-punjab-minister-dharamsot-in-patiala-over-erratic-power-supply-101625084123257.html
01-07-2021||Chandigarh||PSPCL imposing 6-8 hour cuts in rural areas, up to 3 hours in cities||The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is imposing cuts of 6-8 hours in rural areas of the state and up to 3 hours in all major cities as it is unable to meet the rising demand due to less electricity generation amid the ongoing paddy sowing season and soaring temperatures. Whereas the rural belts have been witnessing major outages for the last four days, unscheduled cuts were put in place in urban pockets on Tuesday. The situation will remain grim in the coming days as the power demand is rising by the day accompanied by a delay in monsoon. Even in urban industrial areas, cuts to tune of over 2 hours were imposed. The power supply to farmers was only 6 hours, against the promise of eight, and that too with frequent interruptions. On Monday, the power demand in Punjab reached 14,225 megawatt (MW) against the supply of 12,695 MW, leaving a gap of nearly 1,550 MW. While one unit of the private-run Talwandi Sabo power plant is completely shut since March 8, another has also developed snag and is operating at half of its capacity, generating only 960 MW against its total installed capacity of 1,980 MW. Also, a unit of the Ropar thermal plant went out of operation, causing a shortage of another 210 MW. Power generation at the hydel power plants is also less due to low water levels in the dams.“The gap in demand and supply was despite the fact that Punjab has purchased almost 500 lakh units from the grid. The failure of private plants to provide committed supply during the peak season has resulted in the shortage. Otherwise, there were no cuts in the last two years,” said a PSPCL official.BBMB requested to increase generation PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad said they have requested the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) to increase power generation.In a letter, Prasad asked the BBMB chairman to explore the modalities to generate more power from the Bhakra project and run all available units round the clock to provide relief to farmers.The CMD said the water level of the Bhakra reservoir is less, and therefore the BBMB is not generating power to full capacity. “The water level of Bhakra reservoir is 1524.60 feet against the last year’s 1581.50 feet. Also, the water level of Pong Dam is 1,281 feet against the last year’s 1,335 feet,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pspcl-imposing-6-8-hour-cuts-in-rural-areas-up-to-3-hours-in-cities-101625084062916.html

On June 1, marking the sixth anniversary of the sacrilege incident at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village, SAD (Amritsar) president Simranjit Singh Mann and Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (ad hoc) president Baljit Singh Daduwal had announced to start a morcha from July 1. As per information, Mann has reached Faridkot after holding a meeting at Bathinda to take a decision on the venue, where morcha will be started and the chalk out the line of action for the agitation. Faridkot senior superintendent of police (SSP) Swarandeep Singh said the Sikh outfits had announced to start morcha at Faridkot following which police are on a high alert. In a letter to ADGP (law and order), Faridkot SSP stated that a ‘panthic morcha’ could be started by SAD (Amritsar) and other Sikh outfits on the intervening night of June 30 and July 1. “Sikh leaders have asked people to participate in the morcha at a large scale. We would require more manpower to maintain law and order,” SSP said, asking for 25 ARP teams and 5 commando companies. The police have also identified six sites --- Dana Mandi and sports stadium both at Bargari, on National Highway near Behbal Kalan village, Dana Mandi at Behbal Kalan, Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village and Kotkapura light chowk ----where morcha could be started. SAD (Amritsar) leader Jaskaran Singh Kahan Singh Wala said they are moving ahead with their plan. However, the Sikh outfit leaders did not disclose the venue of morcha as they suspect police would not let them start the agitation. In 2018, Sikh outfits had come together to hold Bargari Insaaf Morcha which ended in December 2018 after 193 days. Congress ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa had approached the morcha and declared from the stage that the government had accepted all their demands. The lifting of morcha was widely criticised by Sikh outfits who blame parallel acting jathedar of the Akal Takht Dhian Singh Mand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sacrilege-firing-cases-sikh-outfits-likely-to-start-morcha-at-bargari-on-thursday-cops-on-alert-101625083945878.html
01-07-2021||Chandigarh||Pink bollworm in 6 Bathinda villages sets off alarm bells among cotton growers||Infestation of pink bollworm in at least six Bathinda villages has left the cotton growers and officials of the state agriculture department worried.The agriculture department is on its toes as it is for the second consecutive year that the pest attack has been reported in the major cash crop of southern Punjab.Experts and the agriculture department blame oil mills, cotton ginning units and a section of villagers for ignoring the laid-down protocol. They say Bollgard 2, or BG-2, Monsanto’s second-generation insecticidal technology for cotton, was considered to protect crops against the pink bollworm. But previous incidents from other states indicate that the variety may have developed resistance.Director, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) regional research station, Bathinda, Paramjit Singh said the pest larvae are reaching the state with cottonseed consignments from south-west states, including Maharashtra and Karnataka.“Oil mills and cotton ginning units across the state were asked to follow guidelines to ensure the pest do not entre fields from where it could harm the cotton crop. Farmers were also advised to remove cotton straw, which is used as firewood or consumed to energise brick kilns etc, completely from the fields,” he said.A cotton grower from Gurusar Sainewala, about 25km from the district headquarters, said half of his 15-acre land has been found infested with pink bollworm. A sizeable stock of cotton straw was lying adjacent to his field on Wednesday.“I had sown cotton seeds on April 16 and hoped of a good profit. But the pest attack at the flowering stage has dashed my hopes. A pheromone trap that uses chemicals secreted by insects to lure pests at my field is full of deadly pest. Use of sprays to contain the pest means additional cost and high vulnerability of crop yield loss,” he said.Bathinda chief agriculture officer Dr BS Sidhu said intensive field surveillance has been initiated in the district. He said it is a challenging task to detect pink bollworm in time and control it through pesticides as it stays inside a cotton boll.“In the last three days, our teams have spotted pink bollworm in six villages. All infected fields were sown early in mid-April and the pest is visible in the flowers. Advisory has been issued to farmers control the situation,” he said.Principal entomologist of the PAU Vijay Kumar: “Normally the pest appears in cotton after 65-70 days of sowing. Cotton bolls look normal from the outside. But each infected boll has a pink bollworm inside. The worm eats cotton seeds and prevents the development of cotton staple fibre around it well before the boll opens,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pink-bollworm-in-6-bathinda-villages-sets-off-alarm-bells-among-cotton-growers-101625083823576.html

Subsequently, the confirmation of provisional attachment of properties was ordered by adjudicating authority (PMLA) in 2016. Following this, the ED served the eviction notice to the accused, including Harmesh Gaba, and concerned agencies, including Phagwara sub-registrar, in 2016. The ED said it came to light that Gaba sold properties, including 14 kanal land situated in Hadiabad area of Phagwara, attached by the adjudicating authority (PMLA). It was ordered that the provisionally attached property will not be removed, parted with or otherwise dealt with without prior permission of this directorate. Harmesh Gaba had filed an appeal in appellate tribunal against the order of adjudicating authority PMLA in 2020.“The sale of attached properties during pendency of appeal filed by accused himself shows utter abuse of process of law and degree of mens rea is evident from conduct,” the ED said.“Despite the issuance of provisional attachment order and eviction notice to sub registrar, Phagwara, the authorised officer in connivance with Harmesh Gaba, knowingly allowed the sale of properties, which is subject matter before the appellate tribunal and the special PMLA court and the Government of India,” the ED said. A probe conducted by police found that Harmesh sold around 14 kanals of land to eight persons on different dates. According to the Phagwara SDM report, negligence was found on tehsilder Parveen Chabbra and the area Patwari. The case was registered under Section 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC at the Phagwara police station. The ED chargesheeted nine members of the Gaba family, associated with his 11 firms, in connection with the Bhola drug case for alleged violation of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Besides Gaba, his three sons — Gurjit, Gurmesh and Mahesh — father Suresh Kumar, brother Harmesh Gaba, 23-year-old grandson Khushwant Gaba, Gurjit’s wife Rekha and Harmesh’s wife Sudesh Rani were booked. The ED’s chargesheet had listed 11 firms, jointly owned by the Gaba family, and their properties at Phillaur, Goraya and Una (Himachal Pradesh). The ED had registered the money laundering case after former Punjab Police DSP and drug lord Jagdish Singh Bhola had in January 2014 accused Gaba of trading in synthetic drug pseudoephedrine in association with Delhi-based smuggler Varinder Raja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bhola-drug-case-2-revenue-dept-officials-among-three-booked-for-selling-attached-properties-101625083582989.html
01-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir alleges illegal mining in Beas, dept trashes charges||AMRITSARHigh drama was witnessed at Wazir Bhullar village of Baba Bakala sub-division situated along the banks of Beas on the Amritsar-Delhi national highway after Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal and his supporters conducted a raid at a mining site.Sukhbir claimed that the mining site was illegal and was being operated for the last three months with heavy machinery installed in the river’s running water, while the district administration tried to justify that it was an approved mine of the government. Sukhbir waited for at least two hours at the site until the officials of the district administration visited the spot and assured him of taking “legal action if anyone found to be guilty in floating the rules”.The SAD chief also filed a complaint against Congress minister Sukhbinder Singh Sukh Sarkaria and MLAs Santokh Singh Bhalaipur, Sukhpal Singh Bhullar, Inderbir Singh Bolaria, Ramanjit Singh Sikki and Kulbir Singh Zira, besides others at the Beas police station for “illegal” mining.A complaint was also lodged by Friends and Company, which claimed to have the contract for the mining at the site against Sukhbir and some former Akali MLAs who accompanied him for threatening the employees and staff of the company and obstructing and interfering in the mining operation.During his visit to the site, Sukhbir said according to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), no mining activity could take place within 5km area of a bridge. But in this case, sand was being excavated within a distance of 1km of the bridge, claimed Sukhbir. Some truck drivers, who were being charged a “goonda tax” of ₹16,000 per truck, have also filed a separate complaint, it was learnt. Villagers also filed a complaint saying panchayat land was being mined by the mafia without their permission, claimed SAD leaders.Sukhbir also condemned the “mining mafia” for trying to divert attention from their crime by filing a false complaint against him and other Akali leaders. “Our only sin is to expose this corrupt and scam-ridden government as well as its mining mafia,” he added.According to the SAD, the visit found a few hundred trucks, fork cranes and even a pipeline on floaters on the spot. Sukhbir said it was shocking that chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was allowing the sand mafia to indulge in daylight robbery of state resources within a kilometre from the national highway. Superintendent of police (SP-investigation) Gaurav Toora said: “The allegations made in the SAD complaint are being examined. We are writing to the mining department seeking a report. Once the report comes, legal action will be sought and action will be taken as per law.”About the company’s complaint, SSP-rural Gurleen Singh Khurana said: “It is being verified. According to the sub-divisional officer of the mining department, the site was approved for de-silting. Our investigation is on.”Site legal, says mining dept In a release, the state mining department said the site was approved by the government. A spokesperson of the department said from mining block number 5 that was allotted to the company, the government has been getting ₹34.5 crore revenue annually. He said during the SAD government, the revenue was only ₹30 to ₹40 crore from entire Punjab. He said the state government has been earning ₹300 crore revenue from the mining in the state. He also made it clear that there was no illegal mining site in Amritsar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-alleges-illegal-mining-in-beas-dept-trashes-charges-101625083342938.html

01-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Drive launched to ensure safe travel in auto-rickshaw||In a first-of-its-kind initiative to make people feel safe while travelling in auto-rickshaws, the Ludhiana police have launched a special drive to verify all three-wheelers by equipping them with a unique ID and linking it with PPSAANJH mobile application. The traffic police have come up with a plan to do away with unlicensed auto-rickshaws in the city. The move is aimed at curbing crime involving auto-rickshaw gangs.Conceptualised in 2012 during the tenure of Ishwar Singh, first commissioner of Ludhiana police, it took nearly 10 years for the auto-rickshaw registration to become a reality. The current police chief, Rakesh Agrawal, who launched the drive and an android mobile application by pasting reflective stickers bearing unique ID on auto-rickshaws here on Wednesday, said, “By using SafeAutoPb on PPSAANJH app, passengers can verify all details of an auto-rickshaw and credentials of its driver.” “As soon as a passenger will enter the unique ID number in the application, all the details, including the driver’s photo, auto’s exterior and interior photos besides its registration will appear on the mobile screen,” he said, adding that the move aims to provide sense of safety and security to passengers, especially women, who travel alone at odd hours.How auto-rickshaw drivers can get themselves registeredAgrawal said anyone willing to register their auto-rickshaws would have to visit the nearest saanjh kendra with all necessary documents, including driving licence, RC, permit and address proof among others.He said that saanjh kendra will use the ‘SafeAutoPB’ software’s official login to capture details of the owner, driver, auto-rickshaw and upload copies of all relevant documents, and generate a unique ID, of which four reflective stickers will be pasted inside and outside the verified auto. He added that whenever a new driver is added to an entry, it would be the responsibility of the owner to get his/her details updated in the software. The police chief said that once the database of auto-rickshaws is created, it will also help in preventing crimes. Apart from this, it would be easy to identify the accused in case anyone commits a crime using an unregistered auto-rickshaw. Agrawal added that joint police commissioner (traffic) will be the nodal officer for the smooth conduct of the drive and the police will be charging ₹150 for covering the cost of stickers and driver’s verification for which proper receipt will be issued from saanjh kendra.“It is mandatory for every auto-rickshaw owner to get their vehicles registered with the unique ID, otherwise strict action will be taken against the violators,” said joint police commissioner (traffic) Deepak Pareek. Agrawal also urged the residents of Ludhiana to prefer travelling in auto-rickshaws with unique ID pasted on them. In case of any suspicion, the passenger can immediately call the police control room at 112, he added. Lakhwinder Singh Dhillon, president of Auto-rickshaw Union, meanwhile, slammed the decision of registration. He said the move has been taken without discussion with the union representatives. He alleged that most of the auto-rickshaws are being operated by nexus involving politicians and cops, while those owning a three-wheeler are just wasting time in completing government formalities. He said while diesel and petrol auto-rickshaws have been asked to register themselves with the police, no such proposal has been initiated for battery operated auto-rickshaws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-drive-launched-to-ensure-safe-travel-in-autorickshaw-101625083165215.html

As per the officials, the drive has been initiated on the directions of mayor Balkar Sandhu, as plastic carry bags dumped on the roads choke drain/sewer lines during monsoon season.Ashwani Sahota nodal office, health branch, said the drive will continue in the coming days, and MC will take strict action against the violators.The state government had imposed a complete ban on the use of plastic carry bags in April 2016, but the civic body has been struggling to implement the same in the city. The drives initiated in the past got derailed either due to political pressure or resentment shown by the traders.One of the officials, requesting anonymity, said the civic body conducts such drives only when the higher authorities or local bodies department issue directions regarding the same. To impose a complete ban, MC and Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) need to take coordinated action against the manufacturing and trading of carry bags, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-issues-72-challans-confiscates-63-kg-of-plastic-carry-bags-in-two-days-101625083162995.html

Citing hike in diesel price and maintenance expenses, the company has now demanded that the civic body should at least pay ₹435 per tonne, otherwise it will stop the lifting process from July 1. Mayor Sandhu had on Tuesday formed a committee of councillors and MC officials to look into the matter. The panel was asked to explore the viability of garbage lifting by MC on its own and look into the demand of the contractor. Panel head senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra said they have decided that MC should continue with the contractor, otherwise the civic body will have to make huge investments and gather resources to deal with 1,100 MT garbage, which will take some time.“The lifting of garbage will not be stopped and the same contractor will continue the work. The final decision regarding the rate (amount) of tipping fee to be paid to the contractor will be taken by mayor and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal,” said Malhotra. A2Z company had terminated its contract with the MC on February 4 and the latter made stopgap arrangements by roping in the third party to whom A2Z company had sublet the work of lifting garbage from the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-decides-to-increase-tipping-fee-to-continue-garbage-lifting-ops-101625083105261.html

01-07-2021||Chandigarh||Doctors’ Day: Those on the frontline recount horror of war they waged against Covid||As the nation celebrates Doctor’s Day, medical professionals who turned out to be guardian angels in the time of Covid pandemic share their experiences of how they fought the invisible enemy. It has been nearly 16 months since the medical professionals are waging a continuous war with Covid. Many of them feel that the virus has taught them some of the important lessons of their lives. Dr Rajesh Mahajan, professor of medicine, Emergency in-charge and nodal officer for Covid at DMCH, who had attended and treated the first case of coronavirus in Ludhiana on March 20, 2020, said, “The worst time was when I and principal of the institute Dr Sandeep Puri got ourselves isolated after coming in contact with the first patient at DMCH. Everyone was scared of interacting with us. And till then, little headway was made in the field of treatment of the disease. Those were anxious times but as the time progressed, we learned more about the virus and managed to save many precious lives.” Senior cardiologist at DMC Heart Institute Dr Bishav Mohan, who is also a member of the Covid task force of Punjab, said, “Initially we took Covid as a challenge as patients were increasing and treatment was limited. But with time, we took it as a mission to serve people. It was difficult. When people were scared to come near a Covid patient, we were up against an invisible enemy. It was agonising to see some of our known and loved ones losing the battle.”Dr Amanpreet Kaur Brar, MD (medicine) at the civil hospital is among the first batch of doctors to treated Covid patients. She did not let her average salary and the hospital’s acute staff crunch become a deterrent. She said, “It was a real challenge to serve in the government sector during a pandemic. I can easily relate our work, our fears, and our courage to win the fight against Covid with a fireman dousing flames or a soldier in the battlefield. With the support of family and excellent teamwork shown by paramedics, we came out as winners by treating about 3,000 moderate to severe patients in Ludhiana civil hospital.”Dr Baldeep Singh, MD, of Deep Hospital in Ludhiana, said, “The pandemic has been a challenging phase for the entire medical fraternity. Initially, there was not enough data on treatment protocols and it was a continuously evolving process. Drug shortage was consistent throughout.” Dr Rajiv Kundra, medical superintendent at SPS Hospital, said, “I have been working in the healthcare sector for around 20 years, but had never witnessed such enormous pressure. From keeping distance from my near and dear ones to spending countless nights alone in my room, I saw and managed it all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/doctors-day-those-on-the-frontline-recount-horror-of-war-they-waged-against-covid-101625083102824.html

The state’s local government department has revoked its approval for at least six development projects that the improvement trust had started, on the recommendation of the MC. The projects halted include beautification of flyovers, maintenance of parks, which also include installation of swings, LED lights and open gyms etc. The government departments have been at loggerheads due to a rift within the Congress party’s district unit Mayor Nitika Bhalla has also written a letter to the local government department, stating that the MC will carry out development of the city with its own funds. HT has copies of these letters. Before she assumed the charge of mayor, however, she had written to the trust to maintain parks in her ward.Sources claimed that trust chairman Vinod Bansal is an aspirant for a Congress ticket from Moga and wants to replace the present MLA, Dr Harjot Kamal. Sensing this, Kamal has started calling the shots in the MC to ensure Bansal does not gain prominence in the public eye. Bansal said, “I started with these development works after locals approached us. We have already developed five parks in the city. Act 69 of the Improvement Trust rules allows us to carry out development works anywhere in the city. We passed resolutions and then got approval from the local government department. Now, the permission has been cancelled.”Mayor Nitika said, “We are planning to carry out these works as these fall in jurisdiction of the Moga MC. There is no need for the trust to get involved.” MLA Kamal said, “The trust’s work is to develop colonies. Maintenance and development of parks is the duty of the MC. We will do these works on our own and installing open gyms in parks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/moga-improvement-trust-mc-not-on-same-page-development-hit-101625082804749.html

He and his family settled in Los Angeles, California managing multiple convenience stores. In 2003, he moved his family to Fresno, California.“Living in the Central Valley, Singh flourished his businesses. He was a business owner of purchased and newly built stores. Singh had over 30 gas stations and liquor stores,” Costa said on the House floor on Monday.“He could prioritise his time, manage multiple stores, and have time for his family. Singh would attend many events in the Central Valley, including many of my own, and he would often share his wisdom about the Sikh community to me,” he said as he urged his Congressional colleagues to join him in celebrating the great life of Singh.Describing Grewal as one the North Jersey’s most compassionate community leaders, Congressman Josh Gottheimer said on the House floor that the Indian-American Sikh was truly an unselfish and deeply caring man who made an impact on everyone who crossed his path.“As a founding member of Glen Rock’s Gurdwara, Pritam helped build a safe space for North Jersey’s Sikh community to come together and worship. Having personally visited several times, I can attest to the special atmosphere he instilled in this important Glen Rock establishment,” he said.“Pritam always felt a calling to promote quality education throughout his community. He taught mechanical engineering at Fairleigh Dickinson University, and later partnered with his brother, Amarjit, to establish the Grewal, Harchand Singh and Jagir Kaur Memorial Scholarship of Ramapo College, in memory of his late parents,” Gottheimer said.He said Pritam was also widely known throughout Hackensack University Medical Centre, where the trauma team took care of him after an accident in 2012.“While Pritam is no longer with us, his spirit, legacy, and impact on North Jersey will live on forever,” the Congressman added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lawmakers-pay-tributes-to-two-eminent-punjab-origin-personalities-in-us-house-101625082803265.html

He has the ideal combination of experience, values, and leadership ability to helm the enforcement division at this critical time. I look forward to working closely with him to protect investors and root out wrongdoing in our markets,” Gensler said.Grewal is the second pick for the post since President Joe Biden took office in January.The commission had tapped attorney Alex Oh to lead the enforcement division in April, but she stepped down only days later for unstated “personal reasons,” the NJ.com reported.“The enforcement division has a critical role to play in finding and punishing violations of the law,” said Grewal.“I’m excited to get to work with the talented team of public servants to uncover and prosecute misconduct and protect investors. I thank Governor (Phil) Murphy for the opportunity to serve the people of New Jersey and all of the colleagues with whom I’ve had the pleasure to work during my career in the state,” he said. Grewal has been the state’s top law enforcement leader for more than three years, the first to hit that mark since the early 1990s, the report added.As the nation’s first Sikh state attorney general, Grewal and his office have overhauled the rules governing police use of force in New Jersey for the first time in a generation and joined other states to sue the federal government more in three years than the Garden State had in the previous four decades, while simultaneously investigating and prosecuting a range of crimes.The attorney general in New Jersey has more direct authority over local police than in any other state, the NJ.com noted.Grewal graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in 1995. He obtained his law degree from the College of William & Mary, Marshall-Wythe School of Law in 1999.New Jersey Governor Murphy, a Democrat who appointed Grewal, in a statement said that he will miss Grewal’s leadership.“Though we’ll miss his leadership, I know he’s the right person to protect investors all across the nation.” “Through his efforts standing up to the Trump administration’s attacks on New Jersey and our diverse communities, instituting historic reforms in policing, and leading the fight against gun violence, attorney general Grewal has been an invaluable member of our administration,” Murphy said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/first-sikh-american-attorney-general-gurbir-grewal-resigning-to-join-sec-101625082622880.html

There was evidence that some vulnerable victims were targeted more than once,” said Claire Bennett, a specialist prosecutor for the CPS proceeds of crime division.“Where we can take money from people who have profited from crime, we will not hesitate to do so. In 2019-20 the CPS recovered over GBP 100 million, stopping hundreds of criminals benefitting from their ill-gotten gains,” she said.On December 20, 2017, Sandhu pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to defraud in respect of the sale of carbon credits through Harman Royce Ltd and Kendrick Zale Ltd in a City of London Police investigation. He was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for each of those offences, to be served concurrently.Sandhu’s available asset figures were determined by a court to be GBP 391,680. Notable known available assets include a rose gold Patek Phillipe watch valued at GBP 72,000, Audemars Piguet watch valued at GBP 22,000, and a Rolex watch valued at GBP 4,000.The defendant attempted to stash some of his assets away, but the CPS said its investigation teams uncovered hidden assets of GBP 200,000 which he now has to pay back as part of the available assets figures.Much of the money obtained through the frauds in question was spent on his lavish lifestyle. There is evidence of spending on luxury holiday villa rental, watches and jewellery, designer clothing and over GBP 9,000 (over ₹9 lakh) of dental work.In relation to a further separate Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) case, Sandhu was convicted of a number of counts of conspiracy to defraud and three counts of communicating an invitation to engage in an investment activity, which involved a fraudulent share sale scheme, on December 11, 2017. In all, he was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud, fraud, and money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjaborigin-fraudster-ordered-to-pay-compensation-from-assets-in-uk-101625082503207.html

Reliance has around 275 stores in Punjab, all of which are closed for the past eight months, with farmers laying seize to the properties. “We are in a deep financial crisis and moving towards bankruptcy, as there has been no rental income from our properties for the past 7-8 months, because all Reliance Retail outlets have been forcibly closed by agitating farmers. Farmers have even set up tents outside our stores,” the memorandum says. It adds, “We are all Punjabis and fully support farmers, but such forced closure of Reliance stores is only harming Punjab as Reliance procures a lot of products locally, provides huge direct and indirect employment to Punjabis and pays huge taxes. No corporation would be interested to invest in the state if they are not allowed to operate peacefully,” said Dharampal Singh Nain from Jagraon.OSD Brar assured the building owners that all possible support would be extended and the matter would be taken up with the CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/owners-of-buildings-rented-to-reliance-seek-cm-s-help-101625081662946.html

Dissatisfied with helicopter’s range, process of acquiring a 10 seater Airplane has been initiated. Convenient for whimsical criss-crossing of the entire country for upcoming Loksava (Lok Sabha) poll campaigning? On Govt expenses?” tweeted Adhikari, a reference to Banerjee’s prime ministerial ambitions.On June 11, the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd floated an e-tender for hiring a fixed-wing, twin-engine aircraft on wet lease for three years. The aircraft should be air-conditioned and capable of night operation, said the tender notice which said the plane was proposed to be leased for the state’s dignitaries.The tender said the plane should be able to operate in any part of the country and be a super mid-sized aircraft equivalent to the Falcon 2000 or similar models. The aircraft would fly for at least 45 hours a month, the notice said.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh wondered why the state government needed to go for a plane. “The government already has a helicopter. Why does it need an aircraft when there are only three operational airports in the state?” he said, a reference to airports in state capital Kolkata, Siliguri’s Bagdogra and the Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport in Paschim Bardhaman district.“This is a wastage of public money,” Ghosh said. Trinamool Congress hit back at the BJP, pointing that there were states which had more than one aircraft. “Many states in India have more than one plane. Adhikari should be aware that before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls Narendra Modi used the Gujarat government’s plane to fly between different states for campaigning,” TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/for-self-proclaimed-pm-suvendu-adhikari-s-dig-at-mamata-over-tender-for-plane-101625081188789.html

01-07-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Building a bond of trust between doctor, patient||It was a winter evening in 1969 when I was posted at the Civil Hospital, Fazilka. I got a call from the senior medical officer to attend to a delivery case near the Pakistan border. Being the only lady doctor in town, I headed for the village with a staff nurse and a male help. We took along a delivery kit and a few medicines, but there were no backups for oxygen or blood. It was dark by the time we reached the isolated hut where the frail woman was crying in pain. The only source of light was a lantern. I requested the men of her family to shift the patient to hospital, but they refused. There was no way out but to conduct the delivery. I listened for the baby’s heart, luckily it was beating. I thanked God as the baby arrived, yelling loud and clear. The woman’s family had assured me that whatever the consequences, I would be sent back with my staff safely. Still, I could breathe easy only when we reached the hospital. A doctor’s duty and the outcome This happened more than five decades ago. When I look back, I wonder how we were so naïve to take such risk. I ask myself and my colleagues if such a situation were to arise today, how many of us would go to a remote village to conduct a delivery in the dark. I’m sure hardly anyone would risk it. The reasons are clear; first being personal security. Nowadays, no doctor likes to visit an unknown patient. Who knows if someone is taking you for a ransom in the garb of a patient! Back then, such incidents were rare. Second, if something drastic were to happen to the patient today, I may not have returned. About 50 years ago, we were made to understand that if we were putting in a sincere effort, no harm would come to us, even if the patient died. Today, many patients believe a doctor is only making money and have become potential litigants. Every doctor wants that his patient should go back satisfied and fully recover as the goodwill brings in more people in need of treatment. So, why would a doctor spoil a case knowingly? Does anyone think about the condition of a doctor if something goes wrong with the patient? The doctor’s blood pressure falls along with that of the patient’s and he/she undergoes just as much stress. Why put docs in the dock? We doctors deal with a complicated machine, the human body, which responds in the most unexpected manner under stress. Which professional can claim he/she is always right? We should not forget that a doctor is dealing with sick people who come to him of their own free will, especially in elective cases, and they have time to choose and decide on their doctor after consulting others. Why does he have to face the wrath of the same people if something adverse happens? In many cases, the doctor is manhandled, his clinic vandalised and he is even handcuffed! In emergencies, it’s worse. If a doctor says he is not equipped for a case and advises the attendants to shift the patient to an institute, imagine his plight if God forbid the patient dies on the way. On the other hand, if he feels the patient might not survive the trip and wants to give him a last chance, he faces a backlash. This is in spite of the fact that everything is explained to the family and consent is obtained. The doctor is blamed both ways. Why? Did he intentionally kill the patient or spoil the case? Why does the media splash the news without verifying facts from the doctor concerned? Does anyone think what will happen to his practice, which he has struggled to build for years? Nurturing the bond with respect In case of negligence and complications, there should be an inquiry by a senior medical faculty and strict action should be taken against the erring doctor. Even consumer courts should consult a board of doctors before admitting a case. The doctor-patient relationship is one of trust. The doctor expects his patient not to conceal facts, follow the prescription and report to him in case of any problem. The patient also expects a sympathetic hearing and a frank opinion. If both parties are honest, there is no reason why there should be any problem. The sacred bond should be nurtured with respect. The writer is a Chandigarh-based gynaecologist.

01-07-2021||Chandigarh||Heatwave sweeps Chandigarh, power cuts add to woes||Amid a subdued monsoon, heatwave swept Chandigarh on Wednesday, for the first time this summer. The maximum temperature was recorded at 40.6°C, up from Tuesday’s 39.8°C and five notches above normal.According to the Indian meteorological department (IMD), in the plains, heatwave is declared if maximum temperature is more than 40°C and at least 4.5°C above normal, or if it crosses 45°C.Similar conditions are likely to continue in the city on Thursday, though some respite is expected thereon, with a forecast for light to moderate rain up to 30 mm on Friday and Saturday.“Due to hot northwesterly winds, the temperature has increased beyond normal. It is expected to remain like this on Thursday as well. Easterly winds that are needed for the monsoon system to become stronger are unlikely to start yet,” said IMD scientist Shivinder Singh.Even as the monsoon arrived in Chandigarh early on June 13 this year, there have been only two spells of rains since then. While 15.4 mm was recorded on June 16, localised conditions created by high temperatures had led to 4mm rain accompanied by high-speed winds on June 26. According to the IMD, the monsoon is on a “break spell” and is not likely to cover the region in the next six to seven days. Meanwhile, maximum temperature is expected to remain around 37-40°C while minimum will be around 29°C in the next three days in Chandigarh.Power demand peaks in cityWith the mercury soaring, Wednesday also recorded the highest peak power demand in Chandigarh this year.It led to power outages in southern parts of the city, as the supply remained erratic. Even residents in the neighbouring Mohali district had to bear with long power cuts during the day.The peak power demand in Chandigarh on Wednesday was 383 MW, equal to the peak demand registered last year.In 2019, the city had broken all previous records of power consumption with peak demand touching 431 MW. On June 30 that year, it had stood at 415 MW.“Last year, the demand didn’t go very high even during the summer because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown restrictions. However, with subdued monsoon and consistently high temperatures, we are expecting the power demand to increase further, though it may not break the 2019 record,” said an electricity department official. Sectors 40 and 47 were majorly affected as the electricity department undertook repair works and replaced major transmission line equipment, said the official. Even Sector 49 reported erratic power supply throughout the night.“In some areas, there were temporary outages because of the high power demand, but the supply was restored after short intervals,” said the official.In Mohali, an emergency unscheduled cut at the Patiala grid led to disruption in power supply at 2pm. Though deputy chief engineer Mohit Sood said power was restored by 5:15pm, some areas remained without electricity till 7pm.A PSPCL official said that against an average demand for 420 MW per day, Mohali has 560 MW power available. “Sometimes, faults develop due to overload, which snap the grids causing major power failures. Otherwise, we have surplus power and there are no scheduled cuts in Mohali,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/heatwave-sweeps-chandigarh-power-cuts-add-to-woes-101625079922743.html

They will also have to take a commercial power connection for the shops. The rest of the house will be charged as per domestic rate. The UT administration has approved a municipal corporation draft notification, that proposed amendments in the Chandigarh Water Supply Bylaws.Residents of these localities have been for long demanding that commercial rates not be imposed on the entire house, if a shop was being run from part of it.“It will also help the MC in improving compliance as more people are expected to come forward to avail commercial connection,” said an MC official.In another amendment, the water bill now not be allowed to be used as a proof of ownership. The notification states, “The water connection (regular, temporary and provisional) in the erstwhile villages, colonies and Manimajra is basic amenity of the general public. However, water bill cannot be used as a proof of ownership of house in any litigation or in court case related that premises.” In some cases, it has come to light that residents were using the water connection as ownership proof, even if they legally didn’t own the land or property wherein the house/shop was constructed on.In March, the MC had notified draft amendments after giving 15 days to general public and stakeholders to make any objections or suggestions to the draft amendments. After the 15 days, the MC had sent the draft amendments to the administration for its approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhadmn-approves-amendments-in-water-bylaws-101625079624351.html

Senate polls have been pending since August last year amid the pandemic.This interim arrangement comes as a relief to hundreds of research scholars, who had been awaiting approvals. The regulation 14 of PU calendar volume-I states that whenever there is urgency, the vice-chancellor may take such action as he deems necessary, and report the matter at the next meeting of the syndicate for approval.However, an ex-senator said that as per regulations, these powers lie only with deans, and even the syndicate cannot use them.Meanwhile, PUTA president, Mritunjay Kumar said, “It is strange that PUTA was not informed about such an important decision. While we understand that it will provide much needed respite to research scholars whose files have been pending for long, we hope that it is only an interim measure, since all academic and research bodies/offices are being bypassed.” “We request the V-C to hold the elections of various bodies including senate and syndicate, amid declining Covid cases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-now-v-c-to-take-final-call-on-academic-research-matters-101625079623146.html

Nearly 80 of those marked absent are members of the sanitation staff.The employee salaries were withheld earlier too, on account of not wearing the watches, but the dues were released with a warning for the future. The sanitation committee, however, has asked the MC officials to give them another chance, adding that if there were any technical problems with the watches, these should be fixed. In case the employees are unable to use the watches properly, they should be taught the best ways to do so, they have added.Employees have complained of glitches in the watches, particularly in showing the correct location. Failure to recharge the watches is another issue raised by the employees.The linking of attendance with the live location of staffers, as shown on the GPS-enabled watches, has been a controversial issue for the civic body. While the councillors have favoured a more lenient stance, the MC officials, including MC commissioner KK Yadav, have insisted on mandatory use of the watches to improve employee efficiency.After nearly a year of disuse, the MC in April this year had finally decided that the attendance marked through the watches will be linked with staff salaries from May onwards. But now with the sanitation committee again pushing for release of salaries to employees who couldn’t be traced through the watches, the old dispute is likely to be raised again.The MC spends more than ₹2 crore annually as rent for the watches, which are used to track more than 4,000 employees to deal with complaints of non-present staff. “We will ensure that the salaries are disbursed on the basis of the live locations of the wrist watches. This was the decision of the MC General House and we will implement it in toto unless suggested otherwise by the House,” said an MC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-panel-wants-relief-for-staff-marked-absent-by-gps-watches-101625079562756.html

This is the first time since the incident that the gurdwara management body has decided to observe its anniversary. On July 4, 1955, police had entered the shrine to deal with the supporters of the Punjabi Suba Morcha, injuring a number of Sikhs.“It was the first raid on the shrine since the Mughals. We are organising a Sri Akhand Paath Sahib (non-stop recitation of the Guru Granth Sahib) at the Manji Sahib Diwan Hall on July 2 to recount its history. The Bhog will be on July 4,” SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur told a press conference. The SGPC will also display relics of the entry, including four tear-gas bombs that the police had used. Kaur added, “During the intervening night of July 3 and 4, about 3am, the then Amritsar Range DIG Ashwani Kumar, under instruction from the then chief minister Bhim Sen Sachar, entered the shrine to crush the movement. Bullets hit the Golden Temple and the Akal Takht.”She alleged that the Congress has always been unjust with the Sikhs, who sacrificed the most for the freedom of the country. “The central Sikh shrine, Sachkhand Sri Harmandar Sahib, was attacked just seven years after independence. The intention of the Congress, which committed the genocide of Sikhs in 1984, were anti-Sikh from the very beginning,” she claimed. In 2020, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannu had raised the issue of marking the anniversary. He had written a letter to Akal Takh acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh to seek encouragement before opening a voter registration process in the state for a referendum on Punjab’s independence on July 4. His request, however, was never considered. Pannu was designated as a terrorist after he launched a ‘Voter Registration’ bid via a number of websites in July 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-a-first-sgpc-to-observe-anniversary-of-1955-police-entry-in-golden-temple-101625079382847.html

01-07-2021||Mumbai||Maha BJP writes to Amit Shah for CBI probe against Ajit Pawar and Anil Parab||Bharatiya Janata Party’s state unit has written a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah demanding a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe against deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and transport minister Anil Parab for extortion and corruption allegations levelled by former police officer Sachin Vaze. The letter written by state unit chief Chandrakant Patil has stated that the law and order in the state has collapsed because of the “obvious reason of political revenge and blatant misuse of the political power”. The letter, written a week after the BJP’s state unit passed a resolution in its executive committee meeting with the demand to the Centre for action against the two ministers, has urged to initiate necessary legal action to protect the interest of law abiding citizens. “In a handwritten letter submitted to designated NIA court, Sachin Vaze on April 3rd has alleged that Ajit Pawar through one Darshan Ghodawat asked him to collect ₹100 crore from illegal gutkha sellers and manufacturers. Vaze has also said that Ghodawat induced him to collect ₹100 cror illegally. He has also said that Parab asked him to collect a sum from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation contractors by threatening them against anonymous complaints. Parab also asked Vaze to collect ₹2 crore from about 50 sub-contractors. He also asked Vaze to initiate an inquiry against Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust and collect ₹50 crore from it,” the letter has stated. Vaze, who is a prime accused in Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran death case, was arrested by National Investigation Agency in March this year. He was later terminated from the Mumbai police force where he served as assistant police inspector. The letter states that the Bombay High Court has directed CBI to conduct a probe against former home minister Anil Deshmukh for similar allegations by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. “In the light of the specific allegations by Vaze against Pawar and Parab, a detailed inquiry must be conducted by CBI against the ministers and Ghodawat. The allegations are made before a judicial officer and as such it is just and necessary to conduct a detailed inquiry by the CBI and statements of the persons concerned be recorded. If the disclosure Vaze is not dealt with in accordance with the law, the law abiding people will lose faith in the legal system,” it further reads. The Congress and Nationalist Congress Party that are part of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi ruling state government have reacted sharply to the demand. “The BJP demands for the probe, it decides over it, its ruling government arrests people and even punishment is proclaimed by them…this is the mockery of democracy. BJP should understand that the West Bengal model would not work in Maharashtra. All the three ruling parties are together and would not bow before such tactics,” said minority affairs minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said. Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “Generally, the CBI inquiry is initiated by state governments or high courts. However, the BJP has now exhibited the fact as under whose guidance and orders CBI acts. We are thankful to the BJP for it. This is the reason why Maharashtra and few other states have withdrawn the standing permission for the CBI probe in state matters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-bjp-writes-to-amit-shah-for-cbi-probe-against-ajit-pawar-and-anil-parab-101625078663145.html

Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday kick-started the process of inviting applications from eligible beneficiaries by launching a web portal - www.ulb.shops.ulbharyana.gov.in.As per the Mukhyamantri Shehri Nikay Svamitva Yojana, the tenant will have to pay less than the present collector rate to get the ownership rights. A 20% rebate on the current collector rate will be given to tenants who have been residing in the house or are running a shop for the past 20 years. Similarly, those who have an occupancy period of 50 years will get a rebate of up to 50%.During a press briefing, the CM said while the urban local bodies department has data of 16,000 possible beneficiaries, the number is likely to increase. “Hence a weekly plan for staggering the applications has been made with maximum 1,000 applicants allowed to enrol every week on the portal,” Khattar said.Once the applications are in, the department will invite objections within a month. And once all objections are resolved, the applicants will be asked to submit papers.“The applicants will be able to see details of their applications on the individual dashboard designed for them. This will eradicate the manual registration process,” Khattar said.As per this scheme, if someone has constructed more than the floor or area of the allotted building, then he will have to deposit an additional amount that is ₹1,000 as per the additional constructed area.If the applicant is not allottee as per rules of the municipality but fulfils all eligibility criteria of the policy, then he will have to pay a lump sum regular fee of ₹30,000 in addition to the amount and tax to be paid as mentioned in the policy.As per this policy, if anyone has taken shop or house on the municipal land either on rent, lease basis or by paying a license fee for 20 years or more, then all such occupiers will be given ownership right under this policy.As per the policy, the occupier should have completed 20 years as of December 31, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/process-to-give-ownership-rights-for-tenants-in-urban-areas-of-haryana-begins-101625078604205.html

01-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Assembly elections on July 6||The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi has finally decided to hold the elections for the post of Speaker of the state Assembly, which is lying vacant following resignation of Nana Patole as he was appointed the state Congress chief, on July 6, the second day of monsoon session. The decision was taken by the MVA following a meeting between chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and a meeting of coordination committee of leaders from three parties on Tuesday. Congress MLAs Sangram Thopate, Suresh Warpudkar and Amin Patel are the frontrunners. Patole had resigned as the speaker of the lower house in the first week of February, a day ahead of his appointment as the Maharashtra Congress president. The election to the post could not take place during the two-week budget session as many ruling party MLAs were infected with Covid-19 and also because two ruling parties, barring Congress, were not very keen on it. The Congress was pushing for the election, but allies Shiv Sena and NCP were not keen because they did not want show of strength in the Assembly at a time when the situation was satisfactory and the government is occupied with the pandemic, according to MVA insiders. However, following a closed-door meeting between Thackeray and Pawar, the ruling coalition seems to have made up its mind. The state is writing to Koshyari for approval to hold the election. The Congress and Sena have issued whips to their MLAs to remain present on both the days of the session.Thackeray held a meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar over various issues including the speaker’s election on Wednesday. The leaders reportedly discussed the reply to be sent to Governor’s letter in which he had reminded the government about holding the election. Congress leader and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said the letter will soon be sent to the Raj Bhavan. According to the NCP and Shiv Sena leaders, the issue was discussed during Thackeray-Pawar meeting. Both the parties are reportedly annoyed over the way the Congress appointed Patole without fairly discussing it with them. The top leaders felt the election to the post could put the MVA government in an embarrassing position if its numbers dwindled on the floor of the house. Pawar had expressed his unhappiness over Patole’s resignation in February. Thackeray, too, did not want election at this juncture as the state is grappling with Covid epidemic. “Thackeray wanted to drag the issue for some more time, but agreed after the NCP chief intervened and convinced him for the polls,” said a NCP leader. “The two leaders also felt that a show of strength could be used to political advantage to show the government is stable and all its MLAs are with it,” he added. The decision on holding the election has to be taken by the state government with the approval from the Governor. “The government informs the governor about its resolve of holding the election for the speaker’s post after which the deputy speaker announces the programme for the election once the government informs him,” said Narhari Zirwal, deputy speaker of the Assembly. Koshyari wrote to Thackeray last week asking him to take a call on election to the post of speaker, extending the monsoon session and postponement of the local body election in the wake of pending decision over OBC reservation. “The three issues are of utmost importance and have been brought to my notice by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis who led a delegation of party leaders to Raj Bhavan on June 23. Take the decision on these issues and inform me accordingly,” he said in the letter dated June 24. The BJP delegation had also demanded extension of the monsoon session which is scheduled to be held for just two days. It also demanded that the polls to the local bodies be postponed in the light of the scrapping of the OBC reservation. This is not the first time the governor insisted on the elections. Ahead of the budget session of the state legislature in March, Koshyari had directed the legislature secretariat to conduct elections in the first week of the budget session. Nawab Malik said, “Whips are issued by the ruling parties every time there are finance bills are supposed to be tabled. We want to hold the election for the post of speaker, but a review of the attendance of the ruling MLAs will be taken on the first day of the session. Amid the pandemic many ruling MLAs are expected to remain absent if they are infected of the virus. The decision over the election will be taken keeping this factor in the mind.” Malik also said the governor should also take a call on the proposal of the appointment of 12 members to the legislative Council from governor’s quota. “Our leadership conveyed to Thackeray that we are very serious about holding the election in monsoon session. A detailed discussion was held during review meetings by All India Congress Committee incharge for state HK Patil recently,” said a senior Congress leader. Malik said the NCP has no objection to hold the elections this session and they will win the election, if it happens, with more numbers than polled during confidence vote in November 2019. Meanwhile, Congress has finalised the name of Sangram Thopate for the post. “We have only two MLAs in Pune district which has 21 seats. Pune has been our stronghold once upon a time and with both the municipal corporations in the district going to polls early next year, we need to give it a fair representation. His name has already been cleared by the party high command. Official announcement will be done on first day of the session,” said the leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-assembly-elections-on-july-6-101625078482109.html
01-07-2021||Mumbai||Stop political rallies during Covid-19 pandemic: Bombay HC to State||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday asked the state government to immediately stop political rallies being taken out during the Covid-19 pandemic and warned of strict action if political rallies continued to be held in the state in defiance of Covid protocols. The court took note of news reports of the recently organised rallies over naming of Navi Mumbai airport and Maratha and Other Backward Castes (OBC) reservations, and observed that it was not the time to hold rallies. The court said the state should activate its machinery to curb such rallies and added that it would not allow such rallies to be held during the pandemic. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by social activist Nilesh Navlakha seeking directions pertaining to shortage of anti-Covid drugs and alleged black-marketing and profiteering taking place during procurement and distribution of the drugs. During the course of hearing the PIL, petitioners counsel advocate Rajesh Inamdar informed the bench about rallies being held in complete defiance of Covid protocols. Inamdar referred to news reports which highlighted the recent political rallies and protests organised in the state pertaining to OBC quota in civic bodies and said that it was an open invitation for the spread of Covid. In view of this, he urged the court to intervene to stop it.After hearing the submission, the bench addressed advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for state and said, “You will have to start activating machinery to stop political rallies defying Covid protocols. We will not allow this to happen. We are shutting down courts for physical hearings and these political leaders are organising rallies with thousands of persons. The last rally was on the issue of naming of airport with over 25,000 people present. Can it not wait for Covid-19 to get over?” The protest rally demanding for naming of Navi Mumbai Airport after late socialist leader DB Patil was held two days ago, even before the completion of the first phase of the airport. While referring to the protest for Maratha reservation, the bench questioned as to why political leaders were not informing the electorate that the state government was not the authority to decide on the issue and that a review petition was filed in the Supreme Court. The bench then noted, “Everyone is trying to take mileage. Why? Let it wait for some time. Are vaccination camps less important? We should all take lessons from the second wave and be prepared for the third wave. We all invited it and saw what happened. We should avoid it.” Earlier last month, a division bench headed by justice Ravindra Ghuge at Aurangabad had also made similar observations and restrained politicians and ministers from conducting physical ceremonies and functions, including inaugurating projects and religious, social, cultural or political functions of any kind, until lockdown restrictions were eased by the state. The bench had suggested that such events and functions could be organised virtually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/stop-political-rallies-during-covid-19-pandemic-bombay-hc-to-state-101625078424340.html
01-07-2021||Mumbai||Want of vax doses forces shut Maharashtra centres, again||Many vaccination centres in Maharashtra were shut down on Wednesday owing to the shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses, pulling down the improving inoculation rate. The shortage has forced the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to suspend its drive today. After inoculating a whopping 3,222,031 people between June 21 and 26, the first six days of the national vaccination drive, the inoculation rate in the state dropped significantly in the past four days, owing to the short supply of the vaccine. A total of 1,381,907 citizens were inoculated in the state from June 27 to 30. Many centres in Kalyan-Dombivli, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Ratangiri were shut for want of doses. The shortfall is expected to continue even on Thursday as the state has about 400,000 doses left for inoculation. A total of 253,772 people were inoculated on Wednesday.The BMC on Wednesday announced that it will not conduct vaccination on Thursday i.e. July 1, 2021. Although the supply has been better in June compared to May, there is not sufficient stock to continue vaccination, said BMC in a statement. The BMC in the statement added that citizens will be updated about the vaccination drive from time to time.The state government is expecting an additional stock of 900,000 doses from the Centre on Thursday. “We have received 200,000 doses today, and with earlier doses remaining after today’s inoculation, we expect the vaccination of about 400,000 people tomorrow. The fresh stock expected to be received tomorrow will take a day for distribution and will be available for inoculation from Friday,” said Dr Archana Patil, director health services.Dr Patil said some of the vaccination centres could not be operated owing to shortage of doses. “We distribute the available stock of vaccine to the districts to last for three days. If some of them use more on the first day itself, they may fall short of stock on the third day. In such cases, the centres do not operate. Our capacity is of inoculation of more than 1 million doses per day through over 15,000 centres, but actual vaccination depends on availability,” she said.Another officer from the health department said that although the Centre has given the allocation plan for the next few weeks, the schedule is not maintained, leading to shortage of doses. “This has resulted in drastic drop in inoculation rate after vaccinating more than 600,000 people a day over the past few days. The daily average dropped significantly this week. The irregular supply of vaccines by the Centre makes it difficult for us to plan the inoculation at steady rate,” the officer said.Health minister Rajesh Tope said on Tuesday that the state government wants to inoculate its 70% population at the earliest to lessen the impact of a probable third wave. He said that the state has the capacity of inoculation of 1 million people daily. Till Wednesday evening, Maharashtra had administered 32,436,460 doses to 26,065,108 people.After the central government rolled out a new phase of the national vaccination programme on June 21, Maharashtra inoculated a record 738,704 people on June 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/want-of-vax-doses-forces-shut-maharashtra-centres-again-101625078423737.html

01-07-2021||Mumbai||New species of snail in Western Ghats belongs to entirely new genus: Researchers||Researchers have identified a new genus and species of land mollusc in the northern Western Ghats, from Amboli village in Sindhudurg district. The new genus, Varadia, has been named after herpetologist Dr Varad Giri, while the species has been christened as Varadia amboliensis, in reference to the location where it was first discovered in 2017. The findings were published on Tuesday in the European Journal of Taxonomy after five years of research. “Though we had initially misidentified the species, we undertook studies to compare its morphology, phylogenetic analysis and reproductive systems with other closely related specimens. DNA studies strongly suggested that Varadia amboliensis has not been previously described and that it belongs to an entirely new genus. The new genus is named after Dr Giri, whose contribution towards the study of Indian herpetofauna involves describing 56 new species and four new genera,” said first author Amrut Bhosale.The newly described species is a semi slug belonging to the eupulmonate molluscan group Stylommatophora. Semislugs are so-called because their shells are relatively small in comparison to the body, with the shell often partly or almost entirely covered by extensions of the snail’s ‘skin’, or mantle. Varadia ambolienesis, in particular, is a large semislug and adults can measure up to 7cm in length. It can be told apart from other Indian semislugs largely based on external appearance, the morphology of its shell, and its unique reproductive system.The newly described species is endemic to the Northern and Central Western Ghats, where it is primarily found in natural forests. It has so far been seen only in a handful of localities in Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka, and can be found on the forest floor, among leaf litter, or on trees. “The discovery of this large and striking snail emphasizes the urgent need for detailed and geographically wide-ranging surveys of the snails and slugs of the Western Ghats. This group, which has long been neglected, is at a high risk of extinction due to habitat loss and degradation,” the researchers said in a statement on Wednesday.The Varadia amboliensis is among 21 new species that have been discovered in Amboli since 2005, including snakes, amphibians, crabs, spiders and scorpions. Amboli village is home to Shistura Hiranyakeshi biodiversity heritage site and falls under the Amboli-Dodamarg Conservation Reserve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-species-of-snail-in-western-ghats-belongs-to-entirely-new-genus-researchers-101625078302867.html

For this, the BMC had plans to procure over 10 million vaccine doses from the international market. But as the Central government has announced to give vaccinations to all above 18 years of age for free, the BMC scrapped the plan. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, said, “We are vaccinating citizens based on the supply we are getting from the government. As of now, our plan to procure vaccines from the international market is not on the cards. It is all being administered on the free supply we are getting.”On Wednesday alone, 63,579 citizens were vaccinated, taking the total to 5,435,731.

While corporators across party lines opposed the administration’s proposal, Leader of the House, Vishakha Raut moved an adjournment motion opposing the circular issued by Mumbai Fire Brigade under which they have planned to recover fire service fee and annual fee from March 2014 in a retrospective manner.The BMC general body in 2014 passed the proposal to charge a fire service fee. Recently, the fire brigade issued a circular to implement levying of the fee retrospectively. Leader of the Opposition, Ravi Raja questioned, “Why did the fire brigade fail to implement levying the fee since 2014? Why has the proposal been brought now?”Among other proposals tabled before the standing committee on Wednesday, the administration also proposed to deduct 10% from the pension of a retired officer for a period of five years. The officer was found guilty in an internal enquiry regarding the Jogeshwari plot scam in 2018. Since the committee meeting was adjourned, no decision was taken in this regard, leader of the opposition Ravi Raja said. At the time of the internal enquiry, the officer was deputy chief engineer of the development plan (DP) department.“With allegations made against Bhaskar Choudhary, deputy chief engineer, DP during a departmental inquiry having proved to be true the standing committee’s permission has been sought for deducting 10% from his pension for five years,” the proposal said.The Jogeshwari plot, reserved for recreation space and hospital, was pegged at a market value of ₹500 crore. On the file regarding the acquisition of the plot, the then municipal commissioner Ajoy’s Mehta’s remarks were tampered with, leading the BMC to not challenge the acquisition of the plot in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-panel-stays-fire-service-fee-on-builders-societies-101625078242086.html

Since there is a movement of people from one part of the state to another, there is a danger of spreading the virus, if it is not controlled,” warned Salunkhe.Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild said people are not adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour. “People are now fatigued due to lockdown, hence we are seeing more socialising among the people.

01-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai rat-bite case: BMC trying to shield agency, alleges AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Mumbai unit has alleged that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) tried to shield a private agency that was in charge of running the intensive care unit (ICU) at civic-run Rajawadi Hospital, where an incident of a rat biting a 24-year-old patient was reported 10 days ago.AAP’s Mumbai unit has alleged that the agency responsible for operating the ICU is owned by the daughter of a former BMC officer who is also a civic employee as of date.AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon said, “We demanded action against the agency, but were surprised when both the dean and mayor, quickly absolved them of all blame and laid it on “administration”. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar and dean of Rajawadi Hospital Dr Vidya Thakur are deliberately trying to shield the agency.”The AAP alleged that in the case of Rajawadi Hospital, the agency that provides intensivists for the 21 ICU beds, belongs to the daughter of a retired medical superintendent. The AAP further alleged that the daughter is also an employee of the BMC. However, the BMC has not commented on the issue.Menon added, “During the pandemic, another 10 beds were added, and the same agency was given the contract, without a new tender and at a new inflated rate of ₹3,800 per bed, per day. Healthcare is one of the BMC’s primary responsibilities, and the civic administration cannot abdicate it by any means whatsoever.”However, the BMC in a statement has denied all allegations and said that none of the BMC employees have been given the contract. The BMC in a statement said, “Due process of tendering has been followed in awarding the contract for operations of ICU beds. The BMC administration has taken serious note of this matter and immediately constituted a three-member committee and the proceedings in this regard are now in the final stage. Action will be taken against the concerned as per the recommendations made by this committee.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-rat-bite-case-bmc-trying-to-shield-agency-alleges-aap-101625078122136.html
01-07-2021||Mumbai||JNPT expansion: NGT forms panel to study plaints of CRZ violation||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has constituted a four-member committee to examine complaints of Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) violations during the expansion of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust’s (JNPT) Container Terminal-4 in Uran. The committee has been tasked with submitting “an independent factual report” within three months of the NGT order, dated June 23. NGT was hearing a complaint filed by Uran fisherman Dilip Pandurang Koli and others, against the Union government, challenging the manner in which environmental clearance was granted (in October 2019) to JNPT for the expansion works. The four-member committee comprises representatives from the environment ministry, Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board, Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA), and the Raigad district magistrate.The appellants have argued that the fragile ecology of the area has been subject to an onslaught of environmentally destructive activities by JNPT over the past several years. They have also challenged the joint CRZ, and environmental clearance granted to JNPT by MoEFCC, on grounds that it was done based on a factually incorrect claim that the CRZ area comprised of the project site is CRZ-4, though it falls within CRZ-IA, where no fresh construction activities are permitted as per the CRZ Notification, 2011.The appellant said the mandatory stage of public consultation under the EIA Notification, 2006 has been foregone without any valid basis and that JNPT has violated the conditions of previous environmental clearances, which mandate the protection of mangroves and mudflats. The compliance report submitted to the state government by JNPT in the matter was found to be at odds with the terms of past ECs granted to the project. These discrepancies were not discussed at the MCZMA meeting before issuing the CRZ clearance in July 2019.As part of legal proceedings, NGT has observed that the expansion area identified is ecologically sensitive and does indeed fall under CRZ-1A as per the coastal zone map. No construction is permitted in CRZ–1A notified areas. “The reclamation that is proposed to be carried out for the balance work of the fourth container terminal will seriously impact fishing activities being carried out by traditional fisherfolk that have a large presence in the area,” said Koli.“The expansion of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port over the years has seen wetlands destroyed, mangroves razed, and rich fishing grounds destroyed. Deepening and widening of the navigational channel, dredging, blocking the tidal flow of water in the course of the expansion of the Port has caused considerable damage to the natural ecosystem,” Koli added.“Given the contention that the area where expansion activities are to be undertaken is in CRZ-1A, where constructions are prohibited and that violations of EC conditions have been found... there is a substantial question of the environment relating to the enforcement of CRZ Regulations. Response of the concerned statutory authorities and ascertainment of ground factual situation is required,” NGT observed in its order. The matter is set to be heard next on October 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jnpt-expansion-ngt-forms-panel-to-study-plaints-of-crz-violation-101625078062701.html
