31-07-2021||Delhi||July ends with record rain, August likely to be surplus too||New Delhi: Starting off as an unusually hot month, July ended up with 507mm of rain -- twice the city’s average of 210.6mm for the month, making it the wettest in the past 18 years, another weather extreme that was characteristic of the patterns being observed in the capital since August 2020. The city has been breaking a weather record every month since August 2020. For instance, this February was the second warmest in 120 years, with the mean maximum temperature in the month touching 27.9 degrees Celsius (°C), falling marginally short of the all-time record of 29.7°C in 2006.Then March this year recorded the hottest day in 76 years, with the mercury levels touching 40.1°C on March 29. But then, after a sweltering February and March, the conditions changed again in April and the lowest minimum temperature in at least a decade was recorded on April 4, at 11.7°C.July 2021 has kept with the record-breaking pattern: it started off with an unusually hot day when the maximum temperature spiked to 43°C. Over the next eight days, there were four heatwave days – a frequency not seen since 2014. Around this time, the monsoon should have arrived – but it would not till nearly the middle of the month on July 13, which was the latest onset since 2013. And in a span of three weeks, the monsoon has now dumped more rain this month than it did in any year since 2003.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department (IMD) regional weather forecasting centre, said Delhi has received “excess” rainfall this July, adding that more rain is expected over the next couple of days. “More showers are expected over the next couple of days. Given that the month of August, when the city receives its maximum rainfall, is beginning, we may have a slightly above normal monsoon this year. However, we have to watch out for how much it rains in September. Even last year, August received very good rainfall but September went almost dry, making it slightly below normal monsoon,” he said.Besides registering a record for the month, the rain over the city was erratic and inconsistent in its geographical pattern. The rain spells have also been short and intense, instead of being uniformly spread over the month, with some areas getting heavy rain on days when others got trace or no rain. Though Safdarjung station recorded 507.1mm rain, Aya Nagar weather station received 295.7 mm rainfall. This phenomenon can also be seen in the rain data of July 30, when Safdarjung observatory received 41.6 mm rain between 2.30pm and 5.30pm, but barely two kilometres away, at the Lodi Road station, showers were more intense (62mm). Similarly, on July 29, when rains lashed Safdarjung (72mm) and Lodi Road (73.4mm), areas around southwest Delhi’s Palam observatory were almost dry. RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the IMD, explained, “Rainfall does vary within a few kilometres. On Friday, around the Lodi Road area clouds suddenly built up from the east, and there were already favourable weather systems. Local land use and land cover also impact weather activities in an area.” Private weather forecasters also said that a change in monsoon patterns, which is being observed over the region over the last few years, was more prominent this season. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said the change in pattern is being observed because over the last few years most of the rain received in this region was through convective clouds, which cause short, more intense rain spells that cover a smaller area. “Convective clouds, unlike sheet clouds (altostratus clouds), cover a smaller area. So, there are chances that one area might receive intense rainfall and another, just within its 8-10km radius would be completely dry. Earlier, the clouds used to cover 300-400km radius of area and the showers would also be more uniform and continue till days,” Palawat said. This can be seen from the fact that the rain recording of 507.1mm at Safdarjung in July was a result of just nine days of rain in Delhi. Till 2001, Delhi used to record an average of 15-20 days of rains in July. Forecasters also said that August is likely to be an “above average” monsoon month for Delhi. “Looking at the forecast, it does seem like August will also record a surplus for Delhi. The coming few days are also favourable for moderate to heavy rains in Delhi and NCR,” Palawat added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/july-ends-with-record-rain-august-likely-to-be-surplus-too-101627754658632.html

The assailants fired around a dozen bullets of which at least eight hit the victim, police said, adding that they suspect it to be a fallout of a gang war between two jailed gangsters Jitender alias Gogi and Sunil Tajpuriya aka Tillu.The victim, Nitesh, was the brother of a jailed criminal, Pravesh, who reportedly belongs to Gogi’s gang, senior police officers associated with the probe said.Police said Nitesh suffered bullets in his chest, back and abdomen, after which he fell off the bike and died on the spot at around 11 am on Saturday. The attackers fled on their bike.“Prime facie, it appears that the attackers were waiting for Nitesh. They chased Nitesh’s bike and shot him dead from a close range. Some locals rushed and informed Nitesh’s family members about the firing.

In addition, the mass-scale vaccination has also helped,” said Dr Salunkhe. However, he warned against adopting a casual outlook in light of the findings. “The authorities need to strictly monitor the situation regularly and ensure that all the rules are followed,” Dr Salunkhe added.Dr Ameet Mandot, director, Gut Clinic, said “Citizens need to strictly adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks, maintaining social distance and participating in mass gatherings,” said Dr Mandot. “This will ensure further decline in the cases and will eventually result in more easing of curbs,” he added.The total number of Covid-19 patients in the state, has now reached 6,303,715.

However, 18,35,903 doses have been given by July 31. Among the people vaccinated, 10,59,753 have received the first dose and 7,76,150 have received the second dose.Singh said as people from other districts are coming to Bhubaneswar, they may have taken the vaccine that was meant for people living within the BMC area. He, however, said Bhubaneswar citizens have been given priority.When vaccination started in Odisha, Bhubaneswar was the only place where Covaxin was given. As the gap between two doses was 4 weeks compared to 12 weeks of Covishield, it helped quicker vaccination of people in the BMC area. The municipal body speeded up the vaccination by arranging drive-in facilities at parking areas of malls where people in their two-wheelers and cars could drive in and get jabbed. The BMC also organised doorstep vaccination in various apartments and private companies. It also started the vaccination of beggars and the poor.Singh said from Monday, people who are waiting to get their second dose of the jab can visit any vaccination centre near their home and get jabbed without booking a slot on the CoWin app.Despite record vaccination in Bhubaneswar, the city still continues to report more than 350 cases daily which officials said is happening as people are not adhering to Covid appropriate behaviour. Besides, many cases are being reported among those less than 18 years who are yet to be vaccinated. On Saturday, the city reported 354 new cases of Covid-19 with the test positivity rate (TPR) climbing to 5.48%. Meanwhile, the state government on Saturday announced that weekend shutdowns will continue in Cuttack, Bhubaneswar and Puri from August 1 as the cases continued to remain high there. However, the rest of the state would see no weekend shutdown from August 1. Street food vendors shall be allowed to operate with on-spot eating in compliance with Covid-19 safety protocols. Daily and weekly haats shall remain open with strict adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour. Inter-state and intra-state public transport by buses shall remain functional with seating capacity only.All educational institutions, including coaching centres, would function as per the guidelines issued by respective departments. Indoor amusement centres, entertainment parks, amusement parks, theme parks, water parks, museums, tourist places, zoos and archaeological monuments would remain open observing Covid-19 safety protocols.Government and private swimming pools would remain open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bhubaneswar-achieves-target-of-18-lakh-doses-of-vaccination-tpr-still-above-5-101627752378984.html
31-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai gets 37% more rain in July this year||With Mumbai recording a total of 1,125.9mm rain in the past month alone, this July marks the fourth consecutive year in which monthly rains have crossed the 1000mm mark, as opposed to the monthly normal of 827mm, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD). This year, July rainfall in the city was 37% in excess of the monthly normal or long-period average, as per data from the IMD’s monitoring station in Santacruz, representative of the city and suburbs. Though the intensity of rains began to subside after July 21, the previous week saw the city grapple with two consecutive, atypical thunderstorms which dumped more than 500mm rain over the city. A convective thunderstorm, described by meteorologists as “monstrous”, deposited a whopping 235mm rain between 12am and 4am on July 18, less than 48 hours after a similar high rainfall event resulted in the season’s highest daily rainfall on July 16 at 253mm.During the week starting July 15, the city received 689.9mm rain, which is 251% in excess of the weekly normal amount for the same period (196.7mm). In July, Mumbai also crossed the 2,000-mm rainfall mark for the entire monsoon season from June to September, with receiving 2,087.2mm rain since June 1. This is 94.6% of the monsoon long-period average of 2,205mm rain as per IMD. Of this, 961.4mm was recorded in June, which is also more than the monthly normal of 505mm.As the monsoon enters its third month, Mumbai is likely to see a drier start to August due to lack of typical synoptic features which drive precipitation over the city, such as a vigorous offshore trough and low-pressure systems over the Bay of Bengal. An official with IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai said, “There is a possibility of monsoon revival between August 5 and 7, but the next spate of heavy downpours is at least another 10 to 12 days away.” With the monsoon oscillation moving northward, a break phase in the monsoon is expected next week not only in Mumbai but across the state as well as other parts of western and central India, the IMD’s long-range forecast indicates.Mumbai has been placed under a green alert by IMD till at least August 5. Temperatures are expected to hover at a maximum of 31 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 26 degrees Celsius for at least the next week. Remaining coastal districts in Maharashtra which were recently battered by heavy rains leading to flooding are also expected to see light to moderate rain with isolated heavy showers during the first week of August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-gets-37-more-rain-in-july-this-year-101627751237338.html

He was speaking at the launching of the report ‘Turning the Tide: Is Mumbai Ready for the Next Wave?’ by Mumbai-based Observer Research Foundation (ORF), via video conferencing on Saturday afternoon. The report captures lessons and learning from Mumbai’s experience with dealing with two waves during the Covid-19 pandemic and examines its preparedness to handle the projected third wave and the city-wise vaccination drive. Regarding easing of the present restrictions in Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra, Thackeray said, “We are being painfully slow, because at least as per our reading, it is here that the Delta strain originated. Maharashtra has been honest and transparent with reporting its [Covid] numbers. The real success lies in counting real numbers, identifying patients on time, getting them to the hospital, and then safely home.”Maharashtra has had success in dealing with the social response to the Covid-19 crisis as well, according to Thackeray. Speaking on the issue of migrant labour being displaced during the first wave of the pandemic, Thackeray said, “There is a larger policy issue at hand here, ...about housing, transit camps for the floating population in the form of migrant labour. But the social aspects of the pandemic, finding food, shelter, and psychological security for migrant labour are challenges we have addressed.”He also addressed the need to have a Covid-19 recovery master plan for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) region, and other crucial pockets of thriving commerce across the state, such as the Nagpur Metropolitan Region. “With the other aspect of when it comes to infrastructure development and amenities, we have to look at a unified approach at least city wise, if not MMR wise. One city one administration is a better approach,” Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-needs-to-prepare-for-3rd-covid-wave-after-relaxations-ease-says-aaditya-thackeray-101627749857298.html

Due to non-constitution of SMCs, development work has been affected in the schools. Despite provisions, not forming SMCs is a serious matter and the headmaster and his deputy are directly accountable for it. They have to ensure formation of SMCs,” says a letter from additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar to all DEOs on Thursday.Kumar has directed that all the SMCs be formed within a month and a certificate in this regard be obtained from the headmasters and submitted to the department. “Any lapse or delay in forming SMCs will invite action,” he wrote.The right to education (RTE) Act provides for SMCs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/govt-schools-must-form-management-committees-within-a-month-bihar-education-department-101627748776623.html

Considering the pandemic-triggered circumstances, the varsity has decided to do away with the entrance test as holding an exam for thousands of students would not be feasible.The last date for filling online admission form is August 20. PU officials said applicants will have to pay ₹1,100 for filling the admission form.Anil Kumar, dean of students’ welfare, said, “Details regarding online admission process in undergraduate (UG) courses will be uploaded on www.patnauniversity.ac.in on Sunday. Admission to UG courses will be done based on marks obtained by applicants in Class 12. The entrance exam has been eliminated only for the current session due to the Covid-19 pandemic.” “In a first, the varsity has resorted to the university management information system (UMIS) this year for facilitating centralised admission process at all constituent colleges. Candidates will get a chance to select multiple preferences for colleges and courses without paying additional charges. The new system is likely to expedite the admission and counselling process. We are hopeful to commence classes for the new academic session on time”, he said.Meanwhile, students aspiring to take admission in PU evoked mixed responses on scarping of entrance exam.Rahul Kumar, who is aspiring to pursue BSc, said, “The varsity should take out merit list for state board and CBSE students separately due to huge difference between exam and evaluation pattern of both boards. CBSE students have fetched high scores than state board students. In such circumstances, a handful of state board students will get admission in PU.” Deepak Singh, a CBSE Class 12 pass out, said, “Entrance exam gives fair and uniform opportunity to all students irrespective of their previous background. Mediocre students are likely to suffer as they might not get admission to reputed colleges. I have scored 70%. My chances of getting admission in PU is low if cut off marks remain high.”PWC reopens admission portal till August 10Patna Women’s College (PWC) has decided to re-open the admission portal for UG courses from Sunday to August 10.“Interested students can fill online admission forms for various vocational and conventional UG courses.

A political resolution to this effect was passed by the party at its national executive committee meeting in New Delhi on Saturday.Earlier in the morning, a meeting of party national office-bearers welcomed the Modi-government decision to provide 27% reservation to OBC and 10% to EWC in medical education.“JD (U) parliamentary party delegation has sought time from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hand over a memorandum demanding caste-based census in the country,” said JD(U) principal general secretary KC Tyagi.The party also passed a resolution to publish recommendations of Justice G Rohini Commission report so that the advantage of the reservation is extended as per the numbers. On Friday, the main opposition parties of Bihar led by the RJD had met chief minister Nitish Kumar and had demanded that the issue of caste census be raised before the PM. “Caste-wise enumeration is necessary as it would only help in identifying the backwardness in economically and socially weaker groups among backward classes and extend them the benefits of welfare schemes. We will press hard for it,” said Tyagi.On July 20, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai had told Parliament that the government had directed it as a policy matter not to enumerate caste-wise population other than SC/ STs.The JD (U) also passed a resolution concerning population control. “We support ways and means to control the population. But this cannot be done through acts or laws. It should not be forced. A concerted effort to create public awareness is required through the benefits, education, etc., to bring down the reproduction rate,” said Tyagi. Talking about the political decisions, Tyagi said that the party has decided to contest elections in all the states going to polls in near future. “We have talks with union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president J P Nadda for a respectable seat-sharing formula for UP polls. If the things did not work out in UP, the JD (U) will contest on at least 200 seats in UP,” said Tyagi. The party has also requested Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to take out time and tour other states as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jd-u-parliamentary-delegation-to-meet-pm-for-caste-based-census-101627748656584.html

31-07-2021||Mumbai||Heavy rainfall helps in substantial water stock in Maharashtra dams||The heavy rainfall for a week since July 22 across the state has helped in a significant rise in the water stock. The state reservoirs have the stock up to 51% of their collective capacity, against the stock of 41% last year on the day. This has resulted in sowing for the Kharif crops over 85% of the area under cultivation and the farmers are expecting good agricultural crops this season.The incessant rainfall across the state since July 22 has resulted in the state recording 125% of its average rainfall till July 31. Against the average of 538.5mm rainfall on this day, the state has recorded 674.2mm rains this monsoon. It was 522.3mm last year on the same day. At 145% (464mm) till today, drought-prone Central Maharashtra has received the highest rainfall until now, while it is 137% (2367mm against average 1726mm) in the Konkan division. Barring Nashik division, which covers north Maharashtra, all other divisions have received more than 100% of their average rainfall till July 31. Nashik has so far received 75% or 269mm against an average of 358mm.Of the 353 tehsils in the state, 273 have reported more than 100% rainfall, while only eight tehsils in Nandurbar, Dhule and Nashik have received rains between 25% and 50% of their average rainfall.This has also resulted in the rise in the water stock in the state reservoirs to 51% against the stock of 41% last year on the same day. “Though central Maharashtra has reported more than average rainfall in first two months of the monsoon, the water stock in the dams in the region have the accumulated stock of 35.04%, lowest among the other five divisions, against 39.5% last year on the same day,” said an official from the water resources department. He said that it was because not all the districts have received equal rainfall.The officer said that the water stock in 3,267 dams of all sizes, has increased significantly in the past 10 days. 20,440 million cubic meter (MCM) or 33.39% on July 21, it has increased to 27,935 MCM. The sowing average in the state stands at around 90%, with the area under cultivation of soybean and udid has increased.“We can expect good production and productivity this year in the wake of the satisfactory rainfall. In drought-prone central Maharashtra, the sowing in three districts (Aurangabad, Jalna and Beed) has crossed 98%, while in other districts too is excellent. Cash crops like cotton, soybean will do better this year. The area under cultivation for soybean has increased because of the procurement price of soybean mounting to ₹9,800 per quintal from ₹5000 last year. If any prolonged dry spell is not witnessed in near future, the production and productivity of crops will be much better this year,” said SB Varade, farm and irrigation expert.An official from the agriculture department of the state said that if the crops are not stressed due to the dry spells in the remaining period of monsoon, they can expect as satisfactory production as last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/heavy-rainfall-helps-in-substantial-water-stock-in-maharashtra-dams-101627745177089.html

The Rajasthan Police had declared ₹10,000 reward on her arrest. She has been arrested along with Kala Jatheri,”said Chandra.On Friday night, a special cell team arrested Jatheri and Anuradha from Saharanpur. Jatheri was wanted by Delhi Police and their counterparts in Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab, for his alleged role in several serious offences such as murder, extortion, and attempt to murder.Jatheri’s name surfaced in the GTB Hospital shoot out case of March 25 and during the investigation into wrestler Sagar Dhankad murder at Chhatrasal Stadium. Two-time Olympic medallist and world champion wrestler Sushil Kumar and his 12 associates have been arrested in the murder case. Jatheri is a relative of Sonu Mahal, who was also allegedly thrashed along with Dhankad by Kumar and his associates on May 4.Investigators said Kumar was earlier associated with Jatheri, but differences emerged between them following the Chhatrasal Stadium assault and murder.Born in 1984 in Sonepat, Jatheri escaped from the Haryana Police’s custody in Faridabad on February 1 last year. He is considered to be close to jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.Investigators said many incidents of firing at businessmen related to extortion were reported from different parts of the city after Jatheri’s escape. In most of the cases, the shooters threw paper slips after firing. The slips contained intimidating messages and the name of Kala Jatheri-Lawrence Bishnoi gang. This was seen as threats to businessmen who did not give into the gang’s extortion demands. According to police, Jatheri’s gang is the largest in terms of its members and network. The gang is believed to be spread across at least four states. Even as nearly two dozen close aides and hitmen of Jatheri, including Priyawart, have been arrested in the last one year, his gang is still the biggest and has support of many other gangsters such as Jitender alias Gogi, who is presently in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/most-wanted-gangster-in-delhi-arrested-101627713975403.html

31-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s districts of concern in Covid fight: The predictability of pandemic, an expert writes||I am a respiratory physician who has been treating patients with Covid-19 for the past 16 months. While certain patterns have emerged which help triage patients, there is still little understanding as to why some patients deteriorate while others don’t. This is frustrating, because it makes it difficult to decide whom to confidently reassure, and whom to help brace for a stormy course ahead. In contrast, as an epidemiologist, I feel confident in knowing that the signals from a public health perspective have been fairly consistent to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Whether it was the potluck banquet for the Lunar New Year at Wuhan, China in January followed by an exodus of 5 million people from the city for the holidays or the football match at the San Siro stadium leading to Bergamo being the epicentre of the first wave in Italy in February 2020, or numerous instances since, overcrowding has consistently facilitated the exponential spread of the virus.The three Cs: closed spaces (such as restaurants and gyms), crowds (such as those seen in congregations of people for recreational, religious, political and other social reasons) and close contact (such as public transport) account for a majority of infections. With more transmissible variants such as the Delta, such “superspreader” events are even more likely to be the drivers of future spread. The investigations conducted by HT on the high incidence of infections in certain districts of Maharashtra arrive at similar conclusions. Elections and rallies leading up to them appeared to be a driver of spread. Congregation of crowds of at tourist destinations was another. An over-reliance on Rapid Antigen Test kits (which are prone to detect around 50% of those infected) meant that infected people were escaping the net, thereby continuing to spread the virus. As vaccines were in limited supply, prioritisation of vaccination of the elderly, whilst protecting the most vulnerable, may have led to the under-protection of the most exposed workforce, leaving them vulnerable. Most importantly, economic hardships have left individuals with no choice but to resume work, despite being cognisant and fearful of the risks entailed. All of these, based on our understanding of spread over the past year, were preventable. It cannot be emphasised enough that the workforce needs to be vaccinated on a priority basis, and we have not done this at a pace that we should have. This is especially needed in areas of essential activities such as grocery stores and marketplaces, where the sheer magnitude of the population will make it impossible to avoid crowds. One cannot expect individuals to behave in a way that is detrimental to their livelihood, and shaming or penalising them has almost never been a successful strategy. We have not focused enough on the economic safety nets and financial support from employers and the government that would enable individuals to refrain from engaging in risky behaviours. It will be worth considering mandating vaccination for recreational activities (restaurants, gyms, tourism, sporting events), which would boost vaccine uptake especially in the private sector, in which shortages do not seem to be as much a concern. Preventing crowds from aggregating for events, whether political, religious, or social will be more challenging, despite lockdowns in place. Focusing on harm reduction is likely to yield more dividends than attributing blame. While the government needs to strictly prohibit mass gatherings, we will need to think of innovative ways to dampen the effects of such events if they do occur. For example, encouraging masking and preventing sloganeering and chanting (speaking loudly can increase droplets 50-fold, and singing, almost 100-fold) at such events could all potentially reduce the probability of spread. “Cluster-focused backward tracing” — which was used with success in Japan — tracks every case to a likely superspreader event and then tests those present at the event, rather than forward tracing, which focuses on those who came into contact with the person post-infection.The uncertainty around the nature of the course of the illness once infected, versus the predictable nature of spread, suggests that we need to invest all our resources into preventing disease and overburdening the healthcare system. Doing this, while acknowledging the need for social interaction and earning one’s livelihood, in the most non-judgmental way, would determine our future success in containing this pandemic.

Former Union minister and Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal requested the representatives of all opposition parties, including the Congress, to join the delegation of MPs that will meet the President on Saturday demanding that he direct the Centre to discuss repeal of the three agriculture laws in Parliament. Harsimrat said the MPs pointed out that the agriculture minister had committed a serious lapse by claiming that the government did not have any record of farmer deaths. “This amounts to whitewashing the sacrifice of the ‘annadaata’ who has been agitating against the three laws for eight months. We are shocked that he said this despite there being clear proof of 537 farmers losing life during the protests,” she said.Requesting the speaker to intervene on the issue immediately, the MPs said the agricultural minister should be asked to apologise to the farming community for his “intemperate remarks”. Simultaneously, the speaker should form a JPC to ascertain details of the total number of lives lost during the ongoing protests and suggest ways to rehabilitate the victims’ families. The MPs also brought it to the notice of the speaker that the agriculture minister had gone on record to say that no study was conducted to understand the apprehensions among farmers about the three laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sadled-8-party-delegation-meets-ls-speaker-demands-jpc-on-tomar-remark-on-farmer-deaths-101627674794121.html

Presently, the galliara is being maintained and taken care of by various departments of state government. The gurdwara body recently acquired its portion to build jora ghar (space for keeping shoes), a locker room and a parking lot amid increasing footfall of devotees.

31-07-2021||Chandigarh||Transfers deed in Chandigarh must state parents will be taken care of||The Chandigarh Maintenance Tribunal has mandated that children must give an undertaking that they will take care of their parents before a property transfer deed is executed between them.If the transferee (children or relatives or other person) fails to fulfil this clause, the tribunal may cancel the transfer deed.For strict compliance, the tribunal has directed the sub-registrar, Chandigarh, to ensure that the mandatory condition is followed by the transferee.The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, mandates that the transferee must provide basic amenities and physical needs to the transferor (parents).Set up under this Act, the Chandigarh Maintenance Tribunal currently has more than 300 complaints by senior citizens pending before it. Most of these relate to property disputes, harassment by children and payment of maintenance.Applications under the Act can be made to the tribunal by a senior citizen or any other authorised representative. The tribunal magistrates also can take suo motu cognisance of a matter. Faith being floutedThe directions came after the tribunal observed that properties were transferred in good faith and with the verbal promise that they (transferee) will provide basic amenities and fulfil physical needs of the parents. But after the transfer deed was executed, they often failed to keep their promise.Headed by additional deputy commissioner KPS Mahi, the tribunal stated, “As per Section 23 of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, the tribunal is empowered with the power to declare such instrument of transfer or gift or otherwise as null and void wherein the condition is violated.” “In good faith under the influence of the transferee and due to lack of knowledge about the above provision, the transferor executes the instrument without quoting the condition in the transfer instrument,” it added further. Directions to sub-registrarThe tribunal has directed the sub-registrar that at the time of registration of instrument to transfer/gift deed, s/he must inform the transferor about the above provision of the Act. S/he must also ensure that the transferee has added the condition in the deed.The sub-registrar has been told to fix a notice about this to create awareness among the public, and also educate document writers and advocates dealing in such property transfers.“In Punjab, such property transfer deeds already must contain this provision. This was missing in Chandigarh. So, we decided to implement the provisions of the Act in this regard in letter and spirit,” said Mahi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/transfers-deed-in-chandigarh-must-state-parents-will-be-taken-care-of-101627674672275.html

31-07-2021||Chandigarh||PU conducts study to predict gender through handwriting||A study has been conducted by the Panjab University’s Institute of Forensic Science and Criminology that can be used to predict the gender of a writer of a document through his/her handwriting.The study has been carried out in collaboration with Forensic Science Laboratory, Rohini New Delhi, Regional Forensic Science Laboratory (RFSL), Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, and Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Madhuban, Karnal, Haryana. It has been published in the Australian Journal of Forensic Sciences.The study focuses on the identification of individual characteristics in handwriting for the purpose of estimating the gender of the writer.A total of 150 individuals participated in the study and the relevant features were extracted from their handwriting. These characteristics were collectively studied and their potential of gender estimation was explored by utilising statistical methods of chi-square test, logistic regression, and likelihood ratios.This is a pilot study that paves]way for creating larger reference databases of handwriting and using automated feature extraction. The method can be used to predict the gender of the person in tune with the requirement of the present age, where methods of forensic identification are under scrutiny for the error rates and empirical foundations.The study proposes the significance of the individual characteristics of handwriting from 150 individuals from the Indian population in the estimation of the gender of the writer under question or suspicion.Vishal Sharma of PU’s forensic science institute said, “In this study, we had different steps, starting from the extraction of individual features from the set of handwriting, converting them into data form, use of statistical method to check the significance and then application of logistic regression for model creation.”He added, “We have checked this model with unknown samples and the correct classification rate for females and males are 80% and 76.4%, respectively, which is very high for such studies. This pilot study paves a way for creating a database of the handwriting of Indians and then automation using the current method for quick results. There is a dire necessity for such methods in countries like India where forensic identification is under scrutiny for empirical foundation and significance level in real casework.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-conducts-study-to-predict-gender-through-handwriting-101627674372253.html
31-07-2021||Chandigarh||Vij tells health officials to increase sampling||Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Friday directed to increase sampling of Covid-19 in order to detect and contain the spread of contagious virus. In the last 24 hours, 27,355 samples were tested, 26 fresh cases detected in 10 districts and three people succumbed to the contagion in Nuh, Panipat and Hisar, according to the health bulletin. The health minister, who held a meeting with senior functionaries of the health department, said that people should be categorised according to their work and that the priority should be given to sampling. Vij said random sampling should be conducted in crowded areas so as to prevent the spread of the infection. He directed the officers to expedite the work of setting up oxygen plants considering the possibility of third Covid wave. He directed the officers that an oxygen plant of 200-litre/minute capacity should be set up at Ambala’s community health centre or primary health centre at the earliest. Vij told the officers to make efforts and get all government laboratories in the state the accreditation of National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL). Additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora asked the officials to ensure immunisation of staff and students of medical colleges while focusing on the administration of second dose of the vaccine against the Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vij-tells-health-officials-to-increase-sampling-101627674195212.html
31-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Escaping to Nainital lake||Bus terminals, or bus addas, aren’t thought to have the romance of a railway station, or an airport’s departure lounge.Such a prejudice collapses while aimlessly wandering in Kaushambi Bus Station in Ghaziabad—it’s across the interstate Delhi-UP border, in Anand Vihar. This evening, after a day-long rain, the inundated bus station ground is looking like Nainital lake. The sky, the departing buses, and the passengers are being reflected in its stagnant water. Most people are oblivious to this beauty. Despite being a busy terminus, there isn’t much crowd. Some dozens of people are sheltering under gigantic tin sheds lined with benches. Each bench is operating like a stage showing its own soap opera. In one, a middle-aged couple is sitting, the woman absentmindedly playing with the man’s nose as they chat; three elderly men are perched on another, loudly arguing about UP politics; on another bench, a woman is sleeping. And bus station staffer Ram Kishen is hard at work—cleaning the tiled floor with a machine, his arm tattooed with a bleeding heart.Hundreds of buses are parked in the station. Some are filled with passengers, and ready to leave for their respective destinations. Others are empty, their departure probably scheduled for later in the night. The name of the city each bus is headed to is prominently painted on its destination plate. Reading these place-names—most are in UP— makes you feel as if you have already escaped Delhi. Stationed at the edge of a metropolis, it is thrilling to find a material connection to these towns that seem to be part of some remote world—Pilibhit, Lakhimpur Kheri, Gola, Tanakpur, Inhauna, Jagdishpur, Khurja, and Balia.Since it has again started to drizzle, the next best thing if you aren’t boarding a bus is to enter one of the eateries that line the bus station. Order Maggi noodles with scrambled eggs. It’s spicy, steaming, delicious, and a kind of quick stomach-filler commonly found in a bus-friendly highway dhaba.Meanwhile, a pair of pigeons is skipping in the rain pool, like a long-time couple vacationing in the great outdoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-escaping-to-nainital-lake-101627673644887.html
31-07-2021||Chandigarh||July 29 to be celebrated as new education policy day: Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday announced that July 29 will be celebrated every year as new education policy day and review the progress of the aims and objectives of the policy the Centre had launched last year. The chief minister said that in line with the state government’s vision of empowering students with knowledge, skills and values by imparting quality education, Haryana is moving fast towards ensuring successful implementation of the NEP-2020, by 2025. He said that Haryana would set an example by implementing the education policy. The chief minister said that sensitising the teachers, educationists and other stakeholders as well as the children, who are the real beneficiaries of this policy, about NEP-2020 is the need of the hour. He said that for the successful implementation of NEP by the year 2025, a roadmap has been prepared by the senior officers of the departments of women and child development, school education, higher education and technical education. “Empowering students with knowledge, skills and values to enhance their employability is the top priority of the state government,” Khattar said . He said that in NEP-2020 the target of ensuring participation of women in higher education has been set at 50 per cent and in Haryana, at present, the participation of women in higher education is 32 per cent and soon dedicated efforts will be made to increase this percentage to 50 per cent. “For this, the state government has opened women’s colleges and is also providing transport facilities to girls to reach their college,” said Khattar, who held a function to formally launch the NEP in the state. He said work is being done to set up a multi-disciplinary education and research university in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/july-29-to-be-celebrated-as-new-education-policy-day-khattar-101627674072796.html
31-07-2021||Chandigarh||Cloud over vaccination drive as Chandigarh awaits fresh doses||Left with just 40,000 doses, the Chandigarh health department is waiting for the fresh stock of Covid vaccines from the central government.Usually, the vaccine stocks are replenished by the end of month, but uncertainty prevails over the arrival of next assignment. The health department is, however, expecting the first batch of vaccines for the next month on August 5. The Centre has allocated 2,17,200 vaccine doses for Chandigarh to be utilised in August. Of the total doses, at least 1,69,160 will be given to the government sector for free inoculation, while the private hospitals in the city can buy up to 48,040 doses next month. According to the latest electoral list, around 7.2 lakh people are eligible to be vaccinated in Chandigarh, of which 84% have so far received the first dose. The percentage of those who have been fully vaccinated is 26%.The UT health department aims to vaccinate the entire eligible population with at least the first dose by August 15.On average, the city is inoculating 9,000 to 10,000 beneficiaries everyday. The count, however, crosses the 10,000-mark on some days. In the highest-ever inoculations in a day, the health department had vaccinated 13,735 people on July 24.On Friday, as many as 8,217 people were vaccinated in Chandigarh. If the vaccination will go on at the same pace, the UT health department may fall short of doses in the first couple of days in August.“The health department sends 15 mobile van vaccination teams to different rural and urban areas of the UT. Besides, we have started door-to-door vaccination in many areas so as to inoculate the disabled and senior citizens at their doorsteps. Also, vaccination camps have been set up in public areas, including Sukhna Lake. We are not having adequate vaccines to run such initiatives as the supply from the central government has been delayed,” said a senior official of the health department, on the condition of anonymity.Due to the delay in supply, the UT health department is likely to face challenges in meeting the target of vaccinating the eligible population by mid-August as many centres may soon run out of the vaccines completely.“The stock hasn’t dried out and we would receive the fresh stock soon. At present, we have 40,000 vaccine doses available in the government centres. People can walk in and take their first and second dose,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services (DHS), Chandigarh, adding that the health department is making all efforts to vaccinate the eligible population before August 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cloud-over-vaccination-drive-as-chandigarh-awaits-fresh-doses-101627673952261.html
31-07-2021||Mumbai||Construction works in Thane Creek ESZ to require wildlife board NOC||All infrastructure development set to come up within the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS) will soon be required to obtain a no-objection certification (NOC) from the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL). A clause to this effect is also proposed to be added to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai’s (MCGM) development plan 2034 (DP2034), revealed the civic body circular dated July 9, which was accessed by HT on Friday.A letter by the deputy conservator of forests (Thane), dated April 9, to the Mumbai municipal commissioner had stated that NBWL’s clearance is mandatory for all construction work proposed within a deemed eco-sensitive area of 10km around the TCFS boundary. This would entail projects all the way in Mumbai’s eastern and western suburbs requiring a wildlife board nod.“This is merely a formality as per the law, and it remains to be seen whether such a restriction will actually stave off development pressures on the Thane Creek. It’s not conceivable that a building which has to come up in, say, Saki Naka, be denied wildlife clearance on account of the flamingo sanctuary. What is needed is for projects in the immediate vicinity of the creek to be restricted. This has not been Mumbai’s experience with developments around Sanjay Gandhi National Park, for example, where there are buildings coming abutting the national park despite a monitoring committee being in place,” said Stalin D, director of environment group Vanashakti.An official with the forest department, meanwhile, said that the 10-km zone is only a temporary measurement. “The final notification of the proposal, after it was initially gazetted on April 30, is expected to be issued by the Union environment ministry in August. The maximum width of the ESZ is only 3.89km and the minimum width is 0km. Once that notification comes into place, there will be no need for projects situated 10km away to procure NOC from the wildlife board,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/construction-works-in-thane-creek-esz-to-require-wildlife-board-noc-101627673893531.html
31-07-2021||Chandigarh||HIV+ blood transfusion in Bathinda: 7 months on, VB yet to question suspects||The vigilance bureau (VB) has failed to make any headway in the HIV+ blood transfusion cases at a government facility in Bathinda even after seven months. In December last year, the state health department had tasked VB’s Bathinda range unit to investigate possibilities of a nexus of the sacked hospital staff and others behind the repeated cases of wrong blood transfusion at the government-run blood bank at Bhai Shaheed Bhai Mani Civil Hospital. The step was taken after five persons, including four thalassaemia patients aged between 7 and 13, being treated at the district hospital were found HIV positive after blood transfusion. The role of at least six staffers then posted at the blood bank came under the scanner in the serious breach of strict guidelines of blood transfusion. However, VB has not questioned any of the key suspects to date. As the Bathinda district police are conducting a regular criminal investigation in which the main accused, Baldev Singh Romana, a medical laboratory technician was already arrested, the VB was asked to probe patterns where several were infused infected blood at the same place. Bureau’s deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Kuldeep Singh confirmed that the VB is yet to question any of the suspects. “Four lab technicians namely Gurpreet Singh Godara, Jagdeep Singh, Ajay Sharma and Gurpreet Ghumman were dismissed by the health department for their alleged negligence. It took us a lot of time to locate their current addresses. Now these suspects have been summoned on August 2,” said the DSP. He said the VB is also seeking assistance from the district police in the matter. After two departmental inquiries suspected a mischievous role played by several department staff, the top brass of the health department suspected a link among the cases. Sources said records of the blood bank were allegedly tampered with and the VB was expected to find if there was an irregularity in the procurement of HIV test kits. Health secretary Hussan Lal had said the VB has been entrusted for an in-depth probe as it is better equipped and trained to find out possibilities of a nexus behind repeated cases of wrong blood infusion. Senior medical officer Dr Maninder Singh said the internal probe reports were handed over to VB in December and all assistance will be given to the police as and when required. Bathinda DSP GS Romana said another accused of attempt to murder charge, Richu Goyal, a sacked lab technician, secured a pre-arrest bail from the Punjab and Haryana high court. “No clinching evidence has appeared so far against then blood transfusion officer Dr Karishma Goyal. But the matter is under investigation and roles of other lab technicians are still being probed,” said Romana. Meanwhile, a family of an 8-year-old thalassaemia patient demanded trial by a fast-track court. “According to the internal report, the staff managing the blood bank hid an incident when the blood of an HIV+ infected donor was issued to a patient at the Bathinda civil hospital in May last year. The same person donated blood again in October last year at the same institute and it was infused to my daughter, who is already battling thalassaemia. This criminal negligence has jeopardised the life of my daughter. Victims should be compensated suitably to set a precedent to fix accountability for medical negligence,” said the patient’s father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hiv-blood-transfusion-in-bathinda-7-months-on-vb-yet-to-question-suspects-101627673892363.html
31-07-2021||Chandigarh||Retired bureaucrats, intellectuals to take part in farmers’ stir||Retired Punjab IAS, IPS and army officers and intellectuals on Friday announced to join the “Kisan Sansad” for a day to express solidarity with the farmers agitating for their fundamental rights in a peaceful and democratic manner. In a statement after conducting the meeting in Chandigarh under the banner of Kirti Kisan Forum (KKF), SS Boparai, former secretary, government of India, said that the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has intimated that it will soon inform the KKF about the modalities to raise the issues concerning the farming community. Advocate JS Toor presented the members with his book against the newly introduced agricultural laws highlighting various legal infirmities in the legislation. RI Singh said succeeding generations of farmers would face an existential crisis, which is why the farmers have explained to the Union agriculture minister and his team many times that these laws have to be repealed. MS Chahal, former chairman of the Punjab and Sind Bank, and Kulbir Singh Sidhu highlighted the crisis facing the farming community. They said effective steps need to be taken to safeguard farm incomes and also protect the environment for the future generations. DS Bains said that ensuring procurement at the MSP on all 23 crops would ensure that farmers move away from production of cereals (which the nation has in plenty now) towards making the country self-sufficient in pulses and oil seeds. Brig Harwant Singh underlined the intimate connection of the farm and armed forces. He said that just as farmers joined the defence forces in their youth, the seasoned war veterans came back to their farms post retirement. GPS Sahi expressed surprise that the central ministers were time and again denigrating the farmers who had made the nation self-sufficient in food. Brig Indermohan Singh, Colonel Gill and Colonel Guron emphasised that the farmers must take the political plunge and work for their cause in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab elections. Gurbir Sandhu, ace shooter and former Olympian, said the book against the black agricultural laws must be translated into English and distributed to MPs and chief ministers. JR Kundal expressed surprise that none could come forward for an intellectual debate. Over 35 members of the KKF attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/retired-bureaucrats-intellectuals-to-take-part-in-farmers-stir-101627673052493.html
31-07-2021||Chandigarh||Rainwater floods fields in Sangrur villages, Ghaggar flowing near danger mark||The recent rain has inundated fields in many villages of Moonak in Sangrur, damaging crops over 5,400 acres. Besides, the level of Ghaggar river also reached 747 feet, just four feet below the danger mark on Friday, giving anxious moments to the farmers. The rainwater used to drain out in the Ghaggar through pipes in agriculture fields, but the river is flowing above the installed pipes, said farmers.Pargat Singh, a farmer from Surjan Bhaini village, said that the over 300 acres of crops have been submerged in his village. The rainwater also affected crops in Moonak, Salamgarh, Makror Sahib, Bangan and other villages in the area.Tarsem Singh, a farmer from Moonak, said his 14 acres paddy crop submerged in the rainwater. Former finance minister and Lehra MLA Parminder Singh Dhindsa also visited affected villages and alleged that the state government had not made adequate arrangements in the past four years to save fields from flooding.Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir said: “We are keeping a watch. If there is any damage, the administration will assess it.”Sangrur chief agriculture officer Jaswinderpal Singh Grewal said paddy and cotton crops over 5,400 acres have been submerged. “If the level of the Ghaggar decreases, the rain water will drain out, but if the level remains the same, it can affect the crops,” added Grewal.Farmers encroach upon drainage pipes Patiala: Farmers have encroached upon drainage pipes in villages of Patran sub-division in Patiala, leading to flooding of 900 acres of agricultural fields.Farmers of Jogewal, Ghular and Niawali village blocked national highway on Friday evening due to delay on the part of district administration in removing the encroachments.Villagers alleged that the farmers in the low-lying areas have illegally blocked drainage pipes. “Their crops are under two-feet deep water as some farmers are not allowing local administration to open drainage pipes,” said Balwinder Singh, a farmer in Jogewal village.Meanwhile, Patran SDM Palika Arora said they are going to register an FIR against farmers for blocking drainage pipes and not adhering to the district administration’s directions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rainwater-floods-fields-in-sangrur-villages-ghaggar-flowing-near-danger-mark-101627672993540.html
31-07-2021||Mumbai||Extortion case against ex-Mumbai top cop: Hearing on DCP’s plea on Aug 5||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday adjourned the hearing of the petition filed by deputy police commissioner (DCP) Akbar Pathan, seeking the quashing of a first information report (FIR) registered by Marine Drive police.The FIR has named Pathan as a co-accused along with former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh and four other officers in an extortion and cheating case based on a complaint by Bhayandar developer Sham Sundar Agarwal.The adjournment came after additional public prosecutor Jayesh Yagnik for Mumbai Police sought time for a special counsel to appear on their behalf and gave an oral assurance that no coercive action would be taken against the Pathan till the next hearing.The other police officers named in the case apart are assistant commissioners of police (ACP) Sanjay Patil and Shrikant Shinde and inspectors Asha Korke and Nandkumar Gopale.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing Pathan’s petition, was informed that apart from the police officers, two civilians – Sanjay Punamia and Sunil Jain – who were also named in the FIR are in police custody, and hence, the petitioner sought protection. Punamiya and Jain have also filed petitions in HC seeking quashing of the FIR against them.According to Agarwal’s complaint, Punamiya, Jain and the police officers had connived together and falsely implicated him in a case, and then demanded ₹50 lakh and a 2BHK (bedroom-hall-kitchen) flat in Bhayandar from him to prevent his arrest under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). Pathan’s counsel, advocate Niteen Pradhan, argued that the FIR was registered arbitrarily to hamper the probe to unravel Agarwal’s alleged underworld connection. Pradhan added that as Pathan was a DCP, the FIR could not have been registered against him directly and a preliminary inquiry was required to be carried out initially to ascertain if the allegations made against a public servant are true. He said the Prevention of Corruption Act prescribes a preliminary probe, and then an open inquiry can be conducted. Once the authorities were satisfied, they could grant sanction to register an FIR. Refuting the allegations of Pathan’s role in the extortion case, Pradhan argued that if the FIR was not quashed and the probe against Agarwal was scuttled, it would demoralise the department for investigating instances in which the underworld was involved in an organised crime.The bench has posted the matter for hearing to August 5.Meanwhile, another FIR was filed against Singh for extortion at Thane Nagar police station. Singh has been booked with 27 others, including senior cops, underworld gangsters and journalists. Singh, along with the then DCP Deepak Devraj, ACP NT Kadam, ex-cop Pradeep Sharma, senior inspector Rajkumar Kothmire and gangster Ravi Pujari were booked after a complaint filed by a man named Ketan Tanna, 54. An officer from Thane Nagar Police station confirmed the development and said, “We have booked 28 people including Singh and other cops under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The statements of the complainant and two others have been recorded so far.”Tanna, who runs a construction business, claimed that Singh and the other accused extorted crores of rupees by threatening to get him booked in a fake case. They allegedly also threatened to carry out his encounter on not paying the money. Tanna in his complaint said, “From January 2018 to February 2019, the accused extorted ₹1.25 crore from me and ₹3.45 crore from my associate and bookie Sonu Jalan. They also demanded high-end watches and other expensive gifts. On Singh’s directives, the accused also threatened me in my family’s presence.” Jalan, who had also given his statement to the police, said, “Singh, Sharma and Kothmire, along with some more officers, had arrested me under fake charges.” This is the third FIR against Singh, as cases of extortion have also been registered against him in Kopri (Thane) and Marine Drive police stations. At Kopri police station, Singh, DCP Parag Manere and three civilians were booked after the complainant, Sharad Agrawal, who deals a real estate business stated in his complaint that Singh had extorted ₹2 crore from him and also forced him to hand over some plots of land to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/extortion-case-against-ex-mumbai-top-cop-hearing-on-dcp-s-plea-on-aug-5-101627672992254.html

There is increase in testing which might be the reason for this,” said Muhammad Salim Khan, head of community medicine and nodal officer Covid at Government Medical College, Srinagar.From the highest of 52,848 active positive Covid patients on May 13, the active cases were continuously declining and had plunged to a lowest of 1,124 on July 27. But after 76 days, now the active cases have shown an incremental increase from July 28.Similarly, the test positivity rate (TPR) for July 25-29 has increased to 0.24% from 0.2% of July 20-24. The increase is in the backdrop of the fact that 25% more overall tests were conducted in the last five days than the earlier five-day period.Dr Khan said the UT is still better placed but rued the fact that people are not taking precautions. “There is some fatigue in following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Many people are not wearing masks anymore,” he said.“This time, our vaccination rate is better than the previous time. We are ready with more oxygen beds and better infrastructure,” he said. The past five days also saw three covid related deaths against the nine in the previous five-day period.The incremental change in Covid scenario in J&K comes after the administration lifted the weekend curfew from all districts on July 25 though some restrictions such as night curfew remain in place.Officials said there is a significant improvement in total weekly cases, positivity rate, bed occupancy, case fatality rate, vaccination coverage and extent of compliance to Covid-appropriate behaviour.137 fresh cases reported in J&KJammu and Kashmir on Friday recorded one Covid-related death and 137 fresh novel coronavirus cases.There were 79 cases in Kashmir while the Jammu division saw 58 infections and one fatality.The number of patients who were cured in the UT was 109 with active cases at 1,171.Srinagar has the highest number of active cases at 315, followed by Jammu with 117 cases. The overall number of people who have recovered reached 3,15,795 prompting the recovery rate to reach 98.27%.Since the pandemic started, the overall cases in J&K have reached 3,21,344 and the death toll 4,378.Officials said 58,377 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours in the UT.With 26 cases, Srinagar had the highest number of new cases followed by 15 in Baramulla; and 14 districts had no or single-digit cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-2-5-months-slight-increase-in-j-k-s-covid-cases-positivity-rate-101627672933881.html

They are also unable to comprehend what it means to score 100 in five subjects. Can’t blame them either,” she said.Ansuiya, who aspires to be an IAS officer and serve the country as a civil servant, has a plan B ready too for her career.“Somewhere in my heart, I have this feeling of becoming a journalist so that I may highlight the plight of poor citizens and hardship faced by those living in the rural areas,” she said.While her father Laxmi Prasad is a farm labourer at Badera Khurd village in Mahoba district in the drought-prone Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, her mother Rati Bai, is a homemaker. Ansuiya is the youngest among seven siblings.Lauding her ability to quickly grasp what was taught, principal Bishwajeet Banerjee said, “According to her teachers, she remained focused on her studies. This helped her to score 100 in five subjects. She is a shining example for many other students.” The CBSE announced the results for this year on the basis of an alternative assessment policy after the exams were cancelled in view of second wave of Covid-19.

On July 23, the court of Faridkot judicial magistrate issued arrest warrants against three Haryana residents -- Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri -- returnable by July 30 in two sacrilege cases wherein torn pages of a “bir” (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) were found scattered in Bargari and three derogatory posters pasted near gurdwaras at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages. The SIT told the court that it needed time to conduct raids at more places to nab the accused. Police teams have already raided various locations in Punjab and Haryana, the court was told. Naming the three as conspirators in the Bargari sacrilege and derogatory posters cases, the SIT had filed challan in the court earlier this month. The SIT is likely to file a plea to start proceeding to declare them proclaimed offenders (PO) if it fails to nab them. The three have already been declared POs in three other sacrilege cases as police have failed to nab them since 2018 when they were first named as accused in desecration incidents in Moga and Bathinda districts in 2015. The SIT said two derogatory posters were pasted near the Bargari gurdwara on the intervening night of September 24 and 25, 2015, by dera followers on their directions. “A bir was also stolen on their directions from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala gurdwara on June 1, 2015, and its pages were scattered at Bargari on October 12, 2015,” the SIT said. Meanwhile, the hearing on the bail applications of two dera followers --- Nishan Singh and Pardeep Kumar --- in the Bargari sacrilege case was adjourned to August 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-bargari-sacrilege-arrest-warrants-against-3-dera-men-extended-after-sit-fails-to-nab-them-101627672812360.html
31-07-2021||Chandigarh||Memorial service of Sikh soldier held at Arlington National Cemetery in US||Recognising the valour of Sikh-American Gurpreet Singh, who died in a combat mission in Afghanistan over a decade ago, the Arlington National Cemetery on Thursday held a service in his honour more than six months after he was memorialised at America’s most hallowed ground with the placement of a memorial headstone.The service was held at the memorial marker of Corporal Gurpreet, the first and only Sikh service member from the Afghanistan campaign to be memorialised at Arlington National Cemetery.“The ceremony that was done today was for my brother late Cpl Gurpreet Singh. He was killed in action 10 years ago in Afghanistan. We didn’t do a proper burial, we had his cremation. We actually wanted to have a place at Arlington (National Cemetery),” his sister Manpreet Singh told PTI after the ceremony.After he joined the armed forces, Gurpreet was assigned to 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division, Camp Pendleton, California. He made the ultimate sacrifice on June 22, 2011, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, while conducting combat operations. He was awarded the Bronze Star with Combat “V” for valour, posthumously for heroic service in Sangrin district. He was 21 when he died.In November 2020, he was memorialised at the Arlington National Cemetery with the placement of a memorial headstone. His memorial marker is one of two, symbolising Sikh warriors in the American wars. The other one is of Uday Singh, who died in the war in Iraq.“It took us a while. It has been a really emotional journey, even though it’s been 10 years. Today we were able to get him a gravestone and a place where everybody can come,” Manpreet said.Describing Gurpreet as part of the “wonderful historical military legacy” that Sikhs carry, LTC Kamal Kalsi, who was behind organising the event and was the first Sikh to be granted a religious accommodation in nearly a generation, said that Sikhs have a strong connection with the military.“Today, we honoured the life and service of Cpl Gurpreet Singh,” he told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/memorial-service-of-sikh-soldier-held-at-arlington-national-cemetery-in-us-101627672752370.html
31-07-2021||Chandigarh||250 workers lose job as Sonepat cycle unit wraps up operations||Milton Cycle Industries Ltd. that employed around 250 workers has closed down operations at its Sonepat unit. Set up in 1951, the unit initially manufactured bicycle parts and gradually produced its own product. Surender Malik, vice-president of Milton Cycles Workers’ Union, said, “Workers have been waiting for the salary since March this year and they had received only 50% of the wages for a year between March 2020 and March 2021. Around 250 workers are currently working here and all of them have been sacked without notice. This company can be run but it has collapsed due to family dispute.” Sonepat assistant labour commissioner said the company owners had submitted all documents regarding closing the operations. “The factory was shut down due to dispute in the owners’ family. A case is continuing in the National Company Law Tribunal in Chandigarh,” he added. Milton Cycle Industries Ltd’s manager Girdharwal refused to comment on the issue. “Everything is in public domain. We will not speak on this matter,” he added. Surender Singh, president of Milton cycles workers’ union said, “Milton was producing 1.5 lakh bicycles by the end of 2008, employing around 1, 200 workers. After a rift in the owner’s family, both Atlas and Milton suffered immensely,” Singh added. The owners of the Atlas and Milton cycles come from the same family. Both set up separate manufacturing units in Sonepat in 1951. At that time, Milton would produce bicycle parts for the family’s more popular brand, Atlas. After a feud in the family in 2003, the ownership of Milton’s unit went to Jai Dev Kapoor and the one of Atlas was operated by Rajiv Kapoor, Arun Kapoor and Vikram Kapoor until June last year when it closed down the unit in Sahibabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/250-workers-lose-job-as-sonepat-cycle-unit-wraps-up-operations-101627672636996.html
31-07-2021||Mumbai||ED issues fresh summon to former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh||Hours after the Supreme Court refused to grant any relief to former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in the money laundering case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday issued fresh summons to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and his son Hrishikesh. The agency has asked them to visit its office in south Mumbai at 11am on Monday.ED had earlier issued three summons to Deshmukh but he had not appeared before the agency and had sent his lawyer instead. Hrishikesh was sent summons twice previously. The money laundering case against Deshmukh was registered after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against him on April 21. Deshmukh had in the past said that the allegations against him are false.The central agency has alleged that while serving as the Maharashtra home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze – who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases – collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”. Later, through hawala channels, this money was sent to two brothers in Delhi who operated bogus companies, said the agency. It claimed that at Hrishikesh’s behest, the two brothers diverted the money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, an educational trust controlled by the Deshmukhs.ED has also claimed that while collecting money from the bar owners, Vaze told them that a part of the amount was to go to an entity – ‘No 1’ – as well as the crime and social service branches of Mumbai Police. The anti-money laundering agency has also said that Vaze’s in his statement to ED said that he was called to Deshmukh’s official residence and directed to collect ₹3 lakh from every bar and restaurant in the city. He was also given a list of the establishments.During investigation, ED has identified 24 private entities that are controlled by the Deshmukh family and found that huge sums of money had been transacted among them without any rationale. “From the analysis of the bank accounts of these companies, it is clear that there is no rationale for the transfers, and thus it can be said that these series of transactions were meant for inflating balance sheets and layering of money from one company to other,” ED had stated. The agency then arrested Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and assistant Kundan Shinde on June 26, claiming that they had handled the money laundering linked to the extortions for Deshmukh.In mid-July, the anti-money laundering agency provisionally attached Deshmukh’s properties, worth ₹4.2 crore. The attached assets include a residential flat in Worli valued at ₹1.54 crore and 25 land parcels of book value ₹2.67 crore at Dhutum village at Uran in the neighbouring Raigad district.ED said its investigation has revealed that the Worli flat was purchased by the NCP leader in 2004 by making cash payment entirely by cash. It was registered in the name of Deshmukh’s wife Aarti, but the sale deed for the flat was registered in February 2020 after he became the home minister.The other seized properties too are held in Aarti’s name as well as in the name of company, Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd. According to ED officers, the Deshmukhs acquired 50% ownership in M/s Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd including its assets (land and shops), totally valued around ₹5.34 crore (book value) by merely paying ₹17.95 lakh, that too after a substantial gap.”Deshmukh had said that the allegations against him, made by former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh, cropped up only after the cop was shunted out as the commissioner over his poor handling of the Antilia and the Hiran murder cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-issues-fresh-summon-to-former-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-101627672572215.html

The site of the mining operations and the landslides lie squarely in the middle of the Dodamarg-Sawantwadi wildlife corridor, which was declared as an ecologically sensitive area (ESA) by the Bombay high court. However, the physical boundaries of the ESA are yet to be demarcated by the Maharashtra government, allowing non-forestry activities to continue.“Yesterday, a massive landslide occurred at Kalne, where the mining operations are being carried out. This mine in Dodamarg is in the middle of a crucial wildlife corridor of the Western Ghats connecting Andhi Dandeli/Bhimgad with Radhanagiri Widlife Sanctuary. Tens of thousands of trees have been felled and mining done even after the water table has been hit. We had intimated this illegality and objected to the granting of consent to operate to the mine vide our email dated May 30, 2020. However, our complaint was not taken note of. Today, not only have the forests been destroyed, but people’s lives have been impacted. Thousands of tonnes of mud/mining silt have entered the homes of the villagers of Kalne, and the Kalne river, too, is polluted with mining residue,” wrote Stalin D, director, NGO (non-governmental organisation) Vanashakti, in his letter to CM, on Thursday.Through successive orders over the past decade, HC in 2012 and 2013, based on Awaaz Foundation’s 2011 petition, had directed the Union environment ministry and the Maharashtra government to ensure that the 38 km-long and 10 km-wide corridor in Sindhudurg district be protected as an eco-sensitive area (ESA) where environmentally destructive activities are prohibited. HC had reiterated its order in 2018, based on a 2016 petition by Vanashakti, declaring the belt a ‘no tree felling zone’.However, the Kolhapur regional office of the state pollution control board in 2019 renewed an iron ore mining licence at Kalne village in the Dodamarg-Sawantwadi belt in 2019, allowing operations to handle 750,000 metric tonnes of iron ore per annum till March 31, across 32.25-hectare area at Kalne. The pollution control board had said mining operations were first issued permissions in 2009, much before the petition to protect the area had been filed, and renewing such consent is permissible for any proposed ecologically sensitive area as well.In April, Vanashakti had written to the environment department highlighting the long delay in demarcating the corridor’s boundaries. “The [HC] order is almost eight years old. Nothing stops the government from demarcating the corridor. A study of the flora and fauna in the 21 villages of the corridor is already with the state forest department. There is simply no plausible reason for the delay,” Stalin D wrote at the time.CM has requested the environment department to take appropriate action in the matter. An official with the environment department, seeking anonymity of name, confirmed that they are in receipt of Vanashakti’s petition. “But it requires clarification that there is nothing illegal about the mining work in Kalne, as alleged. The consent to operate is granted after due scrutiny. The connection between the mining and the landslide cannot be established without a study on the same,” the official said. Environmentalists, however, maintained that the renewal of consent to the mining operation in Kalne is in direct conflict with the Bombay HC’s order calling for the area to be protected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mining-in-dodamarg-sawantwadi-wildlife-area-leading-to-landslides-mumbai-activists-101627672092192.html
31-07-2021||Chandigarh||Meeting with Sidhu: Dalit MLAs demand due share to community in party, govt||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday held a meeting with MLAs belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC) community during which several of them sought the implementation of the 85th Amendment to the Constitution as well as due representation to the community in the party and government in the state. The meeting was convened by newly appointed state chief before the party’s long-awaited revamp of the organisational set up for feedback from SC ministers and legislators on issues faced by the community in the state. At the meeting, several MLAs pressed for the implementation of the 85th Amendment that will pave the way for faster promotions to SC employees and a promotion roster separate from that of the general category for them. The MLAs, several of whom have been grumbling from time to time about neglect and lack of adequate representation, sought due share in the party’s organisational set up, state cabinet and government bodies, besides raising pending poll promises, said two party leaders present at the meeting. They said the state government’s decisions on waiver of ₹590 crore loans under the farm debt waiver scheme for labourers and the landless farming community and the proposed Bill announced by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for the SC Sub Plan (SCSP) in the annual budget in proportion to their population were also appreciated. At 31.94%, Punjab has the highest percentage of SC population in the country and parties are going all out to woo this segment before next year’s assembly polls in the state. Gill MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid said that the 85th Amendment had been implemented in most other states but the bureaucracy was proving a stumbling block in Punjab. “There should be due representation in recruitment. We should have 5-6 ministers in the cabinet,” he said. Social security minister Aruna Chaudhary said the meeting was held to prepare for the 2022 assembly elections. “The government’s achievements and all issues, including those related to the SC community, and the government were discussed,” she said, refusing to go into specifics. Congress working president Sukhwinder Singh Danny said the meeting was held to gather feedback from MLAs who gave valuable inputs and suggestions regarding the organisational set up and issues that require attention from the government. “The PPCC president has assured to address these issues, besides taking up with the chief minister the ones that require action from the state government, at the earliest,” said the MLA, who set up the meeting that was attended by at least 17 MLAs. Cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi was among those who were not present. A party statement said another meeting will be held next week for further discussions on the party’s vision for the community. Amritsar West MLA Raj Kumar Verka stressed on better coordination between the party and government with the former acting as a bridge with the workers. Raising the issue of budget allocation, another MLA said that only 9% of funds allocated for SCs were being spent. Earlier, Sidhu held detailed deliberations with Congress leaders and workers from Mohali, Rupnagar, Fatehgarh Sahib and Malerkotla districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/meeting-with-sidhu-dalit-mlas-demand-due-share-to-community-in-party-govt-101627672031961.html
31-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra floods: CM hints at action against encroachments near rivers||After taking stock of the damages in flood-ravaged western Maharashtra and Konkan, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Friday announced to rehabilitate residents in flood-prone villages to safer places and also hinted at taking stricter steps to remove the illegal constructions from the floodplains on riverbanks. CM said that a consensus will be built among the political parties over the plan of rehabilitation and action against the encroachments, as well as measures to avoid such calamities in the future.Thackeray visited parts of Kolhapur that are flooded for more than a week. He had visited flood-affected Mahad in Raigad and Chiplun in Ratnagiri last week. While talking about encroachments in the floodplains in the rivers at Sangli and Kolhapur and the recommendations by the expert committees for their removal, CM said that its time for stricter decisions to remove these structures. He said that the district collectors have been directed to remove them immediately and ensure that new structures do not come up on the blue and red lines of the riverbanks.Thackeray said that he has asked authorities to compile with the key recommendations made by the Madhav Gadgil and Nandkumar Vadnere committees. “We will have to take some harsh decisions related to these structures. If we don’t act in time, these crises will keep occurring frequently. Blue and red lines have been demarcated for the riverbanks. If we do not follow them, there was no point in marking them. I have asked the collectors to take action against them [encroachments]. The floods have brought before us a grave reality, and we want the crisis to be turned into an opportunity. We are determined to implement the plan chalked out to avoid any such losses in the future,” CM said at a press conference.He said that the government has chalked out a plan for the rehabilitation of the people from the vulnerable villages which are prone to the landslides. “We have been witnessing unprecedented crises in the form of landslides, caving in of roads, flooding. The plan is being prepared for the rehabilitation of these people. We are taking suggestions from the opposition parties to bring them on the same page by keeping politics aside. Once a consensus was built, stringent decisions would not be difficult. I would also urge locals to stand by the government for these steps,” he said.Meanwhile, energy minister Nitin Raut announced in Sangli said electricity bills will recovered from locals in the flood-affected areas. “Until the situation does not become normal, consumers in these areas will not be served bills or asked to pay the pending bills. Whether or not to give a complete waiver on the bills is a decision that the state cabinet has to take. We are, however, thinking of discounts in electricity bills to the flood-affected people,” he said. A week after the floods, 173,000 consumers are still without electricity supply owing to the damages to the power infrastructure. Around 960,000 consumers from 1,942 villages and towns experienced power outage last week. The supply of 787,000 consumers has been restored.Public works department minister Ashok Chavan said that losses to the roads and bridges belonging to the state government is worth ₹1,800 crore because of the floods.Thackeray-Fadnavis face to face Thackeray and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis came face-to-face at Shahuwadi in Kolhapur as both were visiting the affected area at the same time. “I have told him that he will be invited for a meeting on the issues related to flooding and his suggestions will be incorporated in the plan,” Thackeray said. However, he did not miss the opportunity to take a jibe at Fadnavis over the relief package and said, “I am not the CM who announces packages for cheap publicity. I am the CM who likes to extend a helping hand to the people in need,” he said.Fadnavis in his reply said, “Let them call it a package or help, but it should be released soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-floods-cm-hints-at-action-against-encroachments-near-rivers-101627671802115.html

His name surfaced in the GTB Hospital shoot-out case of March 25 this year and during the investigation of wrestler Sagar Dhankad murder case at Chhatrasal Stadium, in which two-time Olympic medallist and world champion wrestler Sushil Kumar and his 12 associates have been arrested. Jatheri is a relative of Sonu Mahal, who was also thrashed along with Dhankad by Kumar and his associates on the night of May 4.Police officers said that Kumar was earlier associated with Jatheri, but differences emerged between them following the Chhatrasal Stadium assault and murder.Kumar feared life threats from Jatheri and his gang members and because of that reason he was shifted to Tihar Jail from Mandoli Jail, the officer said.Born in 1984 in Jatheri village in Sonepat, Sandeep alias Kala Jatheri, escaped the Haryana Police’s custody in Faridabad on February 1 last year. He is considered to be close to jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kala-jatheri-delhi-s-most-wanted-gangster-arrested-101627671371947.html
31-07-2021||Lucknow||CBSE class 12 results: Students in Uttar Pradesh dispel myth with performance, excel in arts stream||A number of CBSE class 12 students in Uttar Pradesh excelled in the arts stream despite the difficulties posed by Covid-19 situation, dispelling the myth that one cannot get 99% marks and above with humanities.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced the results for this year on Friday on the basis of an alternative assessment policy after the exams were completely cancelled in view of the aggressive second wave of Covid-19.Last year, the exams had to be partially cancelled after a nationwide lockdown was announced to contain the spread of Covid-19.According to the alternative assessment policy decided by a 13-member panel of the board, the theory paper evaluation formula was 30% weightage to class 10 marks, another 30% to class 11 marks and 40% weightage to marks obtained in class 12 unit tests, mid-term and pre-board exams.Many of the students who excelled in CBSE class results in Uttar Pradesh are ready to study undergraduate courses from Delhi University and elsewhere.One of those who shone this year was Jyotsna Yadav, a student of Lucknow Public School in South City in the state capital.

31-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra floods: State government ignored panels’ recommendations, say experts||While experts attribute the flooding in Raigad, Ratnagiri, Kolhapur and Sangli broadly to climate change, reduction in tree cover and human intervention in the ecosystem, they have slammed the government for its lack of willpower to take the steps recommended by experts to avert such calamities. The downpour in Konkan and Western Maharashtra for three-four days since July 22 wreaked havoc in nine districts. It resulted in the loss of 213 lives, several are still missing and saw evacuation of more than 450,000 to safer places. Preliminary estimates by the state suggest the losses are expected to mount to more than ₹5,000 crore. This is second such flooding in Western Maharashtra in three years. The severity of the flooding could be indicated with the water level in Panchganga river, which was flowing at 55ft, much above its danger mark of 43ft. The Madhav Gadgil committee on Western Ghats ecology and Vadnere committee appointed after the 2019 floods to recommend measures to avoid floods have submitted their comprehensive reports to the governments. Gurudas Nulkar, ecologist and trustee, Ecological Society, said, “Sahyadri range is the source region of rivers and the rain gets divided into Konkan and Deccan Plateau equally. Concentration of the rain run-off in the floodplain and cloudburst led to the flooding. Urbanisation has resulted in change in the natural landscape which takes the shape of saucer and the use of cement, tar, paver blocks result in hardscaping of the structures. This obstructs the percolation of the water,” he said. “Similarly, the construction in river banks and floodplains lead to constricting of river channels. Owing to this, the rivers cannot hold the volume of water they were designed to hold naturally. Destruction to the riparian zones, which give stability to river banks, damage the first and second order streams due to construction and lead to disturbance of ecosystem. Secondly, the city drainage system is falling short for the flood waters. The pattern of the monsoon has changed. We get the season’s rainfall in just four days as cloudburst has become common phenomenon due to the climate change,” he said. The Maharashtra government had appointed an expert committee of 10 members, headed by retired head of irrigation department Nandkumar Vadnere, in August 2019 immediately after the flooding in July-August that year to study the reasons and propose technical measures. Besides the demarcation of restricted zones by marking flood lines and identifying the flood plains, the committee had recommended removal and rehabilitation of encroachments. It recommended advanced weather forecasting systems, real time decision support (RTDS) systems, restoration of natural waterways and their desilting, strengthening of river meanders, construction of more flood dams, temporary flood storage tanks. The committee had also recommended strict implementation of the guidelines on the management of floods and urban flooding issued by National Disaster Management Authority in 2008 and 2010. The committee had recommended forming Flood Zoning Authority for two districts. It also recommended amendment in clause 16 of the Maharashtra Irrigation Act for demarcation of floodplain zones. “The removal of encroachments is directly linked to political vote banks and hence nobody dares to touch them,” Nulkar said. Madhav Gadgil, who headed the state appointed Western Ghat Ecology Expert Panel in 2010-11, said, “We had said that haphazard planning of highways by cutting mountains slopes, unchecked construction and mining activities should not be done. The recommendations were not followed by the government.” Pradeep Purandare, retired professor from WALMI, irrigation expert and member of Vadnere committee, said, “The accurate balance between water stock in reservoirs and discharge of water is key.” Shailaja Deshpande, ecologist and founder-director of Living River Foundation, Pune, said, “The committees have recommended their conservation to protect the ecosystem. The subsequent Kasturangan committee report which diluted Gadgil committee report by 50%, too, has been overlooked by authorities. There is no objection to the development, but there should have been watershed approach to it. The construction should be done by taking the particular landscape into consideration and respecting the ecosystem there.” Deshpande said, “Areas like Chiplun, Mahad city will require specific measures for managing floods. In cities like Kolhapur, Sangli and confluence regions, floods will get retained over longer period due to morphological features of the landscape.” Opposition leader and former CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “The state, by accepting the Vadnere committee report, should constitute a separate department for implementation of the recommendations. The state should implement the World Bank approved 2019-project for the diversion of the flood water to drought-prone areas through diversion canals.” Deshpande also suggested dedicated guidelines for infrastructural developments in the districts which frequently witness the flooding. Natural green belts along flood plains will act like buffers to manage and reduce intensity of floods. Vijaykumar Gautam, officer on special duty , water resources department, said, “We have started holistic approach towards these problem by chalking out short-, mid- and long-term measures. For rapid alerts and forecast, 7 of the 26 Real Time Decision Support systems on rivers in Konkan will be installed in next three months. Similarly, there would be comprehensive plan for water management. Construction within the blue and red lines is the major problem.” Gautam said completion of incomplete dams on Kalu, Shai in MMR and Kaal in Konkan is the need of the hour. “Had the dam on Kaal been completed within time, the water level in Vashisthi would not have increased more than 4ft, which had swelled to 11ft this time. Koyana absorbed 3.5 lakh cusecs of water, by releasing just 50,000 cusecs of water and played a great role of flood mitigation,” he said. Vijay Nahata, member of State Environment Impact Assessment Committee, said, “There are financial constraints before the state while implementing the recommendations given by any committee. The government has started taking corrective steps in response.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-floods-state-government-ignored-expert-panels-recommendations-101627671191945.html
31-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Yusuf Lakdawala’s son accuses stepmother of theft||The legal battle between builder Yusuf Lakdawala and his wife Sabina has taken another turn with his son Feroz accusing Sabina, his stepmother, of theft. Lakdawala, a 75-year-old Mumbai-based builder, is currently in judicial custody after being arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) earlier this year in a land grabbing case. Feroz is his son from his first marriage, while Sabina is his second wife. Feroz submitted a letter to Bandra police on Wednesday, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times. According to the letter, the matter came to light when Feroz checked the locker in his house on his father’s instructions. “Dad gave me his locker combination as only he and Sabina had access to the locker. He had to check whether valuables worth ₹1.5 lakh, including Rolex watches and my mother’s diamond set, were there. To our surprise, when we came home and opened the locker, all the valuables were missing,” the letter stated. Feroz informed his father about the same and then submitted the application to the police on the latter’s instructions. Senior inspector Nikhil Kapse from Bandra police station confirmed that the application has been received and said they are investigating the matter. Sabina was earlier booked for allegedly assaulting Feroz’s wife Noorie in their Bandra house due to a property dispute. Noorie had registered a complaint against Sabina in connection with the alleged incident on July 4 this year. Sabina had subsequently moved the Bombay high court (HC) seeking to quash the case. She had also stated that Lakdawala had assured to give her half the property.The Bombay HC, while hearing Sabina’s application on quashing the assault FIR, had sought Lakdawala’s view on whether he would like to amicably settle the dispute between him and Sabina. Advocate Kartikeya Desai, for Feroz and Noorie, said, “Since Lakdawala is lodged in Arthur Road Central Jail, a video call was arranged between him and his lawyers on Friday afternoon. However, he has not made up his mind about this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-yusuf-lakdawala-s-son-accuses-stepmother-of-theft-101627671013596.html
31-07-2021||Bhopal||MP scraps controversial rule to bar students named in FIRs from college admission||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh will drop a controversial rule that debars students from higher educational institutions if a criminal case is registered against them, higher education minister Mohan Yadav said on Friday. The provision was notified by the state’s higher education department on July 15 and was to be implemented by government and private institutions. It was circulated to colleges earlier this week.The minister said it was “a wrong rule”.“How can we stop any person from getting educated just on the basis of criminal cases against him. The court decides whether the charges against students are true or not… We can’t bar their admission only after an FIR and charge-sheet,” Mohan Yadav said.To be sure, governments have for years rejected suggestions that politicians with criminal antecedents should not be allowed to become lawmakers. Existing election rules framed by the Election Commission on orders of the Supreme Court only require them to declare criminal cases against them.Yadav said there were many occasions when student leaders are booked under different cases for “staging protest on issues of public interest and this rule will do injustice with these students”.HT first reported this controversial rule after the state’s higher education department sent the notification to MP colleges.“I came to know about this rule from different sources. ABVP (RSS-backed Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad) leaders also brought this to my notice that this will be injustice with many students, who are facing ‘political’ cases,” the minister said, stressing that he has issued instructions to remove this controversial provision.ABVP’s state secretary, Praveen Sharma, told HT earlier that in his opinion, “This (rule) will definitely end student politics and is against one’s right to education”.The new provisions also said that students found guilty of misbehaving with faculty, staff or other students and vandalising college property would not get admission to the next academic session. “If there is no improvement in his/her behaviour, the principal is not authorised to give admission to such student,” reads the notification.This provision will stay intact. Yadav said the decision on letting such students continue will be decided by a disciplinary committee.Welcoming the minister’s decision, Congress MLA Kunal Chaudhary also took a swipe. “The state government planned to spoil the future of students of different ideologies but they realised that RSS’ student wing ABVP leaders will also get debarred in large numbers. We are happy they realised their mistake very soon and removed the rule.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-scraps-controversial-rule-to-bar-students-named-in-firs-from-college-admission-101627670962364.html
31-07-2021||Mumbai||CBSE Class 12 results: 99.35% students pass||Almost all Central Board of Secondary Exam (CBSE) Class 12 students have passed this year, showed the board results published on Friday. A total of 1.304 million students were set to appear for the Class 12 board exam this year across 16 regions in the country and 99.37% of them have passed. Pune region, which includes Maharashtra, recorded a pass percentage of 99.35%, up by 9.11 percentage points from last year’s 90.24%. Experts said this jump could be a result of the alternative assessment policy adopted by CBSE in the view of the pandemic. As the Covid-19 pandemic continued to rage in many parts of the country, the board exam was cancelled and students were assessed based on a new formula designed by CBSE.This year, the board evaluated students by compiling their marks in Class 10, 11 and 12. Of the total score, 30% weightage was assigned to the average of the three best performing subjects out of the five main ones in Class 10. Another 30% was assigned to theory marks obtained in Class 10 and the remaining 40% was given to scores in midterm/unit tests or pre-board exams that took place during Class 12. “The alternative assessment policy could be one of the reasons why the numbers are better this year. To moderate the marks, we are considering only the best and the highest marks scored by the student in the last three years. Another reason could be that the board has been liberal in its assessment this year given that the pandemic has been difficult for students as well,” said Avnita Bir, director-principal of RN Podar School, Santacruz.At the Delhi Public School in Nerul, Navi Mumbai, of the 316 students 83.2% got above 90% marks, said principal J Mohanty. All students passed with first division, he added. Across the country, the number of students securing more than 95% marks has almost doubled compared to last year with an 80% increase as compared to last year. Incidentally, flagged by a drastic surge in the number of top-scorers, CBSE had asked schools across the country to rework the marks earlier this month. Earlier schools were allowed to submit their moderated marks by June 30, but many were asked to redo the moderation and submit the marks by July 25, which led to a considerable delay in the much-awaited results.Principals said circumstances were different for students appearing for the board exam this year as compared with previous years. Kavita Sahay Kerawalla, vice-chairperson, VIBGYOR Group of Schools, said, “This year prompted the cancellation of board examinations but opened up promising prospects for novel ways of student assessment in the future. I congratulate our students for emerging victorious and surpassing all the challenges that the pandemic has presented.” For instance, at Bal Bharati Public School in Navi Mumbai, Parvati Paniker lost her mother to Covid-19 and her father was admitted to the hospital during her pre-board exams. She has managed to score 365 out of 500, securing 71% in aggregate.Students said their scores exceeded their expectations. “I was pleasantly surprised to find out I had secured 97.6%. I have done well in the past three years, but I wasn’t expecting to score this well. I’d like to credit my parents and teachers for this,” said Chinmaya DR, who topped in the science stream at Bal Bharti Public School, Navi Mumbai, and is preparing for engineering entrance exams.Ashwin Goyal, who secured 99.2% in the science stream, said amid uncertainties over the final exam, he would sometimes feel disheartened. “Of course, it was a difficult time and there was no certainty about how I would achieve my goals. I concentrated on my studies and that helped me tide through,” said Goyal, a student of DPS Nerul, who is weighing his options between a career in engineering and pure sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbse-class-12-results-99-35-students-pass-101627670892019.html

A link activated by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) meant for confirmation of seat number was mistaken for the results link, leaving students and parents anxious.“Several WhatsApp groups started sharing a link for the results, and the link once clicked was directing students to the official state board website. We assumed the board has suddenly decided to announce results but nothing of the sorts happened,” said Manisha Kapadia, mother of a Class 12 student. She added that many HSC students tried checking their results through the shared link and were worried when they could not access their mark sheets.As per a Supreme Court order, all school education boards have been asked to adhere to the July 31 deadline for announcement of Class 10 and 12 board results. This year, most education boards decided to scrap Class 10 and 12 board exams due to increasing Covid-19 cases, and instead announced results based on their overall performance in previous and the current academic years.Officials from MSBSHSE told HT that work on HSC results is still on and the board will officially announce the result date soon. “Students should not fall for false leads. The board will officially announce date for HSC results through appropriate mediums and give students ample time to be prepared for the same,” said an official from the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hsc-results-unlikely-to-be-announced-on-july-31-maharashtra-board-assures-work-is-on-101627670532712.html
31-07-2021||Other||Varanasi: Ganga water levels up by 2 metres in last 24 hours||Several steps of Dashashwamedh Ghat and other Varanasi ghats are flooded following an increase in river Ganga’s water levels over the last 24 hours, stated the Central water commission on Friday.Over the last 24 hours, the Ganga’s water level has risen about 2.09 metres, the commission reported. Varanasi recorded a 62.52-metre water level on Friday, while the river was flowing at 60.48 metres on Thursday.A central water commission official said that rains in the hilly areas and adjoining districts have resulted in a rise in water levels.Additionally, connectivity between one ghat and another was cut off because of high water levels.Due to the sudden rise in water level, five to ten steps at Dashashwamedh Ghat, Sheetla Ghat, Rana Mahal Ghat, Tulsi Ghat, Asi Ghat, and Panch Ganga Ghat are submerged.The water has reached the stairs of Harshchandra Ghat. A few stairs of Manikarnika Ghat were also reported to be underwater.Shambhu Manjhi, a member of the boatmen welfare community said that the boatmen operate only motorboats and he has asked his counterparts to take all precautions while plying the boats.Vijay Yadav, a resident of the Pandeypur area, said that if the water level of River Ganga continues to rise, the water level of Varuna will also increase and the problem of people living in the catchment areas may also increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/varanasi-ganga-water-levels-up-by-2-metres-in-last-24-hours-101627670412178.html

The CBSE also seems to have given grace marks to students. Students and staff are happy with the result,” said Jha.Gaurav Sharma, who topped the Science stream at RPVV Surajmal Vihar with 97.6%, said that the result was as per his expectations though he had to face many challenges during online classes. “During online classes, network connectivity was a major challenge. On many occasions, I missed classes since there was no data or network. After all those struggles, I am happy with my result,” said Sharma, whose father is a labourer and mother is a housewife. Sharma will be the first in his family to pursue graduation and dreams of pursuing a computer science in an IIT.Sakshi Aggarwal, another student of RPVV Surajmal Vihar who secured 97%, credited her performance to the efforts by teachers during January-February when physical classes were held. “Online classes took place throughout the year but it was during the two-three month period that we gained a sense of confidence. Our teachers polished us very well during this period,” said Aggarwal.An ecstatic Aggarwal said that though her father expected a score above 95%, she was pleasantly surprised to secure 97%. The 17-year-old plans to pursue History honors and has set her eyes on Delhi University. “Since my father is not a graduate, studying in a good college will be a big step forward for our family,” said Aggarwal, whose father is self-employed while her mother is a homemaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-schools-outperform-pvt-schools-for-sixth-year-in-a-row-101627670291423.html

This comes as the situation of student visa applicants continues to be grim due to the pandemic. Students who have already booked their biometrics appointment will need to cancel their existing appointment to book an earlier date using the dedicated queue on the appointment management system (AMS).“This priority service is available only for study permits, short-term study and returning students. VFS [Visa Facilitation Services Global] will cancel appointments from all other applicants booked under the student-dedicated queue on AMS. AMS link https://t.co/ZxBEaDE98S,” read a tweet from the high commission on Friday.“Taking into consideration the increased demand from Canada student visa customers in India for earlier biometric appointments, VFS Global and high commission of Canada now provide a dedicated queue on the appointment system with increased capacity. Customers applying for all other visa categories are requested to avoid booking appointments under the student visa category,” stated VFS Global.As student visa applicants remain to be in a dicey situation, reports of fraud agents have also come to light. In a statement issued to the applicants, VFS Global said, “Customers are advised to beware of fraudulent entities who charge fees from customers for scheduling appointments using VFS Global’s name or independently,” British Deputy High Commission, too, issued an advisory about visa fraudsters.In a thread on Twitter on Wednesday, the British Deputy High Commission (BDHC) listed tips to avoid visa scams and stressed that UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) and visa outsourcing and technology services specialist, VFS Global, would never ask customers to share personal information via social media, and said scammers could use this for online trickery.Pointing out that UKVI or VFS would never ask for visa payments by email or phone, it said that one should pay for visa application online and if there were any suspicions or incidents, it should be reported on the link https://actionfraud.police.uk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/canadian-commission-comes-to-aid-of-student-visa-applicants-101627670233785.html
31-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi University cutoffs set to soar as over 70,000 score over 95%||With over 220,000 students scoring 90% or more marks -- over 70,000 of them securing 95% or more -- in the Central Board of Secondary Education Class 12 results announced on Friday, securing a seat in Delhi University (DU) this year will become all the more difficult as DU officials anticipate a steep rise in the cutoff marks for most undergraduate courses.Every year, over 70% of students who take admissions to the DU are from the CBSE board.A total of 220,156 students scored 90% or more this year, as compared to 196,620 in 2020 — a jump of nearly 12%.The number of students scoring 95% or more has almost doubled to 70,004 from last year’s 38,686. However, those scoring in the 90-95% range decreased by about 5% — from 157,934 last year to 150,152 this year.It is to be noted that the number of students appearing for Class 12 assessment has also increased — from 1,192,961 to 1,369,745 this year.In 2019, when the board managed to conduct exams for all papers without hindrance, 94,299 students scored in the 90-95% range while 17,693 students scored above 95%. The number of high scorers jumped by over 96% between 2019 and 2021 – indicating the impact of the revised assessment schemes on board results.For the past two academic sessions, the board devised an alternative assessment pattern to evaluate Class 12 students, as exam schedules were interrupted or disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic and the February 2020 riots in north-east Delhi. While all exams for classes 10 and 12 were scrapped this year on account of the second wave of the pandemic, in 2020, the board cancelled exams of 23 Class 12 papers in view of Covid-19 and the February riots.Several school administrators said the jump in pass percentage was mainly due to the 30% weightage given to class 10 and 11 scores. Ashok Pandey, director of Ahlcon Group of Schools, said the results this year, too, are a continuation of the trend of high scores. “Also in previous years, the actual pass percentage was without the compartment exam results. This year, students who could have got compartment did not because 60% of their marks came from class 10 and 11 scores, which they already cleared, and their best scores were taken. Another reason for an increase in top scorers is that internal test scores and practicals were used to calculate results. Students generally do better in unit tests,” he said.Several educationists said the criteria were more empathetic this time. Ameeta Wattal, former principal of Springdales, Pusa Road, said, “The jump in scores is due to the revised marking scheme. But in the prevailing scenario, the assessment criteria were the best possible outcome and there was no other way. The board had formed a strict moderation policy for a holistic assessment of students.”The increase in pass percentage and the number of top scorers may affect the cutoffs for undergraduate courses in Delhi University, which are likely to come out by the second week of September. Former dean (admissions) Shobha Bagai said, “The increase in pass percentage was expected. The number of high scorers nearly doubling was unexpected. Colleges will face challenges in deciding cutoffs and may have to decide on whether to leave seats empty or risk over-admissions.”In Delhi University, colleges are supposed to give admission to all applicants who meet the announced cutoffs; there is no “first come first served” policy. Several times, colleges have to increase seats to accommodate all eligible students. The university will begin registrations for undergraduate courses from August 2.Rajeev Gupta, chairperson of admissions, said, “If (pass) percentage has increased this year, it will also impact the cutoffs. But several entrance examinations are also in the pipeline. Once those examinations are conducted and certain students move out, that too will impact our admissions.”Miranda House principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda said, “Cutoffs in popular courses will increase as per our calibration. In certain subjects, cutoffs may remain the same as per the choices of students. We will also be analysing the admissions data of previous years to ascertain the more popular courses.”Hindu College principal Anju Shrivastava said they are waiting for admissions data to analyse how many top scorers have applied for different courses over the years. “The first cutoffs will be on the higher side. As far as cutoffs of 100% are concerned, we have to see how many students scoring above 99% have applied and take a call accordingly,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-university-cutoffs-set-to-soar-as-over-70-000-score-over-95-101627670231336.html
31-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi high court seeks report on illegal constructions near Qutub Minar||The Delhi high court has directed the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to submit a report on unauthorised properties being built in the vicinity of Qutub Minar, while ordering its commissioner to hold to account officers who permitted these constructions.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva also directed the civic body to ensure that none of the illegally constructed properties are permitted to be occupied, if not already occupied, and asked for the deputy commissioner (south zone) to be present before the court on August 20, the next date of hearing.“Let a status report along with complete details of properties which have come up in the vicinity of the Qutub Minar unauthorisedly be filed, along with action taken, supported by the photographs.The directions were passed on a petition by one Rinku Kaushik, who alleged vast illegal and unauthorised colonies being developed on a plot adjoining Qutub Minar, a world heritage site, and that several multi-storey buildings are being built at Mehrauli.He contended that in spite of repeated directions by the court, SDMC permitted illegal and unauthorised construction to be carried out. While SDMC said that demolition action has already taken place, the court observed that further construction has nonetheless been carried out and some of the buildings were in the process of being occupied.“The judicial observations made last year on SDMC’s response to the illegal construction being insufficient seem to have been fortified,” the court said. Last year, SDMC in its Action Taken Report said that it has undertaken a demolition action with respect to some structures in the area. The court had however said that the “isolated punctures in walls or roofs are insufficient” and if the structure was illegal, “it would have to be brought down”.The court had observed that all the structures were in the vicinity of the Qutub Minar and it was imperative that the ambience of the area be maintained, especially in view of the strictly prohibited and regulated construction near protected monuments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-seeks-report-on-illegal-constructions-near-qutub-minar-101627670231920.html
31-07-2021||Delhi||Water level breaches danger mark in the Yamuna||The water level in the Yamuna breached the danger mark on Friday following heavy rainfall and water discharge from Haryana.The water level recorded at Delhi’s Old Yamuna Bridge at 9pm on Friday was 205.59 metres, above the danger mark of 205.33 metres.According to officials of Irrigation and Flood Control Department (I&FC), the water level started rising on Thursday, reaching close to the warning level of 204.50 metres.“At 8 pm on Friday, the water level touched 205.58 metres after Haryana released 37,109 cusecs of water from the Hathnikund Barrage at 6pm,” said a senior I&FC official.Flood control officials, however, said that releasing high volume of water from Hathnikund is usual during the monsoon, especially when heavy rainfall in the hilly regions threatens to raise the water above the dam’s capacity.“Water is released into the barrage every four hours. On a regular basis, only 350 cusecs of water is released. During the monsoon, because of higher volume of water in the barrage coupled with rainfall in the hilly regions, more water is released, which leads to a surge in the Yamuna. It takes about 36 to 72 hours for the released water to reach Delhi. We are continuously monitoring the water levels,” the official said.Rajendra Kumar, SDM (Preet Vihar) and nodal officer for flood control, said that a flood alert has been sounded in the low-lying areas along the Yamuna and announcements are being made through loudspeakers in motor boats and e-rickshaws, to alert those living close to the embankments. Evacuation operations will begin if water level rises further, officials said.“All agencies concerned with providing rescue and relief have been put on alert. Also, preparations are underway for erecting tents if required. Keeping in mind the precautionary measures for Covid-19, in case people have to be evacuated, we will shift them to schools and provide all necessities,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/water-level-breaches-danger-mark-in-the-yamuna-101627670171930.html
31-07-2021||Delhi||Moderate three-hour spell of rain in Delhi hits traffic, causes waterlogging||In what was nearly a repeat of Thursday’s sequence of events, a moderate three-hour spell of rain on Friday left major stretches across Delhi inundated, and brought traffic to a standstill,The Capital received a bulk of 42.8mm rainfall on Wednesday between 2.30pm and 5.30pm, enough to throw a spanner in the city’s flood and traffic management systems, which have repeatedly been overwhelmed by the short, but intense spells of rain that Delhi has received over the past few years.The maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung, considered representative for Delhi’s weather, was 32 degrees Celsius, two below what is considered normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 24.5°C, three below normal.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that there is a forecast of ‘moderate’ showers on 31 as well. “Patchy rainfall will continue even after that and a heavy spell in parts of the city is expected on August 2. The monsoon trough is persisting in Delhi and hence more showers are likely over the next couple of days. This will also keep the temperature in check,” he said.Delhi saw a similar sight on Thursday as well, when an intense spell of showers between 2.30pm and 5.30pm left many roads flooded and commuters stranded.Over the last decade, the Capital has been receiving shorter and more intense spells of rain, weather scientists have said, a change in monsoon patterns that is the primary reason behind increasing instances of urban flooding and flash floods in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR).Rainfall data maintained by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune shows that in the 1980s and 1990s, in July, Delhi used to record 15-20 rainy days on an average. This has, in the last decade, reduced to eight to 10 days.In line with this pattern, Delhi got a 100mm spell of rain in a three-hour span on Tuesday morning, inundating low-lying areas and key arterial stretches, and confirming this as the wettest July in Delhi since 2003. So far this month, Delhi has received over 506mm. The Capital’s wettest July on record was in 2003, when it received 632.2mm of rain.Many commuters posted photos of inundated roads and crawling traffic.Delhi traffic police data showed that a host of vital arterial stretches, including Vikas Marg, IP College to Mall Road (both carriageways), Signature Bridge to Yamuna Vihar, Dhaula Kuan, both ends of Nizamuddin flyover, Zakir Hussain Marg, AIIMS flyover, Geeta Colony and Laxmi Nagar, among others.“There was a long jam near Saket Metro station, as vehicles crawled through the waterlogged road. Every time it rains, it becomes a struggle,” tweeted Shalini Iyer, a commuter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/moderate-three-hour-spell-of-rain-in-delhi-hits-traffic-causes-waterlogging-101627669996335.html

31-07-2021||Lucknow||Seven high-tech townships likely in five UP cities||Seven new high-tech townships are likely to come up in five UP cities as the state government has renewed licence of seven developers. The then state government had approved high-tech township policy in 2003. But in January 2010, the then state government scrapped it. Now, the Yogi government has renewed their licences. These developers have submitted detailed project reports to the housing department. These townships will come up in Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Mathura-Vrindavan, Bulandshahr and Prayagraj. Till then, large number of people had invested in some of the high-tech townships. However, the policy was scrapped leaving investors in the lurch. Now after renewal of the policy, around 50,000 people are expected to benefit from these seven housing projects. In these high-tech townships, flats, plots, row houses and commercial establishments will come up. “The state government has renewed licence of developers for seven high-tech townships in five cities. The developers have submitted revised DPRs of the projects. These projects will benefit around 50,000 people,” said a senior official of the Housing Board. Three promoters have applied for licence with the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) for the likely Lucknow townships. “Proposals have come up for three integrated townships in Lucknow. However, proposals are yet to be finalised,” said Nitin Mittal, the chief town planner, LDA. According to LDA officials, these townships will be of 28 acres, 112 acres and 210 acres respectively.After this proposal, three private developers applied for the licence. Clearance for these three townships may take some time as new LDA vice-chairman Akshay Tripathi will take a final decision only after going through all the details of these projects, said those familiar with the matter.Earlier this month, three firms gave separate presentations before the Lucknow Development Authority for preparing the city development plan. The development authority on July 3 this year had invited proposal for preparing a “vision implementation and integrated infrastructure plan” for overall development of Lucknow. Contenders for the project are Arinem Consultancy Services, Skyline Architectural Consultant and Rudrabhishek Enterprises Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/seven-high-tech-townships-likely-in-five-up-cities-101627669811318.html
31-07-2021||Delhi||Heated debate in Delhi assembly over GNCTD Act||The two-day Monsoon session of the Delhi assembly ended on Friday with a charged debate on the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, which gives overarching powers to the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) in the day-to-day functioning of the Capital.While leaders of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) argued that the law – also called the GNCTD Act – is “unconstitutional” and “anti-democracy”, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) asserted that the law did not weaken the powers of the Delhi Assembly.“The GNCTD Act is anti-democracy. It is like a colonial law which gave all powers of governance to the Viceroy. The BJP has failed to understand that the law is not in their interest as well in the long-term… Demanding a law that makes it mandatory for all executive files to be cleared by the L-G is unfair. I condemn such a law,” said Delhi minister Satyendar Jain, who is in charge of health, home, power and urban development.Delhi MLA Raghav Chadha said, “The GNCTD law makes elected governments impotent in administrative and legislative terms. In a few years, other parties can have a majority in this Assembly, including the BJP. This law is a major attack on federalism… This law violates the Supreme Court judgment in 2018 which clearly said that Delhi will be governed by the elected government and the lieutenant governor cannot interfere in any fashion other than domains of land, public order and police.”“It reduces this House into a mere debating society,” said Chadha.The law was notified in Delhi on April 27, after being passed in both houses of Parliament the previous month. While the AAP and other Opposition parties across the country criticised the law, the Centre claimed it promotes “harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive, and further defines the responsibilities of the elected government and the Lieutenant Governor, in line with the constitutional scheme of governance of Delhi, as interpreted by the Supreme Court.”According to the controversial act, the “government” in Delhi would mean L-G in the context of all legislations to be passed by the state assembly. This, according to the Centre, is consistent with the Delhi’s status as a Union Territory to address the ambiguities in the interpretation of the legislative provisions.Dismissing the AAP’s allegations, BJP MLA Vijender Gupta said, “The GNCTD Act does not reduce the power of the Assembly in any way. We fail to understand why the AAP wants to bring up the issue after eight months. Also, no committee of the Delhi Assembly has been nullified… The GNCTD Act asks that rules of the Assembly committees should be in line with rules that apply in the Lok Sabha. The law prohibits interference on day-to-day administrative work.”The law makes it mandatory for the Delhi government to take the opinion of the L-G before taking any executive action in the city. It also bars Delhi government from making any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the Capital or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions. Any rule made till this act comes into effect will be void, according to the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/heated-debate-in-delhi-assembly-over-gnctd-act-101627669751965.html
31-07-2021||Delhi||Two found dead in locked Rohini flat, one with hands tied with live wire||The decomposing bodies of a 40-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman were found under mysterious circumstances -- the man’s hands were tied with a live electric wire; the woman’s body lay next, touching him -- in a locked flat in outer Delhi’s Rohini Sector 34 on Thursday. The bodies were found on Thursday after a neighbour informed the police about a foul smell.Investigators suspect a murder-suicide and are waiting for a post-mortem report from a government hospital, where the bodies are currently preserved.“Prime facie, it appears that the man first killed the woman, a music teacher, and then electrocuted himself by tying his hands with a live wire connected with the ceiling fan. The ceiling fan was switched on and current was flowing through his body,” said a senior police officer.Deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Rajiv Ranjan Singh said that the police control room received a call about a foul smell coming from a flat in Rohini Sector 34.A police team found that the flat was locked from inside, following which the fire department team was called to break open the door. Inside, they found the two bodies lying on the floor.“Since the deaths did not look natural, we called the electricity department and crime spot investigation teams along with forensic experts to inspect the spot and collect necessary evidence. Later, the bodies were shifted to a government hospital and an enquiry was initiated,” said the officer.Police did not identify the deceased but said that they hailed from Bihar and had moved into the flat on July 25.“The man had gone to his hometown on May 22 while the woman had left for Bihar on July 22. They both returned to Delhi on July 24 and shifted to the flat a day later. Some neighbours heard a verbal spat between them on the morning of July 27. What happened after the quarrel is not known,” the officer added.Police said the man, who allegedly had two failed marriages and a case filed by one of his former wives, was under psychiatric treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-found-dead-in-locked-rohini-flat-one-with-hands-tied-with-live-wire-101627669691286.html
31-07-2021||Delhi||Doctors should be given Bharat Ratna: Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday in the Delhi assembly said that doctors across the country should collectively be awarded the Bharat Ratna — the highest civilian award in India — this year for their service to the people of the country during the Covid-19 pandemic.The assembly on Friday, in the second and last day of the Monsoon session, unanimously passed a resolution that said the Delhi government will this year nominate only doctors and paramedic staff in the Capital for the Padma awards. To this effect, Kejriwal also said the Delhi government has so far received 2,100 nominations from the public, three days after it launched an e-mail address for residents to send their recommendations for the awards.“It is our responsibility to deliver a message of respect to doctors, paramedics and health care workers for the service they have rendered during the Covid-19 pandemic. We arranged five-star hotels for doctors. I think, we were the first such government. In Delhi, we decided that all orders regarding Covid-19 management would be issued after due consultation with doctors and the medical fraternity. So, none of our orders faced any protest. We got full cooperation,” said Kejriwal in his speech at the assembly on Friday.“Every year, the central government invites nominations from states for Padma awards. We have decided to recommend names of only doctors and paramedic staff… We have received 2,100 nominations from general public in three days of launching an email address for taking public opinion. Doctor can nominate themselves too. This house also recommends that doctors from across the country should collectively be awarded the Bharat Ratna as a community.”On July 5, Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to consider awarding the Bharat Ratna collectively to the doctors’ community in India. On July 27, he announced that the Delhi government will nominate only doctors and health care workers this year for the country’s second, third and fourth highest civilian awards — Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan — to honour their contribution in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.Friday’s motion on Bharat Ratna and Padma Awards for the medical fraternity was proposed in the Assembly by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj. He said: “Delhi would not have survived its worst of peaks only because of doctors and health care workers… The risk that doctors have taken in Delhi is unimaginable.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, who is also the leader of the opposition in the assembly, said, “We support the proposal by Mr Bharadwaj. But we request CM Arvind Kejriwal to make the list more inclusive. Safai karamcharis (sanitation workers) were entrusted with disposal of waste from residences of Covid-19 patients in home isolation. And many such workers died of Covid-19. We request that we should think of the safai karmcharis too when we talk about doctors and paramedics. Similarly, there are lift operators, teachers, police officers who were deployed on Covid-19 duty. All of them should be included in the Padma awards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/doctors-should-be-given-bharat-ratna-kejriwal-101627669631923.html
31-07-2021||Delhi||An academic year like no other comes to an end||From being unable to attend school in person for most of the year to having to rely on online learning — an exercise that brought to the fore a glaring digital divide among students — the class of 2020-21 has been unlike any other till date. There were other novelties too. The academic session went on for 16 months — from end-March 2020 to end-July 2021— on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the batch became the first to graduate without appearing for the Board exams, which were cancelled also on account of the pandemic.The year, in short, was challenging not just for teachers and students but also for education officials, including Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) employees and school principals, who had to evolve and adapt to the “new normal”.Principals and teachers across several schools said that the entire academic year was rife with uncertainties over the conduct of exams and the online teaching-learning process.Mena Mittle, vice-principal of Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, said, “Teachers had to extend constant support to students during the year; there was so much uncertainty over the cancellation of exams and even the exam pattern. The pandemic also heaped a lot of stress on students for whom the future appeared quite uncertain. They were unable to interact with their peers or teachers in their final year of school.”Due to the revised assessment policy devised by the board, in the absence of board examinations, schools had their work cut out for them while tabulating scores as they had to feed in marks of students while keeping the moderation policy in mind.Before the pandemic, the board was responsible for tabulating results through head examiners and nodal centres.“While the portal (developed by CBSE to upload marks) calculated the weightage of marks accordingly, schools had to feed in marks and ensure that the moderation system was implemented. The high pass percentage this year is also because around 60% weightage was given to class 10 and 11 scores of students,” Mittle said.Deepa Chugh, a class 12 coordinator at The Indian School, who teaches political science, said teachers too struggled with the changes but managed to learn new ways of teaching in the process. “Connecting with students was difficult in the past year because not all could get their cameras on during online classes. Face-to-face interactions help us assess whether a student is understanding concepts or not, and structure our classes accordingly.”However, Chugh noted that students who could have scored a perfect 100 in a written exam were unable to do so this time. “We couldn’t give them 100 because of the Class 10 results which was already calculated by CBSE and put on the website. CBSE did not allow us to increase their marks to 100. We could do a maximum moderation of only one or two marks,” she said.The Class 12 theory papers were initially slated to begin in May and end by June 14 but due to the second wave of Covid-19, the board cancelled class 10 and 12 exams, surrendering to growing demands from parents and other stakeholders.On June 17, the board announced a revised assessment scheme devised by a 13-member committee which gave 30% weightage each to scores from classes 10 and 11, and 40% weightage to class 12 internal tests, including unit test, mid-terms and pre-boards.The board also formulated a strict moderation policy and a results committee monitored the process to ensure standardisation of process across schools, and no inflation of marks by schools.CBSE officials conducted several webinars with school officials to explain the moderation policy in detail and reduce any errors. The board also created a portal for schools to fill in the scores of students, and it would automatically adjust the final scores as per the norms.Dr Sanyam Bhardwaj, controller of examinations, CBSE, said that the comprehensive result compilation and tabulation system built by the board not only helped schools in verifying the Class 10 information but also in uploading the class 11 and 12 scores. “The system guided schools for moderation at every step, so that schools do not commit an error and are aware of the permissible moderation limit,” stated Bhardwaj.In the absence of board exams and admit cards, the education board also devised another portal for students to fill in their details and obtain a roll number to check their results this year.Kunal Singh, 18, a student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Nand Nagri, who scored an aggregate of 91%, said he was happy with the result. “Studying remotely for an entire year is not easy. From network issues to problems with audio and video quality, there were several disruptions. Despite these obstacles, we gave our best,” said Singh, who plans to pursue his graduation in computer science.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/an-academic-year-like-no-other-comes-to-an-end-101627669152039.html
31-07-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath orders transport dept to act against overloaded inter-state buses in Uttar Pradesh||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday asked the transport department to check the operation of unauthorised and ramshackle inter-state buses. He also asked them to take stern action in all such instances where these buses were overloaded.The chief minister said that it had come to notice that many unauthorised buses were being operated inter-state and they were ramshackle and overloaded.“The transport department must stop the operation of such buses. Check their permits and documents and go tough on overloading,” he said at a Covid-19 review meeting in Lucknow.Two days ago, in the early hours of Wednesday (July 28), 18 people died and 30 others were injured when a truck rammed into an overloaded bus which had broken down near Ram Sanehi Ghat in Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh. The bus was on its way from Palwal (Haryana) to Bihar with labourers returning home. There were about 140 labourers on the bus. Many of them were resting near or under the bus at the time of the accident. A majority of the victims were crushed in their sleep.No active Covid-19 case in nine districtsThe chief minister also said the state now had 729 active Covid-19 cases and there were nine districts without any active case.“Today, as many as nine districts in the state have no Covid active case. The total active cases in the state are 729. The Covid-19 situation is somewhat similar to the one in the initial days of the pandemic in the state last year. Aligarh, Amroha, Basti, Etah, Hathras, Kasganj, Kaushambi, Mahoba and Shravasti are the districts without any active case. None of the UP districts has reported fresh cases in double digits, while 20 reported fresh cases in single digit,” Yogi said.He said 2.44 lakh Covid-19 tests were done in the past 24 hours across the state and only 42 tested positive for Covid while 91 patients recovered.The 24-hour positivity rate in the state was 0.01% and the recovery rate 98.6%, he said.None tests positive after contact tracing in KanpurThe chief minister also referred to the state government’s intensive contact tracing of 22 Covid-19 cases that surfaced in Kanpur on Wednesday.Yogi said a total of 1,400 contacts were traced and tested. None of them tested positive, he said.He also said the vaccination drive was going on smoothly. So far, the state has administered a total of 4.67 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines, he said.Yogi asks DMs to keep an eye on ambulance servicesThe chief minister also mentioned the ambulance services (the staff of the 102 and 108 ambulance services are on strike currently). He said all the patients who seek an ambulance must get one as per need. Under no circumstances, the patients or their kin must face any harassment or hardship, he said.The district magistrates should keep an eye on the operation of ambulance services, he said. He reiterated: “In case of any unfortunate incident of death of any patient because of an ambulance not being provided, then those responsible are sure to face the strictest of action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-orders-action-against-overloaded-inter-state-buses-in-uttar-pradesh-101627667111999.html

Maha-Metro believes that commercial operations will begin from November this year and took a major step in that direction with the trail run of the Pune Metro between Vanaz and Ideal colony in Kothrud on Friday morning. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar flagged off the run in the presence of Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol (BJP) and Shiv Sena’s Neelam Gorhe.Maha-Metro’s managing director Brijesh Dixit said, “We are planning to start commercial operations by November this year on priority sections. Vanaz to Garware stretch is 75 per cent complete and PCMC to Kasarwadi is ready. The commercial operations would happen on these two sections.”Three metro coaches made the trial run on Friday and over the next few days, further technical drives will be made.Speaking at the test run Ajit Pawar said, “Considering Covid-19, we took held this trial run early in the morning to avoid crowds. Pune Metro has been completed in record speed and will serve citizens soon. It will be one more attraction in the city.”Pune Mayor Mohol said, “A dream has come true as the Metro runs in the city.”With the BJP in power at the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the plan is to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the inauguration, which the BJP hopes to have before the municipal elections later in the year.Not to be left out of the euphoria, the Congress also issued a statement on Friday, saying, “The metro was approved in our tenure.

The report states that the number of dengue, malaria and chikungunya cases fell drastically compared to the previous year. Experts believe that the welcome figure could probably be because of the increased attention to hygiene or under-reporting of cases. As per the report, the number of dengue cases fell from 183 patients in 2020 to 31 in 2021, malaria cases dropped from 6 to just one and chikungunya cases dropped from 74 to 11 as of March 2021. The PMC health department said that they have not reported a single case of swine flu this year. All these diseases are spread via mosquitoes. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer said, “The number of these monsoon-related ailments has fallen sharply, and no swine flu cases has been reported till date this year. This could be because people are more conscience about hygiene and health during Covid times.” Dr Sanjay Dabhade, public health expert who runs an NGO Jan Aarogya Manch, which works in the field of public health said, “Concrete evidence is needed to prove co-relation between Covid and these other epidemic causing diseases. There could be broader reasons for this fall, including under-reporting of cases or even that people are not reporting these flu-like symptoms fearing isolation or hospitalisations due to covid and are resorting to self-medication or are not seeking medical advice.”  PMC sees fewer cases of mosquito-related infections in 2020-21 as compared to the previous year Disease/2019/2020/2021 Chikungunya/741/74/11 Malaria/0/6/1 Dengue/1407/183/31 *Source: PMC environment report||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-sees-sharp-fall-in-mosquito-related-infections-in-2020-21-than-previous-year-101627654210303.html
