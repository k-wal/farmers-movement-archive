Out of these 16 samples, 10 were of those residing in Agra.. The remaining samples were of two people from Hathras, two from Firozabad, one from Mainpuri and one from Saharanpur. “Viral Diagnostic and Research Lab (VDRL), Microbiology Department of SN Medical College, Agra had sent 40 samples on June 5 and 20 samples on June 26 to the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi for genome sequencing,” informed Dr Aarti Agarwal, head of Microbiology Department and nodal officer for VDRL at SN Medical College here. “We have now received the results of the 40 samples and Delta variant has been confirmed in 16 of them . Out of these,, 10 samples are from Agra, and the remaining six from Hathras, Firozabad, Mainpuri and Saharanpur. All these patients werebeing treated at the Covid Hospital of SN Medical College here,” she said. “”Eight variants of Covid-19 are declared ‘Variant of Interest’ by the World Health Organisation and include Eta, Lota, Kappa, Lambda, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta (or Delta Plus),” said Dr Agarwal. “However, there was no confirmation of Delta Plus variant in any of the samples which is good news because Delta Plus variant has high transmissibility and causes higher death rate,,” she said.. “To protect oneself, one should wear mask and observe social distancing. More and more people should be vaccinated by increasing the pace of vaccination. One should go to public places only if very necessary,,” cautioned the microbiologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delta-variant-found-in-16-covid-samples-from-agra-101625940694621.html

The UP Cinema Exhibitors’ Federation, the body of all the multiplexes and single screens across the state that has also met chief minister Yogi Adityanath in the context of their demands, said that in the recent lockdown, cinema hall owners suffered losses of around ₹1500 crore. “There is no business at all. If we talk about the recent lockdown that was more than 70-day-long, we suffered losses of more than ₹1500 crores. Also, there is no business in the market since there are so many restrictions, including weekly lockdown, late evening curfew and 50 per cent gathering cap. All these factors are making business a no-profit affair,” said Ashish Agarwal, president of the federation. Agarwal said there was also no relief from the government in terms of taxes. “Be it water tax, house tax or the fixed electricity charges, we are being charged for everything even if there is complete lockdown or no business. We had also met the UP CM in this regard who assured all possible help, but no help has reached us so far,” he added. On the re-opening of the multiplexes and single screens, he said the closure was for an indefinite period, until things get streamlined. “As of now, things are not in our favour. Hence it has been decided that the multiplexes and single screens would remain closed,” he said. The UP Government had ordered reopening of multiplexes and single screen halls from July 5 onwards. However, they remained closed. The owners cited weekend lockdown and late evening curfew behind the prolonged closure. The closure of single screen halls and multiplexes was initiated on May 1, 2021 in the wake of the second Covid-19 wave. In 2020, the closure of multiplexes was initiated on March 15, in the first corona wave and was lifted on October 15, allowing them to open but with 50 per cent gathering. The government eventually allowed the multiplexes and cinema theatres to operate with full capacity on December 16, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cinema-theatre-multiplex-owners-seek-relief-in-taxes-101625940514636.html

10-07-2021||Mumbai||Medical tourism in Mumbai improving, but foreign patients still face hurdles||With the flattening of the Covid-19 pandemic curve, medical tourism in Mumbai, considered the medical hub of India, is slowly recovering. However, international patients are still facing hurdles to reach the city for life-saving surgeries due to the coronavirus restrictions across the globe.Ousmane Komi, 54-year-old, a resident of Ivory Coast, with 15% heart-pumping capacity, landed in Mumbai on May 27. But the journey was a nightmare for the patient and his family members, who had to spend three days at the airports in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Dubai, due to continuous cancellations and delays of their flights, owing to Covid-19 restrictions.“It took me three days to reach Mumbai as there was a lot of uncertainty about flights. Either the flights would get cancelled or delayed, while I was at the airport. The flight uncertainties were like life-and-death situations for me as every minute, my health was deteriorating. I had breathlessness and limb swelling and the chest showed bilateral significant pleural effusion (water on lungs),” he said.If that wasn’t enough, when he landed in Mumbai, his Covid-19 report turned out positive. He believes because of his underlying health issues, he contracted the infection during his long halts at the crowded airports. Due to his complicated health issues, he was immediately referred to Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai Central for his treatment.His treating doctor, Dr Ravi Gupta, consultant cardiologist from the hospital, said that he was diagnosed with severely decreased heart pumping ( LVEF 15%), while the normal pumping is 60%. He was managed in Covid-19 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and his heart check-ups showed 100% old and hard blockages in two out of three of his heart arteries. He was very breathless even at rest and used to develop fluid collection in his lungs repeatedly due to severe heart failure. The fluid was drained out multiple times.“We had to perform two angioplasty procedures, which were extremely risky ,as his heart pumping rate was extremely low and his blood pressure was also low. However, his heart rate improved to 30%,” said Dr Gupta.With well-connected international airports and skilled medical staffers at super-speciality hospitals, the city receives hundreds of foreign patients every year.According to the FICCI – E&Y Report – “India: Building Best Practices in Healthcare Services Globally” released in 2019 on medical tourism, it is stated that almost 27% of medical tourists are recorded in Maharashtra.However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the footfall of international patients has fallen by 60% in the second wave. In April, when the city was witnessing the peak of the second, medical tourism almost came to a standstill.“Due to the Covid-19, several international patients have put their surgeries on hold to avoid travelling in the pandemic,” said Dr Santosh Shetty, executive director at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital. In the past two months, the hospital has received about 50 international patients, most of whom have come from Uganda, Tanzania, Oman, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Kenya, Oman, USA, UK and Canada.Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital in Powai has registered 11 foreign patients, mostly from Germany, UK, USA, South Korea, Belgium, Japan since May. They have 21 international patients from the Middle East and Africa who are waiting for their final approval to fly.Talking about the hurdles international passengers are facing, Dr Sujit Chatterjee, chief executive officer (CEO) from the hospital, said, “There are several factors involved in the drop in medical tourism. Travel and visa restrictions are the main hurdles. Medical visas are issued only for elective and emergency cases only.”Due to these restrictions, the hospitals often have to intervene to help in bringing the patients to the city as their medical visas are denied. In April, 2021, Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital had to coordinate with international embassies in China, Cameroon and Nigeria to bring a severely burnt patient to the city for treatment.Peter Esomba, a Cameroon-based resident, sustained 50% deep burn injuries on his face and 80% on his scalp in a blast at a cocoa factory. However, due to incessant local civil wars and scarce medical services, Peter couldn’t access quality healthcare for over five months. Later, he approached the hospital for his plastic surgery. However, loss of facial identification marks through extensive facial burns and scarring meant Peter failed to procure his passport. Then the hospital intervened to expedite his passport generation.Peter’s second roadblock was to procure a medical visa for India. Commonly, Cameroon residents approach the Indian embassy in Nigeria for travel or medical Indian visa. The border between Cameroon and Nigeria was shut owing to the pandemic and Peter couldn’t travel to complete visa formalities. “We appealed to the Hon’ble Indian High Commissioner in Cameroon and requested his support on compassionate grounds to bring him to the hospital for his essential treatment,” Dr Parag Vibhakar, consultant plastic and cosmetic surgeon from the hospital.It took them almost a month of struggle through documentation to reach Mumbai in May.The doctors managed his facial wounds through skin grafting. Then they treated his skull wounds and restructured the left eye and lips. In following visits of the patient, the team will perform complicated procedures such as corneal transplant and improve the nasal structure through skin grafting.“After long spells of hardship, I reached the hospital. For my other surgeries, I would have to fly again. But I am hopeful that I will be able to fight against the hurdles again,” Esomba said.The return flight of Komi, which was scheduled on June 25, has been cancelled. Now, he has booked his new tickets for July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/medical-tourism-in-mumbai-improving-but-foreign-patients-still-face-hurdles-101625938894642.html
10-07-2021||Mumbai||Ambiguity in rules may lead to delay in undergraduate admissions, fear colleges||Even though the confusion surrounding the Class 12 results were recently cleared by respective school education boards, the students still have little or no clarity on admissions to first-year undergraduate (UG) courses. While admissions to undergraduate professional courses depend on entrance exams conducted by the state and national exam authorities, admissions to UG courses in degree colleges depend solely on Class 12 marks, which are yet to be announced by most education boards.“To bring parity during admissions, the state has announced that admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC) will be based on a common entrance test (CET) and not just the Class 10 marks. Class 12 marks are also being derived based on a formula, however, degree colleges are still unclear about admission rules. Will we be considering only the Class 12 marks, or will colleges hold entrance exams as well?” asked Anju Kapoor, principal of UPG College, Vile Parle.Last year, admissions to UG first-year courses started in September and their academic year commenced in the last week of October.Admissions to undergraduate professional courses like medical, engineering, pharmacy, architecture and law are conducted based on an entrance exam, most of which are scheduled to take place in August this year. Admissions to UG degree courses, however, for years have been based on the Class 12 scores only. This year, since the Class 12 scores will be based on students’ performance in the last three academic years, many fear students might demand a chance to appear for written examinations to better their scores.In a public event held in Nagpur on Friday, the state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant said that admission criteria for Class 12 students aiming for non-technical courses will only be decided after the announcement of Class 12 results. “The decision to conduct an entrance exam or conduct admissions based on Class 12 marks will be taken only once the results are announced,” said Samant. Students, however, are unsure that results for Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exams will be announced anytime soon.Several college principals share the fear that with no clear admission policy in place at present, the delay will directly reflect on first-year students’ academic year. “In July we still don’t know what degree college admissions will be based on. If we go by the state government’s word, Class 12 results should be announced by July 31, following which, the government plans to announce admission criteria. This means the first year UG students will not make it to their classrooms before the first week of October,” said the principal of a college in central Mumbai. He added that once again this delay will have to be a burden shared by students and teachers who will have to work extra hours to ensure that the entire year’s portion is completed in half the time allotted for the same.This year, Covid-19 pushed all education boards to rethink their decision of conducting board exams at a time when the country was grappling with a deadly second wave. Scrapping of exams and grading students on a formula giving weightage to students’ performance of past three years was unanimously accepted. The approved mechanism for Maharashtra state board and CBSE Class 12 students includes a 30:30:40 formula, which gives equal weightage of 30% each to results of Class 10 and 11 and 40% weightage to a student’s overall performance in Class 12. In the case of CISCE, the formula will take into consideration the Class 10 ICSE board exam results, project and practical work in subjects, and best marks obtained in school exams in Class 11 and 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ambiguity-in-rules-may-lead-to-delay-in-undergraduate-admissions-fear-colleges-101625938895253.html
10-07-2021||Patna||‘In 2019 there was discussion, in 2021 decision was made’: Lalan Singh on JD(U) joining cabinet||Internal rumblings have hit the Janata Dal (United) post-cabinet expansion at the Centre. After the JD(U) accepted to join the Union cabinet with party national president RCP Singh being sworn in as a cabinet minister, the voice of dissent has started to emerge even though senior leaders deny that there is no dispute over the choice of minister. Party MP from Munger, Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, one of the close friends of chief minister Nitish Kumar, finally broke the silence on Saturday and said that the decision to join the Union cabinet was that of RCP Singh. “In 2019, there was a discussion inside the party and this time the decision was taken. In the year 2019, Nitish Kumar was the national president of the JD(U) and the proposal that came at that time was not accepted by the party. Then the decision was taken by Nitish Kumar after discussion with all the party leaders. In 2021, the party’s national president is not Nitish Kumar but RCP Singh. RCP Singh was authorized by Nitish Kumar and the party to decide on joining the Union cabinet. RCP Singh decided on the proposal that came to him,” said Singh on Saturday while talking to media persons. Lalan Singh was one of the front runners for the post of minister in the Union cabinet. People in the party privy to the development said that in 2019 also, when one post was offered to the JD(U), RCP Singh’s name was doing the rounds. But, the party wanted Lalan Singh’s name as well. When asked whether it was discussed this time, the Munger MP said that he did not know. “We definitely heard that the party is joining the Union cabinet,” he said. He, however, added that nobody is angry with anybody joining the cabinet. Party leaders accept that uneasy calm has crept in the party “but it all will settle down.” People aware of the situation have hinted that there could be a change of guard as far as the position of JD(U) national president is concerned, which is currently held by RCP Singh. According to the people mentioned above, Upendra Kushwaha may be the contender for the president of the JD(U). Lalan Singh held a closed-door meeting with party MLC Upendra Kushwaha two days back while Kushwaha embarked on Bihar yatra of different districts from Valmiki Nagar on Saturday, hinting at a likely change at the top. If party sources are to be believed, chief Nitish Kumar has directed the colleagues of all the districts to fully support Upendra Kushwaha during the yatra so that the JD(U) can be made the number one party of Bihar again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/in-2019-there-was-discussion-in-2021-decision-was-made-lalan-singh-on-jd-u-joining-cabinet-101625938835186.html

The overall price of the machines is over ₹2.30 lakh, which have been donated by the doctor from Israel. Along with this, the donor has provided test tubes and other apparatus for the next month, which would have cost another ₹50,000. The money was donated directly to the vendor.The centre outsources the testing through a private laboratory—-Thyrocare but the samples are last collected till 7pm. At night, the samples are being sent to Dr RN Cooper Hospital, Juhu for emergency patients which is a time-consuming affair.“A few philanthropists approached us through a national party which wanted to donate food and provide other facilities. But I wanted to set up a laboratory, hence, they contacted the doctor who readily agreed to help us with the request to keep his identity hidden,” said Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of the NESCO jumbo centre.These tests help to decide the line of treatment in emergency Covid-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU).Another donor has promised to donate a cell counter machine that helps in white blood cells, clotting time among others. The machine costs around ₹1.5 lakh.Along with this, the centre has procured a CT scan machine through a public-private partnership model which will be available next to the ICU. The patients scanned at the centre with the BMC’s price rate which is ₹1,200. “Till now, we have been sending patients to Cooper Hospital. We are given a time slot between 5pm-7pm to test from the centre. But transporting the patient is an issue. So, the reports are given only to the family members,” she added.Now, the centre has a CT Scan and an in-house emergency pathology laboratory, the centre has 10 dialysis machines, a USG facility, portable chest x-ray machines, ECG machines, ventilators, dura cells, oxygen pipeline supply, liquid medical oxygen tanks, oxygen concentrators.“We have all the required speciality facilities which would help us a lot if we have to face thied third wave. We are completely prepared for it. Also, we are adding more beds,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/indian-doctor-from-israel-donates-machines-to-set-up-pathology-lab-at-mumbai-s-nesco-centre-101625938774557.html
10-07-2021||Mumbai||Dry spell in Mumbai: BMC in a watch mode as water levels in lakes freeze to 18%||In the past 10 days, there has not been a significant increase in the water levels at seven lakes supplying drinking water to the city.According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s data, the water level is 18% in the seven lakes that will be sufficient for the next 70 days. However, this is less than the last two years. At this time, the city had around 80 days of water stock in 2020 and 100 days in 2019. The lake levels have not gone up significantly owing to less rainfall in July.According to BMC’s data, Vihar Lake that is located inside Mumbai was over 61% full followed by another lake inside the city- Tulsi Lake was 74% full. Last year at this time, both Tulsi and Vihar had a mere 67% and 41% of water level.Further, Bhatsa, which supplies 55% of the total annual water requirement, the water level is 18 down from 22% last year at this time. In Tansa, the water level is 30%, which was 20% last year at this time followed by Modak Sagar having 31% of the water stock that was 33% last year at this time. In the case of Upper Vaitarna, the water level is 0%, as of Tuesday. Last year at this time too, there was no water left in the Upper Vaitarna dam. Lastly, Middle Vaitarna has 11% of water stock that was 18% last year at this time.On the other hand, Powai Lake that supplies water to the civic body for non-potable purposes overflowed on June 12 this year. Last year, Powai lake was full on July 5. The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems, the Vaitarna system supplies to the western suburbs and the island city, and the Bhatsa system supplies to the eastern suburbs. The lakes are situated in Mumbai as well as neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts.The civic body supplies 3,850 million litres of water daily against the city’s demand for 4,200 million litres. To meet the shortfall, the BMC has been exploring several ways to increase the water supply to the city. Two weeks ago, the BMC signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the BMC and an Israel-based firm for the city’s first desalination project at Manori in Malad. Under this project, BMC plans to turn seawater into drinking water, and the pilot project is expected to be ready by 2025.On the lake levels, a BMC official from the hydraulics department said, “We are yet to get the rainfall for the month of July. Hence, any decision on water cuts will now depend on how much rainfall we will get in the month of July. However, the forecast of rainfall for this year is good, and a decision will be taken in the coming days based on how the rainfall patterns are there in the month of July.”Meanwhile, the city had experienced a 20% water cut last year in August 2020 amid the covid outbreak owing to the low level of water storage in the lakes. BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal had also prepared a backup plan to bring water to Mumbai from Bhandardara dam in Ahmednagar if required. Before 2020, no water cut was imposed in 2019, owing to good rainfall in catchment areas. But BMC had imposed a 10% water cut in 2018, a 20% cut in 2016 and a 25% cut in 2014.Box:Upper VaitarnaJuly 09, 2021: 592.61July 09, 2020: 594.67Middle VaitarnaJuly 09, 2021: 240.28July 09, 2020: 248.77Modak SagarJuly 09, 2021: 150.98July 09, 2020: 151.44BhatsaJuly 09, 2020: 114.44July 09, 2020: 116.50TulsiJuly 09, 2021: 137.59July 09, 202: 137.09VeharJuly 09, 2021: 78.05July 09, 2020: 76.81TansaJune 09, 2021: 122.56June 09, 2020: 121.41Water storage capacity: 1,447,363 million litresLivestock on July 09, 2021: 261,644 million litresLivestock on June 09, 2020: 289,157 million litresLivestock on July 09, 2019: 417,943 million litresBMC daily supplies: 3,850 million litres drinking water against demand of over 4,000 million litres||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dry-spell-in-mumbai-bmc-in-a-watch-mode-as-water-levels-in-lakes-freeze-to-18-101625938654608.html
10-07-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination drive at 300 centres to resume from Monday in Mumbai||After a gap of three days, Covid vaccination will resume at over 300 civic and state government-run centres from Monday. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday received over 85,000 doses of Covidshield and around 8,000 doses of Covaxin. The BMC has also written to pharmaceutical company Zydus Cadila for conducting its vaccine trials on 50 children between the age group of 12 to 18 years.The vaccination drive at over 300 centres was suspended since Friday owing to a shortage of doses. Earlier, the drive was suspended on July 1 due to the same reason. However, the drive will resume from Monday. According to BMC officials, the stock that it has received will last for around two days. There are a total of 401 vaccination centres in the city, of which, 98 are private vaccination centres where the drive is being conducted without any disruption.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “We have got a fresh stock of around 85,000 Covishield and 8,000 Covaxin doses. This will last for around two days and further Wednesday onwards; the drive will be dependent on the stock we get. However, we have been informed that we will get a good number of doses in the coming days.”Kakani added, “We have also written to Zydus to provide us with their vaccine to conduct a trial on 50 children between the age of 12 and 18 years. We have intimated and are awaiting their reply on the same.” Earlier, the BMC had also written to the Central government showing its interest to conduct trials of Covaxin on children between the age group of 12 and 18 years. However, there was no further communication on the same from the Centre.Further, from Monday onwards, vaccination will be undertaken in the same formula wherein 50% slots will be reserved for walk-ins and the rest will be via online booking.On Saturday, 48,393 citizens were vaccinated at private hospitals. Overall, six million citizens have been vaccinated in the city since January 16. As of Saturday, 6,009,025 citizens have been vaccinated in the city with at least one dose. A total of 1,273,484 citizens are fully vaccinated with both doses in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-drive-at-300-centres-to-resume-from-monday-in-mumbai-101625938594662.html

10-07-2021||Other||First pandemic, now lack of coaches play spoilsport for sportspersons in UP’s Prayagraj||It has been a double whammy for local budding sportspersons as for the last year-and-a-half they were deprived of training because of the Covid-induced lockdowns and now it is the lack of coaches that is further affecting their practice. Although sports courts and grounds in the state have opened from July 5 and players have also started arriving but lack of coaches has raised many a concern among the sporting fraternity. The condition can be gauged from the fact that at Madan Mohan Malviya stadium there is just one coach who imparts training for athletics while the remaining sports have no coaches as of now. Similar is the condition at Amitabh Bachchan Sports Complex where there are no coaches for many sports. Officials said most of the coaches posted at Madan Mohan Malviya stadium and Amitabh Bachchan Sports Complex were on ad-hoc basis and their services were terminated in March last year after the first lockdown. Since then, there have been no appointments, officials said. The problem has further increased as the appointments of trainers have to be made through the GeM (Government e-Market Place) portal. Many trainers have openly opposed the process and the matter is pending in the courts, they added. The trainers, who are ready to work through GeM portal, are being posted in other districts. Satyendra Singh, who has been working in Madan Mohan Malviya stadium for years, has been posted to Varanasi and cricket coach Kaushik Pal has been sent to Kaushambi. As a result there are no coaches for cricket, hockey, football, badminton, kabaddi, weightlifting, judo, taekwondo, volleyball, handball, boxing, kho-kho, wrestling, squash and gymnastics in these two sports facilities in the district. Sportspersons claim that against two dozen coaches that were working earlier at these two facilities, now there are merely four including one for athletcis at MMM Stadium and three-- one each for volleyball, basketball and softball-- at Amitabh Bachchan Sports Complex. “Absence of a coach is a major drawback as then you don’t have anyone to guide and help improve your game. A coach is very much needed,” said Ragini, a young badminton player.

The decision to form the ‘indigenous faiths and culture’ department was taken at a special cabinet meeting held to mark the completion of two months of the new government and ahead of next week’s budget session of the assembly. “Our indigenous populations have their own language, culture and religious beliefs but due to lack of official help from the government, several of these groups were economically weak,” chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said at a press conference in Guwahati. “This new department will work to protect and preserve their unique cultures, languages and beliefs. Since it’s a new department and will require a lot of work, the cabinet has requested the finance minister to allot a substantial sum in the next budget for it,” he added. There are eight major scheduled tribes in Assam but there are many other smaller groups and sub-groups. A proposal to grant ST status to 6 more communities in the state is pending with the Centre. Sarma informed that the new department would work independently and focus specifically on issues relating to the faith, language and culture of the indigenous communities.Development work and other schemes meant for these communities will be handled by other existing departments. Saturday’s cabinet meeting also took decisions in key financial and administrative reforms changing the existing long-winded process of sanctioning schemes and allocation of funds routed through different departments. “From now, the decision on all schemes of up to ₹2 crore will be approved by a departmental committee headed by the commissioner of each department and based on approval of the minister these works will be executed,” said Sarma. Works between ₹2-5 crore will be decided by a committee headed by the chief secretary, projects between ₹5-100 crore will be decided upon by the finance minister and schemes above ₹100 crore will be approved by the state cabinet, the CM informed. “This change is being incorporated to end so-called red-tape and bureaucratic hurdles in sanctioning of projects and their funding. This will reduce the time taken in the movement of files from one department to another, for approval and officers will be able to give more time in monitoring schemes,” said Sarma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-approves-formation-of-dept-to-protect-preserve-indigenous-faiths-and-culture-101625935896029.html

However, there were also reports of widespread violence during the polling process, which took place from 11am to 3pm.“Almost 85% seats went in favour of the BJP. The victory was due to the guidance and inspiration from prime minister Narendra Modi, as work was done without any discrimination for all sections of the society. People’s inclination was towards us, and I’m happy to say that the party’s strategy has yielded results,” Adityanath said in a press conference held at the state BJP headquarters in Capital Lucknow.The chief minister also lauded the state election commission for “peaceful and fair” polls. “Conducting such a massive election process peacefully, in a state full of professional criminals and mafia, and where democracy was mortgaged on the basis of caste, religion and sect, is praiseworthy,” Adityanath told media persons.Meanwhile, PM Modi took to Twitter to congratulate the chief minister and the UP BJP. “The Uttar Pradesh BJP has been victorious in elections for the posts of block panchayat chiefs as well. This big victory is a reflection of the benefits people have received due to the policies of the Yogi Adityanath government, as well as its pro-poor schemes. All workers of the party deserve to be congratulated for this victory,” a rough translation of Prime Minister Modi’s tweet, posted in Hindi, read.उत्तर प्रदेश में ब्लॉक प्रमुखों के चुनाव में भी @BJP4UP ने अपना परचम लहराया है। @myogiadityanath सरकार की नीतियों और जनहित की योजनाओं से जनता को जो लाभ मिला है, वो पार्टी की भारी जीत में परिलक्षित हुआ है। इस विजय के लिए पार्टी के सभी कार्यकर्ता बधाई के पात्र हैं। https://t.co/QZP6u1kjVTSaturday’s polling was held for 476 seats as 349 candidates were declared elected “unopposed” on Friday.Uttar Pradesh is likely to go to polls in early 2022 as the Adityanath-led BJP government looks to secure a second consecutive five-year term in office.

10-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi Opens Up: Gen Z welcomes back office life!||For those who missed working from office, there was a ray of hope, when the Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, announced some relaxations to unlock after Covid-19 induced restrictions. In a virtual press conference he said, that both government and private offices can open in the city, with conditions. For many working professionals, this move has brought in relief. Feeling happy about working from office, Mohit Tomar, a digital marketing professional says, “I am glad to be back in office. Atleast the time after work is solely mine.” As working from home came with a set of challenges. “First of all, there is no time schedule. Colleagues or managers would call you anytime, you can’t even say anything, because where else could you possibly be busy. Then there’s family disturbing, wi-fi issues –which are often perceived as excuses. There was no escape,” he says.Many GenZ working professionals agree with having work and personal timings blurring owing to the work from home. Like Udit Guleria, a Gurugram based IT professional who is ecstatic at the thought of going back to office, feels, “The lack of schedule has people working for long hours. We think we are working on our own time, but as a result, working hours are being dragged more than usual. Work used to fun at the office, but at home, it has become very mundane.” Working from office comes with other perks and advantages that were totally missing while working from home. From team meetings to taking a break, everything was different at home. Vivek Prashar, a sales and marketing professional, feels, “Sharing a cup of coffee or interacting during lunch, can go a long way in building concrete relationships at work. Face-to-face communication is still the most effective and preferred method among employees. Many believe that a video con-call is not as effective as a round table conference. Working from office also opens up immense opportunities for networking,” he shares.Similarly, travelling to work every day also brings a lot of inspiration and keep you following routine, feels, creative head for an event company, Anil Sharma. He says, “Creativity cannot be contained in four walls. It is difficult to feel inspired working from home. While working from office, you meet other people, you travel to work every day, and you see things other than your own home. That instils some kind of motivation that can’t be compared to working from home.”For many working from home has been tough. However, some had adjusted to it pretty well, take for example, Sameer Saroha, a food technologist who is working from office but feels that work from home is a blessing in disguise. “While working from home you have time at your disposal, you get the luxury to design your day, while adhering to deadlines. Not only that, you also save so much time and money that otherwise goes in travelling and other expenses,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-opens-up-gen-z-welcomes-back-office-life-101625934455971.html
10-07-2021||Kolkata||Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh called to Delhi to discuss organisational issues||The Bharatiya Janata Party’S West Bengal chief Dilip Ghosh is likely to meet the party’s National president JP Nadda in New Delhi on Sunday to discuss a range of issues, a party leader said. A senior BJP leader said that while the party is thinking of imposing some kind of penalty on those who have been openly criticising the party and its leaders after the assembly elections, there could also be some structural changes in the coming days. “All these issues, including how to boost the morale of party workers who are bearing the direct brunt of post-poll violence, could be discussed in the meeting,” said a senior leader.Asked whether the party is going to impose any penalty against leaders who have spoken against the BJP, Ghosh said that the issues were being discussed. “The issues were being discussed. The decision would be taken by the party’s policymakers,” he told the media. While the party’s national vice president, Mukul Roy, has already sided with the Trinamool Congress, a section of leaders has openly criticised the party and its state leaders. A few others, who had abandoned the TMC to join the BJP ahead of the 2021 assembly polls have expressed their intention to return to the TMC. “Sometimes, a bark of one tree can be fixed on another tree. We had done some experiments. They didn’t work. Those who joined the BJP know its ideologies. The problem crops up when someone thinks that he is above the party,” said Ghosh. The TMC, however, took a jibe at the BJP saying that good sense prevailed even though it was late. “It is good that they have understood and accepted that their experiment with barks has failed. They tried to nurture one tree with the bark of another tree. But instead of growing, the tree became shorter. They have lost seats compared to 2019,” said Firhad Hakim, state minister. In the recent Union cabinet reshuffle while four BJP MPs were inducted into the cabinet as ministers of state, two erstwhile ministers in the cabinet, Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri, had to bow out. “The party may also give them and some other leaders some responsibilities in the state unit and to strengthen the party,” said another BJP leader. While elections in more than 100 civic bodies are pending, panchayat elections are also scheduled in 2023. Even though the BJP had set a target to win more than 200 seats in the recently held assembly elections and form the government in West Bengal, the TMC returned to power with a sweeping victory winning 213 out of the 292 seats where elections were held. The BJP could manage only 77 seats. “Since then, several of our party workers have been killed and many injured. Thousands had to abandon their homes due to violence. The party needs to stand beside them and boost their morale before the civic and panchayat polls,” said a BJP leader. On Friday, election strategist Prashant Kishor and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee met in Kolkata to discuss organisational changes in the TMC and the alliance of regional forces the party plans to form against the BJP ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-bjp-chief-dilip-ghosh-called-to-delhi-to-discuss-organisational-issues-101625934336628.html
10-07-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Have briefed Guv designate on TAC rules, says Droupadi Murmu||In an apparent critique of the Hemant Soren government that recently amended rules of the Tribes Advisory Council (TAC), outgoing Jharkhand governor Droupadi Murmu said she has briefed Governor-designate Ramesh Bais over the issue even as she underlined that the Constitution provides special powers to the Governor on certain issues and everyone should follow and act accordingly.Reacting to a specific question on the contentious TAC Rules, 2021 during an interaction with journalists at Raj Bhawan on Saturday, Murmu said, “I had summoned the files (related to TAC). They (Hemant Soren government) are good people, but they delayed sending the file. I was seeking legal opinion on the matter when the new orders (of appointment of a new Governor) came.”“I have briefed the new Governor about it. Now, he would take a call on it. However, Article 244 of the Constitution gives special powers to the Governor. The Constitution is a sacred book like Gita. So everyone should follow the Constitution and act accordingly,” she added.The Hemant Soren government recently amended the TAC (an advisory body that deliberates and helps government about issues related to tribes and their development in states that have areas classified under the fifth schedule of the Constitution), transferring the power of constituting the TAC from the office of the Governor to the chief minister, who is also the ex-officio chairman of the council.The outgoing Governor, who is all set to relinquish office after a tenure of over six years in Raj Bhawan---the longest for any Governor in Jharkhand--on Monday also pitched for few amendments in the special pre-independence land tenancy laws in tune with the present times. “Some of these laws are old. Some changes are required. For example, the restriction of police station (of sale purchase of tribal land) should be amended. Earlier, the size of the police stations used to be huge. Now, it is not the case. However, any amendment in such laws needs to be in consonance with their spirit,” said Murmu, the only female Governor of the state till date. The Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act and Santhal Parganas Tenancy Act are two pre-independence tenancy laws which prevent non-tribals from buying the land of tribals. Even tribals can’t buy land owned by the same community outside the jurisdiction of the police station they belong to. These two laws, besides the land acquisition law, have often led to political controversy in Jharkhand, where tribals make over 26% of the 3.29 crore state’s population.Having worked for so long in the state and being a tribal herself, Murmu recommended that both the government and the society at large need to work on imparting quality education to tribals, besides focusing on training and implementing modern techniques to uplift the agriculture sector in the state. “Tribals are very simple people. They need to be educated, as they are not even aware of the Constitution and their rights,” she said. Governor designate Ramesh Bais is set to take oath early next week, sources said, and the incumbent Governor is likely to leave the Raj Bhawan on Monday. Sources said the chief minister will host a lunch as farewell for the outgoing Governor at his residence on Sunday, before Murmu leaves for her village Rairangpur in Mayurbhanj district in neighbouring Odisha on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-have-briefed-guv-designate-on-tac-rules-says-droupadi-murmu-101625932894367.html

This comes few days after Bankatwa, Raxaul and Motihari--all in East Champaran--became Bihar’s first block, municipal council and municipal corporation, respectively, to achieve the target.Confirming the same, East Champaran district magistrate Shrisat Kapil Ashok attributed the success to all stake holders, including health agencies such as WHO and UNICEF, besides the state government. “We did face hesitancy from few sections of the society. However, if countries like Iran and Spain can achieve total vaccination, there is hardly any reason as to why we could not. This was the motivator for our team here, besides the state government’s assistance in allocation of vaccines,” said the district magistrate. The district’s vaccination team enlisted support from religious leaders, influential persons, and all sections of the societies aided by political parties to build up a popular opinion for vaccines, the DM said.The team of vaccinators comprising UNICEF personnel and local health workers and professionals inoculated 14,902 people of the 15,000 eligible population (above the age of 18 ) dwelling in 15 wards of Pakaridayal Nagar Panchayat. The Panchayat has a total eligible population of 18,447, including migrant workers who are currently not living in the area, as per 2020 electoral roll. “The remaining 98 are pregnant women. They will be administered the vaccine later. Over 3,000 of the total eligible population are non-residents of Nagar Panchayat. They will be administered the shot whenever they return and if found not inoculated,” said Kumar Ravindra, sub divisional magistrate (SDM), Pakaridayal. However, the vaccination team faced challenges in carrying out the drive, officials said. Maulana Md Noorullah, Imam of Amana Masjid, said he had to resort to announcement from the mosque twice to encourage participation from his community. “There was a distinct hesitancy owing to sheer lack of knowledge and rumours. However, the mindset changed after I took the shot in front of the public in a bid to motivate people,” he said. The district administration, however, had to take to some tricks as well in inoculating all eligible people. “In the first place, we administered vaccines to all Public Distribution System (PDS) officials and their family members. Later, pressure was brought upon some reluctant people to either get vaccinated or be denied ration,” said the SDM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-pakaridayal-first-nagar-panchayat-to-give-first-dose-to-all-eligibles-101625932834329.html

Meanwhile, Jaynagar-Bhagalpur special train, which was supposed to commence its journey on July 10, has been cancelled. Likewise, as many as four trains have been diverted, whereas one train was short terminated and another short originated due to suspension of traffic movement on the downline. Jaynagar- Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (Special Journey), Jaynagar- Sealdah (Special Journey) and Raxaul-Howrah (Special Journey) will be diverted via Darbhanga-Sitamarhi-Muzaffarpur instead of Darbhanga-Samastipur.Similarly, Darbhanga-Amritsar (Special Journey) will be diverted via Darbhanga-Sitamarhi-Sikta-Narkatiyaganj instead of Darbhanga-Samastipur-Muzaffarpur-Narkatiyaganj. Rajendra Nagar Terminal-Jaynagar (Special Journey) will be short terminated at Samastipur instead of Jaynagar while Jaynagar-Rajendra Nagar Terminal (Special Journey) will short originate from Samastipur instead of Jaynagar.It is the third consecutive year when the train movement had to be suspended on this section due to floodwaters crossing the danger mark at one or the other bridges, revealed an informed source.Meanwhile, the flood situation in this part of the region continues to affect the increasing population with the inundation of low-lying localities in different pockets.Darbhanga DM Thiyagarajan SM, who conducted an aerial survey of the flood-hit area in the district on Friday, said that all the panchayats in Kusheshwar Asthan (East) and Hanuman Nagar blocks were affected by floods. Similarly, some parts of the Kusheshwar Asthan (West) and Hayaghat blocks were inundated, while nine panchayats in the Keoti block were affected.

According to officials, more than 50 cases under Prohibition Act are pending for want of chargesheets and case diary in 21 police stations of Nalanda district. The highest seven cases are pending in Bihar police station, while other cases are pending with eight police stations, including Chandi, Noorsarai, Laheri, Karaiparsurai, Parwalpur and Sarmera. Principal Magistrate Mavendra Mishra directed the Nalanda superintendent of police (SP) Hariprasth S to prepare a list of all chargesheets between 2018 and ­2021. He also asked him to seek the status of filing of chargesheet from the investigating officers (IO) concerned. “It is the duty of police to complete investigation within a reasonable time, submit relevant reports and produce witness before the board within the time frame,” the board observed. According to JJB’s counsel Pramod Kumar, slow investigations by police are not only prolonging trails but also overcrowding jails and putting undue burden on parties. In case of minors, it also leads to trauma, he said. “Often police delay filing of chargesheets. Forensic reports too are delayed. Even though, as per Juvenile Justice (Care and protection of children) Act, every inquiry into the cases relating to juveniles has to be complete within four months, as many as 50 cases related to Prohibition Act are pending in JJB. Due to the serious nature of the case, the JJB cannot not terminate the case despite non-submission of chargesheets”. Earlier, monitoring bench of juvenile justice comprising Justice Ashwani Kumar Singh, Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Justice Arvind Srivastava, through video conferencing with the Principal Magistrates of JJBs in Bihar, expressed concern over slow disposal of cases across the state. Following this, the Principal Magistrates were directed to write to chief judicial magistrates (CJMs) and district judges (DJs) concerned with the such cases for appropriate direction. The Nalanda SP said such old cases under Prohibition Act should not be pending for filing of chargesheet. “If old cases are still pending, I will look into the matter and get them disposed of by filing chargesheet as soon as possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pending-juvenile-liquor-cases-board-asks-police-to-furnish-details-101625932775040.html

It was because of his understanding about taxation and finance that the then UPA government had included him in the GST Council,” said Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra.Though the RJD took potshot on Modi for targeting party chief Lalu Prasad and his family, party spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari said late Karpoori Thakur and he (Modi) were among the most deserving lot to represent Bihar for its development. “His (Modi’s) unrestrained bashing of Lalu Prasad and his family, which earned him some political success, could not help him get blessings of Narendra Modi,” Tiwari said.“Sushil Modi missed the bus owing to his known proximity with the Bihar CM. He had in the past declared Nitish Kumar as PM material, much to the chagrin of Narendra Modi. Inclusion of JD(U) national president RCP Singh in the cabinet has already triggered an intense squabbling within the party,” Mishra said.CPI(ML) legislator Amarjeet Kushwaha said that Bihar was a loser in what he said was a battle of nerves between Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar. “Many senior leaders, including Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh, Ramnath Thakur and Santosh Kushwaha, were eying their inclusion in the Union cabinet. Instead, Patna Saheb MP Ravi Shankar Prasad was booted out unceremoniously,” said the MLA.A senior JD(U) leader, pleading anonymity, said induction of non-political leader as minister in the central government had put a question mark over stability of the government in Bihar. “Lalan Singh’s statement that party seniors were not taken into confidence for nomination of the minister speaks a lot about growing dissent in the JD(U) on the issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/oppn-leaders-sympathise-with-sushil-modi-say-he-deserved-a-berth-in-union-cabinet-101625932654396.html

I spoke to my father and he has refuted reports that the state president has resigned. All is well in the party,” Yadav said before leaving for his assembly constituency of Hasanpur in Samastipur. Singh told reporters on Saturday that reports of his resignation were mischievous and an attempt to defame the party. “Had I resigned , why would I be sitting here?” he said the party office. Asked about his alleged tiff with Tej Pratap, Singh said had no reason to be annoyed with him. On RJD’s 25th foundation day on July 5, Tej Pratap Yadav had said Singh was annoyed with him. He had also complained in the past that he was not being heard in organisational decisions.Singh’s predecessor Ram Chandra Purbe too had faced embarrassment from the elder Yadav, who attacked him for not accommodating youth leaders of his choice in party’s various cells. Singh took over as state RJD president in November 2019.Earlier this year, Tej Pratap Yadav had accused Singh of not extending support to him in his campaign for release of RJD president from jail by sending postcards to the President of India, which was launched in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/no-ill-will-towards-jagdanand-says-tej-pratap-101625932594440.html

Singh is currently posted in Gaya.According to Koderma police, Ashutosh Kumar, currently posted with Brahmpur police station in Buxar district of Bihar, along with two of his friends from Patna, Nikhil Ranjan and Sourabh Kumar, had gone to Tilaiya Dam, where he was joined by one Suraj Yadav (from Koderma). Soni Pratap, station house officer (SHO) of Chandwara police station under whose jurisdiction the incident took place, said Ashutosh has claimed Sourabh took his service revolver to shoot a photo when the gun went off and the bullet hit Nikhil Ranjan in chest. He was rushed to a private clinic in nearby town of Jhumri Tilaiya where he was pronounced dead. On Saturday, a police team led by Koderma superintendent of police Dr Ehtesham Waquarib visited the spot and recovered an empty liquor bottle, the police said, adding that blood samples of all three arrested have been sent for tests for alcohol consumption.

Meanwhile Buxar superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said the probationer DSP is a resident of Rohtas and was attached with Brahmpur circle inspector for training. He said they are probing how he went outside the state carrying with service revolver. “If any official is on leave, he or she has to deposit the service revolver in armoury,” he said.Ashutosh is the DSP of 56-59 batch of Bihar Public Service Commission and joined in Bihar Police after completing his training in February 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-dsp-s-picnic-in-jharkhand-ends-with-his-arrest-after-friend-gets-shot-101625932534345.html

10-07-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana: Farmers clash with police in Yamunanagar||As the impasse between farmers and the government continues over the three contentious agricultural laws, protesters under the banner of Samyukt Kisan Morcha faced off with police while trying to disrupt a Bharatiya Janata Party meeting in Yamunanagar on Saturday, leading to minor injuries on both sides.Meanwhile, farmers showed black flags to BJP state chief OP Dhankar during the party’s “chintan shivir” (brainstorming session) in Hisar while women and child development minister Kamlesh Dhanda and Sirsa MP Sunita Duggal faced the protesters’ wrath in Jind.The party’s district executive meeting in Yamunanagar was chaired by transport minister Moolchand Sharma at a marriage palace near Matka Chowk, and had education minister Kanwar Pal and other party functionaries in attendance.Despite a three-layer security, some farmers tried to run over the barricades with their tractors, making way for other protestors to climb over them.A major confrontation was averted after superintendent of police Kamaldeep Goyal urged senior union leaders to call back their men, and they yielded. However, some of the protesters and half a dozen cops received minor injuries during the melee, confirmed the union leaders and police.As police started rounding up protesters, the farmers failed to show black flags to BJP leaders or disrupt the meeting.“We had announced to stage a dharna till the end of the meeting, but police forcibly took away a few of us in buses. We asked them to release our men or face consequences, and they did,” said Sanju Gudiana, district president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Charuni).Aashish Chaudhary, deputy superintendent of police, said seven to eight cops received minor injuries and it will be ascertained if a legal action is required. “A few men were detained as a precautionary measure, and were released after the meeting ended peacefully,” he said. BJP leaders face farmers’ wrath in Jind, HisarIn Hisar, farmer leader Vikas Sisar lashed out at the authorities of Guru Jambeshwar University for allowing the meeting of BJP state chief OP Dhankar even after cancelling its booking on Friday evening.“It is evident that the BJP government has been using educational institutes to conduct its party meetings and the varsity officials are following its each and every direction,” he said.Later, farmers blocked the Hisar-Delhi highway near Ramayana toll plaza after some women protesters alleged that a man accompanying BJP’s Hansi MLA Vinod Bhayana made derogatory gestures at them. Bhayana was not available for comment.In Jind, Kamlesh Dhanda managed to leave the meeting being conducted at the BJP office after getting news about farmers reaching the venue in large numbers to protest. However, Sunita Duggal and Jind MLA Krishan Middha got stuck in the office, and were later taken away in a police vehicle amid heavy security.“The administration is helping BJP leaders in conducting meetings against the people’s sentiments. We will continue to protest against them until the farm laws are repealed,” said BKU’s Jind district president Azad Palwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-bjp-meeting-farmers-police-face-off-in-yamunanagar-101625930314979.html

I did a lot of work with JICA but PMC should now speed up this work.” He said, “Pune is taking many good steps during BJP’s tenure. Pune purchased the highest electric buses. Even these buses are running on the same fare which applies for other buses in the city. The Metro project is getting ready and will be launched very soon.

The two, however, are absconding.The DRI, in coordination with the Customs, had examined two containers at Nhava Sheva Port in Mumbai, imported by Tarn Taran-based firm M/s Sandhu Exports, from Afghanistan via Iran. These containers found to contain the contraband.After the seizure, firm owner Prabhjit Singh, 25, of Chohla Sahib village, was arrested on July 1. Subsequently, two Tarn Taran-based accomplices of Prabhjit were nabbed from a godown in Shivpuri district of Madhya Pradesh. On Saturday, a team of Tarn Taran police that superintendent of police (SP-narcotics) Jagjit Singh Walia led returned from Mumbai. The team had gone there to question Prabhjit and assist the DRI. “We can’t disclose the duo’s names, as it may hamper DRI investigation into this high-profile smuggling case. One of the two accused is from Tarn Taran. We suspect the two men had links with Pakistan or Afghanistan-based smugglers,” said a senior Punjab Police official, not wanting to be named.“Two associates of Prabhjit who were arrested from MP by the DRI had been living there since 2012. DRI officials say the two arrested men have claimed that they were unaware that heroin was to be smuggled in guise of talc stones. Prior to this seizure, five consignments of gypsum and talc stones were delivered to Prabhjit from Afghanistan or Pakistan. The DRI is probing if heroin was smuggled in these five consignments as well,” he added. Prabhjit is on remand with DRI Mumbai till July 12.

Parents and teachers from across the state can participate in the survey until July 12 at 11:55 pm on the link http://www.maa.ac.in/survey. Speaking about the survey, Dinkar Temkar, director SCERT said that as the state government has directed to reopen schools for classes eight to 12 offline, we decided to take a survey to understand how comfortable parents are with the decision. “In a recent government resolution (GR), the state government has issued directives to start schools from classes eight to 12 in offline mode where Covid cases are negligible. Schools are directed to take all necessary precautions for the reopening like sanitization, mask and social distancing,” said Temkar. He added that schools are also advised to call students to class alternatives so that not more than 20 students are present in the classroom at one time. As the survey started, so far around 2,25,194 parents have participated in the survey. More parents can participate till July 12 late evening. “Out of these, 1,89,095 parents have given their consent to send their ward to offline school whereas 36,099 that is 16.03 percent of parents have denied their consent for offline schools,” said Temkar. He added that out of 2,25,194 parents who participated, 52.84 percent parents, that is 1,18,182 parents are from rural parts of Maharashtra. “Out of 2,25,194 parents who participated, 23,948, that is 10.63 percent, were from suburban parts of the state and 83,064, that is 36.89 per cent of parents are from cities across Maharashtra,” said Temkar. Local authorities are directed by the state government to open offline schools and allow students only if parents give their consent. This decision is not mandatory on parents and students. However, many parents have been keeping on sending their child back to school. Schools are advised to carefully monitor each student for symptoms of Covid and if any such student is seen to show any symptoms, they should be immediately moved to the nearby hospital for better care. Education experts note that the decision of offline classes will help students from rural parts as their learning loss is greater than those students who are residing in urban areas. Students from village face multiple issues of network problems during online education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/84-parents-agree-to-send-child-to-offline-school-scert-survey-101625926894210.html

I visited the spot after I was informed about the illegal mining activities. I had instructed the officials to stop stone quarrying after noticing the violation of rules. Those who violated the rules were fined and there is a ban on stone mining,” Nirani clarified.Denying the charges of Mandya MP Sumalatha Ambareesh, Minister Nirani said the government is ready to order a probe. “Let Sumalatha Ambareesh produce documents related to illegal mining activities to the government. We will order a thorough and fair investigation and take action as per the law and won’t buckle under any pressure,” Nirani assured. On Friday, Members of Parliament Sumalatha Ambareesh and the Janata Dal (Secular), led by former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, traded charges over alleged illegal mining in Karnataka’s Mandya district, about 100 kilometres from Bengaluru.The confrontation between the Mandya MP, the widow of popular actor-turned-politician Ambareesh, and the JD(S), which has its seeds in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, was reignited this time when Sumalatha alleged that illegal mining activities were affecting the structure of Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) dam.Replying to the query on the public spat between former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy and MP Sumalatha Ambareesh, Nirani said he respected both the leaders and added that indulging in mudslinging in public would not solve any problem. “Both the leaders are intelligent and have enough experience in politics. It’s time they ended this public spat. Politicians should not indulge in mudslinging and senior leaders should intervene and end this matter,” Nirani appealed.Talking about the concerns over the safety of the KRS dam in Mandya, Murugesh Nirani denied illegal mining activities in the 20-kilometre radius of the KRS dam which is the lifeline for farmers in Mandya. “Mining activities have been banned in the 20-km radius of KRS dam. Officials have been instructed to collect information regarding any illegal activities. It is very difficult to reveal the names of any politicians involved in stone mining activities which are happening in the last 70 years,” Nirani explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-will-order-probe-into-illegal-mining-in-mandya-if-documents-provided-101625926774682.html

Whatever taxes are there, they were imposed during their (BJP’s) tenure. The central government is earning around ₹3.5 to 4 lakh crore with the fuel tax. They should show a big heart and reduce the taxes,” the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader said.Notably, petrol and diesel prices witnessed yet another hike on Saturday – seventh in July till date, thereby surpassing the ₹100 per litre-mark in 18 states and Union territories (UTs).In Mumbai, petrol is priced at ₹106.93 per litre, while diesel costs ₹97.46 per litre. In Delhi, one litre of petrol costs ₹100.91 per litre, while an equal quantity of diesel is priced at ₹89.88. In the southern cities of Bengaluru and Chennai, petrol is priced at ₹104.29 and ₹101.67 per litre, respectively. Diesel, on the other hand, costs ₹95.26 per litre in Bengaluru and ₹94.39 per litre in Chennai.Petrol prices in the national capital and Kolkata crossed the ₹100-mark on Wednesday. As of now, petrol prices are over ₹100 per litre in several major states and UTs, including Maharashtra, Bihar, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, West Bengal, Telangana, and Rajasthan, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/show-big-heart-and-reduce-fuel-prices-ajit-pawar-tells-centre-101625924954984.html

Addressing a press conference, BJP MP Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said while the Congress has been vocal about women rights in other states, “Rajasthan tops the chart for crimes against women and Dalits in India… Those who are loyal to the chief minister of Rajasthan have been given a free hand to do whatever crimes they like.”He added that there has been a 50 per cent increase in crimes against women till 2020 in Rajasthan. “In Alwar district alone, 7 gang-rapes took place. This is a shameful reality of this state… There has been an increase of rapes by 30 per cent and 550 such cases were reported in just last 30 days,” Rathore said.He added that in the past year, 13,750 rapes were reported from the state.“It is the wrong competition that we are winning in Rajasthan all because the Congress government placed there has only one objective which is to remain in power, irrespective of what happens in the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rajasthan-tops-chart-for-crimes-against-women-dalits-rajyavardhan-singh-rathore-101625923656105.html
10-07-2021||Pune||Communication professional demystifies temple names in Pune||Patrya Maruti, Sotya Mhasoba, Dadhivala Datta, Bhikardas Maruti, Jilbya Maruti, Upashi Vithoba, and Khunya Murlidhar are among many such seemingly bizarre names of temples effortlessly cited as landmarks, especially by true-blue Punekars. A novel keepsake-cum-Hindu calendar (beginning from April as per the Gregorian calendar), which explains the cultural significance of these names, has been selling like hotcakes in the city. Tejas Gokhale, a visual communication professional, is the man behind this calendar, aptly titled Dev- Bhiv. The calendar features 12 distinguished temples dotted around the nooks and by lanes of old Pune (including the peth areas), and each of these has a tale to tell, about its name.“Every Punekar has known these temples since childhood. We’re also aware that the names are slightly odd, but we don’t really stop and contemplate about the history behind them. Through Dev-Biv, I have made an effort to get people to understand the city, its heritage and the Marathi culture better,” informed Tejas, who has spent more than a decade in the field of media and animation.In a free-wheeling and resourceful conversation, Tejas threw light on a couple of interesting stories and history of the temples. Patrya Maruti on Kumthekar road is the first ever temple in Pune to have been stationed under the shade of roofing panels (patra). “Actually, the panels were bought for some construction work at the city’s Sassoon hospital. But there was a surplus, and that’s when the idea of using those extra panels to build a temple was implemented, and the foundations of the Patrya Maruti temple were laid,” he explained, exclaiming how back in the day, even some things as simple as roofing panels were considered to be objects of splendour. Another rather engaging nugget of information shared by him was about the famous Dadhivala (bearded) Datta temple in Narayan peth. “The deity- Datta does not have a beard. So why would this age-old temple be called Dadhivala Datta? I wondered, and found out,” smiled Tejas. Apparently, the temple was built by a devotee called Dattatreya Ghanekar, who had a beard. “And so, the Datta’s temple he built came to be called the Dadhivala Datta Mandir,” he added.Dev-Biv is the pilot product that Tejas has launched under the aegis of his brainchild initiative called “Khalbatta,” a forum that has been formed to promote, preserve and celebrate Marathi, as a language, and culture. Khalbatta (mortar and pestle), for Tejas, represents ancient wisdom, tradition and customs. His idea is to launch videos of Marathi food recipes, in addition to spearheading a range of other stints under the canopy of Khalbatta. Speaking about why he decided to begin with launching a calendar, he stressed, “We are living in a super-fast world, where even an Instagram story becomes outdated in 24 hours and vanishes. With this kind of pace and the diminishing attention spans of people, I couldn’t think of anything better than a calendar to hold people’s attention for a year. Also, the calendar is replete with short poems and information about the temples, which is sure to serve as a piece of art after the year has passed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/communication-professional-demystifies-temple-names-in-pune-101625923654024.html

Born in Afghanistan, the citizen of Australia is working on Hindi language to fit into the industry. Before lockdown, he has done reality shows Love School-4 and Ace of Space-2. The youngster says, “I enjoy reality shows but now I need to expand my horizon. I have decided to shift my focus towards acting and evolve further. I need to make myself relevant and can’t just depend on reality TV.” On his prep for the same he says, “I am working on my dialect and ascent. I am taking diction classes and brushing my acting skills. I am auditioning for acting projects and simultaneously working on producing shows with leading streaming platforms in which I can also do act.” Ramiz was a contestant at the Afghanistan version of Bigg Boss which he also co-produced. “I have enjoyed doing both the reality shows in India. Unfortunately, due to pandemic, I could not be a part of Mujhse Shaadi Karogi even after signing a contract with them. That would have been my next step towards Bigg Boss.” He left India in February. “As the corona cases started to resurface, I began to face visa issues and so I had to return to Australia. Since then, I am here working on my personal projects. Still the visa formalities are very stringent. So, besides acting and reality shows assignments, I have got involved with a group of people in India to produce shows. I am amazed to see the industry bouncing back in India despite the ongoing pandemic.” Telling us about his local connect, he says, “I have a very strong Indian connection. My father was a professor at the foreign languages department at Jawaharlal Nehru University and I have good memories of visiting him when he was living in Noida. That’s when my connect with India started and I dreamt of working there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amazed-to-see-the-industry-swiftly-bouncing-back-ramiz-101625923594824.html
10-07-2021||Pune||PMC estimates ₹150 crore for roads and one bridge under PPP||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has estimated a cost of ₹150 crore for eight cement concert (CC) roads and one riverside bridge under the Public Private Partnership (PPP). It is the most discussed development model in budget-2021-22 on the background of Covid-19 financial crisis situation of the PMC. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation, the PMC is facing a financial crunch for development work. Therefore, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar introduced a development model to take help of private players to ease out the financial burden. In the budget 2021-22, PMC commissioner reintroduced the concept and declared to develop 11 roads and two bridges in three years. After the standing committee budget, the roads added another eight roads in the PPP development concept. Under the PPP model, instead of PMC, private players such as contractor/builder/developer will spend money and PMC will give credit notes which private players can use in building construction related activities such as to pay development charges, premium charges as well as transfer credit to developers. Now, the PMC has estimated the cost of eight roads and one riverside bridge. The estimated committee has given approval for the estimate of total ₹150 crore. It has eight CC roads in the Kharadi area and Bundgarden (Koregaon Park) to Mundawa parallel to the right bank Mula-Mutha river and North main road of Koregaon. The total length of DP roads is 7.3 kilometers and width varies from minimum 18 meters to maximum 36 meters. All roads are located in Kharadi area which is one of the fast-developing eastern part of the city due to IT companies and good transport connectivity and proximity to Pune Airport. V G Kulkarni, chief superintendent engineer of road department said, “On the background of financial crunch in the Covid-19 pandemic situation, the PMC has adopted the concept of development of roads on the PPP model. In the first phase, we estimated the cost of eight roads and one riverside bridge. PMC has set a three-year deadline to complete the work. We are hoping to get a good response from the Kharadi area due to the fast development.” Amar Shinde, executive engineer of the road department said, “After approval of the estimate committee, the road department will float a tender. We will come to know how developers, builders respond to work.” “In this work, the road department has included eight roads in the Development plan (DP) located in various parts of the Kharadi area. The estimated cost of the eight roads is ₹123 crore. We have also included one riverside road which connects Bund garden road to Mundhwa bridge. The road department has calculated the estimated cost of the bridge is ₹27 crore.” he added. New bridge connects Bundgarden to Mundwa The PMC will for the first time construct a bridge under the PPP model. The PMC has proposed a bridge which connects Bundgarden to Mundhwa. It is 5.50 kilometer parallel to the right bank of Mula-Mutha river and North Main road of Koregaon Park. It is of 30-metre width of road mentioned in the development plan of the city. It will help solve traffic problems in the Koregaon park area to Mundhwa road. It will develop in two patches- Bundgarden bridge to Kalyani nagar bridge and Kalyani nagar to Mundhwa bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-estimates-rs-150-crore-for-roads-and-one-bridge-under-ppp-101625923535216.html

This is the third such module that the state police have busted over the past eight months. “Sweety Singh, of Umarti village in Barwani MP, has been involved in the manufacturing and supply of high-quality illicit weapons to Punjab and other north Indian states,” said Punjab director general of police Dinkar Gupta.Kapurthala Police have also recovered three .32 bore pistols, along with three magazines from his possession, he added. Previously, Amritsar rural police had unearthed two such modules, including one illicit small-arms manufacturing unit in MP, with the arrest of weapon smugglers. They were supplying weapons to gangsters, criminals and radicals in Punjab. The DGP added the development came 10 days after the Kapurthala Police arrested four robbers and recovered 10 pistols and a rifle, along with ammunition, from their possession. Kapurthala police procured arrest warrants of Sweety and police team was sent to district Barwani to arrest him after coordinating with the MP Police. “Our team arrested Sweety, who unsuccessfully attempted to evade arrest, by crossing the Narmada River to enter the Maharashtra border,” the DGP added. Kapurthala SSP Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh said Sweety has confessed that he and his elder brother, Sumer Singh, were into weapon manufacturing and supply trade for years. “They uploaded videos of pistols on social media platforms to lure their customers,” the SSP added. In initial probe, Sweety has been found to be running a YouTube channel on name of ‘Azad Group Munger’ on which he advertised and marketed his business of illegal weapons. When customers asked for price, they shared a WhatsApp number. Police sources added that Sweety has claimed that of 40-45 households in Umarti village, over 50% (20 households) were involved in the business of manufacturing and sale of illicit weapons, especially .30 bore and .32 bore pistols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mpbased-illegal-weapon-supply-module-busted-3rd-in-eight-months-101625923054557.html
10-07-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana Congress protests against fuel price hike||The Haryana Congress organised protests across the state on Saturday to demand a complete rollback of fuel price hike.All India Congress Committee in-charge for Haryana affairs Vivek Bansal and state unit chief Kumari Selja led the state-level protest at Charkhi Dadri. Moving on cycles besides carts pulled by bullocks, mules and camels, the Congress leaders and workers took out a rally from the Janata College stadium to the heart of the city.“We had never thought that the price of petrol would exceed ₹100. This is the result of the Centre’s anti-people policies. Ration cards of the poor are not being made, housewives find it difficult to run the kitchen, and the farmer is in debt,” said Selja while addressing the gathering.The Haryana Congress president said the party will become the voice of the people suffering from inflation, poverty, corruption and unemployment. Former leader of Congress legislative party and Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry said the government should stop imposing excise duty on petrol and diesel. “Fuel should come under the purview of Goods and Services Tax. Under the UPA regime, the tax on petrol and diesel stood at ₹9.20 and now it exceeds ₹32,” she said.Bansal said the whole country is suffering due to inflation, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi is giving no heed to the people’s grievances. “During the second wave of the pandemic, there was no oxygen and no beds in hospitals and helpless patients were dying on the streets, but Modi’s focus was only on the tactics to grab power in Bengal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-congress-protests-against-fuel-price-hike-101625922454652.html

D’Sa was among the defectors.The clash was triggered after around a dozen AAP volunteers visited D’Sa’s residence with a cake to mark the day he defected to the BJP in 2019.D’Sa’s supporters booed, jeered, heckled them, threw eggs, and smashed the cake they tried to offer him.AAP leader Atishi Marlena, who is currently visiting Goa, launched the “defection anniversary” campaign. “The people of Goa wanted a change, and they thought the Congress represented change. Instead, Congress sold the votes of the people of Goa to the BJP. The BJP bought these votes. Together they form the Congress Janata Party,” Marlena said. “The people of Goa have not forgotten this betrayal.”Ahead of the 2022 elections in the state, the AAP has launched a “Let’s Clean Goa’s Politics” campaign.AAP leaders tried to offer cakes to other defectors including minister Jennifer Monserrate who along with her husband Atanasio Monserrate defected to the BJP. The Monserrates did not show up when the AAP volunteers arrived at their residence. Minister Filipe Rodrigues engaged with the AAP volunteers and even had a piece of cake.The cakes carried a logo showing both the Congress and the BJP symbols.AAP leader Cecille Rodrigues said, “Today is a reminder to all those people who have voted for the Congress. We have come to the legislators’ doorstep to remind them that they have betrayed the people’s vote.”BJP spokesperson Narendra Sawaikar called the campaign a “cheap political stunt to gain publicity.”Goa assembly Speaker Rajesh Patnekar on April 20 dismissed a Congress plea to disqualify the 10 legislators for switching sides in 2019.The Congress emerged as the single-largest party in Goa in 2017 by winning 17 seats in the 40-member House. But the BJP, which won 13 seats, formed the government with the help of the Goa Forward Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, and independents.

She said 'jungle raj' is prevailing under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government rule in the state as violence marred the polls and a woman in Lakhimpur district faced indecent behaviour."In the present BJP government in UP, there is no law but jungle raj, under which violence occurred in the panchayat elections and misbehaviour with a lady of Lakhimpur Kheri is also very shameful. Is this their rule of law and democracy? This is something to think about," Mayawati's tweet, in Hindi, read.1. यूपी में वर्तमान भाजपा सरकार में भी कानून का नहीं बल्कि जंगलराज चल रहा है, जिसके तहत यहाँ पंचायत चुनाव में हुई असंख्य हिंसा व लखीमपुर खीरी की एक महिला के साथ की गई बदसलूकी भी अति-शर्मनाक। क्या यही इनका कानून का राज व लोकतन्त्र है? यह सोचने की बात है।The BSP chief's comments came after other opposition parties also slammed the state government over incidents of violence in the run-up to the panchayat elections for the block president.Several parts of the state reported violence amid allegations that candidates backed by opposition parties were not permitted to file nomination papers.Also read: Samajwadi Party announces protests across Uttar Pradesh on July 15 over alleged poll irregularitiesSamajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Friday accused the BJP workers of misbehaving with a woman in Lakhimpur Kheri.

10-07-2021||Kolkata||TMC launches two-day state-wide protest against hike in fuel prices||The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal launched a two-day state-wide protest against hike in fuel prices on Saturday. Petrol is retailing at over ₹101 per litre and diesel at more than ₹92 in West Bengal, while domestic LPG touched ₹861 per cylinder.State ministers, MPs, legislators and other leaders of the party hit the streets, holding rallies and staging protests in innovative ways sometimes using bullock carts and cooking on the road with wood. “The centre imposed enormous taxes on petroleum products, causing a lot of hardships for the common people. Petro-product prices were unregulated, allowing oil companies to raise prices to increase their profits so that their share prices also rise,” said Frihad Hakim state transport minister. While at Girish Park in Kolkata, a scooty was loaded on a hand-cart and then dragged. At Ganga Sagar in South 24 Parganas, TMC workers cooked on the road and organised a rally with bullock carts. At Canning, local party leaders held a rally carrying LPG cylinders on their shoulders. At Kashipur in the northern fringes of Kolkata, TMC supporters tore posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Earlier this week, state labour minister Becharam Manna had pedalled around 40 kilometres on a bicycle from his house at Singur in Hooghly district to reach Legislative Assembly in Kolkata to protest against the hike in fuel prices. On his way, he was joined by Kalyan Ghosh, TMC legislator from Domjur in Howrah, which is around 20 kilometres from the state legislative assembly. The Congress was also not left behind. Young Congress leaders staged a protest in front of Raj Bhavan in Kolkata dragging a motorcycle with ropes. “Ultimately, the citizens are facing the heat of a hike in fuel prices. I would urge the centre to roll back the process. The state government should also think about the VAT which they are imposing,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha. This comes just three days after chief minister Mamata Banerjee attacked PM Modi saying that the PM should sometimes talk about fuel prices, vaccines and dumping of bodies of Covid-19 victims in the river in his Mann ki Baat. “The centre has collected revenue of ₹3.71 lakh crores from oil and petroleum products in the financial year 2020-21. After collecting this huge sum, he is sitting silently, sometimes preaching on Mann ki Baat. Sometimes he should also talk about petrol, diesel, vaccines and dead bodies being dumped in rivers in Uttar Pradesh in his Mann ki Baat. Only then the people would be ensured that their PM is thinking about them,” Banerjee said while talking to reporters after placing the state budget on Wednesday. On July 5, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to slash taxes on fuel. The BJP, however, said that the prices of fuel is linked to the international market and won’t come down because of protests by TMC leaders in the state. “The BJP has been staging protests, both inside the state legislative assembly and on the streets, on several issues. Now, the TMC also wants to do something and have hence started protests. But fuel prices never went down because of protests. It is linked to the international market. We also want to know what the TMC has to say about post-poll violence and vaccine scams,” said Dilip Ghosh, state BJP president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-launches-two-day-state-wide-protest-against-hike-in-fuel-prices-101625918856423.html
10-07-2021||Pune||Startup mantra: Giving nanofibres a Covid-safe spin cycle||PUNE E Spin Nanotech is a nanotechnology manufacturing firm that pivoted in the face of Covid-19 to startup its movement towards making its R&D keep Indians safe.The uses of nano-technology are myriad. From baby products to AC vents to Covid-19 masks, nanofibers are all-encompassing. E Spin Nanotech had an indigenous antiviral, antibacterial mask ‘Swasa’, in the market months before the Covid-19 pandemic broke outThat, however, is not where the story begins.E Spin Nanotech is not a startup in the typical sense of the term – recently launched, online driven, currently boot-strapped. Its proof of concept, revenue stream and customer acquisition have all been in the works for at least a decade now.It began in 2010 and was comfortably ensconced in the B2B world of research-led, process driven manufacturing. Its primary product, a nano-fibre spinning machine, was first purchased by IIT Kanpur. IIT Kanpur is key to this company’s “startup” pivot, because the founder, Sandip Patil, is an alumni of the institute; a PhD no less.Swasa N95 Mask and Covid19 outbreakThe company pivot came without the firm realising it. “We started working on the Swasa N95 mask in 2017-18. Sunil Dhole, a PhD from IIT Kanpur, Nitin Charhate – also a student of UDCT Jalgaon – who returned to India from Europe to join our team, and Mahesh Katheria were part of our team which worked on the product. These were conceptualised before the pandemic broke out in 2019-end,” says Sandip Patil.“We designed the mask in such a way that it will be comfortable to wear and easy to breathe in. We used nanofibre technology and successfully made an anti-viral and anti-bacterial mask. It was also certified by the Nelson Labs in USA stating that 99.5 per cent bacteria and virus can be filtered through these masks,” he claims.“We had launched our mask in August 2018. The Covid-19 pandemic broke out in December 2019. We could provide masks to people during the pandemic. We were able to build trust among users, especially doctors. When we decided to scale our production, we had no means and facilities to do it. IIT Kanpur in June 2020 opened their facility to us. We started manufacturing at the facility with peak production capacity at 30,000 masks per day. Later, we also launched new designs, some designed especially for children,” Patil said.Oxygen concentratorsApart from the nanofibre spinning machine and Swasa masks, E Spin Nanotech also ventured into manufacturing of oxygen concentrators. Patil’s mother was diagnosed with Covid-19 symptoms and was admitted in a hospital in Dhule in February 2021.Patil said, “Just before the peak of second wave, we realised that there could be an oxygen shortage. I contacted a company and sourced 10 oxygen cylinders per day for my mother. The company used to supply 300 oxygen cylinders in Dhule, of which I used to get 10. I spoke with my team Sunil Dhole and Tushar Wagh, and asked them to work on a portable oxygen concentrator units. We had already procured raw materials and components when the second wave peak arrived. We got support from the central government officials and ONGC also placed an order for 5,000 oxygen concentrators in June 2021, which we are fulfilling now.”In the beginningIt’s a nano-technology story that among other differentials, illustrates the macro impact of education; from a village school to the hallowed halls of an IIT.The company is self-sustaining and has not sought any VC investment… so far. “We got offers as high as ₹50 crore from investors, but, I prefer to go slow on product development and believe that there should be an innovation component in it. Recently, we have decided to take a loan from a bank,” is how Patil explains it.The setting for this ambitious entrepreneur to enter the cut-throat world of technical and engineering inventions, all nano of course, is a small village named Pimpri (Chimthana) in Dhule district.Pimpri in Dhule is inhabited by 75 per cent Adivasi farmers.Patil comes from a family of farmers and has done his entire schooling in a Marathi-medium school. Patil says, “I spent my entire childhood in a village. I started attending school from Class 2 because there was no good school in our village. I was sent to my uncle’s village near Shahada town in Nadurbar district for schooling. We were not very sound economically and hence, I had to work in the farm besides studying.” Patil’s first taste of entrepreneurship came at a small shop besides his house in the village, where he worked as a youth. “My younger brother and father are still engaged in farming,” he adds.After clearing his HSC exams, he got admission to the University Department of Chemical Technology (UDCT) Jalgaon, North Maharashtra University (NMU), for a BTech in Chemical Engineering. “I failed most subjects in the first year and came back home crying and told my parents I am not good enough to complete engineering. I decided to work in the farm,” says Patil.With a few hours in the fields, Patil felt the “heat” of farming. “That moment I resolved to clear all subjects in my first year of engineering with distinction or first-class,” he recalls.IIT– a different world altogetherIn 2006, Patil got admission for an MTech in Polymer Technology at MS university, Baroda, and then, to IIT Mumbai for one year under a collaborative course. “I had developed interest in research while pursuing my engineering. However, my family and other villagers were not so aware about what exactly research means. I took keen interest in nanotechnology,” Patil says.Then came the PhD at IIT Kanpur. “My family was opposed to me travelling and staying in Uttar Pradesh. It was a different world and culture altogether. All professors spoke English and I could not express myself or any problem in English. I took two years to acclimatise to the culture. The study pattern I had never experienced. I almost failed to get the Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) of 7 which was mandatory for a PhD. In the first semester I got a score of 6, in the second semester I got 6.5, but in the subsequent semester, I got the 7 score and was allowed to pursue my PhD. However, four years at IIT Kanpur transformed me into an altogether different person,” Patil recalls.Research-led entrepreneurship Sandip Patil did his PhD under Professor Ashutosh Sharma, who is now secretary, department of science and technology, government of India. While doing his research work Patil realised the potential of the “indigenous product market”. Says Patil, “Many instruments required for research are imported in India. I realised that I should do something to support the research ecosystem. Since my research was on nanofibre technology, Prof Sharma tasked me with building a machine - electrospinning – a nanofibre spinning machine.”Over the next six months, Patil worked on the machine project. “We sourced all materials indigenously and managed to make a lab-scale machine which was working perfectly fine. I did not understand the business angle to it, but the material sourcing experience gave me a fair idea about how to price any product,” he says.“When I told Prof Sharma that I want to continue my research in nanofibre technology and develop a commercial product for societal benefit, he asked me to immediately start working on the idea. I said to him that I am yet to complete my PhD. He said, ‘don’t worry your PhD will be completed in time’.” E-Spin Nanotech was founded on November 24, 2010 and the company received its first order from IIT Kanpur itself. “It helped me sustain financially,” Patil adds.BootstrappingPatil says, “I used some of my earlier savings from my stipend, Prof Sharma gave me some amount and also a few friends contributed. With this financial help, I registered my company and also manufactured the machine. I earned ₹4.5 lakh from the sale of the machine at that time, but I put that amount into the startup. I had got married in 2006 while pursuing MTech. My wife Jagruti also joined the startup as director. We had nothing to lose. Whatever I have earned is much more than what I could have done otherwise. We didn’t have our own office, but still we hired our first employee. I used to pay him ₹4,000 out of the total ₹8,000 stipend I received.”IIT’s Startup Incubation and Innovation CentreThe Startup Incubation and Innovation Centre (SIIC) at IIT Kanpur played an important role in the growth of E-Spin Nanotech. The Department of Science and Industrial Research (DSIR) under the Promoting Innovations in Individuals, startups and MSMEs (PRISM) scheme granted a fund ₹4.5 lakh to E-Spin Nanotech in 2011. Says Patil, “Most of my problems were solved after receiving the PRISM fund. After commercialising the machines, I could sell them not only in India, but in US, Europe, and Russia too. All our revenue was reinvested in research and development work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-giving-nanofibres-a-covid-safe-spin-cycle-101625917116369.html

He also pointed out that though Pune district achieved the milestone of 50 lakh inoculations this week, the vaccination centres were closed for two days because of a vaccine shortage.He also asserted that it is essential to follow the Covid-19 norms even after taking two vaccine doses. “Pune district has crossed the milestone of 50 lakh vaccine doses. There are a total of 814 vaccination centres in the district. For the last two days, all our centres have been closed because of the shortage of vaccines and vaccine doses may come on Saturday. The administration is well prepared for the vaccination drive, but the supply of vaccines from the Centre is not in the proportion of the requirement,” said Pawar.“They (Central government) had said that vaccine production would increase after June-end and all the states will get vaccines. But currently, this is not the situation,” said Pawar. He also added that people should not become complacent in following the Covid-19 norms after taking two doses. “People should not stop wearing a mask after taking two vaccine doses. There have been cases where fully vaccinated people have got the infection. So I would like to request all that even if you are fully vaccinated follow the norms,” he said.Pune district, as of Thursday, touched the 5 million mark for a vaccination with at least one dose, across the district. Of the coverage, 91.86 per cent is by Covishield, whereas Covaxin makes up for 8.09 per cent in the district. Sputnik V has 0.05 per cent usage in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/not-enough-vaccine-doses-to-meet-demand-in-pune-ajit-pawar-101625915313629.html
10-07-2021||Pune||New vaccination programmes help bring down child mortality in rural Pune||The introduction of new vaccines in the universal vaccination programmes has helped bring down the child mortality rate in rural areas of Pune.In the five years, infant mortality went down from 388 to 232 and under five years mortality went down from 480 to 282 deaths while the number of live births remained almost the same above 60,000 annually, according to data provided by the Pune district health department.From 480 deaths among kids aged under five years in 2015-16 the deaths have come down to 282 in the same category in 2019-10, said officials.Although kids are not yet eligible for Covid19 vaccination, the central ministry has emphasised routine immunisation among kids in anticipation of the third wave.As per the information from the Pune district health department, Zilla Parishad, the mortalities among infants, aged less than one year, and among children aged less than five have fallen in the past five years. This positive growth has been due to the various measures introduced in rural villages.Dr Sachin Edake, district immunization officer, said, “In the past five years, we have introduced pentavalent which protects against five infections, measles, rubella, rotavirus, hepatitis B and others. Under universal immunisation programme, these vaccines are administered to kids.”“Most mortalities happen under age five and even within that age group, kids under age one and infants aged less than 28 days are the most vulnerable. Vaccination at the right time protects the kids when are the most vulnerable,” he said.In addition to the introduction of vaccines, initiatives under child welfare schemes to bring down malnutrition has also added to the benefit.Dattatraya Munde, deputy chief executive officer under women and child welfare, Pune district, said, “In addition to providing necessary nutrition food packets to malnourished kids, we ensured that the supply of food to kids who are not able to attend schools due to the pandemic get their food delivered to their homes.”“Also, since past two years we have begun programs under which volunteers and govt officials ‘adopt’ a kid which provides financial aid for the nourishment of the child,” said Munde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/new-vaccination-programmes-help-bring-down-child-mortality-in-rural-pune-101625915194362.html

10-07-2021||Pune||Pune activists welcome SC’s decision on environment clearance for HCMTR project||The city activists welcomed Supreme Court’s decision which has instructed Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to take environmental clearance for the High Capacity Mass Transit Route (HCMTR) project.Sarang Yadwadkar, original petitioner in the National Green Tribunal (NGT), welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision and said, “NGT had asked PMC not to proceed with HCMTR work without environment clearance. The same decision was upheld by the apex court.”The HCMTR is a 24 metre, six-lane fully elevated road having a length of 36 km with two exclusive lanes for the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) one on each side. Additionally, 26 BRTS stations and 17 up ramps and 16 Downs ramps are proposed in the construction of HCMTR. Various grade roads and structures below the elevated HCMTR, as well as minor bridges, are also proposed in the project.Yadwadkar said, “HCMTR would create a huge environmental impact on the city. The rapid environmental impact assessment that had been carried out by the project proponents was unscientific.”Sujit Patwardhan of Parisar said, “The corporation has twisted the meaning of HCMTR by adding four lanes for private vehicles. The HCMTR should remain exclusive for mass transportation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-activists-welcome-sc-s-decision-on-environment-clearance-for-hcmtr-project-101625914714230.html
10-07-2021||Pune||Covid curbs to continue in Pune, stricter restrictions at tourist spots||The existing Covid-19 restrictions are set to continue next week as well. Following the weekly Covid-19 review meeting at the divisional commissioner office on Friday, deputy chief minister and Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar announced that all shops, including business run by hawkers, will have to be closed at 4 pm.He also asked the police department to strictly implement curbs at the tourist spots while stating that crowding at these places is leading to a rise in Covid-19 positivity rate.“Shops and business run by hawkers can remain open till 4 pm only. I have instructed the police to make sure that everything is closed after 4 pm,” said Pawar.“Also, people are crowding at the tourist spots such as Sinhagad, Lonavla, among others. Because of this, the positivity rate is increasing. Police should strictly implement the Covid norms in such areas,” said Pawar.“The decision regarding the weekend lockdown will be taken by the state,” he added.After the Covid-19 review meeting, Pawar emphasised the preparation of the administration for Covid-19 management but asked people to strictly follow norms.“According to World Health Organisation (WHO), even after two vaccine doses, masks have to be used, and crowding should be avoided. Many countries are making decisions according to their policy but it has been observed that where curbs were eased heavy price had to be paid,” said Pawar.“Centre should give relief on fuel rates”As the fuel prices have been soaring with each passing day, Pawar demanded that the Center should give relief to common people.Pawar made it clear that the state government is already facing revenue loss due to the Covid situation, and hence the state taxes on the fuels cannot be waived off. He demanded that the central government should waive off taxes levied by it and provide relief to the people.“In the Covid-19 situation, the state revenue has reduced by Rs1.25 lakh crore. Huge funds have to be allocated to the public health department, medical education department, food supply department, and police department. We are giving priority to health. If we reduce state revenue, then it will affect these allocations. So the Union government should give relief on fuel rates,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-curbs-to-continue-in-pune-stricter-restrictions-at-tourist-spots-101625914539220.html
10-07-2021||Pune||Devendra Fadnavis bats for Neo-Metro on Pune’s HCMTR||Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has instructed the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) to give priority to High-Capacity Mass Transit Route (HCMTR) project and execute Neo-Metro on the same. On Friday, Fadnavis was in the city to launch the AC bus service in the central part of the city at the cost of Rs10.As the central government has accepted the Neo-Metro model nationwide, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will get financial help from Centre to execute the HCMTR project.HCMTR is the inner ring road, and it was planned in 1986, and PMC has not executed the project till date.Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar has already given instructions to execute Neo-Metro on HCMTR and bring down its width. Fadnavis, meanwhile, has instructed to execute the hybrid Neo-Metro model.“Along, with Neo-Metro, try to keep one lane open for private vehicles,” he said.Fadnavis said, “Maha-Metro had invented the Neo-Metro model which was first planned for Nashik city. Now central government has accepted it at the national level. Now Prime Minister Narendra Modi is planning to execute it in his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi. If PMC executes Neo-Metro it will get financial aid from central and state governments. It will help to bring down civic body’s financial burden.”“Maha-Metro had invented the model, so it is better to ask then to prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR) and allot the work to them as there would be no need to carry the tender process,” he said.While launching the bus service, Fadnavis lauded BJP for its performance in the municipal corporation for the development works undertaken in the city.“It is necessary to strengthen the public transport. During my tenure, I tried to make Pune a sustainable city and gave a nod to all transport-related projects. We purchased the electric buses and now Pune has the highest electric buses for public transport,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/devendra-fadnavis-bats-for-neo-metro-on-pune-s-hcmtr-101625913994440.html
10-07-2021||Ranchi||Outgoing Jharkhand governor says new governor to take a call on TAC row||Outgoing Jharkhand governor Droupadi Murmu on Saturday indicated that the end of her tenure in Raj Bhawan was unlikely to see the end of friction with the state government over Tribes Advisory Council (TAC) as she had already briefed her successor Ramesh Bais on the controversial issue. Without naming chief minister Hemant Soren, Murmu said the Constitution gives certain special powers to the governor on certain issues and it needs to be respected by all.Murmu’s comments come in the backdrop of the Hemant Soren government recently transferring the power to constitute the TAC from the governor to the chief minister. TAC advises the government on issues related to tribes and their development. The CM is also the ex-officio chairman of the council.“I had summoned the files (related to TAC). They (Hemant Soren government) are good people, but they delayed in sending the file. I was seeking legal opinion on the matter but in the meanwhile the new orders (of appointment of new governor) came,” Murmu said while interacting with journalists at Raj Bhawan in Ranchi.“I have briefed the new governor about it. Now he would take a call on it. However, Article 244 of the Constitution gives special powers to the governor. The Constitution is a sacred book like Gita. So everyone should follow the Constitution and act accordingly,” she added.Murmu will relinquish office after spending over six years in Jharkhand Raj Bhawan---the longest for any governor in the state. On Monday, she had also pitched for a few amendments in the pre-independence land tenancy laws saying they were out of tune with the requirements of the present times. “For example, the restriction of a police station (for sale and purchase of tribal land) should be amended. Earlier, the size of the [areas under] police stations used to be huge. Now that is not the case. However, any amendment in such laws needs to be in consonance with their spirit,” said Murmu, the only woman governor of the state to date. The Chotanagpur Tenancy Act and Santhal Parganas Tenancy Act are two pre-independence tenancy laws which prevent non-tribals from buying the land of tribals. Even tribals can’t buy land owned by the same community outside the jurisdiction of the police station they belong to. These two laws, besides the land acquisition law, have often lent themselves to political controversies in the state, where tribals make for over 26% of the 3.29 crore population.“The tribals are very simple people. They need to be educated as they are not even aware of the constitution and their rights,” she added. Ramesh Bais is set to take oath as the next Jharkhand governor early next week, people familiar with the developments said, and the incumbent is likely to leave the Raj Bhawan on Monday, they added.The chief minister was likely to host a farewell lunch for Murmu at his residence on Sunday before she leaves for her village Rairangpur in Mayurbhanj district in neighbouring Odisha, said the people quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/outgoing-jharkhand-governor-says-new-governor-to-take-a-call-on-tac-row-101625913094145.html

When the international market stabilises, prices in the country will also be moderated," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-organises-protests-across-west-bengal-over-spike-in-fuel-prices-101625903057117.html
10-07-2021||Dehradun||Amid tourists’ rush, Dehradun, Nainital hotels to run at 50% occupancy||Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami ordered 50% occupancy capping in hotels in the state’s popular tourist destinations – Nainital and Dehradun. “Challans are being issued to those who aren’t wearing masks. We are making efforts and will follow guidelines to contain the spread of the virus,” he told news agency ANI.The chief minister's orders follow after latest videos on social media showed tourists thronging the northern hill state after coronavirus (Covid-19) restrictions were eased. The Uttarakhand government relaxed the travel curbs imposed earlier to check the spread of Covid-19, and even permitted markets to stay open every day barring Sundays. However, markets in Nainital and Mussoorie can remain open on Sundays, and will be shut on Tuesdays.Visuals shared by ANI on Friday saw several people gathering in another Uttarakhand’s popular destination – Haridwar, for Har ki Pauri. “We feel like we have come out of jail after two years. There is a huge crowd. We are not scared of Covid-19. We came here before the third wave,” a tourist told ANI.This comes days after tourists were seen roaming around Mall Road in Mussoorie – most of whom were violating Covid-19 norms, including not maintaining social distance and not wearing masks.Moreover, on Thursday, a video of hundreds of maskless people gathered at Mussoorie’s Kempty Falls had gone viral. Following this, the state government on Friday announced that only 50 tourists will be allowed to gather at the Kempty Falls, and they can only stay there for not more than 30 minutes. Furthermore, a check-post for regulating tourist activity will also be set up, ANI reported.After visuals of travellers flouting Covid-19 norms, and flocking hill states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand surfaced the internet, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Dr Balram Bhargava termed them “frightening”.Union ministry of health and family welfare joint secretary, Luv Aggarwal said, “People, fed up of sitting at home due to restrictions, now seem to believe that if restrictions have been lifted, it means that the virus has ended.

10-07-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh draft bill proposes to bar people with over two children from getting govt jobs||A draft bill on population control prepared by Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission proposes to make people with more than two children ineligible for government jobs, disentitle those already in service to promotions, and exclude them from the benefits of 77 schemes. It also suggests incentives such as tax rebates for those with two children or less.The draft has been uploaded on the commission’s website for suggestions from the public until July 19 as chief minister Yogi Adityanath is expected to announce on Sunday a new population policy 2021-30 for Uttar Pradesh, which is due to go to the polls early next year. Uttar Pradesh is India’s most populous state with a population of around 220 million.The proposed incentives for government employees with one child include increments, promotions, and concessions in housing schemes. For those who are not government employees, the incentives listed are rebates in taxes on water, housing, home loans. In addition to this, if the parent of a single child opts for vasectomy, then the child will be entitled to free medical facilities until the age of 20. Such children are also proposed to get free education, insurance, and preference in government jobs.Justice AN Mittal, the panel’s chairman who has prepared the draft bill, said all aspects have been looked into and an exhaustive study of such laws was carried out before the proposed legislation was drafted. He underlined the need for a law to check the increasing population of the state. “Resources are already overstretched due to increasing population. Be it medical facilities, food grains, and jobs, everything is under stress due to the rising population,” said Mittal, a former Allahabad high court judge.“Imagine if the population of the state remains 22 crores (220 million) to 23 crores (230 million) even after 20 years, then what will be the state’s condition. There will be the availability of everything in abundance for the future generation. There will be no scarcity of resources.”Congress questioned the timing of the draft bill ahead of the assembly polls in the state. “The polls are due in seven to eight months. What is the urgency to bring the (draft) bill now when parties are preparing for the assembly polls?” said V N Madan, state Congress spokesman. Madan said they were studying the draft bill and added the Congress will support its positive aspects and oppose the ones the government has incorporated for its own benefits.Chief ministers of Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh and Assam have of late sought aggressive population control. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has said large families will lose certain state benefits.Population control is believed to have both advantages and disadvantages. According to United Nations data, the rate of population growth is falling behind replacement rates in over half of the countries globally. The growth rate in the global population is projected to be zero by the end of the century perhaps for the first time. China has allowed two to three children per household to reverse a fall in its population after decades of the one-child policy.India is projected to overtake China as the most populous country by 2025. Statistics show that India’s population growth peaked decades ago and is on a downward trajectory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-draft-law-proposes-to-bar-people-with-over-two-children-from-getting-govt-jobs-101625903373938.html
10-07-2021||Chandigarh||Growing tourist rush raises Covid concerns in Himachal||The rising rush of tourists to Himachal Pradesh, particularly during the weekend, has become a concern for the state government amid rampant violation of the Covid-19 protocol that could accelerate the third wave of the pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had during his address to the new Union cabinet expressed concern about the behaviour of tourists visiting hill stations in Himachal Pradesh and neighbouring Uttarakhand. Though epidemiologists have already indicated that the third wave is inevitable, they had said that it is likely to hit the country in September and October. Also read: Covid-19 in India: All you need to know about the top updates of this week“More than 13 lakh tourists have visited Himachal Pradesh since May. Of them, about 6 lakh holidayed in the state after the government eased Covid restrictions,” says state tourism director Amit Kashyap. “Hotel occupancy in Himachal Pradesh that was almost nil during the pandemic has now gone up to 80%. Our department has issued the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for hotels,” he says. Tourists looking for a breather A majority of the tourists making their way to Himachal Pradesh are from Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi-NCR, and Uttarakhand. A tourist, Anil Kapoor of Noida, says: “The lockdown time was a harrowing time for us in Delhi-NCR. We needed a break.” Ajit Kumar, a resident of Shimla town, says, “It’s fine that tourists are visiting the hills. Our economy has to run but at the same time they must follow the Covid protocol lest they risk the lives of locals. Tourists without masks and crowding will only speed up the inevitable third wave.” Govt stresses on Covid-appropriate behaviour Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Friday evening presided over a meeting to review the Covid situation. “The number of Covid cases is declining at a steady pace and the number of tourists visiting the state is increasing manifold. The government is not against this, but at the same time it will ensure that people follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” Thakur said. He asked deputy commissioners, superintendents of police and chief medical officers to ensure that the tourists strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. The government directed hoteliers, travel agents and owners of the homestays to motivate tourists staying in their establishments to follow the Covid-19 guidelines. He said that NGOs would be involved in providing masks to tourists. Police must identify places where the tourist inflow is high and personnel should be deployed to ensure compliance of guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/growing-tourist-rush-raises-covid-concerns-in-himachal-101625903253886.html
10-07-2021||Patna||Bihar governor to decide on plea to set aside registrar appointments in 3 months||Patna High Court has allowed a petitioner to approach the Bihar Raj Bhawan seeking cancellation of appointment of registrars in six state universities, allegedly done in violation of rules, and also given him a free hand to approach the court if the grievance is not adequately addressed in three months’ time.The bench of chief justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar was hearing public interest litigation (PIL) by one Rohit Kumar of Madhubani, seeking permission to request the governor to declare the appointments of registrars in six universities null and void and make fresh selections as per the existing statutory provisions.“Even those facing serious corruption charges, or against whom FIRs have been lodged, have been appointed in an arbitrary and non-transparent manner. Those without experience and from affiliated colleges with questionable recognition have also found favour for the important posts. Now, the governor, who is also the chancellor of universities and the appointing authority for registrars, has to dispose of the representation from the petition within three months. The petitioner had the liberty to approach the court if not satisfied,” senior counsel PK Shahi, who is representing the petitioner said.The petitioner has alleged that the appointments of Dr Mustaque Ahmad at Lalit Narayan Mithila University (Darbhanga), Dr Vijay Kumar at Magadh University (Bodh Gaya), Dr Jitendra Kumar at Patliputra University (Patna), Dr Ravindra Nath Ojha at Purnea University, Dr Pushpendra Kumar Verma at Nalanda Open University (Patna) and Dr Shiva Ranjan Chaturvedi at KSD Sanskrit University (Darbhanga) be set aside as they were not done as per the laid down provisions of the Bihar State Universities Act.The court granted the permission after the counsel for the respondents promised a response within three months. “...The authority concerned shall consider and dispose of [the petition] expeditiously and preferably within a period of three months from the date of its filing, along with a copy of this order”.The court order is significant as the chancellor’s secretariat has got involved in the appointment row, a repeat of what happened during the stint of former Bihar governor Devanand Konwar, when the Supreme Court asked the Raj Bhawan to carry out appointments only through search committee and through meaningful dialogue with the chief minister. In 2013, the Supreme Court quashed all appointments of VCs and a new process was initiated.Citing a Supreme Court ruling, the bench directed the petitioner to approach the authority within four weeks.“The authority concerned shall consider and dispose of expeditiously by a reasoned and speaking order, preferably within a period of three months from the date of its filing along with a copy of this order. While considering such representation, principles of natural justice shall be followed and due opportunity of hearing afforded to the parties,” the court observed and added that it was not expressing any opinion on merits and all issues were left open.In Bihar, appointments to key positions in higher education have often landed in controversy and led to confrontation between the state government and the Raj Bhawan.The much-hyped experiment to appoint former Brigadiers from the armed forces as the registrars of universities, initiated during former governor Satyapal Malik’s tenure, has mostly been done away with, the charge of multiple universities now going to professors, even from affiliated colleges. Earlier, professors from affiliated colleges were never made registrar.The situation is such that several vice chancellors and registrars are holding charge for multiple universities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-governor-to-decide-on-plea-to-set-aside-registrar-appointments-in-3-months-101625902893801.html

And come to think of a summer appropriate diet, and the scorching heat has made them get hooked to seasonal leafy veges, cucumbers and fruits such as melons, bel, and even dishes such as kheer (for bears) and khichadi (for elephants, monkeys, bears and rhinos). Ramesh Pandey, director, National Zoological Park, Delhi, says: “We are taking the best possible care of animals and meticulously following summer drills to keep them cool and comfortable. The enrichments done have also made the enclosures vibrant, which is good for both the animals and the visitors (when they arrive again). We have also arranged thatched roof, agronet sheds, serpentarium with air conditioning to maintain temperatures, coolers specially for large mammals, planks and platforms for carnivores to sit, and wooden balls to play with.”So as you stay indoors enjoying cucumbers in salad, here’s how the deers are relishing them too.

10-07-2021||Delhi||OPD footfall dipped by 57%, surgeries by 43% at one of Delhi’s biggest hospitals||The number of patients at the out-patient department (OPD) of one of the biggest private hospitals in Delhi dropped almost two-thirds (57.6%) last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to an analysis of the records of Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals published in the Indian Journal of Medical Sciences. The number of surgeries dropped by 43.78%, highlighting the impact the pandemic has had on the treatment of non-Covid-19 patients.The admissions of patients also reduced, but not significantly. Covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital offset the decrease in the admissions of others. The respiratory medicine department was the only specialty that reported a significant increase--314%--in admissions between April 2020 and March 2021 as compared to the previous year. It was because mostly Covid-19 patients were being treated there.“It was observed that all the medical and surgical specialties dealing more with critical and emergency care were less affected than the others. The most urgent surgical and interventional work was undertaken with due precautions. The surgical work was reduced significantly across all the specialties, with bariatric surgery (87.5%) and ophthalmology (65.45%) being affected the most, and general surgery (32.28%) and neurosurgery the least,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, Group Medical Director, Apollo Hospitals.The most significant decline in the number of patients visiting and getting admitted to the hospital was during the Covid-19 lockdown imposed in March 2020. The number of patients at outpatient clinics dropped by 89% from April to May 2020. The number of surgeries reduced by 80.7% during the period.“COVID-19 emergency had a direct and profound impact on the health-care delivery of non-COVID medical and surgical conditions. One of the worst affected groups was non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as these chronic diseases require continuous care,” the study said.The study cited the government’s move to reserve beds for Covid-19 treatment and fear among people about visiting hospitals. It added this led to a decline in the number of patients at the hospital. “The hospital was asked to reserve 20–80% of the beds and ICUs at different times, as per Delhi government orders which decreased capacity for non-COVID work. In addition, many cases had reservations about coming for treatment for the fear of acquiring the infection in a healthcare setting,” the study said.Even as the number of infections has dropped in the city, 70 to 80% of the beds in major hospitals continue to be reserved for Covid-19 treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/opd-footfall-dropped-by-57-surgeries-by-43-at-one-of-delhi-s-biggest-hospitals-101625899593686.html

Since the sports complexes in Delhi were closed on April 19, on account of Covid-19 mandated norms, denizens were unable to head out for a game, until now. Recently, as part of the unlocking process, sports complexes have finally reopened in the Capital. And their being shut, for more than two months, has caused discomfort to not just those who love sports, but even those who earn their livelihood by teaching sports, that is, the coaches. “This is great news for us as many coaches associated with us have been going through financial trouble,” says Sachin Singh, head coach and coaching director, NCERT Adchini campus, adding: “Many coaches, started individual coaching online. However, these never took off as sports is something that needs physical training!” Babita Juneja, a homemaker in Delhi’s Raja Garden, is thrilled at the prospect of rejoining her tennis training, and says, “My kids and me were desperately looking forward to go back to the court! Due to the lockdown, we have had very little physical activity and this has been the best news till now, that we can go and play again. I feel it’s much needed right now considering the sadness that had started seeping in all of us due to being indoors for a very long time. Sports has always helped me uplift my mood.” The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has permitted sports complexes and stadiums to reopen without any spectators. And as per the new guidelines, a two-player team — a coach and a player — has been allowed on the court, for all the sports including tennis, badminton and shooting. Contact sports such as basketball, football have been allowed in semi-private groups following a two player, one coach ratio whereas swimming is still not allowed. Sharad Kumar, owner of tennis academies in Gurugram and Delhi’s Raja Garden, shares how they are taking precautions, as much possible. He says, “Masks are not allowed on the court, but we maintain proper social distancing. However, some details are not clear in the guidelines that have come from the government. Like they have said no spectators but these kids come with their parents, so are they allowed?” Abhishek Verma, Indian compound archer associated with Yamuna Sports Complex, informs that they have restricted entry for many. “We are allowing only 20 students as of now; these are students who have tournaments lined up,” says Verma, to put to rest the worries of parents who are being pestered by their young ones to let them resume their sports training. “As soon as the news of reopening came, we started getting a lot of calls. Our old students also want to come back. But to ensure that we maintain distance, we aren’t taking everyone in at the moment. We anyway have to stand five metres apart in archery, but when the students have to go to collect the arrow, we make sure they are wearing masks.”Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sports-complexes-reopen-in-delhi-denizens-coaches-relieved-101625898756565.html

Of them 3.11 lakh were elementary teachers, including 1.04 lakh Shiksha Mitras appointed for ₹1500/month honorarium and later elevated to the rank of Panchayat teachers. It was later revealed that many of these appointments, especially for elementary teachers, were made on the basis of forged documents..The Patna high court ordered a vigilance probe into the matter in 2015 but it could not be finished on time. After several delays, the high court expressed disappointment over the unending probe in January this year and also threatened action. The appointment documents of close to 1.25-lakh teachers are said to be unavailable. The Bihar education department then shifted the onus of verification of documents on the teachers, who have been asked to get their mark sheets, job application and the recruitment letter uploaded on a web portal designed for the purpose.Ranjeet Kumar Singh noted the slow progress in uploading of documents despite reminders and asked the district education officers (DEOs) to carry out necessary corrections to ensure there were no errors in recording key employment details like name of applicants, date of joining etc. He also asked them to complete the uploading process by July 20.Earlier, Bihar education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary had warned the teachers that their appointment will be declared illegal if they failed to upload their documents for verification on the education department’s online portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-warns-teachers-that-they-will-lose-jobs-if-documents-not-uploaded-in-time-101625896473417.html

Besides, the highest number of UPI transactions was also made in the Bihar circle.As per assessment of business carried out by the IPPBs, Bihar is the only circle which is in profit, said a senior officer of India Posts familiar with the matter.Post master general (PMG) of Bihar circle Anil Kumar said that Nawada branch of IPPB had been adjudged the best performer in the country by achieving deposits of more than ₹100 crore. “More than 95% of the accounts of IPPB in Bihar are verified with Aadhaar of the customers,” said the PMG.The Bihar circle surpassed all other major circles including that of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra in terms of absolute transfer of money to the people by way of payments via Aadhar enabled payment system (AePS). “IPPB in Bihar carried out the highest number of AePS transactions, worth over ₹679 crore to over 3 million people during the Covid pandemic,” said Kumar.There are 38 IPPB branches across the state. IPPB has a total of 650 branches all over the country. In a related development, a 1990-batch Indian Postal Service officer Jaleswar Kanhar assumed the charge of new chief post master general (CPMG) of Bihar on Friday.

He said they have created a capacity to vaccinate over 1.5 million people daily to ensure expeditious vaccination. Gehlot added their daily vaccination is limited to the extent of supplies received from the Centre. He said the daily average of vaccine doses received since the start of the vaccination drive for people over 18 has been around 20,00,00-30,00,00.“I request for your personal intervention regarding our request for enhanced allocation of vaccines for Rajasthan,” said Gehlot.Gehlot added the Covid-19 cases are declining but they were strengthening the medical infrastructure from the primary health care level in view of a possible third wave of the pandemic. “It is apparent that apart from Covid-appropriate behaviour, vaccination is the only way to effectively counter the threat of the third wave.”Gehlot wrote Rajasthan is the best performer in terms of the vaccination drive. “Over 2.59 crore (over 25 million) people have already received the first dose of vaccination, and out of these over 44 lakhs (4.4 million) have even received the second dose as well,” he wrote. “...around 65 lakh (6.5 million) people are due to get their second doses by the end of July. The Center has been allocating vaccines primarily on the basis of the target population, while greater consideration should be given to the number of people due for the second dose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/gehlot-urges-centre-to-increase-vaccine-quota-of-rajasthan-101625892573249.html
10-07-2021||Patna||BJP’s ‘sidelined’ barb at Tej Pratap Yadav after he opens a shop. RJD responds||Tej Pratap Yadav, the eldest son of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad, has opened an outlet on the outskirts of Bihar capital Patna to sell his brand of incense sticks. Tej Pratap calls them LR, or ‘Largest Reach’."I have been doing pooja for a long time and am attached to incense sticks. I was inspired by a Delhi friend who makes incense sticks from flowers in his factory," Tej Pratap said on his new endeavour.The 33-year-old has reconciled to his role in the RJD that is led by his younger brother, Tejashwi Yadav, the political heir to Lalu Yadav who also holds the reins to the party that his father founded in 1997.Like in 2018 when Tej Pratap sought to stamp out speculation about their rivalry, referring to Tejashwi Yadav as “Arjuna’ in the epic Mahabharata and himself as Lord Krishna, his brother’s charioteer who would help deliver Bihar in the general elections in 2019. But there were indications of some friction when Tej Pratap abruptly stepped down from the leadership role of the RJD’s students wing weeks before the 2019 general election.Tej Pratap who is popular for dressing up as gods rather than his politics, did make a second attempt to relaunch his aborted acting career in 2018 with a Bollywood movie Rudra: The Avatar. The film is yet to be completed.He had earlier played the role of Bihar chief minister in a 2016 Bhojpuri film, Apaharan Udyog.The Bharatiya Janata Party said it was good that he was looking for an alternative. “Best wishes to Tej Pratap for his new business venture. The way he has been sidelined in the party, it’s good that he is looking for an alternative. Tejashwi can feel relieved because he is the worst victim of his brother’s tantrums,” said BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand.RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary rushed to defend Tej Pratap and mount a counter-attack on Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s government. "What is the harm in it? When the present government has failed to generate employment, he has set an example for the youths by starting a start-up," he said.Abhishek Chowbey, manager of the outlet, said Tej Pratap did closely track the business but rarely visited the shop. He also revealed that the Hasanpur lawmaker had started the business in March but it was shuttered soon after due to the Covid induced lockdown.Chowbey was optimistic about the business. “There have been trade queries from Mumbai and Indore and it is being supplied to all parts of Bihar,” he said.At present, he continued, they were making the incense sticks in 19 fragrances in the price range of ₹320 to ₹1020 for a 200 gm pack and ₹170 to ₹530 for 100 gm pack.“The incense sticks are made from flowers collected from temples and extracts from coconut leaves instead of bamboo. Maybe that’s why its price is high,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bjps-sidelined-barb-at-tej-pratap-yadav-after-he-opens-a-shop-rjd-responds-101625861159722.html

The train was travelling from Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh to Katni in Madhya Pradesh after loading coal from Korba Coalfields in Kusmunda.Madhya Pradesh | A goods train accident occurred due to the fall of a carriage on a railway bridge near Nigaura railway station near Chhattisgarh border. It was travelling from Bilaspur to Katni. Rail traffic movement remains unaffected pic.twitter.com/40wsrOXWJuPhotos shared by news agency ANI on Friday showed portions of the damaged freight train floating on the river. Part of the bridge, too, collapsed from the pressure.According to reports, the bridge over the Alan river had developed cracks in its structure, which could have led to the derailment of the train. However, there was no official response yet on how such fatal cracks appeared in a route specially designed for freight trains.Senior railways officials went to the area soon after news of the accident came in to evaluate the situation. A detailed investigation is underway to ascertain the exact cause of the accident.Rail traffic remained unaffected in the meanwhile, news the agency reported, adding that rescue operations are on.The railways commissioned the third train line for freight trains two years ago. The route runs between Nigaura in the Anuppur district of Madhya Pradesh and Venkatanagar in Chhattisgarh and is specifically designed for running such trains carrying coal and other heavy goods.Freight trains played a major role during the peak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis in India, when they transferred essential goods and heavy-duty raw materials across the country at a time when passenger trains remained restricted to cut off the spread of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/freight-train-derails-falls-off-bridge-in-madhya-pradesh-no-casualties-reported-101625876786151.html
10-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi rolls out graded plan for Covid-19 curbs||Private offices, malls, weekly markets and the Metro will be shut down in Delhi if the test positivity rate (TPR) rises above 2%, and the city will be put under a curfew if the number breaches 5%, according to a new Covid-19 action plan approved by authorities that sets clear thresholds for curbs that kick in from as low as 0.5% TPR in order to scuttle an outbreak.The graded response action plan, which harks back to a similar mechanism to fight air pollution during pre-winter months, was drafted by an expert committee formed by the Delhi government and approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).It classifies outbreak severity into four bands – yellow, amber, orange and red – with each representing a more severe outbreak and, thus, stricter curbs than the one preceding it.“In today’s DDMA meeting, ‘Graded Response Action Plan’ was approved. There will now be no confusion regarding when lockdown is to be imposed and when scaled down. In the meeting, we also had discussions on Delta+ variant. We have to protect Delhi from spread of this variant (of the virus), for which the government is taking all necessary actions,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted after the meeting.The colour-coded classifications take into account three factors: the test positivity rate over two consecutive days, new cases over a seven-day period, and the average weekly hospital occupancy rate (see box).Had such rules been in place prior to the April wave of infections in the Capital, a lockdown would have been put into place 10 days sooner than it was – the city crossed the 5% threshold for what is now the red alert category on April 9. A full lockdown was announced only on April 19.To be sure, the test positivity rate in the Capital has been 0.12% over the past two days, there have been 580 cases in the last seven days and, over the last week, the number of hospital beds occupied has reduced form a little over 620 to 450 on Friday.“Now that this plan is going to be in view of the public, there will be a sense of certainty and accountability on our part towards the people of Delhi. The plan descriptively elaborates upon when the lockdown will be imposed and when it will be lifted. This kind of a graded plan should be adopted at the national level as well… We can’t let our guard down, the preparation for the road map of an impending third (nationwide) wave (of Covid-19) is being worked upon consistently by the Delhi government,” Kejriwal said in a press statement.The chief minister is the vice-chairperson of the DDMA, which is headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal.A senior official in Baijal’s office, who asked not to be named, said: “After detailed deliberations and presentations made by the health department of the Delhi government and the Indian Council of Medical Research, it was decided to notify the graded response action plan that will objectively and transparently ensure an institutional and automatic response with regards to enforcement measures, lock downs and unlock based on criteria such as test positivity rate and quantum of cases.”According to the plan, seen by HT, the first of curbs are triggered when the positivity rate crosses 0.5%, or new cases over a week exceeds 1,500, or if there are more than 500 oxygen beds occupied on average over a seven-day period.Once any of these thresholds are breached, the city is under a yellow alert mechanism in which non-essential shops are allowed to open only on an odd-even basis, a night curfew comes into force, and offices are required to move half of their staff to a work-from-home function.If test positivity, case numbers and hospitalisations rise further, the amber alert comes into effect. In this scenario, some venues and activities are completely halted: parks need to close, barber shops cannot open, and dining in at restaurants will be prohibited (as will the opening of bars). Amber alert is when TPR rises above 1%, or if there are more than 3,500 cases over a week, or if oxygen bed occupancy surpasses 700.The next alert level, orange, takes effect if TPR breaches 2%, the number of new cases in a week goes beyond 9,000, or if the average number of oxygen beds occupied over the week goes beyond 3,000. In this scenario, private offices, malls, Metro rail services and weekly markets will be shut down.In the most severe red alert category (if TPR is above 5%, cumulative weekly case above 16,000 or hospital occupancy above 3,000), there will be a 24-hour curfew with people allowed outside only for essential services. In this scenario, all offices engaged in non-essential work need to shift to a completely work-from-home functioning.The new mechanism also makes it mandatory for incoming passengers in the national capital to produce a certificate of full vaccination (both doses) or a negative RT-PCR test report not older than 72 hours if Delhi is on red alert. People coming by air from states with positivity rate higher than 5%, or if they come by any mode of transport from a state with positivity rate is of 10% or more, irrespective of the alert applicable in Delhi, too, will be subjected to the same requirements.People coming from a state where a new variant is found spreading, irrespective of the nature of alert in Delhi at that point, will also need to show vaccination certificates or a negative test, the documents said.Friday’s DDMA meeting was also attended by Dr VK Paul of Niti Aayog, Dr Balram Bhargav of ICMR, Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, and Dr SK Singh of NCDC, said the official in the L-G’s office.Experts welcomed the response plan. Dr Charu Hans, the head of the department of microbiology at Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences, said: “Such anticipatory actions are likely to prevent any delays and avoid confusion, and conceivably lead to effective preventive measures in limiting the spread of Covid-19 disease. The experience gained in the last two waves of the disease and learning about mutations of the virus have enabled the government to come up with such a strategy. This strategy can play an important role in limiting the impact of a potential third wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-rolls-out-graded-plan-for-covid-19-curbs-101625870903580.html
10-07-2021||Delhi||Man held for killing teen daughter’s friend in northeast Delhi||In a suspected case of hate crime, a 46-year-old man allegedly killed his daughter’s male friend in his house and dumped his body outside a gym in northeast Delhi’s Karawal Nagar, police said on Friday, after arresting the main accused. Police said the incident happened on Wednesday night and they are also looking for a man who allegedly helped the accused dump the body.Police said the accused was enraged after he caught the 20-year-old victim with his 17-year-old daughter at their house. He allegedly tied the victim’s limbs with a rope and assaulted him with a belt, stick and a pair of scissors.When the victim died, the accused panicked and sought the help of his friend to allegedly dispose of the body. Together they allegedly carried the body on a bike and dumped it outside a gym, which is nearly a kilometre away from the house.Deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Sanjay Kumar Sain said that the police were informed about an unidentified man’s body, with multiple stab wounds and injury marks, lying near a gym in Karawal Nagar on Thursday morning. Through local enquiry, the victim’s identity was established and it was learned that he hailed from UP’s Baghpat and was visiting his uncle in the city.“Further probe revealed that he was in a relationship with a girl living in the neighbourhood. Her father was against their relationship. On Wednesday night, he went to meet her at her home but her father saw him,” said DCP Sain.The accused, the DCP said, allegedly overpowered the victim, tied his limbs using a rope and began assaulting him with a belt, and also used a pair of scissors to inflict injuries. He allegedly continued the assault till the victim became unconscious and died, after which he called his friend who arrived on a bike. “They put the victim’s body on the bike, took it a kilometre away and dumped it outside a gym,” said Sain.Police said that the victim’s family members were unaware of his relationship with the girl. The investigating team scanned the victim’s mobile phone and traced its last location to the accused’s house.“He confessed to the crime during questioning. The stick, belt, rope and the pair of scissors used in the crime were recovered from him. Raids are on nab his friend,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-held-for-killing-teen-daughter-s-friend-in-northeast-delhi-101625870166344.html
10-07-2021||Delhi||2 passersby killed amid firing near Bara Hindu Rao||Two passersby were killed amid a firing after at least four unidentified assailants opened fire at a local builder and his nephew at a market in Filmistan near Bara Hindu Rao on Thursday night, said police. Though the builder and his nephew survived the alleged attack, tension gripped residents living in the crowded locality of north Delhi.The builder, Haji Naeem Ahmad Peer, and other locals said they heard at least half a dozen gunshots. The police said not more than three bullets were fired. One empty bullet shell and a cartridge were recovered from the incident spot, said police.One of the passersby, identified as Sanjay Rajput who was in his mid-twenties, was returning after visiting his extended family members in Shyam Gali, Azad Market. His family members said he used to visit the Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib almost daily and was presumably going there at the time of the incident.“When I met Sanjay in the evening, he told me he was going out. Around 11pm, we got a call from Sanjay’s friend who informed us about the incident. The police called us to the station and told Sanjay was dead,” said Jaipali Rajput, the victim’s aunt.The identity of the second dead man could not be ascertained till Friday evening. A case of murder and firing was registered at the Bara Hindu Rao police station. Four teams have been formed to ascertain the exact sequence of events leading to the firing, the motive behind it and to find the attackers, said police.Senior police officers associated with the case said preliminary investigation suggests the assailants had come to settle some scores with Peer and his nephew, identified by his first name Muneef.“We have got certain leads and our teams are working on it. As of now, we can say that there was an altercation between the assailants and the builder before the firing. We are exploring all possibilities to ascertain the exact motive behind the attack. The CCTV cameras in the vicinity of the crime scene are being scanned for clues,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.Recalling Thursday night’s horror, Peer said he was standing outside a nursing home owned by him, that is currently undergoing renovation, when a man wearing a black t-shirt stopped by and asked if the nursing home was administering Covid-19 vaccines. Peer said that he asked the man to visit Bara Hindu Rao hospital or a nearby dispensary, after which he left. Peer then sat in his Swift Dzire car and left with his nephew and his office staff Prakash.“Just a few metres ahead, the same man suddenly came in front of our car and signalled us to stop. We came out and asked him to move aside. When he refused, we pushed him aside. Suddenly, three more men joined him and got into an argument with us,” said Peer.According to Peer, some locals came to their rescue and overpowered the unidentified men. Peer and his nephew pacified the men and asked them to leave. The assailants opened fire at the uncle-nephew duo just when they were about to leave in their car. Peer said he rushed inside a local shop to save his life and saw the assailants chasing his nephew and firing at him.“My nephew somehow survived the attack. I heard five to six gunshots. After the firing stopped, I came out of the shop and found two men bleeding on the footpath,” said Peer.Police, however, could not ascertain where Prakash was at the time of the firing.Police said they received a call at 9.21pm and rushed the passersby, each of whom sustained one bullet injury, to a nearby hospital, where they were declared brought dead. Their bodies were preserved in the mortuary at the Bara Hindu Rao Hospital.The incident sparked fears among local residents who were in a state of panic even on Friday. “We are not aware of the motive, neither the circumstances in which the firing took place. However, this is certainly a matter of concern and shows that the area is not safe,” said a worker at a local garage shop without sharing his name.Police said they have learnt that Peer and Muneef were having a dispute over a 2,800 square yard property in Shahdara as they had allegedly sold half of it some years ago. There is a possibility that the attack on them was orchestrated by Peer’s rivals, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2-passersby-killed-amid-firing-near-bara-hindu-rao-101625869669630.html
10-07-2021||Delhi||Two Karol Bagh markets temporarily closed over violation of Covid norms||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday ordered temporary closure of Gaffar Market and Naiwala Market in central Delhi’s Karol Bagh -- popular for car accessories and electronic gadgets -- for at least two days, citing violation of Covid-19 regulations.“Shopkeepers, vendors, and the general public are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Due to large footfall, market associations and shopkeepers are not able to ensure Covid protocols over the last three days...which may cause super-spreading of the coronavirus,” said the temporary suspension order.The restrictions will come into effect at 10 pm on Friday and shall remain in force till 10 pm on Sunday, or until further orders, the notice said. However, shops dealing with essential goods and services will be allowed to open.In the last 10 days, the authorities have similarly cracked down on at least nine such popular markets in the city, including the Lajpat Nagar Central Market and Laxmi Nagar market.Earlier in the day, at a meeting of the DDMA chaired by Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, which was also attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, senior officials raised concerns over overcrowding in the city’s markets.“Grave concerns were expressed over the flouting of Covid appropriate behaviour and negligence. It was stressed that apart from enforcement efforts on the part of various agencies, the onus of ensuring and enforcing Covid-19 appropriate behaviour lay with stakeholder organisations like market welfare and resident welfare associations,” said an official who attended the meeting.The district administration on Friday directed the North Delhi Municipal Corporation to sanitise markets in Karol Bagh and the surrounding areas, and requested the Delhi Police to ensure “strict compliance of the order”.Currently, markets and malls in Delhi are allowed to operate between 10am and 8pm.The market associations, traders and owners of shops are expected to ensure that customers follow Covid norms such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and avoiding spitting in the open. Delhi was under a complete lockdown from April 19 due to an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. Scaling down of restrictions started in a phased manner from May 31 and markets were allowed to open from June 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-karol-bagh-markets-temporarily-closed-over-violation-of-covid-norms-101625869687115.html

10-07-2021||Delhi||Vasant Vihar murder: ‘As I woke up, I saw Kitty Amma dead in her room’||An eyewitness account has thrown light on the sequence of events at Vasant Vihar’s building number A 15/19 on the evening of July 7, the day three men murdered Kitty Kumarmangalam, 70, wife of former Union minister Phanindranath Rangarajan Kumarmangalam, inside her second floor apartment in the building.HT has seen the statement of crucial witness, Kitty’s domestic help, Mithila Devi (33), who was inside the house and was strangled by the three men until they thought she was dead. But Mithila, who survived the attack, woke up about an hour after the incident, and told the police in minute detail what happened that evening.It is on Mithila Devi’s statement that police were able to identify the three men — Raju Lakhan Kanojia (24), Rakesh Raj (34), and Suraj (yet to be arrested) and solve the case.The 33-year-old Devi said that around four or five days before the incident, she joined “Kitty Amma’s house”. Her job was to prepare dinner between 6pm and 9.30pm.Police have said that Raju, who was a regular at the house, expected only the elderly woman to be home. He did not know Mithila was hired at the house. The three were so confident they would find Kitty alone that they did not even carry a weapon.“I reached Kitty Amma’s house around 6.30pm and was preparing potatoes, capsicum and rotis for dinner. She specially asked me to prepare it. At around 8.30pm, when I was washing the dishes, the doorbell rang. When I opened the door, I saw laundryman Raju, who works in B and C blocks. He was holding a heap of clothes. I told Kitty Amma about it, and she asked me to collect the clothes from Raju. To take the clothes, I opened the door a little. At that moment, Raju kicked the door and threw the heap of clothes on the floor,” Mithila told police.Narrating what happened next, Mithila, who lives in the nearby servant quarters, said Raju smothered her with one hand; held her hair by another, and dragged her to a room.“At that moment, I saw two other men entering the house and directly going towards Kitty Amma’s bedroom. They started assaulting her. I tried to free myself and shout. Raju called his two friends to the room. He told them he could not restrain me. The two men then came to the room. One of them, who was of heavy build, removed his belt and strangled me. I tried to hold the belt to ensure that it did not choke me. Raju then held on to the belt from one side and the second man held it from the other side. They pulled it in opposite directions. One of them also covered my nose to stop me from breathing,” she told police.Mithila mentioned that at that moment, she heard Raju telling his accomplices she worked in B block and he could identify her.“And then I fell unconscious. When I woke up around 9.30pm, I saw Kitty Amma dead on the floor in her room. They used a pillow to smother her. The whole room was ransacked. Those men also stole my gold necklace, earrings and a nose ring. I then called my husband and told him what had happened. I could barely walk but somehow managed to go down the stairs and alerted everyone,” said her statement.On Tuesday night, about an hour after the murder, the three went to a wooded area on Nelson Mandela Marg, and shared the stolen cash and valuables. They then broke open the stolen locker. All they found was a bunch of papers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vasant-vihar-murder-as-i-woke-up-i-saw-kitty-amma-dead-in-her-room-101625864674021.html

10-07-2021||Delhi||‘No major infirmity’ in purchase of low-floor AC buses, says LG panel||A probe committee appointed by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has given a clean chit to the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) over the tendering and procurement of 1,000 air-conditioned (AC) low-floor buses -- an issue that was a bone of contention between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and the Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which alleged corruption in the process.The three-member panel, however, recommended floating fresh tenders for its annual maintenance contract (AMC) over what it described as “procedural lapses” arising out of a “bona fide decision-making process”.The report submitted to the L-G this week -- HT has reviewed portions of it -- stated that the committee, prima facie, did not find criminal misconduct by any public official.“The tendering process of purchase of buses warrants no interference and suffers from no major infirmity... The committee, prima facie, did not come across any material to impute criminal misconduct attributable to any public official,” the report said.“There were only procedural lapses apparently arising out of a bona fide decision making process. However, a greater effort for understanding the market and a higher degree of due diligence in assessing reasonableness of bids was required compared to what seems to have been demonstrated,” it added.“…In light of the findings outlined above, the committee recommends that the bid for AMC of buses be scrapped,” the panel, said while giving four recommendations.These included either going for a fresh bid, asking DTC to develop and strengthen in-house capabilities to maintain these buses, suggesting that a fresh bid could be floated for a turnkey operation and maintenance contract for these buses as against a simple AMC contract, and recommending that DTC could rope in experts to design suitable variants of all the stated options.DTC comes under the Delhi government.The panel urged the government take a decision soon based on its recommendations soon, so that there was no gap between the arrival of new buses and their operations. Delhi currently has at least 6,600 buses against the requirement of 11,000 buses, as mandated under various court orders.Bone of contention In March last year, DTC floated a tender for procurement of 1,000 CNG low-floor buses, issued another tender for allotting the AMC for these buses four months later. The BJP-led opposition in the Delhi assembly, raising the issue this March, contended that the AMC should have been included in the same tender meant for procuring the buses on the grounds that it would have been cheaper.The Delhi government was spending ₹875 crore in the procurement of the 1,000, buses and the AMC, as per the second tender, was costing the DTC ₹3,500 crore. To be sure, the purchase is a one-time expense, and the maintenance contract is valid for 12 years.Eventually, BJP leaders led by Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta, filed a complaint with the city’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) and the LG.On June 11, the Delhi government put on hold its plan to procure these buses through the DTC, saying it was open to investigation.On June 16, the state vigilance department, on the direction of LG Baijal, constituted a three-member committee headed by former bureaucrat OP Aggarwal. The other two members were principal secretary (vigilance) KR Meena, and transport commissioner Ashish Kundra.The committee, in its report, said that the tender for procurement of buses “warrants no interference”.Suppliers’ marketAt the same time, it noted that there were some deviations from the process outlined in the General Financial Rules (GFR) and Manual for Procurement of Goods in tendering for the AMC. “While separate bids for purchase and AMC can be justified with a view to get greater competition and a larger number of bids, the efforts made to get more bids is not apparent. In fact, the eligibility criteria do appear restrictive and defeat the purpose of splitting the bids. The process of discounting for a longer duration contract was not undertaken and only a total cost evaluation was done.”The panel went on to explain why the DTC may have done so, saying that various court orders limit the corporation to purchasing only low-floor CNG buses. “There are very few others who use such buses, and so DTC (in fact Delhi) has been pushed into a suppliers’ market, with very few manufacturers. These limitations may compel some deviations in the procurement process. Yet, if these deviations had become necessary, DTC should have ensured that they did some kind of reasonableness test of the rates for AMC, especially since the rates were far more than what they had in earlier contracts.”It stated that this incident should be taken as an “opportune occasion” for the transport department to take a hard look at comprehensive reforms of DTC in both the short- and the long-term.Neither the Delhi government nor the LG’s office commented on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-major-infirmity-in-purchase-of-low-floor-ac-buses-says-lg-panel-101625864071382.html
10-07-2021||Delhi||Long delayed, monsoon likely to arrive in Delhi on Saturday: IMD||After slowing in mid-June, and then entering a 10-day lull, the monsoon has started reviving and is set to finally advance over Delhi on Saturday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said — almost a month after its initial prediction of June 12-15.The monsoon will also cover the remaining parts of western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan in the next 24 hours, IMD added.It said the conditions were becoming favourable for the advance of monsoon over the remaining parts of the country between July 11 and 12, and to intensify further in the next three or four days. “Widespread rainfall is likely over northwest India, including Delhi, over the next five days. Besides, isolated heavy rainfall is expected in Delhi and surrounding regions from July 11 -13,” IMD said in its Friday bulletin.“The showers will intensify on July 11, with good rainfall likely across Delhi, and will continue throughout the week at least,” said a senior IMD scientist who asked not to be named. Monsoon showers are expected to hit Gurugram and Noida on Saturday as well, he added.This is already the most delayed monsoon in the Capital for at least 17 years, for which the weather office has records, going back to the 2006, when the seasonal showers hit the city on July 9. Monsoon usually arrives in the city by June 27-28.The monsoon was racing through the country in early June, and the Met predicted last month that it would hit Delhi by June 15, the earliest in the period for which data is available, before it suddenly slowed down and appeared to hit a “break” phase.Since June 1, the country has received 6% less rain than it normally does. Delhi has received only 42% of the rain it receives in that time, while Haryana has got 71%, Chandigarh has received 60%, and Punjab has got 64%, IMD data showed.“During the next 24 hours, monsoon is likely to make its onset over Delhi and other parts of northwest India. Conditions are favourable because easterlies have started coming towards this region... The circulation features and expected weather support the advance of monsoon to northwest India. We saw a spell of rain on Thursday evening as well, and there is some clouding,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.A low-pressure area is likely to form over west-central and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal around July 11, and will further intensify rains over west and central India. “When the low-pressure area develops over Bay of Bengal, good rainfall is expected in its path.To begin with, India Meteorological Department (IMD)‘s May 31 forecast for monsoon onset over Kerala raised hopes of early showers across the country. But this was revised, at the last minute on May 30, to declare the onset of monsoon for June 3. IMD, on June 11, forecast that monsoon would advance to remaining parts of the country outside south Rajasthan and Kutch during the next six to seven days. But the northern limit of monsoon has been stationary. The Northern Limit of southwest monsoon has been stationary since June 19 at Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar. IMD initially forecast that monsoon would make onset over Delhi by June 15, around 12 days ahead of its normal onset date. But the weather office gradually deferred it to July 10, nearly a month later than its initial prediction.Independent weather experts backed the latest Met’s prediction.“Easterly winds have started blowing in, and will completely replace the westerly winds. There is already an increase in moisture levels due to easterly winds. During the next two weeks we expect widespread rains across the country, including northwest India,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (climate change and meteorology) at Skymet weather, a private forecaster.He added that the showers will bring Delhi some long-awaited respite from the heatwave conditions. Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius on Friday, two notches above normal, but down from 41.8°C the previous day.“The day temperature will drop to around 34°C,” Palawat said.So far, Delhi has seen heatwave conditions from June 29 to July 2 and then on July 7 and 8.Palawat also said that, according to Skymet’s forecast, Delhi is likely to have a “normal” monsoon. “The monsoon will most likely be normal with 103% of long-period average (LPA),” he said. LPA is considered the normal range of temperatures and rainfall, which helps note deviation. Monsoon rainfall in the range of 96%-104% of LPA is considered ‘normal’.Easterly winds are also likely to strengthen at lower levels over northwest India in coming three or four days. Under the influence of these conditions, widespread rainfall is very likely over northwest India in the next five days, said the weather office.Moderate to severe thunderstorms accompanied with frequent cloud to ground lightning is very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh during next 24 hours. This may cause injuries leading to casualties to people and animals outdoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/long-delayed-monsoon-likely-to-arrive-in-delhi-on-saturday-imd-101625863442540.html
10-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh banker duped of ₹1.06 lakh in online fraud||A Sector-42 resident was duped of ₹1.06 lakh by a person who approached her through Facebook.The victim, Netram Meena, who works for a public sector bank in Sector 8, said she received a message over Facebook from a woman, identifying herself as Stella, an NRI.In the message, Stella expressed her desire to come to India for donations and Meena offered to help her. Stella shared her air ticket to arrive in India on May 19, 2021. After a few days, she got a call from Stella, claiming that she was stopped by the customs department at the airport as she was carrying a huge sum of money. Meena got another call from a woman, identifying herself as a customs officer, who sought a deposit of ₹2.34 lakh to let Stella leave. Through two transactions, Meena deposited ₹86,000 and ₹1.48 lakh, but soon after, she could not contact any of the numbers that she got calls from. Suspecting fraud, Meena managed to reverse the payment of ₹1.28 lakh, but ended up losing ₹1.06 lakh. Following the complaint, police have registered a case under Sections 419, 420 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 36 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-banker-duped-of-1-06-lakh-in-online-fraud-101625862033043.html

10-07-2021||Chandigarh||Retired Panjab University official loses ₹48 lakh to fraudsters promising insurance bonus||Eyeing a ₹38-lakh bonus against a matured insurance company has left a retired Panjab University assistant registrar poorer by ₹48.46 lakh.Given the runaround since 2013 by multiple callers, who made him invest different amounts of money to get the bonus, Tarsem Lal, a resident of Adarsh Nagar, Nayagaon, contacted the police in February 2017 after realising that he had been defrauded.After a four-year probe, the Sector-11 police have registered a case under Sections 420 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. Lal had told the police that he retired from PU in January 2013. He had an LIC policy that matured in December 2012 and he received the insured amount in April 2013. In June 2013, employees of Davis Club company contacted him via phone, informing him that LIC had declared a bonus of ₹38 lakh in his favour. He was informed that the bonus will be sent to Davis Club and to receive it he will have to become a member by depositing ₹25,000, which he did. They asked him not to get in touch with LIC, as he will lose 40% of the bonus money.After three months, they asked him to invest ₹15 lakh in the company, but they could not be contacted thereafter. In March 2014, one Jyoti Bhagat and Ganpati Dass called him and claimed that they were working with RBI, Mumbai, and will help him get the money back within 45 days. They asked him to pay ₹11.30 lakh for this. After delaying the matter, they also switched off their mobile phones. Then, one Riya Gupta called and told him that his bonus file had been received, but before release of payment, he needed to deposit ₹4.80 lakh as advance tax in the bank account of one Vikram Singh. Thereafter, Shweta Tewari called him and asked him to transfer another ₹4.70 lakh in the account of one Rajesh Kumar Khatri. But they could not be contacted after October 2014. Similarly, he was made to pay ₹75,000 in the account of Perimero Club Holiday, and ₹67,000 and ₹65,000 to different insurance companies. Later another person got him to transfer ₹21000 in the bank account of Care India Services. All these callers had lured him to get his money back from Davis Club, Lal told the police.On February 25, 2016, he got a message saying his file had been cleared and through one Om Prakash, he was made to invest ₹9.5 lakh in Prime Land Corporation for release of money, but they kept delaying the release date. Later, one Mohan Kumar Walia informed him via phone that in November 2016, after demonetisation, the income tax department had raided Davis Club company and found that it was working illegally. Lal was informed that the money he invested had been sent to SBI for repayment, but was told to pay ₹5,500 as cost of forms. However, he never received any bonus or his payments back, following which he contacted the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/retired-panjab-university-official-loses-48-lakh-to-fraudsters-promising-insurance-bonus-101625861192207.html

10-07-2021||Kolkata||Mukul Roy made PAC chairman in Bengal assembly, BJP walks out||Mukul Roy, who has joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) but is still officially a legislator of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was made chairman of the public accounts committee (PAC) of the West Bengal assembly on Friday as the budget session came to an end.BJP lawmakers staged a walkout in protest, saying the convention of an opposition MLA appointed as head of the PAC was violated. The party had nominated Ashok Lahiri, former chief economic adviser to the Centre and lawmaker from Balurghat, for the post.“We did not nominate Roy for inclusion in the PAC. The ruling party wants to spend government funds and keep the accounts as well. This is autocracy. The speaker violated convention,” said Suvendu Adhikari, BJP legislator and leader of the opposition in the assembly.Defending the decision of speaker Biman Banerjee, TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said, “There is no rule which says an opposition leader has to be made the PAC chairman. It is only a convention. The speaker is the sole authority to select the chairman. He has done the right thing.”The speaker told the House that Roy was selected because of his experience.That Roy could be made the PAC chairman had become somehow apparent on June 24 when chief minister Mamata Banerjee stoked speculations.“Anybody can file nomination papers for inclusion in the PAC. He (Roy) is a BJP member. He has been supported by Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. If required, we will support him too. We will win if there is an election. Let people see who is more powerful. The speaker takes these decisions,” Banerjee had told the reporters during a press conference.However, no election was held on Friday since the BJP had nominated six MLAs for inclusion in the PAC, which can have a maximum of 20 members. The TMC had named 14 MLAs, said Adhikari.According to rules, it is the discretion of the speaker to select the chairpersons of the various committees in the assembly. The Bengal assembly has 41 committees, of which PAC is considered the most important one.Earlier, the BJP and TMC got into a tussle on June 25 when 67-year-old Roy, who left the saffron camp and returned to the ruling party on June 11, filed his nomination for induction in the PAC.On June 18, the BJP submitted a petition before assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, saying Roy, the legislator from Krishnanagar North constituency in Nadia district, should be disqualified under anti-defection law as he did not resign from the BJP before switching sides.On June 26, the BJP submitted a letter to the speaker saying Roy’s nomination should be cancelled because the party did not nominate him. Stating that the BJP may seek legal action, the letter added that Roy should be disqualified under anti-defection law.The decision to disqualify a member is taken only by the speaker. The Constitution does not specify any time frame for the process, which involves inquiry and setting up of a committee.Adhikari, Mamata Banerjee’s protege-turned-adversary, joined the BJP in December last year and defeated her from Nandigram constituency in the recently concluded assembly polls. He filed the application for Roy’s disqualification. Roy, who joined the BJP in 2017 and became the party’s national vice-president, returned to the TMC along with his son Subhranshu, but did not officially resign from the BJP, said opposition leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mukul-roy-made-pac-chairman-in-bengal-assembly-bjp-walks-out-101625860057860.html
10-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh waste plant’s upgrade: Adviser warns MC against further delay||If the municipal corporation continues to drag its feet with regards to upgrade of the city’s only solid waste processing plant, the UT administration will take over the project, warned UT adviser Dharam Pal on Friday.In June last year, the civic body had taken over the plant from the Jaypee Group, as it could process only a fraction of the city’s daily waste that runs into 450 million tonnes.But since then, MC has neither improved the plant’s working nor upgraded the technology and most of the city’s daily waste is still being dumped at the Dadumajra landfill. “We can no longer allow the city’s waste to be dumped like this. We have to take up the issue with greater urgency,” said Pal, during his visit to the waste processing plant on Friday.Pal instructed MC commissioner KK Yadav to speed up the upgrade process, else UT will have to intervene in the matter.IIT Roorkee recommended new plantOn MC’s request, IIT Roorkee had compiled a report last year and advised that the best way was to set up a new modern 500 TPD (tonnes per day) plant for dry and wet waste treatment in the given plot.The report had stated that even after the existing machinery was repaired, the plant can at best run at only 40% of its total capacity.Nearly 10 months on, MC has not been able to decide which technology to use to upgrade the plant, constructed by the Jaypee group in 2008 as per the Municipal Solid Waste, 2000, guidelines.Thirteen companies even submitted their expressions of interest (EOI) in January this year. But in the last four General House meetings, the councillors only postponed taking a decision on the technology. This, after asking for presentations from firms, and touring waste processing plants in Ambala and Delhi. In the last meeting, they yet again decided to visit more plants.“A technology has been recommended by an expert committee of MC, but has been pending with the MC General House for some time now,” said Pal.“If they don’t decide on the technology immediately, we (UT), after the approval of the UT administrator, will take it in our hands,” said Pal after he was informed that a special session of the MC House will be called in mid-July to deal with the issue.Even after finalisation of the technology, it will take at least 18 months for the plant to work at its optimum efficiency, Pal said, so decision on the matter was immediately required.“We cannot afford to wait anymore. We want to process 100% of all the waste being processed in the city per day. This will be a very unique achievement in the country,” the adviser said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-waste-plant-s-upgrade-adviser-warns-mc-against-further-delay-101625860413121.html

The committee during the inspection found that untreated waste water and sewage from four towns is being discharged into ponds and drains due to the failure of the Moga administration and local civic bodies to complete the installation work of STPs.Municipal officials said there are 6 ponds in Fatehgarh Panjtoor, 1 in Kot Ise Khan, 3 in Badni Kalan and 2 in Nihal Singh Wala.The NGT in its order on May 21, 2020, had directed all civic bodies in the Malwa region to ensure setting up of STPs and work on connecting all the drains and other sources of sewage with them to prevent groundwater contamination.Justice Jasbir Singh (retired) said, “The work of installing STPs at Nihal Singh Wala, Bhadni Kalan, Kot Isse Khan and Fatehgarh Panjtoor is in slow progress and untreated waste water of these towns is falling into water bodies. Only the STPs at Moga and Dharamkot towns are functional while installation work of STP at Baghapurana has been completed. Even it is yet to get operational.”“We have directed the Moga deputy commissioner to expedite and complete work before the deadline or be ready to face environmental compensation. If they fail to complete the work on time, the compensation will be imposed on civic bodies concerned,” he added.According to the monitoring committee, some of STPs have deadlines till July 31 while others are given time till September 30.Seechewal, said, “An inspection report will be prepared and then submitted to the NGT for further action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngt-monitoring-panel-directs-moga-admn-to-expedite-installation-work-of-stps-101625859871761.html
10-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC restrains SIT from filing challan in derogatory poster case||The Punjab and Haryana high court has restrained the Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) probing the sacrilege cases from submitting chargesheet (challan) against an accused in a desecration incident wherein derogatory posters were pasted near the gurudwaras of Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages in Faridkot district on the intervening night of September 24 and 25 in 2015. The HC bench of Justice HNS Gill acted on the plea of Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, a Dera Sacha Sauda follower, who had demanded that the SIT be stopped from re-examining his handwriting samples for matching them with those on the posters. “Till the next date of hearing, the state is restrained from filing the challan in this case,” the HC ordered fixing July 15 as the next date of hearing. Sukhjinder had argued that the SIT is competent only to further investigate the matter and not reinvestigate it. “Once the CBI had got the petitioner’s handwriting samples compared from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) and found the same not matching with those on the incriminating posters, it is not open to the SIT again to send the samples for comparison,” his counsel had argued in the court. Sukhjinder is among four accused in the case besides Shakti Singh, Ranjit Singh and Baljeet Singh. On June 1 this year, the SIT collected samples of Sukhjinder to match them with the writing on the derogatory posters claiming that one of the posters was written by him. The SIT led by then deputy inspector general (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra in 2018 had claimed that the handwriting of the accused dera followers had matched with the ones on the posters. But the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in its closure report filed in a Mohali court in July 2019 said the handwriting samples of the accused dera followers it had sent to the CFSL in Delhi did not match with the ones on the posters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-restrains-sit-from-filing-challan-in-derogatory-poster-case-101625859812871.html
10-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab lifts night, weekend curfew from July 12; bars, cinema halls to open with rider||Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday ordered lifting of night and weekend curfew and allowed gatherings of 100 persons indoor and 200 outdoor in Punjab from Monday ( (July 12). Bars, cinema halls, restaurants, spas, swimming pools, gyms, malls, sports complexes, museums and zoos etc in the state will open provided the staff members and visitors have taken at least one dose of the vaccine, he said. Reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state through video-conferencing, he directed director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta to challan all political leaders violating the Covid rules while holding rallies and protest meetings. “The situation will again be reviewed on July 20. Strict use of masks must be ensured at all times,” he said. Though schools will continue to remain closed, colleges, coaching centres and all other institutions of higher learning shall be allowed to open by the deputy commissioners concerned, subject to a certificate having been submitted that all teaching, non-teaching staff and students have been given at least one dose of vaccination at least 2 weeks ago. Heath secretary Hussan Lal said four districts had shown positivity rate of 1% or less, but they still needed to be vigilant in case of Ludhiana, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Firozepur and Rupnagar districts. Referring to the cases of mucormycosis, or back fungus, which has been reported among 623 people as of July 8, the CM asked the health department to prepare a proposal for supporting and helping in the treatment of such patients. Of the 623 cases, 67 are from outside the state, the health secretary said, adding that 337 patients were under treatment, 154 had been discharged while 51 persons had died. Amarinder noted that due to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) in place and the level of Covid and post-Covid care, Punjab has had fewer black fungus cases and deaths than most other states, including Haryana and Delhi. Against 623 cases and 51 confirmed deaths so far in Punjab, both Haryana and Delhi have seen over 1,600 cases each, and 193 and 236 deaths respectively, he added. CM okays ₹380 crore for third wave preparationThe Punjab government on Friday approved ₹380 crore to set up more oxygen plants and other necessary health infrastructure to deal with an anticipated third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.The amount approved by the CM shall be spent on PSA (pressure swing adsorption) oxygen plants, cryogenic liquid medical oxygen tanks, ambulances, among others.The CM approved ₹380 crore to be spent by the health, and medical education departments in preparing for a possible third wave of the Covid pandemic, an official release said.The CM said funds have never been allowed to become a constraint in the state government’s response to Covid and they will continue to be made available even in the future, according to requirement.At a virtual Covid-19 review meeting, the CM also gave a go ahead for filling of posts of medical specialists, nurses along with 330 faculty posts in the Patiala and Amritsar medical colleges.He also asked the departments to bring the proposal for any additional posts needed to the cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-lifts-night-weekend-curfew-from-july-12-bars-cinema-halls-to-open-with-rider-101625859811771.html
10-07-2021||Chandigarh||SIT files chargesheet against 6 Dera Sacha Sauda followers in Bargari sacrilege case||The special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege incidents in Punjab on Friday filed a chargesheet in a Faridkot court against six Dera Sacha Sauda followers in the Bargari desecration case. The 500-page chargesheet was filed in the court of judicial magistrate Tarjani against Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, Nishan Singh, Ranjit Singh, alias Bhola, and Pardeep Kumar, all residents of Kotkapura; Shakti Singh of Daggu Romana village and Baljit Singh of Sikhanwala village in Faridkot district. The challan was filed under sections 295 (destroying, damaging or defiling any place of worship, or any object held sacred), 295-A (malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information), 120-B (being party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence) and 153-A (promoting enmity between groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence or language etc) of Indian Penal Code. On May 16 this year, the SIT led by inspector general of police (border range) Surinder Pal Singh Parmar had arrested the six sect followers in connection with the Bargari sacrilege episode. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of a bir (copy of Guru Granth Sahib), which was stolen from the Burj Jawahar Singh Wala gurdwara, were found scattered near a shrine at Bargari. Later, Sukhjinder, Shakti, Ranjit and Baljeet were named as accused in another sacrilege incident wherein two derogatory posters were pasted near the Bargari gurdwara on the intervening night of September 24 and 25 in 2015. The SIT probe has found that the accused had scattered the torn pages of ‘bir’ stolen from the Burj Jawahar Singh Wala Gurdwara on October 12, 2015 at Bargari. The SIT has also named three absconding members of the Sirsa-based dera’s national committee as conspirators in both cases. They are Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kaler and Harsh Dhuri, all Haryana residents. The probe team has also filed an application along with the chargesheet for initiating proceedings to declare the three as proclaimed offenders (POs). In November 2015, the Akali-BJP government had handed over the probe into the three sacrilege incidents to the CBI. But the Punjab Police’s SIT probing other desecration cases claimed to have traced all the three incidents in 2018. The CBI did not agree with the SIT probe findings and filed a closure report in the three cases in July 2019. The Congress government, led by Captain Amarinder Singh, took back the cases from the CBI and handed over the probe to the SIT led by IG (now retired) Ranbir Singh Khatra. In July last year, the SIT named jailed Sirsa-based dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, three national committee members as accused and filed a chargesheet against seven sect followers in the case of theft of ‘bir’ from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 1, 2015. However, the SIT has not named the dera chief in Bargari sacrilege case so far. In January this year, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed the CBI to hand over the diaries and papers relating to the probe into the three sacrilege incidents to the Punjab Police and asked the state government to replace the then SIT head IG Khatra. In February, IG Parmar replaced Khatra as the new SIT head.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sit-files-chargesheet-against-6-dera-sacha-sauda-followers-in-bargari-sacrilege-case-101625859695614.html
10-07-2021||Chandigarh||Same Covid guidelines not applicable on entire state: Himachal high court||Observing that same set of guidelines cannot be applied for the entire state due to variance of corona-related issues in different districts, the high court of Himachal Pradesh on Friday directed to constitute a district monitoring committee in the state. The division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua passed these orders on a petition taken up suo motu by the court as public interest litigation and another writ petition highlighting the inadequate facilities in the state for the treatment of Covid patients. The court directed that the committee will consist of the deputy commissioner of each district, secretary of the district legal services authority and president of the bar association at the district headquarter.In case, the president of the district bar association is a senior citizen and not willing to participate in the committee, he may nominate another person on his behalf, to do so, said the court.The DC will be the chairperson of the committee.The HC directed that the panel will visit the towns, cities and villages in the respective districts to ascertain the Covid situation and whether the assistance from the government is adequate to meet the challenges thereon. The court said that the committee will also ascertain as to what is required to be done to contain the virus spread and to ensure preparedness for the third wave.The committee will also visit the primary health care centres, the areas where the medical facilities are provided and it may seek the assistance of any other person in the performance of their duties and all the activities of the committee will be in tune with the prevalent SOPs and guidelines regarding Covid, the HC directed.The panel will submit a weekly report to the registry of the court on or before the Tuesday of every week by e-mail and the bench would interact with the committee on July 14 through videoconferencing.The court directed that the committee’s first meeting will be held on July 10 and it may meet as many times as required.During the course of hearing, the advocate general apprised the court of the efforts made by the state in order to control the spread of Covid-19. The court observed that it is aware of the work done by the state, but more is required to be done as the issues pertaining to each district vary and there cannot be a same set of guidelines for the entire state and thus a local monitoring committee would be more useful in such circumstances.The court directed that the related matters will be taken up by the court every Wednesday at 2pm to consider the reports that would be filed on Tuesday.The case will be next heard on July 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/same-covid-guidelines-not-applicable-on-entire-state-himachal-high-court-101625859575465.html
10-07-2021||Chandigarh||Covid cases dip in J&K, but health experts warn against complacency||Though Covid count is down in J&K, doctors and health experts have cautioned that if people continue to violate the safety protocols, the caseload may surge in the weeks to come. Since June 25, the UT has recorded below-10 daily fatalities with two deaths each on July 3, 4 and 6. The overall number of people who have recovered reached 3,10,630 prompting the recovery rate to climb to 97.59%.Currently in J&K, active cases have dropped to 3,300 from more than 50,000 in May. However, with Covid-appropriate behaviour going for a toss, there is a slight rise in infections at some places in the UT, though officials said it’s premature to call it a surge as the recovery rate is improving daily.Professor and head of community medicine at Srinagar GMC, Dr Mohammad Saleem Khan, said the drop in Covid cases and deaths is an encouraging indication of winning the fight against second wave. “But this has resulted in casualness among people towards Covid-appropriate behaviour and adherence to SOPs, which poses serious threat,” he said, adding that the third wave of Covid would be highly dangerous and fatal. Dr Khan suggested that in order to keep the impact of the third wave under control, people need to follow previously fixed guidelines. “Crowding the markets, health resorts and marriage ceremonies without wearing masks and no regard for social distancing is unsolicited and unbecoming behaviour,” he said.“People may go out, but strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour is needed to avoid possible third wave,” he added,while recommending and emphasising on vaccination and terming it a strong tool to fight against the pandemic. Dr Javid Iqbal, senior consultant at Baramulla Medical College, said they receive very few patients nowadays. “The way people have started neglecting SOPs, cases could again go up. People should behave responsibly as virus is still out there,” he added. Dr Masraat, block medical officer, Bandipore, said the war against Covid hasn’t been won yet. “Third wave is still pending, for which we should be ready. If Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed, then only we can win this war, but people have lowered their guards.” Advocate Musdasir Naqshbandi, who arranges oxygen machines and cylinders for people in need, said despite the lowest number of cases, their group has to help patients with oxygen at home on daily basis. “Many people believe that war against this deadly virus has been won which is still not true as cases come everyday and any misstep could prove dangerous.”Officials have claimed that the vaccination is on target and more than 50.46 lakh doses have been administered in the UT. People above 45 years in nine out of 20 districts have been 100% inoculated, they added. However, experts said only 5% people in J&K have received both the doses and over 30% one dose. They said the process needs to be accelerated to prevent the third wave. 262 fresh infections reported in UTMeanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir on Friday recorded one Covid-related death, lowest in the past 88 days, and 262 fresh infections, which took the overall caseload to 3,18,284. The death toll stands at 4,354.The number of patients who were cured in the UT was 304. The officials said that 60,562 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours in the UT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-cases-dip-in-j-k-but-health-experts-warn-against-complacency-101625859092882.html

10-07-2021||Lucknow||Samajwadi Party announces protests across Uttar Pradesh on July 15 over alleged poll irregularities||The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Friday announced it would hold statewide demonstrations on July 15 against what it called the “rigging of zila panchayat chairpersons’ and block pramukh polls” in Uttar Pradesh even as SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said his party was “preparing a list of all those district administration and police officials who conducted themselves like BJP workers” in these elections. The SP chief also said: “On return to power in the 2022 assembly polls, the government will act on all such officers. The Samajwadi Party will never forget the atrocities that were perpetrated first to win the zila panchayat (chairpersons’) and then the block pramukh polls. The BJP engaged in hooliganism and the district administration, police officers worked as BJP cadre. The party is preparing a list of all such officers.” While the district panchayat chief polls were held on July 3, the block pramukh elections in the state are scheduled on Saturday (July 10). The SP chief was addressing a party workers’ meeting at the party’s state headquarters here on Friday afternoon. The announcement about the protests on July 15 was made through a statement issued by the party on the eve of the block pramukh elections. “The state election commission (SEC) did not do its duty. The government should say who allowed all this hooliganism statewide?” he asked. In the recent zila panchayat chairperson’ polls, BJP won 65 of the 75 seats while SP could win only five. On the nomination day on Thursday, the SP chief had accused the BJP and the district administration and police officers of preventing many candidates from filing their nominations. “The BJP’s mask has fallen. Samajwadi Party workers and leaders are being harassed and cases are being filed against them,” he said. He also said the people would bring the Samajwadi Party to power in the 2022 UP assembly polls. In a statement, the SP said its party workers, kshetra panchayat members, zila panchayat, gram panchayat members and heads, apart from all the frontal organizations, will participate in the protest. “The SP cadre will protest at the tehsils and blocks. The protestors will submit memorandums addressed to the governor,” said the SP statement. The memorandum will also try to attract the governor’s attention to price rise, the law and order situation, unemployment, three new central farm laws, misbehaviour with women, crumbling health services, fake cases against SP workers and misuse of power by the BJP government, said Rajendra Chaudhary, the SP spokesperson, in the statement. Chaudhary said that the party had asked its workers to follow Covid safety norms during the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/samajwadi-party-announces-protests-across-u-p-on-july-15-over-alleged-poll-irregularities-101625858851082.html
10-07-2021||Lucknow||Medical staff boycott work for two hours in UP, demand no-transfer policy for 2021||The medical staff in Uttar Pradesh resorted to a two-hour work-boycott on Friday, demanding “no transfers” during the current year for all the health employees working in government-run facilities.The statewide call for the work-boycott was given by the Chikitsa Swasthya Mahasangh (Health Federation). The protest began at 8am.“All the hospital staff have worked since March 2020 without any leave. Even at present, we are preparing for the probable third wave of Covid-19 and working day and night, as required. There is no reason why transfers can’t be postponed as there are many health workers who have either recovered from Covid or have family members struggling with post-Covid complications,” said Ashok Kumar of the Rajkiya Nurses Sangh, an organisation of nurses working in government hospitals.The protestors said that instead of shifting the staff and issuing a fresh list, the pending applications of those employees who themselves are seeking transfers can be entertained. This would come to more than the target decided by the health department for the transfer of 20% of the total staff, they said.“Of the total of about 8000 staff nurses working in Uttar Pradesh, the health department needs to transfer 1100 and the applications submitted by staff nurses (personal requests for transfer) is 1500. Similar applications are pending from lab technicians, pharmacists, doctors and other staff members,” said Ashok Kumar.“Such applications may be filtered and those found fit under the criteria laid down for transfer shall be acted upon to make sure transfers are done without actually disturbing the staff or putting them at risk,” said Dr Amit Singh, general secretary of the Provincial medical Services Association (PMSA), a body of about 14000 government doctors in Uttar Pradesh.“Whenever you make a phone call, the voice message first says stay home and come out only if very necessary. Are the transfers so necessary that even the risk of life appears small before it?” asked Sunil Yadav, head of the Pharmacist Federation Uttar Pradesh.“We have already given representations to senior health officials and now we will hold a massive protest at the health directorate on July 12, if our demands are not met,” said Dr Amit Singh.The state has 167 district level hospitals, 855 community health centres, 3621 primary health centres, 129 mother and child hospitals and 42 trauma centres that have a total of about one lakh staff.“As many as 20% of these were to be transferred, but this can be deferred this year. And we are ready for the transfers in 2022 once the Covid pandemic is over,” said Ashok Kumar.Patient-care hit in Lucknow, stir to continue on Saturday as wellPatient care services were hit here on Friday when health care workers under the banner of the Chikitsa Swasthya Mahasangh observed a two-hour work boycott opposing the transfer policy. They will continue the work-boycott on Saturday as well.Since 8am, the staff gathered at the main entrance of the Civil Hospital in the state capital, raising slogans while people in queue waited to get OPD (outpatient department) tickets made. The staff staged protest at all major government-run hospitals in the state capital, including BRD Hospital, Balrampur Hospital, Lok Bandhu Raj Narain Hospital and Rani Laxmibai (RLB) Hospital.“I had to give my fasting and PP (post prandial) samples for checking blood sugar levels. The sampling will start only after 10am. Hence, I am going back and will be here again next week. I can’t visit the hospital thrice. PP sample has to be given after meal. That requires me to go back home after giving the fasting blood sample,” said an elderly patient who had come to give blood sample.Many patients who came for sampling, x-rays, ultrasound tests, CT scans, and other pathological tests kept waiting, while a few went back. Barring emergency services, doctors and nurses, ward boys and technicians didn’t work till 10am.The patients who went to government hospitals had a tough time. Some of these hospitals included Balrampur Hospital, Dufferin, RLB Hospital, and community healthcare centres (CHCs).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/medical-staff-boycott-work-for-two-hours-in-uttar-pradesh-demand-no-transfer-policy-for-2021-101625858191913.html
10-07-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra may see a few relaxations soon||Amid stabilisation of the daily caseload and pressure from citizens for more relaxations, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to review the Covid-19 situation in the next few days. Although experts have advised against blanket relaxations, the state may consider easing a few curbs in districts with low test positivity rate (TPR) and high vaccination cover.Thackeray on Friday chaired a meeting of the state disaster management authority (SDMA), which was attended by top government officials and experts from the state’s Covid task force.While a decision on relaxation of ongoing curbs was not taken in the meeting, the CM informed officials they will consider them after the review meeting with the task force.Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the task force, said the government could think of the relaxations in a graded manner from July 15. “The relaxations could be on a case-by-case basis and in phases. The districts with TPR below 5% for consecutive two weeks, vaccine cover of more than 70% may get relaxations. We have a long way to achieve 70% vaccination, the mandatory public health yardstick,” said Dr Joshi.“We are considering doing away with the tests for fully vaccinated domestic fliers. Apart from it, a few more relaxations are likely to be considered in operation of shops and commercial establishments. The task force members are still against opening up of the trains for general public and any relaxation in commuting is unlikely at least for a few more weeks,” said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department.Dr Joshi, however, has a word of caution on opening up of local trains in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). “Till then, we could adhere to rapid, spot testing and mass screening to enable calibrated relaxations. People will have to strictly follow the restrictions of Covid-appropriate behaviour, so the second wave does not lead into the third wave,” said Dr Joshi.“Rather than easing curbs in haste, it is better to be on the cautious side, otherwise it could land us in the third wave early. We should not repeat the mistake we committed between the first and second wave. The opening up of trains led to initiation of the second wave which hit Mumbai in the second week of March, six weeks after the decision of allowing general people from first week of February. It was the time gap required for the spread of the virus. The opening up of trains has direct correlation with the wave and thus we have to be very careful while allowing activities,” said Dr Joshi.Another officer said that the state government is under tremendous pressure from the people for relaxations, and opening up of trains for public. “The genome sequencing of Delta-plus strain has proved that it is not highly transmissible than the other variants. Except for eight districts, other parts of the state have not been witnessing high number of cases. In such districts, there is no point continuing with the curbs,” he said, requesting anonymity.The districts – Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Satara, Raigad, Palghar, Kolhapur, Rural Pune – have been reporting high TPR of more than 5% causing a concern for the state administration. The administration is more concerned about Kolhapur as despite 65% of the vaccination the district is witnessing high positivity rate. The local administration has been directed to increase testing, contact tracing and aggressively monitoring micro containment policy.The CM has expressed his concern over people being infected even after getting fully vaccinated and has asked the administration to check with the Centre if the booster of an additional dose would work in such cases.Dr Suhas Joshi, who heads state-appointed the task force of paediatrics surgeons, has suggested the government come up with standard operating procedures for schools before their opening. He suggested the government, which has announced opening up schools for above Class 8 in the districts with fewer cases, to go on cautiously.Meanwhile, higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said the colleges would not open at least for a month. “Opening up of colleges will lead to students crowding at one place which could lead to the spread among them. They could further infect their parents and people around leading to the early third wave. We have not made any arrangement to open colleges at least for a month,” he said.The State Election Commission too announced to put the local body bye-elections in five districts on hold in the wake of the high case of Covid-19. The bypolls were slated on July 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-may-see-a-few-relaxations-soon-101625858071082.html

Mayor Balkar Sandhu, who was leading the committee, batted for installation of an “energy to waste” plant to deal with the 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage that is generated in the city everyday.During the visit, the committee visited the plant of a private firm in Okhla, which has been generating electricity from around 1,800 metric tonnes of garbage and isn’t charging the MC.In Okhla, the firm is using around 15 acres of MC land and 22 KW of electricity is produced from around 1,800 metric tonnes of garbage which is shifted to the plant site by the MC. Only 10% of the waste is left behind after the process and the company is earning revenue by selling off the power produced at the plant. “We are also struggling to dispose off the garbage dumped at the main dump site, where heaps of waste can be seen accumulated. The MC will soon float tenders to hire a contractor and a waste to energy plant will probably be established in the city,” said Mayor.The committee members included mayor Balkar Sandhu, senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra, councillors Dr Jai Prakash, Gurdeep Neetu, Harbhajan Singh Dang, Om Prakash Ratra, Swarandeep Chahal and Baljinder Bunty; superintending engineer Rajinder Singh, secretary Jasdev Sekhon, health officer Vipal Malhotra and assistant engineer Harpal Aujla. The committee also visited a unit of the same company in Bhiwadi (Rajasthan), where the company manufactures machinery like static compactors and mechanical sweeping machines.Leader of opposition in MC house, SAD councillor Dang said, “We support the proposal to establish a waste to energy plant in the city. During the visit to Rajasthan, I also urged the mayor to select quality machines for mechanical sweeping in the city.”An MC committee had also visited Chennai last month to study solid waste management model there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-panel-bats-for-establishment-of-waste-to-energy-plant-in-city-101625858012009.html

The commission is planning to start the probe with the deposition of witnesses, including Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, to complete the hearing before reaching on to a conclusion.The proceedings of the commission were stopped owing to the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak last March, when it had completed the deposition of 35 witnesses in relation to the caste-based riots that had occurred in February 2018.VV Palnitkar, the secretary of the commission, said, “We have decided to start the proceedings from August 2, provided that the state government gives us facilities to conduct virtual hearings, considering the pandemic situation. We are also waiting for an extension order from the state as the tenure of the commission needs to be officially extended.”Earlier, the commission was asked to complete its inquiry by April 8, 2020. The state government is likely to grant extension to the commission till December.Lawyer Ashish Satpute, representing the commission, said, “We were deposing witnesses from Pune when the pandemic had hit the state and proceedings had to be stopped. We will start from there. Thereafter, witnesses from Mumbai will be asked to depose. The list also includes the name of NCP chief [Pawar],” he said.The panel had decided to allow the veteran leader to depose before it in response to an affidavit in which Pawar had expressed his willingness to do so. In his October 2018 affidavit, Pawar had said he was not in a position to blame any particular organisation for the violence. But on February 18, 2020, Pawar alleged that right-wing activists Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote were responsible for creating animosity among locals ahead of the 200th anniversary celebrations of the 1818 Battle of Koregaon at the war memorial in Pune district, which led to violence on January 1, 2018. To probe the riots, the previous Devendra Fadnavis government had set up a commission on January 1, 2018. Pune Police had filed cases against activists linked to the Elgar Parishad conclave held on December 31, 2017, accusing them of having Maoist links and inciting violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bhimakoregaon-case-panel-to-resume-functioning-from-august-to-ask-pawar-to-depose-101625857292457.html

The complainant, a Congress worker who hails from Fatehgarh Sahib, has also accused, Paramjit Singh, the sarpanch of Toosa village of helping Nirmal Singh alias Gopi. The two sarpanches are also affiliated with the Congress. The 35-year-old woman, a divorcee, said she had come to Dakha to help canvass for the Congress during the 2019 general election. Paramjit Singh had introduced her to Gopi during the campaign.The complainant said Gopi had told her that her wife could not bear a child and they were headed for divorce. He promised to marry her once the proceedings were over. She said on July 3, 2020 and July 11, 2020, Gopi had taken her to different hotels and established physical relations with her without her consent. Later, the accused refused to marry her.Assistant sub-inspector Jagdish Singh, who is investigating the case, said an FIR under Sections 376 (when a public servant commits rape), 420 (cheating), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. Gopi alleged that the woman was blackmailing him. “When I refused to give her money, she lodged a police complaint against me. This is a bogus charge as the entire region was under lockdown in July 2020. I could not possibly have taken her to hotels as she claims,” he said. The Sudhar police had booked Gopi and the Rajoana Kalan secretary for embezzlement on January 6.

The woman had attempted to end her life at her house on July 2. In her suicide note, she had accused 12 people, inspector Bittan Kumar, posted at Ludhiana Police Line, his father Surinder Atwal, who is the councillor of the ward 84, Bittan’s brothers Sajan Atwal and Pawan Atwal, uncle Jaspal Singh, his son-in-law Ravinder Singh and others, for forcing her to take the extreme step as they were allegedly attempting to grab her property and harassing her. The next day her family had lodged a complaint with the commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal, who had asked additional deputy commissioner of police-1 Pragya Jain to hold a probe. However, as no FIR was registered, the victim’s family have lodged a fresh complaint. The victim’s brother has alleged that the inspector has threatened to implicate him in a forged case and his allies have been harassing them. The complainant said he had stopped stepping out of his house as he feared that he would be harmed or implicated in a trumped-up case. “The police are asking us to submit my sister’s original suicide note, but we have submitted a copy as the police could destroy the note. If the police keep threatening us, I will end my life as well. I have already written a suicide note and handed it over to one of my friends,” he said.The complainant said that their mother, who is illiterate, wanted to transfer the ownership of two properties in his sister’s name in 2013. But, the realtor, Jaspal, fraudulently managed to transfer a part of the property in his son-in-law Ravinder’s name, while ownership of the rest was given to Pardeep Kumar, the inspector’s uncle. The accused allegedly also made his sister sign the documents on the pretext of transferring the property in her name. Later, they started harassing her to vacate the property, which forced her to take the extreme step, her brother alleged.Inspector Bittan Kumar has refuted the allegations and has said that he does not know the woman. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are 011-23389090 from Sumaitri (Delhi-based) and 044-24640050 from Sneha Foundation (Chennai-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/woman-who-attempted-suicide-over-alleged-harassment-by-ludhiana-cop-succumbs-101625857232500.html

They collect water from the Ganga (usually at Haridwar in Uttarakhand) and offer it at Shiva temples in their respective states after covering hundreds of kilometres on foot. The Kanwar Yatra was not held last year due to the Covid-19 situation. All preparations for yatra should be completed on time, the chief minister said. In view of the Covid protocol, dialogue should be established with various kanwar associations across the state, he said, adding that officials should ensure that there was no unnecessary assembly of crowds.They should remain vigilant during the yatra, he said.The festival of Bakrid will also be celebrated around the beginning of Shravan and the district administration and police officers should maintain vigil during the festivity, he said.Although the state government had controlled the second wave of Covid, it was necessary to take precautions at every level, he said. The Covid-19 protocol should be implemented, along with respecting public sentiments and faith, he said.The officers should pay special attention to cleanliness in Shiva temples and yatra routes in the rural and urban areas where streetlights should be installed, the chief minister said.Officials should ensure that devotees were able to perform ‘jalabhishek’ comfortably, he said, calling for round the clock electricity supply and drinking water arrangements on all the routes. The officers should establish a dialogue with the representatives of religious and voluntary organisations, he said. He also said the yatra should be conducted in a peaceful atmosphere. He directed the divisional commissioners and police zone officers to hold meetings with district and range officers to review preparations for the yatra. Additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi, DGP Mukul Goyal, ACS health) Amit Mohan Prasad, principal secretary (to CM and information) Sanjay Prasad were also present at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ensure-complete-adherence-to-covid-norms-during-kanwar-yatra-yogi-tells-u-p-officials-101625857111763.html

Three of these MPs had joined the party in the past few years, which has led to discontent among hardcore BJP leaders.Heena Gavit from North Maharashtra and Ranjitsinh Naik Nimbalkar from western part of the state are also unhappy for missing the ministerial berths. State leaders reportedly spoke to Gavit and assured her of ‘key responsibility’ in the future. According to party insiders, Gavit’s induction was believably opposed by former state ministers and north Maharashtra BJP leaders Girish Mahajan and Jaikumar Rawal.Party leaders from Vidarbha region also expressed their concerns over the exclusion of minister of state Sanjay Dhotre from the Union government. Dhotre is considered to be a close confidante of Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The Kunbi community, which is dominant in Vidarbha, is already upset after tickets were denied to community leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule in 2019 Assembly polls as well as to Anil Sole in the Council polls last year. Dhotre’s exlusion could add to the resentment further as the party now has only one minister (Gadkari) representing 11 districts of the region.Though none of the leaders have expressed their discontent openly, Munde’s supporters had gathered outside her Worli residence on Thursday. They spoke publicly against the party’s decision of not inducting Pritam, a two-term MP from Beed, the constituency represented by her late father Gopinath, who was a prominent BJP leader from Maharashtra. Several Munde supporters also expressed their anguish on social media posts. Few of them even held Maharashtra’s leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis responsible for Pritam’s exclusion from the cabinet expansion. A visibly disgruntled Munde held a press conference to clarify that her family was not unhappy. “My family and I are not unhappy with the development and it is not true that we were vying for the cabinet berth. We did not contact any leader for the ministry. We accept the decision taken by the leadership as it is likely to be in the interest of the party. The party must have thought it necessary to expand the base. Even if a single vote is added in favour of the party, the step should be welcomed. Leaders who have got the berth are part of our family and are followers of later Gopinath Mundeji. I have already extended my wishes to them,” she said.She, however, added that her and her father’s followers are unhappy. “I would not deny that followers and workers are unhappy. But I’ll try to pacify them,” she said.When asked if Fadnavis’s imprint was there on the names picked from the state and if the chosen ministers were from ‘Team Devendra’, she said, “There is no Team Devendra or Team Narendra in our party. Nobody is above the party and the nation for us. I do not think there is any plan hatched to finish me politically.”Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana in its editorial on Friday said that Pritam’s exclusion is an attempt by the BJP leadership to finish Munde politically. It also stated that choosing Dr Karad over Pritam was an attempt to divide OBCs in the state.Responding to reports of leaders being upset, Fadnavis said, “We don’t have any factionalism or differences within the party. BJP doesn’t believe in cutting short to size to any leader. In fact, Dr Karad is an ardent follower of late Gopinathji Munde and I believe that like any other worker, Pankaja Munde will be happy with the decision [of inducting Dr Karad]. Pankajatai said in BJP, the nation is the supreme most and then comes the party and self. We all believe in the same doctrine.” “Saamana’s jibe is not surprising as it has never been our well-wisher. The mouthpiece has never had any good words for BJP,” Fadnavis added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/not-me-my-followers-are-unhappy-with-my-sister-s-cabinet-exclusion-pankaja-munde-101625857112289.html

Trashing the Akali chief’s announcements for families of farmers who sacrificed their lives fighting against the three farm laws of the central government, the CM termed these as a last-ditch effort by Sukhbir to woo back farmers, whom his party had alienated on issue of these very laws. “Do you think Punjab’s farmers are fools to be taken in by your desperate statements?” asked the CM, adding that Sukhbir must stop cheating the people of the state with such deceitful announcements. “How do you propose to do something that has already been done?” he remarked, adding that “We had made these announcements while you were still busy conspiring with your political masters, the BJP, to destroy our farmers.” Ridiculing Sukhbir’s dream of the Akalis coming to power in Punjab, the CM added that with his frivolous promises, the SAD president had proved his total absence of any connect with the people on the ground. Pointing out that his government was already giving compensation of ₹5 lakh each to the families of such farmers, the CM said, of 237 Punjab farmers who had died so far during the ongoing agitation, the families of 191 had already got the recompense. “Compensation for the rest of the families was also under process and would be paid long before the Akalis even finalise their campaign for the elections,” he said, pointing out that he had announced jobs for the kin of deceased farmers several months ago and the revenue department was in the advanced stages of finalising candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/check-your-facts-before-making-frivolous-promises-capt-to-sukhbir-101625856331586.html

He also promised free education to their children till post-graduation. “Over 550 farmers have been martyred in the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws, which has been on for over seven months. Once in power, we will look after these families,” he claimed, adding that farmers camping on the borders of Delhi were facing inclement weather and state repression.  “We are committed to ensuring the farmers get their just dues.Once we are voted to power we will implement the promises made to martyr families in the very first meeting of the state cabinet,” he said, adding that the SAD-BSP government would also ensure free medical insurance of such families. ‘Don’t victimise officers for power shortage’Responding to Punjab cooperation and jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s statement, where he sought to blame officers for the current power crisis in the state, SAD claimed that this was an attempt to hide chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s failure as the state’s power minister. SAD Kisan Wing president Sikander Singh Maluka said Randhawa should call a spade a spade. “It does not behove a senior minister to act in such a meek manner and try to hide the truth which is before the people. Amarinder has failed to do his duty as the power minister first by shuttering himself in his farm house and not holding any review meeting of the state electricity utility and then by constantly trooping to Delhi to save his chair.

10-07-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh gets first of its kind situation room for disaster management||The Madhya Pradesh government developed a first of its kind situation room from where the chief minister and other officers will be able to keep an eye on every corner of the state, level of water in dams and rivers, traffic conditions, religious places and different fairs, an officer said. The situation room has been set up in Bhopal for disaster management and to avert any untoward incident in the state. The room was set up by using existing infrastructure without any expenses, said Rajesh Rajora, additional chief secretary, home. “The situation room will get live feed of all the CCTV, which have been installed by the different department including urban administration, traffic police, rural development, health and other in a different part of the cities. Similarly, it will get a live report of the level of water in different rivers and dams of the state. Indian Meteorological department has also been connected with situation room to get all the alerts,” said Rajora. Last year in August, as many as 14 people died due to floods and incessant rainfall. More than 26 districts have been affected badly due to sudden floods. Heavy loss of property and crops had been reported after this. The flood disaster was one of the worst in the past decade. In another incident, a bus fell into a canal in Rewa and claimed the lives of more than 50 people as the driver changed the route to avoid traffic jams. Despite complaints about traffic jams due to poor roads, nobody reviewed the situation. In these incidents, it was found that the officers couldn’t get an idea of the situation due to a communication gap. Now, after the complaint on CM Helpline, the ministers and officers will review the condition from Bhopal through the situation room said the officer. Now, the officers will be alerted much prior to control the situation. “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and other ministers need not go for a survey immediately as they will get an update in the situation room. For places with no CCTVs, the officers will use drones to capture the condition and will send it to the situation room,” said Manish Rastogi, principal secretary, chief minister office. The state government is also setting up or renovating control and command centre in every district. However, Congress said the situation room is nothing but a power room that will be used to control district officers. “It is good to have a centralised control system to avert national disaster but what is the need of having a live feed of roads and other places? The CM wants to control everything from Vallabh Bhavan,” said JP Dhanopia, spokesperson, MP Congress Committee. BJP leaders feel that now it’s become a habit of Congress leaders to raise doubt on everything. BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “This is a first of its kind situation room in India and this is for disaster management. But Congress leaders are unnecessarily raising doubt on everything. They forgot to raise constructive issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-gets-first-of-its-kind-situation-room-for-disaster-management-101625855731540.html

The meeting, which continued for three hours, was held at the chief minister’s residence at Kalighat in south Kolkata. Her nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee was also present. TMC leaders aware of the development said that following Kishor’s advice, Mamata Banerjee wants to firmly enforce the one-man-one-post policy in the party and give more importance to young leaders to shake up the rank and file. Some major announcements are likely to be made next week. “The changes will be made in view of the civic body election, which are overdue, as well as the 2023 panchayat polls and Lok Sabha polls in 2024. The BJP will surely put up a tough fight in all coming elections,” said a senior TMC leader who did not want to be named. The chief minister is also keen to see the TMC playing a decisive role in the next Lok Sabha polls. On June 22, prominent opposition leaders and civil society members assembled at Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s residence in Delhi and discussed issues that may help regional forces project an alternative before voters.The meeting took place after Kishor met Pawar twice. Former BJP leader and Union minister Yashwant Sinha, who joined the TMC in March this year, convened the meeting on behalf of Rashtra Manch, an anti-BJP platform that he co-founded in 2018. Since the Congress did not attend it, the issue of forming a third front was not discussed, leaders who were present, later said. The meeting was attended by National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, Rashtriya Lok Dal’s Jayant Chaudhary, NCP’s Praful Patel, Aam Aadmi Party’s Sushil Gupta, Communist Party of India’s Binoy Viswam and Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s Nilotpal Basu. They discussed issues such as fuel price rise, unemployment and the need for social stability and harmony.After achieving a resounding victory over the BJP in the recent assembly elections, the TMC, in June, renewed its contract with the Indian Political Action Committee, or I-PAC, the company launched by Kishor, till the next Lok Sabha polls. Kishor declared that he had quit I-PAC and his team would function on its own. He said he would play a different role. Soon, Kishor was seen meeting leaders in different states. Mamata Banerjee plans to consolidate anti-BJP forces and contest polls in other states with a target to win elections. This was officially declared by Abhishek Banerjee on June 8. The young Lok Sabha MP declared on that say that his party will set up units in other states with the sole aim to win assembly elections and face the BJP head-on. Although he did not name any state, senior TMC leaders HT talked to said, the party is exploring the possibility of contesting in some big states rather than eyeing the smaller ones first.States that go to the polls in 2022 are Manipur, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat. The TMC has no presence in any of these states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/prashant-kishor-mamata-banerjee-discuss-anti-bjp-alliance-structural-shake-up-in-tmc-101625855552285.html
10-07-2021||Mumbai||Illegal phone tapping: DGP to head committee, report in three months||The Maharashtra government on Friday formed a three-member committee headed by director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey to probe the allegations of tapping of phones of elected representatives during the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis government. Ashutosh Dumbre, commissioner, state intelligence department (SID), and Sunil Kolhe, additional commissioner of police, special branch, are the other members of the committee. The panel will check if the phones were tapped illegally for political motives and will fix the responsibility on those involved in it. The committee has been asked to submit its report in three months. “The committee has been asked to investigate all phone tapping cases conducted in the past five years between 2015 and 2019. It will examine if the phones of elected representatives were tapped for ulterior political motives and by illegal means. It will also fix responsibility of those found involved in it,” stated an order issued by the state home department on Friday. The decision came two days after state home minister Dilip Walse-Patil announced a high-level probe while speaking in the Maharashtra Assembly. The ruling legislators raised the issue in the Assembly on Tuesday after Nana Patole, state Congress chief and legislator, informed that his phone was tapped during the Fadnavis government. He said that this was done with other elected representatives as well. “In 2016-17, my phone was tapped by the previous government by giving a dummy name — Amjad Khan. It was done on the grounds of narcotics smuggling. Who gave the order to tap my phone needs to be investigated,” Patole said, in the Assembly on Tuesday. “Phones of other public representatives were also tapped. Such acts are alarming for all. It is an attempt to destroy the public life of public representatives. Democracy is in danger…If legislators are being threatened in the Assembly, they will face the same fate which Anil Deshmukh and Chhagan Bhujbal are facing,” he added. “If the phones are being tapped using a dummy name, the matter needs to be investigated. In my view, it is a very serious issue and I declare a high-level probe in the matter. All those guilty will face strict action,” Walse-Patil said in response to the demand for an investigation in the Assembly. On Friday, deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar said he has found substance in the complaints made by Patole. “In a democracy, tapping phones of elected representatives using different names is not acceptable. This also doesn’t fit in the existing law, which says tapping can be done for cases related to law and order, smuggling of narcotics, when internal security of the country can come in danger or to maintain communal harmony. If it is being done for political reasons and by violating the law, it is extremely wrong,” Pawar told reporters. In response, former finance minister and senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar downplayed the move. He said there was no need to form a high-level committee and the government could have got the information by examining the relevant documents. “I am surprised that they have constituted a DG level committee for this as the information can be obtained only by examining the relevant documents. A phone of any person can be tapped only with prior permission from the additional chief secretary of the home department. The committee should have been formed in case of involvement of a senior official in such an act. If allegations are true then the officers found guilty should be punished,” Mungatiwar told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/illegal-phone-tapping-dgp-to-head-committee-report-in-three-months-101625854950926.html

The duo allegedly buried the child alive in a marshy land along the shore, police said.The police said the eunuch, Kannu, visited the child’s home in Ambedkar Nagar slums in Cuffe Parade on Thursday and demanded ₹2,000, a saree and a coconut, as traditional “shagun” from her parents. The child’s father Sachin Chitkole, his wife and grandfather asked Kannu to come later on the day of her naming ceremony. Kannu then allegedly got angry, leading to a heated argument.Kannu then met her friend Sonu (full name not known) and the two decided to approach the child’s parents. “Sonu along with Kannu allegedly kidnapped the child around 2am on Friday when everyone was fast asleep. The family had not closed the door as it was hot in the night,” a police officer said. After the mother could not find the child in the morning, they looked for the baby in nearby areas and reported the matter to Cuffe Parade police.

10-07-2021||Lucknow||Only Delta, Kappa variants found in gene sequencing by KGMU, says U.P. CM Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said only the Delta and Kappa variants of the Sars-Cov-2 pathogen were found in the Covid samples from Uttar Pradesh gene sequenced by King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow.Delta and Kappa are the old variants of the second wave of the pandemic. (Earlier, at least two cases of the Delta Plus variant were found among the samples from eastern Uttar Pradesh sent for gene sequencing to the New Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in May. The reports of these samples were received in July).“Both the variants (Delta and Kappa) are not new for UP,” he said at a high-level Covid review meeting, mentioning that recently KGMU did genome sequencing of 109 samples of which 107 were Delta and two Kappa variants. The two Kappa cases are from Lucknow according to the address mentioned at the time of sampling. The samples were collected in May.In earlier meetings, he had repeatedly been asking the state’s Covid management team to be on the lookout for the newer Delta Plus variant, considered more virulent than the other variants in the first and second waves.In view of the Delta Plus variant infections reported in several other states, the Uttar Pradesh government had asked KGMU to do genome sequencing to detect if the variant was present in the state.The chief minister once again laid stress on the enhancement of facilities within the state for genome sequencing.Yogi said the state had done 6.1 crore (61 million) Covid tests (since the onset of Covid in the state in March last year) and had administered 3.6 crore (36 million) Covid vaccination doses.“In both tests and vaccination, the state is number one in the country,” he said.He also said that in the past 24 hours, Uttar Pradesh did 2.52 lakh (252,000) tests of which only 90 tested positive while 162 patients recovered during the same period.“The positivity rate in the past 24 hours was a mere 0.04%. There are 41 districts that did not report any fresh case. In 32 districts, cases came up in single digits. Now, the state has only 1,697 active Covid cases and the recovery rate in Uttar Pradesh is 98.6%,” Yogi said.He also said that 7.83 lakh (783,000) Covid vaccination doses were administered across the state in the past 24 hours and asked the officials concerned to further speed up the vaccination process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/only-delta-kappa-variants-found-in-gene-sequencing-by-kgmu-says-yogi-adityanath-101625854411571.html

10-07-2021||Patna||My ancestors were Hindu, kin still are: Bihar minister||PATNA: Bihar’s minority welfare minister Jama Khan has said his ancestors were Hindus from Rajasthan and converted to Islam later. Khan was talking to reporters at Hajipur on Thursday night during which he was asked about the current row in Uttar Pradesh over alleged conversion of Hindus to Islam.Khan had won the last assembly election from Chainpur in Kaimur district on Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) ticket but later switched to Janata Dal (United).Khan said his ancestors, Bhagwan Singh and his younger brother Jay Ram Singh, who were Rajputs, had come to Kaimur area from Baiswara in Rajasthan in 14th century AD and settled there after winning some battles and amassing land.According to Khan, Bhagwan Singh converted to Islam while Jay Ram Singh remained a Hindu. “The descendents of Jay Ram Singh are still living at Saraiya village, adjacent to my village Naughara in Chainpur block of Kaimur district,” the minister said.“We still have family relations and invite each other for family functions. I always visit my Hindu brothers in their village,” the minister said. Anand Kumar Singh, a local journalist from Saraiya village and a descendent of Jay Ram Singh, said the Singh brothers along side Sakarwar dynasty ruler Shalivahan of Chainpur fought against Allauddin Khilji but were defeated and their king Shalivahan was killed. “Bhagwan Singh was forced to convert to Islam to save his family and land,” Anand said, adding that descendents of the two brothers still maintained close ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/my-ancestors-were-hindu-kin-still-are-bihar-minister-101625846552791.html
10-07-2021||Pune||Pune city doctors report ‘bone death’ in Covid-19 recovered patients||After mucormycosis, city doctors are now reporting a huge number of diagnosed cases of avascular necrosis, a new health complication that causes the death of bone tissues, in many Covid-19 recovered patients owing to the long-term use of corticosteroids (especially at high doses)Dr Anand Jadhav, an orthopaedic specialist from Apollo Spectra, said, “Earlier, mucormycosis was seen rampant in patients post-Covid. Now, ‘bone death’ is also another worrisome problem seen in recovered patients from the first and second waves owing to the use of steroids. Around 10-15 patients with avascular necrosis visit me every month for treatment for the last two months now.”“Avascular necrosis, also called osteonecrosis, can be termed as the death of bone tissue owing to the lack of blood supply. It can lead to tiny breaks in the bone, and the bone collapses. A broken bone or dislocated joint can interrupt the blood flow to a section of bone,” he said.“In avascular necrosis patients, there is increased pressure in the bones inside the sphincter. Its rigid structure causes pain to patients. Core decompression surgery is performed if the avascular necrosis is in the first and second stages. This reduces the pressure inside the ball. Joint replacement surgery is the only option to reduce permanent pain in the third and fourth stages. However, surgery is not required if it is diagnosed early. Therefore, if the Covid patients on steroids having groin or thigh pain are advised to take an MRI or X-ray to check if they have avascular necrosis of the hip,” he said.Dr Keerthi Prakash Kotla, a consultant pathologist, said, “Large-scale use of life-saving corticosteroids in Covid-19 cases causes the resurgence of avascular necrosis cases. Pain related to avascular necrosis of the hip might also be felt around the groin, thigh, or buttock. Besides your hip, it may also affect your shoulder, knee, hand, and foot. Hence, on complaints of hip and thigh pain, diagnosis can be done by early X-ray, CT scan, MRI, and bone scan of the hips. Limit your alcohol intake, monitor cholesterol levels, do not misuse steroids without a doctor’s knowledge, and avoid smoking to manage avascular necrosis.”Dr Chandrashekhar Dixit, consultant - orthopaedic and joint replacement specialist from Jupiter Hospital, said, “Avascular necrosis damages the bone tissue due to lack of blood supply. Basic architecture under the cartilage area of the bone is affected, causing unevenness at the joint. Anyone can be affected, but the condition is most common in people between 30-50 age group.”“The common factor between mucormycosis and avascular necrosis is found to be the inevitable use of steroids during treatment of Covid. We are expecting more of such patients in the next one to two years,” he said.“Early diagnosis is the key to the treatment of avascular necrosis. Typical treatment involves the use of blood thinners, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-osteoporosis drugs, cholesterol-lowering drugs and physiotherapy, proper nutrition and body weight under control,” he said.“In Jupiter hospital, we have seen seven patients in last months who had received steroids in last year and early months of this year. Two patients have been advised to undergo joint replacement surgery. Rest are managed conservatively so far,” he said.However, Dr Raghav Barve, an orthopaedic consultant with multiple hospitals in the city, cautions young patients who have avascular necrosis to not rush for hip replacement and instead go for early diagnosis and early treatment which includes medications, physiotherapy and better lifestyle habits.He said, “In stage one and two avascular necrosis could be treated through medications alone while in stage three or four it could become serious and require hip replacement surgery. However, young patients must not rush for hip replacements as the surgeries are effective for around 20 years post which the prosthetic implants have to be replaced. So if a young patient aged 30 undergoes hip replacement then at 50 they’ll need to undergo the surgery yet again, however for older patients, aged 60-70, one surgery may last their lifetime. Early diagnosis, including X-Ray and MRI along with correct medications, can help in the longer run,” he said.Dr Barve added, while earlier, those on steroids or with renal problems suffered from avascular necrosis, now the number has doubled since the past two months due to post Covid-19 complications.He said, “As of now, I’m getting patients recovering from the first wave in the coming years, this number could go up drastically as in the second wave we saw many more patients requiring steroids during Covid treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-city-doctors-report-bone-death-in-covid-19-recovered-patients-101625844450409.html

The Euro 2020 final, scheduled on July 11, will see Italy and England face off for the title. The finale has got football lovers excited. From planning safe and small watch parties, arranging for projectors to watch the game on big screen to whipping up Italian delights and even applying for an off from work the next day, football fans in the city are already in the preparation mode.Excitement is also building up among expats in the Capital who are ready to cheer for their favourite country. Alex Ellis, British High Commissioner to India who represents the United Kingdom and its four nations is as thrilled as Delhiites. He says, “I can’t wait for the match, and I know I won’t be alone in saying this. I see so many people wearing jerseys of their favourite Premier League clubs and this shows how closely English football is followed here. India and the UK are connected by a passion for sports.”As far as the Indian Standard Time (IST) is concerned, the final will be broadcast on July 12 at 12:30am, some youngsters are taking an off from work on Monday. “I have already informed my boss that most likely I will take a Monday off. The match starts post midnight and if it goes on till penalty shoot-out, it will go on till 3am,” says Kunwar Sanjit, a marketing manager, who will be getting together with a couple of football fanatic friends and have a FIFA night prior.Others who are missing the vibe of match screenings at restaurants are planning a little party of their own by getting projectors. “My friends and I used to go to sports bars and restaurants to watch the screenings but this time we are arranging for a projector to watch the match. Only a limited number of friends will be coming so that we are able to follow safety norms,” says Arpit Pruthi, 31, social media and brand reputation manager.While those who are not able to get together to watch the game with friends or family amid the pandemic have their virtual plans in place. Arjun Kalra, 25, a sports content producer says, “In my group, it’s quite sober because of the current situation, plus it’s not club football… So, we’ll be watching at our homes only and may be do watch-alongs and discuss over texts.”To get into the celebratory mode, fans will be cooking traditional Italian delights to show support. Ruchi Khanna, 27, a HR professional says, “I have been supporting Italy since the beginning of the tournament so why not prepare an Italian feast ahead of the match for my family on my off today!”On the delivery front, some restaurants are even running offers or have extended their delivery time to cater to the demand. On the special occasion, Cafe Diva in the Capital will be open till late on Sunday for deliveries, until midnight. For guests to not get hassled by cooking for a small get-together, Priyanka Tiwari ,founder, Appumm House says, “We want the fans to simply sit back, order their food from us and enjoy the match with their pals, and hence offering a flat 15% off on our entire menu just for the day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/football-fever-grips-delhi-with-euro-2020-finals-101625824291320.html
10-07-2021||Other||Suspended IPS officer booked for sedition in Chhattisgarh||Raipur: The Chhattisgarh Police on Friday booked suspended Indian Police Service (IPS) officer GP Singh for sedition citing documents “promoting enmity” and “conspiracy against the government” allegedly recovered in the raids at his premises last week. Singh was suspended after the state’s Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and Economic Offences Wing (EOW) raided his premises in connection with a case related to disproportionate assets. A First Information Report (FIR) against Singh under the Indian Penal Code’s Sections 124 A (sedition) and 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc) was registered on ACB and EOW’s complaint at Raipur’s Kotwali police station on Thursday night. It cited the allegedly incriminatory documents recovered during the raid. HT has seen a copy of the FIR, which said the seized documents contain “provocative contents that can promote hatred and dissatisfaction against the constitutionally formed government”. The FIR said the case has been registered on the basis of a 48-page document ACB and EOW submitted after a primary investigation. “The documents submitted by the ACB were examined after taking legal opinion. An FIR has been registered under sections related to sedition and hate speech,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named. The FIR said ACB recovered pieces of torn papers and when they were rearranged, “serious and sensitive contents were found”. “Objectionable comments against leaders of reputed political parties along with detailed plans of conspiracy were mentioned in these papers. Secret analysis related to representatives and candidates of different assembly constituencies along with comments on serious issues of the concerned area were also written on seized papers. The papers also contained comments on several government schemes, policies, social and religious issues,” the FIR said. It was not immediately clear who these people and parties were. Singh moved the Chhattisgarh high court against the sedition case and sought a Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry into the matter, said his lawyer Kishore Bhaduri. “We are also filing an interim relief application in a lower court,” said Bhaduri. Kanak Tiwari, a former advocate general of Chhattisgarh, said the FIR is inconclusive and does not mention anything in elaboration. “Whatever may or may not constitute the offence of sedition will be the subject of inquiry. In this regard, the Supreme Court judgment in the Kedarnath Singh case in 1962 is the ultimate authority to determine whether an offence is made out or not, but the facts are not brought in detail in FIR.” The 1962 judgment laid down the fundamental requirements--incitement to violence or public disorder--before registration of a sedition case. Searches were earlier conducted at around 15 locations linked to Singh, an additional director general-rank officer, from July 1 to July 3. Investigators have claimed to have discovered documents related to movable and immovable assets worth over ₹10 crore during the raids. An ACB statement on July 3 said the documents seized during searches at Singh’s premises established he allegedly amassed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income and indulged in a “massive exchange of money”. “Singh also allegedly tried to commit money laundering by investing in shell companies,” the statement said. Singh, a 1994-batch IPS officer, served as additional director general of ACB and EOW before he was transferred to the state police academy in June last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/suspended-chhattisgarh-police-officer-booked-for-sedition-101625813489631.html
