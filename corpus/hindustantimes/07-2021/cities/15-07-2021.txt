The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has presented an plan based on six action points of the ministry.On Thursday, Dr Prashant Gargava, member and Naresh Gangwar, joint secretary the ministry held a video conference call, with all the environment, forest and climate change ministry officials of the states, and representatives of cities, included in the central government’s plan to improve air quality.The Central government has disbursed ₹134 crore to the PMC to improve air quality. The amount has been given to Pune, PCMC, Pune and Khadki cantonment area. As per central government guidelines, cities have to submit a time-bound programme to develop year-wise targets on ambient air quality for 2020-25, based on annual average concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2.5.Mangesh Dhighe, environment officer of the corporation said, “We have already started working on the plan which was submitted to the ministry.”He added, “Pune city’s air quality is moderate. Under the national clean air programme (NCAP), we are working on six components to improve air quality, such as mechanical sweepers, water sprinklers, awareness education activities, creating green corridors and electrical crematoriums.” “In meeting, officials instructed us to use other local-level funds to improve air quality of the city and not only use central government grants for this programme,” he added.Pratap Jagtap, sub-regional officer of the Maharashtra Pollution Control board (MPCB), said, “It was a review meeting about action taken by cities to improve air quality. Pune corporation has taken all necessary steps to improve the air quality and we are monitoring the system.”City’s air quality is determined by five components: PM 2.5, fine particulate matter; PM 10, particulate matter in the air with a diameter of 10mm or less, including smoke, dust, soot, salts, acids, and metals; ozone (O3), highly reactive gas composed of three oxygen atoms; nitrogen dioxide (NO2), highly reactive gases and carbon monoxide.The central government has given instructions to take measures to control vehicular emissions, road dust re-suspension, biomass burning, control of industrial air pollution, treatment of construction and demolition waste, air quality monitoring network strengthening, monitoring of diesel generator sets, and shifting to liquefied petroleum gas from solid fuels.PMC action plan includes:• Formulation of city-specific plan for e-mobility and rapid augmentation of the charging infrastructure • Execution of city specific plantation plans• Gradual transition to e-mobility in the two-wheeler sector and specific allocations for creating a venture capital fund for e-mobility. Government-run buses for public transport, private buses, and three-wheelers to be converted to EVs and government office fleets older than 15 years to be shifted to EVs• Maintenance and repair of roads on priority• Introduce mechanical sweepers. SOP for addressing issue of disposal of the collected dust from mechanical sweeping• Treated water sprinkling system with PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) pipeline along the roads and at intersecting road junctions; and spraying of water twice a day before peak traffic hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-presents-six-point-action-plan-to-central-government-to-improve-air-quality-101626373270238.html

On Thursday, 97 private vaccination centres and 327 government centres inoculated beneficiaries in the district. Vaibhav Pingale, a 47-year old beneficiary who works at a private firm in Pune, said that he has to take his second dose in the next few days.“I am waiting to get a slot at a government facility as the jabs are free. Vaccination against Covid is important for all those who are stepping outside the house. And it is the responsibility of the government to provide us with free jabs. Why should I visit a private centre?” said Pingale. Maya Lashkare, a 38-year-old beneficiary who is waiting for her first jab, said that she would prefer a government hospital where vaccination is free of cost.“I have three daughters, of which two are above 18 years of age. And so we three need our jabs. I work as a house help and cannot afford to visit a private centre. Hence, my daughter tries every day to book a free slot on the CoWin application for the three of us,” said Lashkare. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital said that as the vaccines are made available at government hospitals, the number of beneficiaries inoculated at private hospitals has reduced by 50 per cent.“Beneficiaries now prefer free jabs. The idea of private centres is to inoculate as many beneficiaries as they can. Those who can afford vaccination, should visit private centres, so that more people are inoculated,” said Dr Oswal. “We are hoping that the supply is regular and that more and more beneficiaries get the jabs as soon as possible,” said Dr Oswal. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (Medical), Pune circle, said that on Wednesday evening, Pune district received 118,000 doses of Covishield. “Along with this, we have around 30,000 doses of Covaxin. With the current inoculation going on. We are expecting the next doses to come on July 18,” said Dr Deshmukh.He added that private hospitals will not have to procure the vaccines through the CoWin application. “Earlier, hospitals used to directly contact the supplier. Now they have to get the supply of vaccine from CoWin only,” said Dr Deshmukh.As per the health department, a total of 43,543 beneficiaries were inoculated on Wednesday. So far a total of 4,926,341 beneficiaries have been inoculated with Covishield and 441,584 have been administered Covaxin. And 8,923 beneficiaries have been given Sputnik V in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/free-vax-at-govt-centres-in-still-in-high-demand-101626373268787.html

PMC will get revenue from property and water tax from these 23 villages.”The PMC’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has strongly opposed the state government’s decision.Leader of house Ganesh Bidkar said, “It is very sad that the PMC will spend money in these areas to provide water, collect garbage, install street lights and the money will go to the PMRDA. If the state government has so much interest, first it needed to complete the DP process with the help of PMRDA and then merge these villages.”Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The state government is playing politics with the merging of villages. For the elections they wanted to merge villages, but at the same time it is not letting go of its right to collect money from building permission.”Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “The PMRDA did not hand over Rs300 crore from building permissions in the previous 11 villages merged. Again they are going to collect money from newly merged 23 villages.”Administrative sources confirmed that construction activity in these villages is high and it is expected that Rs200 crore revenue will get generated per annum. The PMRDA does not have a mechanism to take action against illegal constructions, which the PMC has.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmrda-to-collect-revenue-generated-from-building-permissions-in-23-merged-villages-101626373150154.html
15-07-2021||Mumbai||Two months on, Mumbai’s Kasturba Hospital awaits genome sequencing machine from Chicago||After almost two months of being approved, the main medical equipment that is required for genome sequencing at Kasturba Gandhi Hospital, is currently stuck in Chicago, the civic body officials said. A United States-based non-government organisation (NGO) has donated the machine to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). However, a section of officials in the US has claimed pandemic-related restrictions on ferrying cargo, thus delaying its arrival to India. Some officials have also cited customs duty issues as another reason.Genome sequencing is an exercise to study the changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant.In May, Kasturba Hospital became the first civic-run hospital in Mumbai to receive approval to start genome sequencing of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Along with this, a committee will also research the microbiological characteristics of the mutated strains of the virus.“The machine which is worth in crores, has been donated by an NGO from Chicago for the genome sequencing at the hospital. As soon as we get it, we will start the genome sequencing,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital, Kasturba Hospital’s parent institute. The civic body is now trying to procure medical equipment for emergency use. “The machine has to be transported in a cargo aircraft. But due to the ongoing pandemic, severe restrictions have been imposed on cargo ferrying in Chicago. Thus, the machine is stuck in the country, but we are trying to procure it through emergency use as it is medical equipment,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.However, a senior official on conditions of anonymity said, “Since the machine is being exported from another country, there have been some issues with the customs duty department. But we are working on it...we will retrieve the machine from at the earliest.”The samples for genome sequencing will be collected from adults with atypical clinical presentations, children with Covid-19 infection, international passengers and patients who contracted the infection in clusters having high positivity rates. Civic officials said in-house genome sequencing will enable faster results that will aid rapid policy planning to take appropriate measures. Genome sequencing is required for medical preparedness in any outbreak of a disease. “At present, we collect and send swab samples outside the city for genome sequencing. As a result, it takes almost 15-20 days to get the report. But after procurement of the machine, we will be able to link information of genome sequencing with patients’ data faster,” said Kakani. Speaking to HT in May, Dr Jayanti Shastri, head of the microbiology department of Kasturba Hospital, had said, “This is genome epidemiology for better understanding of disease like its progression, severity, transmissibility and therapeutics.”The state health minister in June announced that a total of 21 cases of Sars-Cov-2 Delta-plus variant have been found in samples collected from Maharashtra. The Delta plus variant is a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant (B.1.617.2) that was detected in Maharashtra during the second wave. The union health ministry has categorised the Delta-plus variant of Covid-19 as a ‘variant of concern’.BMC has sent 600 samples for genome sequencing to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) that has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the state to undertake genome sequencing of 4,000 positive swab samples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-months-on-mumbai-s-kasturba-hospital-awaits-genome-sequencing-machine-from-chicago-101626373088736.html
15-07-2021||Mumbai||Air India privatisation: Clear pending arrears, Air India pilots urge aviation minister||Air India’s Indian Pilots’ Guild, a recognised trade union representing the pilots of erstwhile Air India Ltd., wrote to the new civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Thursday seeking an assurance that their long-pending arrears will be paid, as privatisation of the airline is in the final stages.From the beginning of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Air India crew has flown crucial cargo and evacuation flights, as well as the flights under the Vande Bharat Mission. Moreover, the airline lost five of its pilots to Covid-19 during the second wave. All these pilots had operated flights during the first and second of the pandemic.“We wish to bring to your attention an issue which gravely concerns the pilots of Air India as well other employees, and the privatisation process itself,” the pilots said.In January 2013, Air India management cut staff salaries by 25% on an ad-hoc basis amid poor financial conditions.“Despite being in a miserable condition, the pilots continued to bear the ad-hoc pay cut,” said a senior Air India pilot.Former Air India chairman, Ashwani Lohani in his 2015 letter to employees had stated that the management was absolutely clear that the pending amount belonged to the employees and would therefore be released back.Moreover, earlier this year the then minister of civil aviation Hardeep Singh Puri had told the media that the employees’ dues with arrears will be paid by Air India assets holding company before the closing of the proposed transaction.“As the privatisation of Air India Ltd. seems to be at the final stage, we turn to you to make good these assurances of payment of our long pending arrears. We sincerely hope that under your tenure the interests of the employees will be addressed and that you could initiate the payment of these arrears at the earliest,” the letter read.The pilots have requested Scindia for a meeting to discuss various issues and seek help to get back their money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/air-india-privatisation-clear-pending-arrears-air-india-pilots-urge-aviation-minister-101626372969470.html

How can we make the payment when there are no sales at all?,” questioned Anand Gupta, chairman, BAI (housing and RERA committee). “The banks and financial institutions have virtually blacklisted us and we are not getting support from them,” Gupta added.Paras Gundecha, chairman and managing director, Gundecha Group, said, “There is a possibility of the third wave. In such a scenario, buyers have postponed their buying plans.”The real estate sector has been facing a slowdown for several years and the pandemic has only made matters worse. The government in August last year announced its decision to reduce stamp duty levied on sales of apartments to 2% from September 1 till December 31, 2020, and then hike it to 3% from January 1 till March 31, 2021. The move played a significant role in boosting sales of both primary and secondary markets. The state, however, refused to extend it despite several requests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-realty-sector-hit-dip-in-sales-new-launches-101626372909198.html
15-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Dewatering pumps at Hindmata, Gandhi Mkt bring relief from waterlogging||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started operating two of six newly installed underground dewatering pumps at Hindamata, and all four underground dewatering pumps at Gandhi Market on Baba Saheb Ambedkar Road, during heavy downpour this week, bringing relief in the chronic waterlogging spots to some extent. The entire project will be completed by the end of August, P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner in charge of the stormwater drains department said. The entire project of constructing underground water-holding silos to do away with logged water in these two areas is not yet complete. However, the civic body activated two pumps at Hindamata, each with a capacity to drain out 3,000 litres of water per second, and one out of four pumps at Gandhi Market, reducing water receding time to less than a couple of hours, and no waterlogging at Gandhi Market area, during rainfall earlier this week. At earlier times, water receding time for Hindamata and Gandhi Market was anywhere between six hours to over 12 hours, depending on the amount of rainfall received in the area. As these spots are located on the Baba Saheb Ambedkar Road, logged water would affect traffic between the island city and the eastern suburbs. “We have begun to operate two pumps at Hindamata, and all at Gandhi market, as and when is necessary. Over the past few days of rainfall, we have already operated the pumps two-three times,” Velrasu said. As part of its plan to tackle individual chronic waterlogging spots, BMC has installed four large dewatering pumps under the flyover at Hindamata, and one under the carriageway at Hindamata junction. These will pump logged rainwater to Pramod Mahajan Udyan at Senapati Bapat Road in Elphinstone with yet another dewatering pump, where BMC is in the process of constructing two underground water holding tanks. Water from Hindamata will also be pumped to St Xavier’s ground in Parel, where construction of the underground water holding tank is complete. From here, water can be reused for non-potable purposes. Similarly, the pumps at Gandhi Market will pump water directly to a railway culvert in Matunga. Velrasu said, “Presently, the entire system that pumps water to St Xavier’s ground is activated and we have used it a couple of times in the last few days. The system that will pump water to Pramod Mahajan Udyan, complete with the underground tanks, will be completed by end of August. BMC is also using these pumps at present to drain water into existing drains at Hindamata.” The silos at the ground in Parel and the garden at Elphinstone, where work is going on right now, have a total water holding capacity of the tanks at Parel and Elphinstone alone is up to 17,000 cubic metres, as part of phase one. After the construction of these tanks is completed, more space is left at both these open spaces to construct more silos, which will augment water holding capacity to 50,000 cubic metres. The cost of the first phase is ₹60 crore, while the cost of the entire project is ₹130 crore. Based on the success of this pilot project, BMC plans to construct similar underground dewatering and water holding systems at Postal Colony in Chembur, Oberoi Mall in Goregaon, and Mahalaxmi in south Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-dewatering-pumps-at-hindmata-gandhi-mkt-bring-relief-from-waterlogging-101626372788650.html
15-07-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: 2 wanted men held after encounter||The police early Wednesday morning arrested two men, allegedly wanted for several heinous crimes in Haryana and neighbouring states, following an encounter at Ghata crossing on Gurugram-Faridabad Road. Their arrests, which happened after an hour-long chase and shoot-out, have helped solved more than two dozen crimes in the district, police said. Police said the two suspects and one policeman suffered gunshot wounds and all of them were admitted to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, where they are stable. Two more policemen were injured when the suspects rammed their motorbike into the barricades set up by police. The officer in charge of the crime investigation unit narrowly escaped as two bullets fired by the suspects were stopped by his bulletproof jacket, police said. The suspects have been identified as Manish Kumar Jakhar (30), of village Salawas in Jhajjar, and Prashant alias Jonty (24), of Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar. Police said a reward of ₹1 lakh each was announced on their arrest by Gurugram police recently. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said the suspects allegedly murdered a 38-year-old man, Sandeep, a paying-guest (PG) facility owner, in Ishlampur village of Sector 38 on May 4 and were on the run since then. “They were wanted men for the past two years and kept shifting their residence to evade the police. They were living in the PG facility owned by Sandeep, who hailed from Sampla village in Rohtak. Sandeep, too, used to live in the PG and became friends with both suspects this March,” Sangwan said. He said when Sandeep asked them to pay two months’ rent, it led to an altercation between them and the two men assaulted Sandeep. Later, the duo shot him dead. Rajkumar, the officer in charge of CIA 39, said the police received a tip-off about the two men and the team spotted them on Gurugram-Faridabad Road, and gave chase. “We were warned that they will be armed, so the personnel were well equipped and kitted out in bulletproof jackets,” he said. Police also set up barricades and checkpoints and the focus was on motorcycle riders. Sangwan said one of the teams, led by inspector Rajkumar, went to patrol Gurugram-Faridabad Road. They were moving towards Gwal Pahari T-point when they spotted a motorbike without a number plate. “The attire of the two riders matched the information given by the informer. As soon as they turned towards Golf Course Extension Road, near Ghata crossing , the team informed the police control room and shared the location to set up more barricades,” he said. Police said the team asked the suspects to stop but they sped away after ramming through the barricades, injuring constables Sanjay Kumar and Manoj Kumar. Sangwan said the team immediately blocked the road a little ahead of them and trapped the duo. They then opened fire at the police team. The duo fired a few rounds at the police and two shots hit the bulletproof jacket worn by inspector Rajkumar, while one hit constable Akash in the arm. Police returned the fire, and hit the two suspects in their legs,” said Sangwan. The police team nabbed both suspects. Police recovered one pistol, one countrymade pistol two live cartridges and the motorbike from their possession. A case under sections 186 (voluntarily obstructs public servant in discharge of duty), (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault on public servant), 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of Arms act was registered at Sector 56 police station on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-2-wanted-men-held-after-encounter-101626371648677.html

The residents have been promised ₹2,000 per month till they are allotted EWS flats -- in Dabua Colony and Bapu Nagar -- under the rehabilitation scheme.“First the authorities were reluctant to provide any rehabilitation and now that they have announced a scheme, most people will automatically be excluded from it as we have ID proofs of Delhi. Some of those who will be eligible for the scheme have seen the houses they are being offered, which are in no condition to live in. Also, even before giving us a place to stay, the authorities have demolished our houses,” said Rekha (35), a resident of Khori.Khori village is situated at the border of Delhi and Haryana, and with no clear demarcation, there has been a confusion since long regarding where Chungi (falling in Delhi) ends and Khori villlage begins.Nilesh Kumar, a social worker associated with the Basti Suraksha Manch, an organisation working to rehabilitate the residents, said, “A majority of Khori residents hold Delhi ID cards, voter IDs, ration cards. They have been provided basic facilities like electricity, gas connection, paved roads and anganwadis by the Delhi government, and all their children go to schools in Delhi. Till 2016, disputes in most parts of Khori Gaon were handled by the Delhi Police.In 2016, the high court asked the Haryana government to decide on a rehabilitation plan as the land belonged to Haryana. But, under Delhi’s rehabilitation policy (DUSIB policy 2015), if people have been living in any settlement before 2015 and possess identity cards of Delhi, then they must be rehabilitated under this policy.”Kumar said a survey should be undertaken urgently to identify households with Delhi ID cards and ensure their rehabilitation before their houses are demolished. A group of social activists and scholars also wrote to the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) on June 30, stressing on how the households in Khori are entitled to protection under the DUSIB Act, 2015, for relief and rehabilitation. Ishita Chatterjee, a PhD scholar with the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning at the University of Melbourne, who has been studying Khori village, said, “It is a well-known fact by now that most of the residents possess Delhi identity cards. Since the Haryana government did not provide electricity, hence most households also draw electricity from Delhi. The current clauses make most of the residents ineligible for rehabilitation.” She also pointed out that the Haryana government wants beneficiaries to pay a deposit, which is twice their monthly salary in most cases, within 15 days of allotment of the flat. “So even among the very few eligible ones, many will not be able to afford it. Residents will be given a monthly amount of ₹2,000 to rent for the time the houses are not ready. The minimum rent in this locality starts from ₹8,000, and there aren’t enough residences to house all the displaced people,” she added. The rehabilitation plan was also slammed by Balakrishnan Rajagopal, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing 2020-2026, who took to Twitter on Thursday: “Haryana government should stop hiding behind the Supreme Court! No court decision can justify forced mass evictions with such police violence and arbitrary detentions, all during the monsoon! Khori Gaon should be regularized or another human rights-based solution found.” Mohd Waseem Hashmi (37), a resident of Vishwakarma Colony in Khori whose house was demolished on Wednesday, said, “I work as a tuition teacher for children in the village and used to earn around ₹5.000-8,000, but since we learnt about the demolition, I myself did not take money from the families as everyone is worried about finding a shelter for themselves, which is expensive at such a short notice. In such a situation, how am I supposed to pay the lump sum amount of ₹17,000. What good is the monthly payment of ₹2,000 when basic living expenses are more than that?” Officials from DUSIB said that they have no information on rehabilitation of residents from Khori village.DUSIB member Bipin Rai said, “Our department is not looking into this matter as the demolition is being conducted by the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad and not the Delhi government.” Meanwhile, Garima Mittal, MCF commissioner, said there have not been any talks with Delhi for rehabilitation and that they will go ahead with the policy announced by Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/khori-colony-mandatory-id-proofs-may-deny-residents-govt-s-rehab-scheme-say-activists-101626371528754.html

Residents further claimed that women, who lay down on the road to stop the drive, were pushed away by the police. However, police have denied the allegations. Residents also shared videos on social media to highlight their protest against the demolition that follows the Supreme Court’s order issued on June 7, directing the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) to clear encroachments from the Aravalli forest land within six weeks.While officials refused to divulge the number of demolitions carried out, social workers active in the area said over 500 houses were razed in the drive on Thursday.Early on Thursday morning, more than 500 residents blocked the entry and exit points to their colony by putting up barricades to but police allegedly resorted to lathi-charge to disperse the crowd and made their way in. Residents alleged that more than 10 people were injured, including a man who was allegedly thrashed by a policeman in civil clothes when he refused to move out of his house. In a purported video of the incident, which was shared online, the policeman is allegedly seen dragging the man and hitting him with force. Faridabad police stopped the entry of media persons and teams were deployed a kilometre away to cut access to the lane connecting to Khori village. Entry of vehicles were blocked at least five kilometres before the road leading to Khori, with police officers deployed there claiming that this was done because residents were pelting stones. Drones were also used on Thursday to ensure that locals do not gather in large numbers at one place. The police teams reached the village around 8am but started the demolition drive after 10am, with officials claiming that work proceeded smoothly and peacefully until 5pm. Garima Mittal, commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad, refused to share the details of the drive but said everything was smooth. “We will implement the orders of the Supreme Court in letter and spirit and follow all the rules and regulations of the government. It is not possible for us to share operational details in the public domain,” said Mittal.Anshu Singla, the deputy commissioner of police (NIT) who oversaw the drive, also refused to share the operational details or the number of houses demolished. “We are following the orders of the apex court and have maintained law and order. We have been requesting people to vacate the village and let us carry out the demolition drive so that we don’t have to use force to vacate the area,” she said. Nilesh Kumar, a social activist with Basti Suraksha Manch, said over 500 houses were razed near Jharkhand Colony, Bengali Colony and Islam Chowk. He said there are more than 20,000 houses built in the 170 acre land. A social activist who visited the village said it will take a nearly a month to demolish the area and another month to remove the debris. Kavita Kumari, a resident whose house was razed on Thursday, said she and her family will not vacate the area and instead plan to set up a tent to live on the land they bought. “Let them raze all the area, we will rebuild. The scheme of rehabilitation they are talking about is of no use to us. If we had that amount to pay, we would have bought the house in any of the colonies,” she said. Zareena Biwi, another resident, too refused to move: “The authorities have tried their best but we will die but not vacate the area. Let them take the debris, we will again construct the houses unless they do not come up with a proper plan. Who will bear the losses? We are dying each moment but no one is concerned about our safety and security. Police is hitting us and abusing us but there is no one who is ready to help us.”Ishita Chatterjee, a PhD scholar from the faculty of architecture, building and planning at the University of Melbourne, who has been studying Khori village, said the houses are the first line of defence against the pandemic. “For the past month, residents have been screaming that eviction before any alternative arrangement is a death sentence. How difficult is it to understand this? Time and again, the police have resorted to lathi-charge when faced with resistance and injured many residents in the process. First, the state takes away the only protection the residents have from the virus – their homes. Next, you injure them. Who is going to pay for their medical costs? Haven’t we learned by now that the pandemic has devastated the poor beyond measure? The rehabilitation scheme announced by the state is a complete sham. It is discriminatory since most of the residents do not qualify, which is what the state wants,” she said. Residents said they are likely to gather at the entry and exit points of the village on Friday too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/violence-heart-break-and-pain-as-civic-body-demolishes-houses-in-faridabad-s-khori-colony-101626371468823.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||Study conducted, recommendation filed, may pave way for Delhi’s 1st wildlife corridor||The state forest department has conducted a feasibility survey and submitted a recommendation for what could be the national capital’s first wildlife corridor, to be built at the southern border of the Asola Bhati Wildlife sanctuary on the Surajkund-Pali Road, to ensure a safe passage for movement of wild animals.The move comes after a two-year-old female leopard was mowed down by a vehicle on the stretch at the Delhi-Haryana border on June 28 — the fourth such incident over the past five years, said officials of the forest department.Soon after the leopard was killed, the department took up the matter with its Haryana counterparts, who have also agreed to the need for a wildlife corridor to protect the fauna as well as allow them free movement from one habitat to another.“We sought the views of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which has experience in tunnelling work across the Capital. We requested them to conduct a feasibility survey to create a safe passage for movement of wild animals on the small stretch of the Surajkund-Pali road falling under the jurisdiction of Delhi. The DMRC has suggested constructing of an underpass for animals,” said a senior forest official, who did not wish to be named.A recommendation for the same has been submitted to the Delhi chief wildlife warden for consideration.“Proving a safe passage for animals here is crucial, as it is a blind curve and in spite of signages and road bumps erected on the road to control speed of motorists, they end up running into an accident. Also, since the topography of the area is such that this road is on an elevation and there is a depression on both sides making it difficult even for animals to navigate their way. Reaching the blind curve, they cannot see the other side and neither can the motorists. If the road is straight, animals can see and remain alert. So, we have recommended constructing of an underpass for safe and free movement of the wild species,” the official said.According to officials, Delhi has a number of fragmented protected forest areas but no one safe path connecting them all, which does not allow free movement of animals. In case of species such as nilgais straying, it is always because they cannot find any way to move to another habitat except for crossing over the main road thus leading to accidents.Another official explained that movement of animals from one habitat to another for food and water is crucial to existence of healthy forest areas. “Even herbivores need to keep moving from one area to another, which allows revival of the area’s ecology,” the second official said.He added that there are three major stretches with heavy traffic movement around the sanctuary ---Surajkund-Faridabad Road, Gurgaon-Faridabad Road and Mehrauli-Badarpur Road. Another road connecting Chhatarpur in south Delhi to Mangar village in Faridabad cuts through the sanctuary.“There are certain features such as sufficient width and safe concealing of the passage that would need to be take care of to make it smooth enough to be used by animals for their movement,” he said. Experts say that creating a safe passage for wild animals is crucial in urban settings, as there is a higher risk of accidents because of the traffic volume. The Surajkund-Pali road is part of the leopard corridor from Asola wildlife sanctuary to Sariska National Park in Alwar, Rajasthan.Sohail Madan, centre manager of the Conservation Education Centre at the Asola sanctuary, maintained by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), who has been studying leopards in this corridor, said that there are three such accident-prone areas close to Asola. “It is extremely crucial to have a corridor for wild animals at such spots. Besides tunneling, other alternatives such as lifting the vehicular traffic up by making the road elevated and leaving the stretch under for movement of animals could also be looked into before the plan is finalised,” said Madan.He added that creating corridors alone is not enough, as most of this area except for the Asola sanctuary is not protected from other sides falling under Haryana. “It is of utmost importance to protect the green patches such as Mangar Bani forest with a great amount of biodiversity, to be protected under the law and be declared as sanctuaries or reserved areas. Without protecting these areas, just creating the corridor will still leave a major threat to the wildlife,” said Madan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/study-conducted-recommendation-filed-may-pave-way-for-delhi-s-1st-wildlife-corridor-101626371409287.html

The court also issued notice on this plea, which alleged that police have created a “narrative of religious extremism” around him by conflating purported discussion of issues affecting a particular religious community that needed to be highlighted.“The allegations against the applicant (Imam) contain an imaginary concoction of the state of mind of the applicant that bears no connection, direct or indirect, with the material collected as part of the investigation in the FIR. Imam’s counsel Tanveer Ahmed Mir further alleged that while making such “wild aspersions”, the prosecution has absurdly taken recourse to the Imam’s MPhil thesis and his several academic expressions found in leading digital media platforms..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-seeks-police-reply-on-bail-pleas-of-sharjeel-imam-umar-khalid-101626371408710.html

It said the petitioner’s counsel was not able to convince the court with his arguments. “Are you aware of any procedure? How are doses fixed? Who is fixing the doses? We will have to alter the procedure if at all we have the power to do so,” the court asked advocate Kuldeep Jauhari appearing for Siddharth De, the petitioner.“We are not inclined to issue notice. We will dismiss with costs,” said the court. In his plea, De contended that despite a controlled 2020, there has been a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases and subsequent deaths. He said there is evidence to prove that properties of Delta variant played an important role behind the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in India as it is around 60% more transmissible, virulent and has been labelled as a VOC (variant of concern) globally.“Thus it is imperative that the dosage interval for Covishield vaccine be brought down from 12 weeks to 8 weeks, at least for people above the age of 50 and for people above the age of 18 with existing comorbidities,” said De’s petition. The petitioner’s counsel told the court that the Covid working group and other experts were deciding the time span between two doses. He added that based on studies conducted by scientists in the UK, there was a need to reduce the dosage interval in view of the new variants of Covid-19.When Jauhari claimed that the petition was an “honest” one, the court responded that it had no doubt regarding the honesty of the plea and dismissal was not a certificate of dishonesty. The plea was later withdrawn by the counsel “unconditionally”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-hc-refuses-plea-seeking-reduction-in-gap-between-covid-vaccine-doses-101626371349266.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||Sharjeel Imam moves bail, says his speeches did not call for violence||Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the sedition law for his allegedly inflammatory speeches during the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), on Thursday contended before a Delhi court that his speeches were not seditious as he did not call for violence and was only sensitising people about the new laws.Imam, currently lodged in Tihar jail, is being probed for his speeches at Jamia on December 13 and on January 16 at AMU, where he allegedly called for a “chakka jam” to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the north-east from the mainland.He was arrested on January 28 from Bihar’s Jehanabad district.Moving his bail application before the Delhi court, his counsel Tanveer Ahmed Mir Thursday said a person trying to criticise a government policy or a particular political narrative can be booked for sedition only for “oblique motives”. He submitted that police have selectively taken passages from Imam’s speech and given them an illegal context.“Question is, if anyone is a critique of a constitutional policy, does that enable the state to book him for sedition…Being a student of modern history, I believe he is fully enabled to express his views as a citizen of this country…He was just trying to sensitise people,” Mir contended.He told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that calling for blocking the roads (chakka jam) cannot be considered a secessionist call as there was no ulterior motive.Reading passages from Imam’s speech where he spoke about “cutting off some cities”, Mir said, “He (Imam) called for blocking roads. It was not seditious. When the call ‘rail roko’ (stop the trains) is not seditious, why is the call of bringing the country to a standstill seditious?”“There was no incitement to violence. Where is the call for violence? How does sedition come into play?” he argued.The court after hearing detailed arguments posted the matter for further hearing to August 2 and August 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sharjeel-imam-moves-bail-says-his-speeches-did-not-call-for-violence-101626371348639.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||No transfer certificate needed to shift child from private to govt school, says Sisodia||More number of children are likely to switch from private schools to government ones in the national capital as the Delhi government on Thursday announced that such students will not need to produce transfer certificates (TCs) while seeking admission. Figures with the Directorate of Education (DoE) shows that it received around 21,000 more applications this year, as compared to last year, from children seeking admissions to entry-level classes and in classes 6 to 12 in Delhi government schools.The state education department this year received 28,000 applications for entry-level classes — nursery, kindergarten and class 1 — as compared to 21,000 last year. The rise is steeper in classes 6 to 12, department officials said. “Last year, we received a total of around 76,000 applications. This year after the first phase itself, we have around 90,400 applications,” said a senior official of the education department, asking not to be named.During a press briefing on Thursday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said the decision to not seek transfer certificates was taken to ease the whole process as several parents, who are facing pandemic-induced financial distress, complained of being denied transfer certificates by private schools over pending fee. “Some private schools are holding back transfer certificates and are asking parents to deposit the full fee first. So many parents are unable to admit their child to a government school. Taking cognisance of this issue, and after receiving several such complaints, the Directorate of Education has been asked to ensure that provisional admission is granted to students. Officials from DoE should secure the TCs directly from the private schools concerned,” Sisodia said.On May 31, the Delhi high court, acting on a plea by an association of 450 private schools called the Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Schools, set aside two government orders issued in 2020, prohibiting private schools from collecting annual charges and development fee during the lockdown period.The court directed that schools may collect these charges for the last academic year retrospectively, in six monthly instalments starting from June 10, but after offering a rebate of 15% on the total fee in lieu of unused facilities during the lockdown. The court also allowed schools to charge the whole fee for the 2021-22 academic year.On Thursday, Sisodia said students may submit other documents to ease the admission process. “The child and parents may bring the other documents from the school concerned and the education department will obtain the transfer certificate,” he said.Private school managements have condemned the move saying it will disrupt the general to EWS category student ratio in their schools, thereby affecting its functioning. RC Jain, vice-president of Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Schools, said the new policy will only lead to more confusion.“We have to submit the data of our school rolls for various government surveys. If a child doesn’t obtain a transfer certificate from our school and yet gets admitted to a government school, (s)he will be enrolled in two places and it will lead to data mismanagement. The directive is also an attack on private schools as we will be unable to adhere to the Right to Education Act directive that stipulates a 75:25 ratio for general to EWS category students in a classroom.”Educationist Meeta Sengupta said the world over, economic constraints during recessions have fuelled migrations to public schools. “Whenever countries such as the US or the UK went into recession, there has been a shift towards public schools in those countries. While this move [of doing away with TCs] will make private schools unhappy, it will ensure that children are not stuck in a limbo and are able to continue their studies,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-transfer-certificate-needed-to-shift-child-from-private-to-govt-school-says-sisodia-101626371171242.html

The decision was taken during a meeting of the admission committee officials. However, no decision was taken on the schedule for admissions to undergraduate courses, officials said.The university conducts an entrance for admissions for all postgraduate (PG), M.Phil, and PhD courses.A senior official who attended the meeting said, “The online registration process for PG and research courses is likely to begin from July 26. The admission committee recommended starting registrations for the nine undergraduate entrance test-based courses as well.”Last year, around 140,000 students applied for entrance to various postgraduate courses at DU, and 14,000 students applied for MPhil and PhD courses, according to DU data. The tests are conducted by the National Testing Agency.All postgraduate courses at Delhi University have entrance examinations in addition to merit-based admissions for DU graduates. NTA also conducts entrance tests for nine undergraduate courses. Due to the cancellation of board examinations this year, there is speculation that the university may conduct admissions through the Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET). However, there has been no clarity on the matter so far. Officials are still exploring different ways to conduct undergraduate admissions.In 2019, the PG entrance tests were conducted in the first week of July. Last year, they were delayed by the pandemic and were conducted in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/online-registration-for-pg-and-research-courses-at-du-likely-to-open-from-july-26-101626371169866.html

Chadha said once the full volume of water reaches the plants, the utility will again be able to achieve the original optimum production of 945MGD (million gallons per day). “With this, areas that are still getting thin supply will also have their supply restored,” he said.“It takes around three days for water to reach all water treatment plants (WTPs) across Delhi, and another day or two for it to reach all households. We are monitoring the speed at which water is flowing in at the Haiderpur WTP,” Chadha said in a statement.The Haiderpur plant is Asia’s second-largest plant that filters and treats more than 200MGD water, he said. Haryana releases raw water in the river Yamuna, which is treated at the WTPs and supplied to households.“Two major water channels of Delhi --- CLC (Carrier Lined Channel) and DSB (Delhi Sub-Branch) have started receiving Yamuna water in good proportions and it will have a direct impact on increasing water treatment and production capacity,” the senior AAP leader said.On Sunday, the DJB filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Haryana government to release the share of water that Delhi is legally entitled to. On Tuesday, the DJB said Haryana has released 16,000 cusecs of water. In 1995, the Supreme Court asked Haryana and other neighbouring states to release a fixed quantity of water to the national capital so that it can fulfil its drinking requirements.“The Wazirabad barrage from where raw water from the river is transported through different channels will soon see a spike in the water levels. DJB engineers and officers are present at different water treatment plants, not only in Delhi but also in Haryana to monitor the flow of water there,” Chadha added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/water-supply-will-improve-soon-says-djb-vice-chief-visits-haiderpur-treatment-plant-101626371169225.html

The board on Thursday warned that schools failing to adhere to the moderation policy may face action. “As the board has to declare the result latest by July 31, 2021, schools are requested to follow the schedule strictly and complete the moderation within school. If any school is left to complete the moderation within the stipulated schedule, their result will be declared separately after July 31,” controller of examination (CoE) Sanyam Bhardwaj said in a circular to schools on Thursday.Following the cancellation of class 10 and 12 exams due to the second wave of Covid-19 that gripped the country in April, the national education board directed schools to compile results based on internal tests and marks students fetched in the previous board examination. The results are to be compiled by the result committee in each school comprising the principal, two senior-most teachers of Class 12 of that school, and two teachers of Class 12 from a neighbouring school.On Thursday, Bhardwaj also asked the results committee to ensure results were compiled in a fair manner. “Schools are therefore mandated to moderate the marks in such a manner that the results are comparable and no student should suffer because of any unequal application of policy within a school or across schools,” the CoE told the heads of schools.Schools have also been asked to ensure that after moderation, the number of students with overall marks in the range of 95 and above this year is not more than the number of students scoring such overall marks, as per the historic performance of last three years. This comes after the CBSE on Tuesday asked schools to stick to the assessment policy formulated by it for Class 10 results after the cancellation of the board exams and warned action against institutes found inflating marks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/class-12-results-cbse-asks-schools-to-complete-marks-moderation-by-july-22-101626371109201.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Civil society seeks more time to submit comments on draft master plan||The civil society members want Delhi Development Authority to extend the deadline for submitting their comments on the draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041.The draft plan, which was made public for comments on June 9, pushes for mixed-use development, creating large public spaces, reducing built densities through planned regeneration to allow distancing during pandemics, as part of its plans to develop “pandemic-resilient” infrastructure. Apart from pandemic resilience, the master plan also has provisions to reduce seismic vulnerability and the chances of floods in urban areas.The “Main Bhi Dilli” campaign, a collective of over 40 civil society groups that aims to make the planning in Delhi “more representative and inclusive”, released an analysis of the draft MPD-2041 on Thursday. While experts welcomed the provision for mixed land use development, they stressed on the need for walkability, development of inclusive social infrastructure and provisions for bringing the informal sector under the planning ambit.They collective also said 45 days was not sufficient to hold public consultations on the draft MPD. Gautam Bhan, urban researcher and member of Main Bhi Dilli Campaign, said, “It took DDA three years to make the plan, but people have been given just 45 days to submit their comments. We want the DDA to release the baseline data and provide time for suggestions/objections from the day the data is put in the public domain.”Bhan said zonal plans and local area plans are a must for the effective implementation of MPD-2041. “While a timeline has been set for drafting of policies and regulations for urban villages and unauthorised colonies, no timeline has been provided for preparation of zonal plans. In MPD-2021, there is a provision for local area plans, but those were never made,” said Bhan.Housing is one of the key issues in the master plan and the draft provides for different types of housing, including rental, to meet the growing requirement. Members of the campaign said the DDA has given the projected demand of housing as 34.5 lakh in the draft MPD. Mukta Naik, a researcher with the Centre for Policy Research, said, “Our demand is that DDA should give the break-up of the 34.5 lakh units in terms of EWS/LIG/MIG and other categories.”The MPD-2041, for the first time, talks about making Delhi a 24x7 city by allowing a night-time economy. Welcoming the move, Kalpana Viswanath, co-founder and CEO of Safetipin, an organisation working to create safe spaces for women, said, “Night-time economy is a good idea, but for that, we have to first make the city safe for women.”She also stressed on the need to have a “gender chapter” in the master plan and provision reserving housing for single women.The campaign also focused on livelihood, mobility and other sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-civil-society-seeks-more-time-to-submit-comments-on-draft-master-plan-101626371108621.html

He was appointed as assistant to Colonel Claude Wade, who was the political agent of the British Government at Ludhiana for the Punjab-Afghan relations.Thus, he lived among the Sikhs for eight years, and during a important portion of their history, he had at the same time got free access to all public records on the affairs of the frontier.“In 1844, he drew up reports on the British annexation. He conceived the idea and felt that he had the means of writing the first-hand history for the people,” a history account read.Dr Paramvir Singh, professor at the department of Encyclopedia of Sikhism at Punjabi University in Patiala, said Cunningham’s book ‘A History of the Sikhs - From the Origin of the Nation to the Battles of the Sutlej’ that was published in 1849 in London, is considered the first authentic English account of the Sikh history.“He was eyewitness to the Anglo-Sikh wars fought between the British and the Sikh forces at Bhaddoval, Aliwal and Sabhraon. He produced his book from the original British sources and got it published while posted in Bhopal. The nine-chapter book is divided into four and five chapters, where in the first part he explains the religion, the Sikh gurus and the transfer of power between them. In the latter part, the whole war is theorised along with the British-Sikh relations,” the professor said.Dr Singh says the most important thing he wrote in his book was that the British won the war and they had precipitated but could have lost it, if they hadn’t done lobbying with the Dogra ministers of Raja Ranjit Singh.“According to Cunningham, the British won the battles against the Sikhs because Raja Lal Singh, Raja Tej Singh and Gulab Singh (commander-in-chief) of Lahore Darbar betrayed their own army. Due to this reference, he faced severe criticism and wrath from his superiors, was dismissed from political service and shifted to the Meerut division. But soon after, he died in Ambala in 1851,” he observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/grave-of-first-british-sikh-historian-found-in-ambala-101626370689635.html

He openly advocated that SKM leaders should launch Mission Punjab and contest the coming polls.“Charuni’s suspension has come as a major setback to lakhs of farmers of Haryana who were facing FIRs and police action, and are away from their families for the past seven months in support of the agitation,” said his follower Nirmal Singh, of Yamunanagar.BKU (Charuni) state secretary Harpal Singh said leaders from Punjab were worried about his popularity not only in Haryana but also in Punjab which is why they decided to sideline him.DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONSince the beginning of the agitation in November last year, Charuni had difference of opinion with the Morcha leaders on multiple occasions.Farm leaders from Punjab were planning to start a sit-in at Sambhu border on November 25 and later Charuni insisted that they should break the barricades and try to reach Delhi.He had assured them that farmers from Haryana will clear the barricades to make way for them. His supporters had removed most barricades from Shambu border to Kundli border in Sonepat. Charuni was also against the decision of Morcha leaders over holding kisan panchayats in Haryana and Punjab as he was in favour of taking the protest to other states.In January, Charuni was snubbed by the Morcha members for meeting political leaders and the move was strongly condemned by them. He had assured that he will not share the platform with any political party till the farmers’ agitation is on.Charuni had slammed his counterpart from UP, Rakesh Tikait, on several occasions. Recently, Charuni without naming anybody had also raised questions on why farmers were not holding protests against BJP leaders in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.WHAT NEXTThe development has exposed the fissures among the Morcha members. Charuni has slammed the decision of his suspension but made it clear that he will continue to support the agitation.People close to him said he is still at the Singhu border and people from Haryana and Punjab came to meet him in the morning.His supporters are planning to lead a convoy of thousands of farmers from Yamunanagar on July 20 to the Singhu border.“The decision will not affect our association with the agitation. We will continue our fight for rights of the farmers,” said BKU (Charuni) spokesperson Rakesh Bains.Dr Ramji Lal, a retired professor of political science, said, “The decision may have an impact on the agitation as it could demoralise the supporters from Haryana. But Charuni’s call for a political foray could go either way as he had already contested the polls unsuccessfully.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/charunis-suspension-comes-as-setback-to-followers-support-pouring-in-101626370451012.html

Mittal is also the chairman of Noida and Greater Noida authorities.“The commissioner assured us to address our demands so that the roadmap of flat registry to homebuyers can be prepared and their grievances can be addressed properly. We want the government to support us and offer an interest waiver in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said RK Arora, chairman of Supertech Group.Arora is also the president of UP unit of the National Real Estate Development Council (NREDCO), a realtors’ body. The developers demanded that the UP government should come out with a package to revive the real estate sector in the state. “The Noida and Greater Noida authorities should stop levying a transfer fee on commercial properties. The two authorities charge 1 to 2.5% of total commercial property as transfer fee when an owner sells it to another. We demand this fee should be done away with as the real estate sector is witnessing a crisis,” said Rakesh Yadav, managing director of Antriksh Group.The realtors also demanded that the authorities should implement a decision of the Supreme Court directing that only 8.5% interest should be charged on defaulted amount of developers as it will benefit the buyers.After the meeting, Mittal said, “The state government is looking into these issues for an appropriate decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-industrial-commissioner-developers-discuss-several-issues-101626369548457.html
15-07-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: GDA selects agency to prepare project report for ropeway link||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has selected an agency to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the proposed ‘urban passenger ropeway’ link between Vaishali and Mohan Nagar metro stations. Officials said that the authority decided to develop a ropeway system, instead of a metro link to connect Vaishali with Mohan Nagar, as it will cost about ₹450 crore as against an estimated ₹1,808 crore for the 5.04km metro link. The officials also said that they have plans to extend the metro service up to the Ghaziabad railway station, which is proposed to be developed as a major city centre. “The agency has started work for preparation of a DPR. It is expected to be complete in 15 days. The project cost of the ropeway system is much less than that of a metro extension. Initially, the ropeway was also planned between New Bus Adda metro station and Ghaziabad railway station, but now we plan to bring in metro services instead,” said Krishna Karunesh, vice-chairperson, GDA. In December last year, the authority had started with the consideration of a ropeway system instead of bringing in metro services between Vaishali and Mohan Nagar. Ropeway is a transport system for ferrying goods or people especially used in mountainous areas, wherein the carrier cars are suspended with the help of moving cables, powered by a motor system. At present, Ghaziabad has two metro links -- from Vaishali to Delhi’s Anand Vihar (Blue Line) and from New Bus Adda to Delhi’s Dilshad Garden (Red Line), which includes Mohan Nagar station.The GDA officials said that the Ghaziabad railway station is proposed to be developed into a model city centre station with an estimated project cost of about ₹1,000 crore and will have all modern amenities for passengers, besides commercial facilities. “In such a scenario, we plan to extend Dilshad Garden-New Bus Adda metro route to Ghaziabad railway station (Bajaria side). For the other side (Vijay Nagar side) of the railway station, we have planned to link it via metro to Noida Sector 62 metro station. This will help commuters of Noida as well as Ghaziabad,” the GDA vice-chairperson said. The authority last year proposed and got prepared DPRs of two metro extensions – 5.05km route from Vaishali to Mohan Nagar and 5.017km Electronic City (Noida Sector 62) to Sahibabad. Together the two projects were pegged at a completion cost of ₹3,325.22 crore, and the GDA denied to share the cost burden alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-gda-selects-agency-to-prepare-project-report-for-ropeway-link-101626369248552.html
15-07-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Contractor alleges assault, abduction by former partner||Greater Noida: A city-based building contractor has alleged that he was abducted and assaulted on Wednesday night by his former partner who let him go after extorting ₹40 lakh from him. The contractor, Sachin Sharma, is a resident of Eldeco Greens society under the Beta 2 police jurisdiction. According to the police, Sharma and his former partner, a resident of the same society, were working on a project in Bulandshahr but due to delays, the latter pulled out of the project six months ago and was asking for his ₹1 crore. “Around 7.30pm, the former partner called Sharma and asked him to meet on the premises of the society. Soon, they left the premises,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 3. In his complaint, Sharma alleged that he was taken by the former partner and his three goons forcefully and they demanded a ransom of ₹1 crore for his release. The amount was negotiated down to ₹40 lakh which, Sharma claimed, was collected by the partner’s wife, the police said, adding that he was allowed to go after five hours. A case was registered on Thursday against the former partner, his wife and three associates for extortion and assault at Beta 2 police station. The police said that Sharma’s partner is currently at large. “There are inconsistencies in Sharma’s statements. Initially, he claimed that the money was collected from various sources and then delivered by an office boy. However, the lenders have not corroborated these claims. Later, Sharma said that the money was taken from a female friend. We are still verifying whether the money exchanged hands or not,” said Pandey. The officials said that a probe in the matter is underway and due legal action will be taken against any wrongdoers, including the complainant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-contractor-alleges-assault-abduction-by-former-partner-101626369008931.html
15-07-2021||Noida||Doing better business than last year, say Noida malls||Noida Managers of shopping malls in Noida say they are doing better business this year as compared to the post-unlock period in 2020, and they are witnessing a good footfall during the end of season sales. During the unlock period, the governments permit places to open and resume normal activities — albeit with significant safeguards — after spending months under the lockdown.According to the managers, restrictions like weekend lockdown, and “negligible audiences in multiplexes” continue to be common hurdles.“Customers seem to be more confident and assured about the Covid-19 safety protocols this year. The prime reason being the vaccination. End of season sales have also been drawing customers to malls. So, from approximately 1,000-2,000 customers in the first week of the opening, the footfall has spiked to almost 20,000 customers a day at present... Food and beverage business is yet to pick up pace, maybe because dinners have the maximum number of customers on weekends. Cinema halls, too, have only a few takers,” said Justin Masih, general manager, Gaur City Mall in Greater Noida. The weekend lockdown, however, is abstaining from the loss recovery.Amit Taneja, vice president (operations), Logix Mall in Noida, said, “We are having a decent footfall and the number of visitors increased from the second week of the opening. It is better than that of Diwali 2020. At present, we are seeing 6,000-7,000 customers per day. In January 2020, before the pandemic outbreak, we used to have over 14,000 customers.”“We are getting a good response from our retail partners and customers. Nearly 90% of the branded shops inside the mall are operational, and our F&B partners are also allowed to operate in adherence to the guidelines issued by the local authorities,” said a representative of DLF Mall of India, Noida Sector-18, requesting anonymity. He, however, did not disclose the daily footfall.“People are more aware this year. The guards don’t even have to ask a single customer to wear a mask or maintain social distance,” said Vikas Tyagi, vice president, Supertech Shopprix Mall in Sector 61.Last year, shopping malls were closed in wake of the coronavirus-induced lockdown and were later allowed to open from June 9, 2020, after being shut for 70 days. The malls were again shut this year after the Uttar Pradesh government imposed a partial curfew from April 30, 2021, amidst the second wave of Covid-19. The curbs were later relaxed, and malls were permitted to open from June 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/doing-better-business-than-last-year-say-noida-malls-101626369008321.html

In a matter of using illegally mined sand for construction of a wall of the pond, police are investigating,” said Rai Singh Narwariya, additional superintendent of police, Morena, adding that no FIR has been lodged.Pandre was attacked by the mining mafia at least 11 times and registered the complaint at a different police station. Pandre seized more than 80 tractor-trolleys and trucks laden with illegally mined sand worth lakhs of rupees.“She was a hardworking officer and we really saw a curb in illegal sand mining in Chambal Sanctuary, which has been going on since 2007,” said Sudhir Sapra, an environmentalist and local activist.“The transfer of Pandre proved her accusation that mining mafias are getting the support of police and local administration in Chambal division. She has been punished for being an honest officer. We will stage protest against this order,” said Satendra Singh Tomar, a social activist from Morena, who is running a campaign on social media against the Pandre’s transfer.The opposition leaders also attacked the BJP-led state government for patronizing the mining mafia. Former minister and Congress MLA Govind Singh said, “In Chambal division, police and district administration are patronizing the mining mafia. Huge money is involved in it. They are spoiling the environment and Chambal Sanctuary for money. We will not keep mum against this injustice with a woman forest officer. We will expose the state government for punishing honest officers.” However, state minister of urban development and housing OPS Bhadoria said, “Pandre transfer is a routine practice. We appreciate her effort to stop illegal mining but the accusation against the government and police are baseless. Police officers are also working hard and taking action against the mafia.”“Congress leaders shouldn’t say anything about the transfer as we all know that during their tenure of 15 months, then Congress government only focused on transfer posting business,” he added. Morena, superintendent of police, Lalit Shakyawar said, “It is wrong to blame the police. Police are taking action against the mafia. Even we requested Shradha Pandre to inform the police before taking any action against mafia so that enough police force could send for protection but she hardly paid any attention to our request.” Despite repeated attempts, Pandre couldn’t be contacted. On Facebook, she had posted, “The transfer is a normal practice for me as whenever I took a tough action against the mafia, I had to face this. Earlier too, I was transferred for the same reason.”The Supreme Court order banned sand mining in Chambal Wildlife Sanctuary in 2007 but illegal sand mining still takes place. Every day, at least 100 dumpers and 1,000 tractor trolleys are used for transportation of illegally excavated sand from Chambal, claimed locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-woman-officer-takes-action-against-illegal-mining-mafia-gets-transferred-101626366908961.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Tunnel-like structures excavated at Golden Temple Complex||The construction of a new “jora ghar” for devotees to deposit their footwear at the Golden Temple complex was stopped after Sikh activists clashed with workers on hearing about historical tunnel-like structures being unearthed while excavating the site in Amritsar on Thursday.In view of the surge in the number of devotees, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) decided to construct a big “jora ghar” on the Akal Takht secretariat side of the complex and assinged the work to Kar Sewa, a voluntary organisation headed by Baba Kashmir Singh Bhuri Wale.As Kar Sewa volunteers were excavating the site to construct the building’s basement, they found tunnel-like structures made of small bricks — that were reportedly used centuries ago — at a depth of about 25 feet. Considering them to be ordinary structures with no religious or historical value, both SGPC and volunteers decided to carry on with the work.However, as the news along with visuals of the site was shared on social media, members of Sikh Sadbhawna Dal, led by former Golden Temple hazuri ragi (gurbani musician) Bhai Baldev Singh Wadala, reached the site and demanded that the work be stopped in order to conserve the historical structure. This led to heated arguments and a scuffle between the two groups. As the land is owned by Punjab Urban Development Authority, subdivisional magistrate Vikas Hira reached the site along with police and stopped the work till further orders. Archaeological expert to examine site: SDM“After tunnel-like structures were found during the excavation, the work has been stopped for now. The site will be examined by an archaeological expert. A joint meeting of Sikh bodies and government officials will be held. Sentiments of Sikh bodies will be kept in mind while taking the next decision,” said the SDM.Meanwhile, police have been deployed at the site to ensure no work is carried out on the portion of the land where the structures were found. “All historical structures deserve to be preserved with respect. I don’t oppose the new construction, but it can also be done by keeping the old structures found during excavation intact,” said Wadala.Requesting all parties not to create a controversy over the issue, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said: “The building found underground is very beautiful. Amritsar deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira has said that he has sent a message to the archaeological department in this regard and its team will visit the site on Friday. Even the SGPC will get the structure examined by historians, and if found historical, it will be preserved.”Prof Balvinder Singh, former head of Guru Ramdas School of Planning, Guru Nanak Dev University, and adviser, Indian Heritage Cities Network, said similar structures were found near Gurdwara Lohgarh a few years ago, but were ignored. “It might be some tunnel linking to the summer palace in Rambagh where Maharaja Ranjit Singh used to stay during his visit to Amritsar. It could also have a link with Akhara Sangal Wala as it is quite lower than the road level. A serious and sincere effort is required to explore and preserve such heritage,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tunnellike-structures-excavated-at-golden-temple-complex-101626366550366.html
15-07-2021||Pune||Construction work snarls traffic at Chandani Chowk||Traffic congestion at Chandini chowk has increased due to the on-going fly over work which has picked up pace since the second Covid wave erupted in the city. The construction did not have an impact on traffic initially due to the partial lockdown during the second wave, however, since restrictions have eased, commuters are facing trouble in the area. A two-storey flyover will be constructed at Chandni Chowk to alleviate traffic congestion in the area including Chandni Chowk, Kothrud, Warje, and Baner. The bridges will be linked to Mumbai, Satara, Mulshi, and Kothrud from Chandni Chowk. The overall project cost is ₹900 crore, of which ₹400 crore are for the construction of the flyover and ₹500 crore are for land acquisition.

Already it is a highway and the construction noise makes things more difficult.

15-07-2021||Pune||MahaMetro launches Station Access and Mobility Program (Stamp)||The MahaMetro, WRI India Ross Centre and Toyota Mobility Foundation, today launched the Station Access and Mobility Program (STAMP) Pune online. Stamp Pune aims to build integrated and resilient city transport networks and enhance last-mile connectivity to Pune Metro by tapping into innovative data-based solutions. MahaMetro along with WRI India and the Toyota Mobility Foundation together have initiated this programme which is a multi-year, multi-city initiative to create innovative solutions that improve multimodal commute in Indian cities. Pune is the fifth city of the initiative, led by MahaMetro to improve accessibility to the metro and commuter experience at metro stations, especially keeping in mind the new normal. Madhav Pai, executive director, WRI India Ross Centre for sustainable cities said, “There are two avenues of commuter experience that Stamp Pune will explore, assessing operational performance of last-mile operators for ensuring better connectivity, and developing strategies for effective planning of last-mile services at Pune metro stations.” This initiative aims to identify and work with innovative technology companies and city planners to develop a data-based last-mile planning tool based on commuter demand and preference parameters. During the presentation, key points that were identified were commuter-centric and city parameters that affect access to and use of public transportation, travel patterns where metro may be advantageous, in conjunction with other modes and provide an evidence-based intelligence for deploying commuter-centric last-mile services at Metro stations. “The goal of Stamp Pune is to build and enhance high ridership through safe, seamless, and efficient multimodal integrations. We have also identified options for the commuter to use Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses and identified routes for the buses around each station and also signed an MoU with almost 14 operators for feeder services to provide better last-mile connectivity,” T Manoj Kumar, DGM - Multimodal Integration & Transport Planning, Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited. Indian Railways too will play a part in bringing the people closer to the last mile connectivity, for wherever railways and Metro interface, railways commuters can access the Metro. Atul Gadgil, director (Works), Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited said that the biggest challenge they have, as Pune Metro, is to encourage people to switch to public transport. Gadgil said, “Because of an increase in private vehicles, average speeds in Pune have come down to between 10 kmph-15 kmph. Through the study via the Stamp initiative, it will help give us an idea of how much ridership Pune Metro can hope to tap into and achieve in initial months.” Gadgil was disappointed with the footpaths and found it challenging to walk in the city hence said, “Metro will be developing along with the local municipal authority’s user-friendly pedestrian and road infrastructure to promote use of metro of around 500 meters of each metro station.” He also said that the Indian Metro systems are affordable to every stratum of society. The minimum fare could range from five rupees to a maximum of ₹50. Pranjali Deshpande, domestic expert of sustainable mobility said, “Affordability must be seen from different angles. There are people from vulnerable groups who cannot afford INR 5 for the PMPML bus. For Metro, how can we facilitate those trips through schemes for a more equitable access? Everyone has the right to travel in the metro. While ensuring first and last-mile connectivity for Metro is essential, only the ‘supply’ side will not work. The authorities need to make a strong travel demand management plan in terms of making parking expensive, not supplying more and more parking, flyovers and roads. The system should ensure social equity and affordability for vulnerable groups by providing special passes or schemes for them” Pras Ganesh, director, Toyota Mobility Foundation (TMF) added that the mission of TMF is to enable more people to go more places, in the most sustainable way. Mobility equals opportunity and those solutions need to be considered with a holistic view, factoring in the entire ecosystem. The data helps to integrate all the aspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mahametro-launches-station-access-and-mobility-program-stamp-101626364809335.html

Soon after ABVP’s foundation day ceremony, several other students’ organizations lodged complaints with PU in this regard, forcing it to order the probe into the matter.Meanwhile, probe team members are tight-lipped over the progress of investigation. “It is not easy to probe a syndicate member, but we are discharging our duties honestly and the guilty can’t be spared,” one of the members said.On the other hand, ABVP functionaries described the unfurling of the flag in the college as an old practice. “We have been hoisting ABVP’s flag on its foundation day every year in the college,” PU ABVP president Abhishek Singh said, declaring it a “deep-rooted conspiracy to malign the image of ABVP”. Recently, anti-corruption watchdog Lokayukta police had revealed serious financial irregularities in PU, raising serious questions over the role of its first V-C Prof Rajesh Singh.

15-07-2021||Pune||Pune registers 74% YoY growth in residential sales: report||Home sales in Pune has witnessed a significant growth of 74 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to 17,474 units in the first half of 2021 against 10,049 units in the same period during 2020, according to a “India Real Estate January – June 2021” report released by Knight Frank India on Thursday. This performance, according to the report, can be attributed largely to robust sales clocked in first quarter of 2021 which was whipped by the lower stamp duty window and a low base of second quarter of 2020. New launches in Pune also grew by 52 per cent to 20,477 units in H1 2021 from 13,435 units in H1 2020. The healthy increase in launches is mainly due to the lower base effect and less stringent lockdown during the second wave of Covid-19. The government permitted construction activity, followed by guidelines which aided launched to grow. The residential sales in Pune started to show resurgence in home sales and launches, especially during the third quarter in 2020 and fourth quarter in 2020 after the reduction of stamp duty rates; this momentum was also carried into first quarter of 2021. However, as the second wave of the pandemic began unfolding, the momentum dropped, with Q2 2021 registering a sequential drop of 72 per cent in volume of home sales and 87 per cent in new home launches. With reference to the performance of micro-markets, markets in the West (which includes Aundh, Baner, Wakad, Hinjewadi, Bavdhan, Pashan) and East (which includes Viman Nagar, Kharadi, Wagholi, Hadapsar, Dhanori) continued to dominate sales in Pune. In H1 2021, markets in the West had the highest- 39 per cent share of new sales followed by the East at 23 per cent. Proximity to office hubs is the reason why these markets are witnessing greater traction. The homebuyers are cognizant of the fact that they will be required to go to the office at least a few days a week once things return to normal and are showing a preference for locations close to employment hubs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-registers-74-yoy-growth-in-residential-sales-report-101626364568621.html

The indictment came from Avinash Kumar, additional sessions judge, Jhanjharpur, in a case where a minor girl was allegedly raped but the accused was charged only with kidnapping. Also, the victim was shown to be major against the opinion of a medical board which held her to be 15 years old when she was kidnapped. The court of Avinash Kumar also issued a show cause notice to additional chief judicial magistrate, Jhanjharpur, asking how it concluded that the girl was a major. The magistrate has been asked to reply on July 19.The court was hearing a bail plea by the accused, Balbir Sadai, who has been in custody since February 25 this year.The girl’s mother, in her FIR, had alleged that on January 6 this year, Sadai kidnapped her minor daughter (15 years) with the purpose of marriage. Subsequently, a charge sheet was filed by the police in which Sadai was charged with kidnapping. The Madhubani SP, in his supervision report, had cleared the charge sheet.Rejecting bail for the accused, the court observed that the SP did not have basic knowledge of laws relating to offences against minors and sought to know why charges of rape and laws related to Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2016, were not applied in the case. The court also issued show cause notices to subdivisional police officer (Jhanjharpur) and station house officer of Bhairav Asthan police station. “The SP should be sent for special training at the IPS training academy to relate to offences against the minor girl,” the court said. The judge also asked state police chief and home minister, government of India, to look into the matter and conduct an inquiry in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/madhubani-court-blasts-sp-says-needs-fresh-training-in-laws-101626364568075.html

15-07-2021||Patna||For vaccination, all roads lead to Patna||Beneficiaries from adjoining districts are adding to the rush at Covid-19 vaccination centres in Patna, pointing to vaccine shortage in some districts other than the state capital. Beneficiaries from Vaishali, Bhojpur and Jehanabad and in some cases even from Munger, nearly 180 kms to the east of Patna, have come to take the jabs in Patna, said an official. “We have received inputs on people from neighbouring districts coming to take the jab at our vaccination centres. We are not denying vaccination to any Indian, irrespective of the place of domicile,” said Chandrashekhar Singh, Patna’s district magistrate. Mansoon Mohanty, district resource unit team lead for Patna of Care India, partners in the implementation of the government’s health programme, overseeing operations at the three 24x7 vaccination centres in Patna, said: “We got a family which drove all the way from Munger to take the shot at our vaccination centre at Patliputra Ashok hotel.” “People from adjoining districts are also coming to take the jabs, pointing to a growing awareness about vaccination among people,” he said. Indians took the first shot of Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine abroad and were due for their second dose, have been given Covishield shots at our centres here, added Mohanty. With 9,002 jabs, the three 24x7 vaccination centres managed by Care India in Patna, recorded the highest inoculations in a day on Wednesday. Of this, the Patliputra Sports Complex accounted for 3,821 doses, the hotel Patliputra Ashok 2,951 and Polytechnic College, Patliputa, 2,230. The district magistrate said a good response towards vaccination had been created. “The demand now is much more than supply. As such, we are unable to meet the increasing demand because of vaccine shortage, forcing us to shut down some vaccination sites occasionally,” added Singh. “We achieved a milestone on June 25 by administering 80,508 doses — the highest inoculations in a day so far — catapulting Patna to the third slot among districts in India that day after Pune (1.38 lakh doses), Mumbai (86,520 doses),” the DM added. Patna was now administering an average daily 40,000 doses, said its district immunisation officer Dr SP Vinayak. “The number of vaccinations depends on availability of vaccines. We had 97,000 doses left in our stock on Wednesday evening, which we hope to administer to beneficiaries soon,” he added. Patna has contributed to 12% of the 1.94 crore doses of vaccine administered in the state till Wednesday. The state capital aims to complete first dose vaccination of its urban adults by July 25. Rural Patna, with first-dose vaccination achievement of 24%, has been slow to keep pace with urban areas. Rural Patna has a target population of 29.12 lakh against 14.36 lakh in urban Patna. “We are deploying one vaccination van in each of the 75 municipal wards for the next 10 days in Patna to complete the first dose vaccination of the eligible population available here,” said Singh. “The government’s focus is to first target the low-hanging fruits, before moving up. We will shift our focus to the rural population, who are fast shedding their reluctance towards vaccination once the willing urban population has been administered the first dose,” said a health official. This also explains the fact why people from rural areas of adjoining districts are crowding in Patna for vaccination..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/for-vaccination-all-roads-lead-to-patna-101626364448009.html

People attending a funeral in the graveyard saw a round-shaped structure wrapped in a black bag and found a woman’s picture pinned to a green pumpkin, upon closer inspection. The structure was garnished with haldi-kumkum, and was kept with a piece of ornament and some lemons, which made it look like an attempt at what is considered in rural parts as black magic. People from the village gathered at the spot to inspect the structure. “We did receive such information from a local reporter. We have registered a suo motu case and investigation will begin. We are yet to identify the woman in the picture but the identity will be protected even when we do identify her.

15-07-2021||Pune||PCB orders vendors to maintain ‘status quo’ at Fashion Street||The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) administration has ordered the vendors operating inside the burnt fashion street market to maintain status quo and refrain from carrying out illegal constructions inside the market. Recently, the board had received complaints about pipe iron structures being built without the mandatory permission of the board. The board administration wants to construct a commercial complex equipped with all the fire safety norms and claims that the hawkers have not shown any interest in the proposal. The PCB has issued a public notice asking the vendors to main ‘status quo’ at the market. PCB CEO Amit Kumar said, “We had ordered for the status quo at the market to be maintained as we don’t want the lives of the citizens including the vendors in danger in case of future incidents of fire. Currently, the vendors are carrying out illegal constructions which are against the cantonment act. We have written to Pune police to take action against illegal construction at Fashion Street and requested them that, if need be, an FIR be registered. The compromise decree with the vendors is pending in court and till further orders; the hawkers cannot be legally evicted out of the premises. There was no sanction for construction of permanent structures as per the original decree.” MG road hawkers and pathari seva sansthan president advocate MG Akolkar said, “Who is the PCB to order status quo at the market as it is the mandate of the court? The board had given permission to the hawkers to conduct business at Fashion Street in 1990. After the outbreak of the fire, the business was stopped for some time. The business never stopped and will continue. The 440 hawkers are doing business usual at Fashion Street. The board must protect the rights of the traders and allow them to conduct them business as per their constitutional rights. The administration has become dictatorial and itself going against the law by snatching away the livelihoods of poor vendors.” On March 26, as many as 600 shops were completely gutted after a major fire broke out at the famous Fashion Street market in the Camp area of While there were no casualties in blaze, the head of Pune Cantonment Board’s (PCB) fire department killed in road accident while returning home after dousing fire. Prakash Hasabe died after his two-wheeler came under the wheels of a truck around 6.30 am, the next morning. He was on his way home to Viman Nagar after finishing the firefighting work at Fashion Street which got burnt down completely in fire incident. Fashion Street adjacent to MG Road is a famous `window shopping’’ destination that houses small outlets selling garments, shoes, goggles and other accessories. Local traders said there were 448 registered shops and over 200 unauthorised outlets located in the market. According to Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), a report was submitted in 2018 highlighting the “risk” of similar incidents and possible difficulty to deal with it at Fashion Street due to congested nature of area. The joint fire audit report submitted by the Chief Fire Officer (CFO), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Fire Brigade Superintendent of PCB was discussed at the special board meeting held in 2018 under the chairmanship of the then PCB president Brigadier Rajiv Sethi. The audit report says the market does not have sufficient exit points in case there is a fire and people have to be evacuated. Fire incidents that happened in different cities of the country, it was required to do a fire safety assessment or audit. In 1997, MG Road was cleared off by unauthorised vendors and the administration provided these hawker stalls of five feet by four feet and totally 565 shops came under the agreement. The report pointed out that many shopkeepers used plastic curtains as partitions, which are hazardous in the event of a fire, and the narrow ways inside make it difficult to move. There are stalls outside the market serving as cafeterias or hotels and use fuels like LPG and kerosene, the report stated. According to the records and earlier verification carried out by the revenue staff of PCB, the place is not safe if any fire incident takes place. Also, it is difficult for a fire vehicle or ambulance to reach there due to narrow and congested roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pcb-orders-vendors-to-maintain-status-quo-at-fashion-street-101626364328724.html

In the absence of accounts, there is always scope of financial irregularities. One does not know how the funds are being spent,” said Rakesh Mohan, additional deputy CAG (eastern region), who was on a visit to Patna during which he met deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad and top officials.Mohan said the state government gave these PSUs ₹30, 481 crore in loans and equity as in 2018-19, which was a wrong practice.“Some PSUs have not given accounts for the last 43 years. It is really surprising. If there are no accounts, there is no accountability,” he said. Mohan said there were 36 working and 37 non-working PSUs while eight PSUs were making profit in the state. He said the implementation of the comprehensive financial management system( CFMS) by the state fianancé department was a good step which would facilitate financial discipline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/large-number-of-bihar-psus-not-preparing-accounts-cag-official-101626364328084.html

A notification issued by Jitendra Kumar, additional director general at the state police headquarters, identified the officers removed from their posts as Paliganj DSP Tanvir Ahmad, Sadar DSP (Aurangabad) Anup Kumar, DSP (Ara) Pankaj Rawat and DSP (Dehri) Pankaj Rawat.Sources said the action has been taken on the basis of a report by the Economic Offences Unit (EoU), which conducted an inquiry into illegal sand mining in Sone and Ganga rivers in Patna, Bhojpur, Aurangabad and Rohtas districts. A senior official of home department said several other officials would be booked soon. The official said EOU’s report has been placed before chief minister Nitish Kumar and his nod was awaited to initiate legal action against them. On Wednesday, the home department had removed Aurangabad SP Sudheer Kumar Podika and Bhojpur SP Rakesh Kumar Dubey and directed them to report to state police headquarters.

Participating in a virtual meet convened by newly appointed DoNER (ministry of development of northeastern region) minister GK Reddy, Khandu said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah have stressed that the inter-state boundary issue should be resolved amicably out-of-court. “Inter-state boundary issue has been long pending. I have discussed it with my Assam counterpart, Himanta Biswa Sarma, and we have agreed to go for an out-of-court solution to all issues related to our boundary,” he said.“In fact, we have already started working at the ground. If everything goes well in the next few months we may see some concrete results towards instilling peace permanently along our boundaries,” Khandu added.Assam shares an 804 kilometre-long boundary with Arunachal Pradesh. Though there was no dispute initially, over the years allegations of residents of one state encroaching land on the other have led to disputes and violence. A suit has been pending in Supreme Court since 1989 on the issue. The border issues between both states hit headlines last month after Kimin in Arunachal Pradesh, where Union defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated 12 roads in presence of CMs of both Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, was shown as Bilgarh in Assam. After protests by several organizations in Arunachal Pradesh and Khandu and Union minister Kiren Rijiju pointing out the ‘serious mistake’, Border Roads Organisation (BRO), which had organised the event, tendered an unconditional apology for the ‘unintentional error’.Besides Arunachal, Assam has long-standing boundary disputes with Mizoram, Nagaland and Meghalaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/boundary-issues-with-assam-to-be-sorted-out-of-court-arunachal-pradesh-cm-101626359288964.html

The raid was conducted jointly by a team of police and CID wing on Thursday morning following a tip-off about mobile phones being used by terrorists lodged in the high-security prison, said officials privy to the development. It may be stated that many terrorists and their overground workers, who were part of terror attacks hatched from across the border, have been lodged in the prison. “A probe has been ordered to know how these mobile phones with SIM cards reached inside the high-security prison and who was using them,” said a senior police officer. Recoveries included ten mobile phones, including five Android phones, seven SIM cards, 12 earphones, four pen drives, five mobile chargers, one mobile battery, two Bluetooth headphones, three data cables, seven knives, two diaries, eight paper pieces with mobile numbers. “The possibility of smartphones having been used to communicate across the border via social apps cannot be ruled out,” said the people cited above. According to an official statement issued on Thursday, conducting an unplanned surprise search has led to the confiscation of mobile phones and SIM cards from some of the inmates of the high-security Kot Bhalwal Central Jail. Repeated calls and messages to DG prisons Dr B Srinivas remained unanswered. Kot Bhalwal is the prison from where Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar and other terrorists, such as Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar and Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, were released from the prison in exchange for the passengers and crew of IC-814 in Kandahar on December 31, 1999.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cellphones-sim-cards-seized-from-high-security-prison-in-jammu-101626357848857.html
15-07-2021||Other||Taste of life: Pune Bhojanagruha is state’s first native restraurant||January 10, 1882. An unusual editorial appeared in “Kesari”. Written by Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, the self–proclaimed “Shivaji of Marathi language” and one of the founders of the newspaper, it tried to educate the residents of Pune about the many virtues of a unique and recently opened institution named “Pune Bhojanagruha” - the first restaurant in Pune, and the first “native restaurant” in Maharashtra. Chiplunkar began the article by reminding his readers that “a new, innovative institution” had started business in Pune six months ago. “Bhojanagruha is a Western concept and has been absent in our country all these years. Our culture dictates that we honour our guests and feed them. In the earlier times, one would wait on the streets in the afternoon to look for guests they could feed and earn virtue. Kings would feed thousands of Brahmins, and students would be fed in temples and in schools. But in the modern times, both Goddess Lakshmi and Goddess Annapurna have left this country, and the modern Political Economy has made us believe that feeding a guest is to make them lazy”, he wrote.He then went on to explain how important a restaurant was to ensure that the students and travellers got their meals - “These days, it is difficult for a householder to feed his relatives and students who visit his house. It becomes more difficult when one arrives unannounced. The houses are small and the money, less. One cannot just sit idly in the home and serve the guests; livelihood has to be earned. Hence, a Bhojanagruha is the need of the hour. The students and the travellers would eat there without causing inconvenience to anyone”.When Chiplunkar mentioned in his editorial that “Pune Bhojanagruha” was the first of its kind “in the country”, there were a few “hotels” in the Poona Cantonment which served food to their European clientele. Royal Family Hotel had opened in 1861 and could accommodate five families and 14 single guests. It charged ₹120 per month for lodging and boarding. Then there was Poona Hotel which was started in 1873 and was owned by M/s Sohrabji Jehangirji & Sons. Napier Hotel was situated on Arsenal road and was the grandest of them all. It was established by Nusserwanji Nowrosji who had also established the first ice factory in Pune. Sixty guests could stay at the Napier Hotel at a time.But these “hotels” in the Cantonment area served food only to the European guests who were staying on the premises. They did not have restaurants where anybody could walk in and order food at any time of the day. There were four tea-shops nearby (one of them being Ms. Dorabjee) that served only tea and biscuits then. They did not serve food.There were a few restaurants in Bombay, like the famous Jerusalem Refreshment House and The Paradise Refreshment House that had opened in the early 1870s, and had a fixed menu for their (strictly) European patrons. In that sense, “Pune Bhojanagruha” was indeed the first restaurant in Maharashtra where natives could walk in, with or without a monthly membership, and have their meals any time of the day. Economic reports on various towns and cities published between the 1860s and 1900s also support Chiplunkar’s claim.Even though it is quite fascinating that an immensely popular leader and author like Vishnushastri Chiplunkar (he was called “Lokmanya”, his essays were being read all over Maharashtra and he had established a school and two newspapers, along with a book shop and a printing press) would endorse a restaurant in his newspaper, the editorial in itself does not help much in understanding more about the “Bhojanagruha”. Probably because he did not want the editorial to look like an advertisement, Chiplunkar did not mention the name of the proprietor of the newly opened “Pune Bhojanagruha”. Nor did he mention the menu, or the address of the restaurant.To find out more about the “Bhojanagruha”, one has to dig deep into the archives of the newspaper. On May 31, 1881, six months before it opened, “Kesari” reported that M/s Narayan Ramchandra & Co. was planning to start a restaurant that would benefit Brahmin students and people visiting the city. It further reported that “the rates would be moderate and monthly memberships would cost Rs5 / Rs6 / Rs7”. This report did not mention the address of the “Bhojanagruha”.This detail could be found in an advertisement which appeared on June 14, 1881, on page 6 of “Kesari”. The title of this ad made it clear that the “Bhojanagruha” was meant only for Brahmins, and that its target patronage was that of students, travellers, and workers. “We have started a Bhojanagruha from June 1, 1881, in a wada owned by Tukaram Kisandas Patwekari, in front of the Dhamdhere wada. We are aware of the hardships faced by the members of the working class who have to take their meals in a khanaval. We assure you that we would strive hard to satisfy you. Wise residents know how important this Bhojanagruha is for this city, and it would not succeed without the patronage of all the Brahmins. All your queries would be answered by the Manager of the Bhojanagruha when you visit.” – the ad read. It was signed by M/s Narayan Ramchandra & Co.“Kesari” was a weekly in those days and was published every Tuesday. This ad appeared on all Tuesdays till the end of August 1881. It is interesting to note that the content, style and language of these ads were very similar to the editorial which appeared six months later. These ads also tell us that “Pune Bhojanagruha” was situated at a prime location in the city. It was right next to the Budhwar chowk, which was a commercial hub in those days.A couple of months after the ads stopped and before the editorial appeared, a reader with the pseudonym “Shodhak” complained to “Kesari” that he found that “there was severe mismanagement at the eatery”. On November 15, 1881, the editor of “Kesari”, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, replied that he himself had visited the “Bhojanagruha” and found that “there was no mismanagement at all”.Perhaps the letter written by “Shodhak” and the suspicion in the minds of people about an altogether new institution might have compelled Chiplunkar to write the editorial. He passed away three months later. This was the last editorial he wrote.After his demise, “Pune Bhojanagruha” changed its location twice, and Gopal Ganesh Agarkar took it upon himself to make the people of Maharashtra understand the importance of restaurants.More about this and the owner of “Pune Bhojanagruha”, Mr Narayan Ramchandra, next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taste-of-life-pune-bhojanagruha-is-state-s-first-native-restraurant-101626357427524.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: Ex-armyman shot dead in Dera Baba Nanak||A former armyman with criminal background was shot dead by two bike-borne men outside his house at the border town of Dera Baba Nanak, 18 kilometres from Batala in Punjab’s Gurdaspur district, police said on Thursday.Though a gangster claimed responsibility for the murder in a Facebook post, police have booked two other men named by the victim’s brother.Karamjit Singh, aka Sabi Fauji, 40, was walking outside his house after dinner around 9.45pm on Wednesday when the assailants opened fire at him. “When we heard the gunshots, we rushed outside, but the killers had fled by then,” said Karamjit’s brother Gagan Ajit Singh.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Kamalpreet Singh said Karamjit received two bullets injuries — one in the head and the other in his back. “He was rushed to a nearby hospital, from where he was referred to a private hospital in Amritsar, but he succumbed to his injuries on the way.Two booked; gangster claims responsibility tooIn his complaint, Gagan named two men — Mandeep Singh and Jagdeep Singh of Batala — with whom the family has an old financial dispute. On its basis, an FIR was registered under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code besides under the Arms Act against the duo.However, Amarjot Bal, an absconding gangster, claimed responsibility for the attack in a post on Facebook on Thursday.According to the DSP, Karamjit was booked in six criminal cases and had an altercation with other inmates in the jail in 2018.Bal’s post, written in Punjabi, claims that he was one of the persons beaten up by Karamjit in the jail and “yesterday night, I took revenge”. “The next turn is of the man who was with him... Police are requested not to harass anyone illegitimately,” the post reads further.According to sources, Karamjit once also had links with gangster Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, who is at present lodged in the Patiala jail. The DSP said police are investigating the matter keeping Bal’s Facebook post in mind, but refused to comment on the victim’s alleged links with Bhagwanpuria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ex-armyman-shot-dead-in-dera-baba-nanak-101626357068487.html
15-07-2021||Other||‘JMB leader running business in India; Bengal linkman married Dhaka woman’: STF||Dreaded Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) leader Ansar Ali Hriday, who was jailed in Bangladesh two years ago for committing robberies to raise funds for terrorist activities, was siphoning part of the money to India to run his private business, officers of the special task force (STF) of the Kolkata Police have learnt from the three alleged JMB sleeper cell members and Ali’s Indian linkman who were arrested between Sunday and Wednesday. Ansar Ali’s present whereabouts are unknown to security agencies. “Interrogation of the suspects has exposed a well-organised cell. The JMB refers to these cells as markaz, which, in Arabic, means centre. The investigation has revealed that Ali had sent money to India through hawala operators apparently keeping other JMB leaders in the dark. This money was invested in several businesses that have Indian partners. Ali also runs a human trafficking racket that has sent Bangladeshi men to several European countries,” an STF officer said on condition of anonymity. The STF on Sunday arrested three JMB members, Naziur Rahman Pavel, 30, Mekail Khan, 30, and Rabiul Islam, 22. The three Bangladeshi nationals were living in a rented room at Haridevpur in the southern outskirts of Kolkata. They illegally entered India over the last few years. Naziur Rahman was the local leader of the group. On Wednesday, an Indian national, Lalu Sen alias Rahul Sen, 38, was arrested from his residence at Barasat in North 24 Parganas district, said V Solomon Nesakumar, joint commissioner of police (STF). “Two Laptops, an iPad, two mobile phones and some incriminating documents were seized from Sen’s possession. He is a close associate of Naziur Rehman and provided logistic and financial support to JMB activists,” added the joint commissioner. “It is suspected that Sen prepared fake Indian documents such as voter card, PAN card, Aadhar card and other testimonials for the JMB members. A probe is on,” Nesakumar said. “Investigation has revealed that when Ansar Ali Hriday, was in jail, Sen used to visit him. During his trips to Dhaka, Sen got involved in the human trafficking racket. During this period he had an affair with a Bangladeshi national’s wife. The man lodged a police complaint and Sen was arrested and sent to judicial custody. He said during interrogation that he later married the woman,” an STF officer said on condition of anonymity. “Ansar Ali was helped by Sen to send money to India through hawala operators. They became associates. Ali secretly visited India once and stayed at Sen’s residence in Barasat. His present location is unknown to us,” the officer added. The investigation has also revealed that Naziur Rahman Pavel and JMB leader Al Amin, who is now in jail in Dhaka, are married to sisters from the same family that lives in the Gopalgunj area of Bangladesh. “To avoid detection, Pavel used the Hindu name Jayram Bepari. He and Mekail Khan alias Sheikh Sabbir befriended two Hindu women in the Haridevpur area and had plans to get married next month. This would have helped them recruit more people without arousing suspicion. We have kept the identity of these women secret to protect their families,” said a second STF officer who did not want to be named. “The main job of this markaz was to raise funds and recruit people. Ever since the JMB got divided into two groups in Bangladesh, the faction headed by Al Amin is facing a cash crunch. To instil fear and respect among sympathisers of fundamentalist activities, Al Amin told people that he works for the Al Qaeda. Sometimes he also used the name of Harkat-ul-Jihad-al Islami or Huji. His associate Ansar Ali took to robbery and carried out around a dozen operations,” the STF officer added. The STF is hunting for another operative, Salim Munshi, who allegedly ferried cash and fake identity cards from one unit to another. The investigators have learnt that Munshi is not a JMB member but works for the outfit for money. “During interrogation, Naziur Rahman said he rarely left the room rented in Haridevpur. Mikail Khan used to spread JMB’s propaganda messages on social media while Rabiul Islam, the youngest in the group, used to communicate with their leaders using a VPN (virtual private network),” said an STF officer. The trio posed as traders and sold fruits and mosquito nets. The arrests come months after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested several men from Bengal’s Murshidabad district for alleged links with the Al Qaeda. In September last year, the NIA arrested 10 people from West Bengal and Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jmb-leader-running-business-in-india-bengal-linkman-married-dhaka-woman-stf-101626356289349.html

In this, the union government’s share will be ₹5,357 crore. This includes ₹50 crore for the Gram Nyayalaya scheme. Elaborating on the benefits of extension of this scheme for judiciary, Pathak stated it would help in construction of 3,800 court rooms for judicial officers and subordinate courts. In addition to this, 4,000 residential units, 1,450 lawyers’ rooms, 1,450 toilet complexes, and 3,800 digital computer rooms will come up across the state in courts with the help of this scheme. Funds will be released to the states only when the notified Gram Nyayalayas start functioning with the appointment of judicial officers. Till February 2020, the state government had constituted Gram Nyayalayas in nine tehsils. These have been constituted in tehsils Sikandra (Ballia), Fatehpur (Barabanki), Meerganj (Bareli), Bhanpur (Basti), Amratpur (Farrukhabad), Badlapur (Jaunpur), Puranpur (Pilibhit), Bangarmau (Unnao) and Jalalpur (Ambedkar Nagar). The government approved 72 vacancies in these Gram Nyayalayas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/extension-of-schemes-will-help-improve-infra-in-judiciary-pathak-101626352927198.html

Describing the efforts of the government in combating Covid-19 as “commendable”, the prime minister said Uttar Pradesh’s population was more than that of a dozen big countries but the way “it has controlled the second wave of coronavirus and stopped its spread is unprecedented”.The prime minister, who arrived at his parliamentary constituency in the morning, also appreciated the Yogi Adityanath-led government for working with a development-oriented approach and bringing in rule of law in the state.He also said Uttar Pradesh was emerging as the leading investment destination of the country due to the environment created by the UP government led by chief minister Yogi Adityanath.The prime minister was addressing a public gathering at IIT-BHU ground in Varanasi after inaugurating and laying the foundation stones of multiple development projects worth ₹1,583 crore.He also inaugurated the Varanasi International Cooperation and Convention Centre-Rudraksh, constructed with Japanese assistance.Earlier, even minor problems assumed monstrous proportions due to the shortage of health facilities and the lack of willpower, he said.The people of Uttar Pradesh, the prime minister said, had seen an era when there were problems in tackling diseases such as encephalitis. “And this (Covid) is the biggest problem the world is facing in 100 years. It is the biggest pandemic, hence efforts made by Uttar Pradesh to tackle the corona are commendable.” Modi, who is on a one-day visit to the city, said the last few months had been very difficult for humanity.“But Kashi, along with UP, faced such a big problem with full strength. Even during difficult times, Kashi has shown it does not stop, nor does it get tired.”“I am especially grateful to corona warriors and people of Kashi for dealing with the corona crisis with courage and patience. The way you mobilized day and night to create arrangements in Kashi, it is a great service,” PM said.He recalled the “difficult” last few months when the “mutated coronavirus attacked with full force.”“Today, UP is the state with the highest number of tests and vaccinations,” he said.According to the CoWin digital platform, Uttar Pradesh has administered over 3.93 crore (39.3 million) doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The figure includes over 3.30 crore first and over 62 lakh second jabs.He appealed to the people, “You have the responsibility of not allowing corona to gain strength once again.”He cautioned people that despite slowing down (of the virus), any carelessness can invite a massive wave. He called upon everyone to strictly follow the protocol and get vaccinated under ‘vaccine for all-free for all’ campaign.Stressing that Kashi is emerging as a major medical hub for “Purvanchal” (eastern region), he said medical treatment for which people had to go to Delhi and Mumbai earlier are now available here.Even today, 14 oxygen plants, which have been installed at various hospitals, were inaugurated, he said. The infrastructure being developed to fight the coronavirus will also be useful in future, he added.The state government also came in for praise for the law and order situation.“There is rule of law in UP today. Mafiaraj and terrorism, which were once out of control, are now controlled by law. Criminals who dare to eye sisters and daughters know they will not be spared,” Modi said.“The way parents always lived in fear and (there were) apprehensions regarding the safety of sisters and daughters, that situation has also changed,” PM said.“Today, the government in UP is run by development, not on corruption and nepotism. That is why the people in UP are getting the benefits of the schemes directly and new industries are being set up in UP, employment opportunities are increasing,” he added. “UP, which was considered difficult to do business in a few years ago, is becoming a favourite place for Make in India today. UP is now emerging as a leading investment destination of the country,” PM said, adding that it happened because of the environment created by “UP government led by Yogi Ji”.Even before 2017, so many schemes were sent to UP from Delhi, he said, adding that they used to get blocked in Lucknow. After 2017, the scenario and the environment changed in the state as the people “gave their blessings to us to serve them”, he said.“CM Yogi himself is working hard today. He visits every district, reviews schemes and monitors them due to which schemes caught pace in the state,” PM said.He reiterated that the cleanliness of the River Ganga and beautification of Kashi were the top priorities for his government.He mentioned the Purvanchal Expressway, defence corridor, Bundelkhand Expressway and road constructions in UP.Speaking on development works in Kashi in the past seven years, he said it was marching ahead on the development path while maintaining its original identity.He also mentioned various developmental projects, including cruise service, regional ophthalmology centre, skill development centre, some of which were inaugurated in Varanasi on Thursday. He said that he had been discussing so many works for the development of Varanasi and the entire UP for so long, but this list was so long that it would not end so soon.The broadcast of the aarti at the Ganga ghat and at Kashi Vishwanath temple will be possible in the entire city through big screens, said the PM.Large LED screens being installed all over the city and technology-equipped information boards on the ghats will be of great help to the visitors to Kashi.Mentioning the recent Union government’s decision of setting up a special fund of ₹1 lakh crore for improving agriculture infrastructure, he said it will prove to be a step towards making the mandi system modern and well equipped.”Improving the system connected with government procurement and providing many more opportunities to farmers is a priority of the government and the record purchase of wheat and rice this year are its results,” he said.These facilities, which present the history, architecture, crafts and art of Kashi in an attractive way, will be of great use to the devotees, he added. He said that all possible efforts are being made for the all-round development of the city.Earlier, starting his speech in the local dialect, PM Modi wished the people of Kashi and said, “After a long gap, I have got a chance to meet you directly. Pranam to all the people of Kashi and I bow my head to the feet of Baba Kashi Vishwanath and Maa Annapurna.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uttar-pradesh-s-tackling-of-second-covid-wave-unprecedented-pm-modi-101626352627800.html

The pachyderm’s 8-month-old calf has also been taken into custody. According to the police, the elephant named Dulumoni, which is owned by former Bokakhat MLA Jiten Gogoi, had killed the child on July 8 at Bijuli near Naharjan tea estate. Following the death, there was intense pressure by local residents on forest officials to take action. “We lodged a case under Section 304 of Indian Penal Code for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. We seized the elephant and her calf in connection with the case and have handed them over to the forest department for custody,” an official of Bokakhat police station told journalists. Also Read | Kidney selling racket busted in Assam; 3 arrestedA local forest officer stated that the elephant attacked the child after the latter reportedly tried to hug its calf. The incident was reportedly the third time the pachyderm had attacked humans. “The forest department is not involved in investigation of the case. Since the police had no means of keeping the elephant and its calf, they placed them under our custody,” said Ramesh Gogoi, divisional forest officer, Kaziranga. Director of Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR), P Sivakumar, said that though it was rare, domestic animals can be seized by police or forest department as part of collecting evidence during investigation of a case. In 2013, a male domestic elephant called Thechikottukavu Ramachandran was arrested by the forest department in Kerala after it killed three women during a temple festival at Perumbavoor. The elephant’s owners had to submit a bond of ₹30 lakh to secure its release. In October last year, forest officials in Assam seized a railway locomotive for mowing down a female elephant and her calf. According to information provided by forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya in the state assembly on Wednesday, 812 people have died due to human-elephant conflict in the past 10 years in Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-police-seize-female-elephant-for-killing-14-year-old-boy-101626351847838.html

The Battle of Haldighati was fought on June 18, 1576, between cavalry and archers supporting the Rana of Mewar, Maharana Pratap, and the Mughal emperor Akbhar’s forces. The ASI has directed its state unit to replace the plaques. Public representatives and Rajput organisations have been demanding ASI do so for years. On June 25, Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari had requested the union tourism and cultural minister correct the plaques. Union minister of state for culture Arjun Ram Meghwal has confirmed that orders have been issued to the ASI. “Yes, the order has been issued,” he said, when asked whether the ministry has given orders to remove plaques at Haldighati. Also Read | 11 cases of Covid Kappa variant detected in Rajasthan: Health min Raghu SharmaASI Jodhpur circle superintendent Bipin Chandra Negi said that they have received the communication to remove the plaques.“The plaques are over four decades old and in dilapidated condition. These plaques do not belong to the ASI as they were put up by state’s tourism department. In 2003, this site was declared a Centrally protected monument of national importance,” said Negi. The plaques should have an ASI notification number, a declaration stating it a monument of national importance and logo. The purpose of fresh plaques is to highlight the importance of the place and vent.Negi said the current plaques have factual inaccuracies such as wrong date of battle. The ASI will verify and put the right information. He said the new plaques will be put up following tendering process, which will take around 20-25 days.The battle was fought between Pratap and Akbar in 1576. NCERT books mention the date of the battle of Haldighati as June 18, 1576, while the date mentioned on the plaques is June 21, 1576. Member of Parliament from Rajsamand, Diya Kumari said, “I had urged the union art, culture and tourism minister to understand the sentiments, as the information mentioned on plaque are factually incorrect, including the dates. I am happy that the plaques are being removed today and correct information will be provided to people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/asi-to-remove-haldighati-plaques-proclaiming-retreat-of-maharana-pratap-in-rajasthan-101626350287783.html

15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Mirrors don’t lie, we get best results when we smile||“Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?” Unlike Snow White’s stepmother, I’ve never dared to ask any mirror that. I don’t have the gumption or the narcissistic streak that needs gratification. My use of the mirror is need-based. I spent the teens fighting a battle with the bulge. As I stepped into the volatile, wacky, egotistical and impractical stage of growing up, I had already grown to substantial proportions. I now realise that the mirror had a significant role to play. My childhood memories are of a vibrant, joyful home well-equipped with mirrors. Each room had one on the wall, another on the inside of the cupboard and my room had an ornate framed one. Even the utility room had one for convenience. Though my image has never been flattering, I still nurture a strong affinity to mirrors. I guess happiness like a mist will touch all aspects of that time and place. While leaving school, we all got our teachers and friends to sign in our autograph book. These are priceless treasures I love to go through. Our math teacher would write the words of wisdom in mirror image. One had to hold it up before a mirror to read the sentence. I find the idea of this out-of-the-box skill intriguing and the reason for doing so even more fascinating. About three decades ago, we visited a friend in Mumbai. The guest room was big and spacious with a view of the ocean. As though that was not enough, half a wall was fitted with a huge mirror, adding to the space and elegance of the room. Welcome to the infinite world of interior design. Recently, when we moved into our new house, the role of Vastu Shastra in mirror placement added another dimension to this item of our daily life. Vastu experts say that mirrors, if placed in the right direction, can double prosperity and health, while sucking up the negative energy lurking around. They balance the power and the intensity, the negative with the positive. I received a picture of a college friend whom I had not been in touch with since a long time. I complimented her because she looked just as I remembered her. To my praise, she replied, “Thanks, but mirrors don’t lie.” Reality check, yet another purpose. Like American pastor and author Joel Osteen said: Cars have a big windshield on the front and a small rear-view mirror, the reason the windshield is so large and the rear-view so small is because what happened in your past is not near as important as what is in your future. Of the numerous uses of this necessity, everyone gets to choose the reason for it, and whatever that might be, we will find this item in every household. Life, as they say, is like a mirror, we get the best results when we smile. promildada@yahoo.com The writer is a Ludhiana-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mirrors-don-t-lie-we-get-best-results-when-we-smile-101626347947505.html

Farmer leaders from Punjab were planning to start a sit-in at Shambhu border on November 25 and later Charuni insisted that they should break the barricades and try to reach Delhi. Even, he assured them that farmers from Haryana will clear the barricades to make a way for them and his supporters removed most of the barricades from Shambhu border to Kundli border in Sonepat district. Charuni was also against the decision of Morcha leaders over holding Kisan Panchayats in Haryana and Punjab as he was in favour of taking the protest to other states. In January Charuni was snubbed by Morcha members for meeting political leaders and the move was strongly condemned by Morcha members and he assured that he would not share the platform with any political party till the farmers’ agitation was on. Charuni also slammed his counterpart from UP Rakesh Tikait on several occasions. Recently, Charuni without naming anybody, also raised questions about why the farmers were not holding protests against BJP leaders in BJP ruled Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.What nextThe development has exposed the fissures within Morcha members and Charuni has himself slammed the decision of his suspension but made it clear that he will continue his support to the agitation.People close to him said that he was still at the Singhu border and his supporters were planning to lead a convoy of thousands of farmers from Yamunanagar district on July 20 to Singh border. “The decision will not affect our association with the agitation and we will continue our fight for the rights of farmers as it is,” said BKU (Charuni) spokesperson Rakesh Bains. Dr Ramji Lal, principal of political science and retired principal of Dyal Singh College Karnal said, “This decision may have an impact on the agitation as it could demoralize supporters from Haryana. But Charuni’s call for a political foray could go either way as he had already contested polls unsuccessfully”.Who is CharuniA resident of Kurukshetra’s Charuni village, Gurnam Singh Charuni led hundreds of farmers’ protests over several issues in the past more than 30 years even during the regimes of Bhajan Lal, OP Chautala and Bhupinder Singh Hooda. He organised one of the first farmers’ meetings in September in Haryana’s Pipli (Kurukshetra) to protest against the three laws. Having huge support in northern districts, now Charuni has spread his union in several parts of Haryana even though it got good support in the Jat heartland Hisar, Sirsa, Rohtak, Jind and Sonepat districts.In 2014, he joined the Aam Aadmi Party and his wife Balwinder Kaur contested the Lok Sabha elections on AAP ticket from Kurukshetra unsuccessfully. In the 2019 state assembly elections, he contested from the Ladwa Assembly seat independently but lost his security deposits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bku-leader-charuni-s-suspension-comes-as-setback-to-followers-101626345789395.html

She was found lying in a pool of blood in her house. The deceased woman married her neighbour, who was already married and had a 17-year-old son (the accused), after her husband died of cancer two years ago. The woman had a 15-year-old from her first marriage who moved the complaint regarding her mother’s murder by his stepbrother. Some 8 months ago, both the families moved to Pune for business. The families have a shop and sell food grains by the roadside to make ends meet.“While the now-deceased woman was at her house, her son had gone to the stepfather’s house for dinner as they had cooked meat. The couple got into a fight about how the man spends more time with the second wife than his own family,” said Senior police inspector Bhaskar Jadhav of Talegaon Dabhade police station.The 17-year-old got involved in the fight and walked out of the house. He later made a phone call to his wife and called her out as well, according to the complainant. The accused went to the woman’s house and used a sharp weapon to make several gashes on her neck, hands, back, and head, according to the police.“His wife also sustained injuries on her hand but we suspect she was trying to stop him and got injured in the process. When they walked out nobody suspected the murder. Even the deceased woman was unaware and let them in, as they always visited each other’s homes,” said Senior PI Jadhav.While the teenager is being produced in the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), his wife was treated for the cut wounds and taken back home by her in-laws. The apprehended boy is married and lives with his wife and parents, according to the police. His wife and he went to school together and are of the same age. They got married in February 2021 at their native place.A case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 4(25) of Arms Act and Section 37(1)(3) with135 of Maharashtra Police Act was registered at Talegaon Dabhade police station against the minor accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/17yearold-apprehended-for-stepmother-s-murder-in-pune-101626342007145.html

The woman, Lilimai Bodo, was arrested after she went looking for “donors”. Police said the gang would allegedly offer around ₹5 lakhs for a kidney. Police said around a dozen people from the state’s Morigaon district allegedly sold their kidneys to the gang, which would get the organs removed in Kolkata. They added Bodo’s son and another person have also been arrested and a search was on for more accused. “Till now, we have arrested three persons. In their statements, the accused have revealed the names of few more persons involved in the racket. Efforts are underway to trace and arrest them,” said Morigaon district police superintendent Aparna N on Thursday.Also Read | Assam Cabinet allows online sale of liquor in Guwahati on trial basisPolice cited their probe and said most of the victims were lured since the pandemic struck last year as many of them were unable to repay bank loans or were left jobless. They added the racket was active for four to five years.Srikanta Das, one of the persons who sold his kidney, said he was in desperate need of money to get his son, who has a hole in his heart, treated. “As I had no work since last year due to (Covid-19) lockdown, selling a kidney seemed to be the only option. I was promised ₹5 lakh, but given only a fraction of that amount,” Das told local journalists this week.Krishna Das, another person who sold her kidney, said she was forced to do so as she failed to repay a loan taken from a micro-finance company. She, too, was promised ₹5 lakh but received ₹3.5 lakh.Reports said nearly 30 people have “donated” their kidneys but only a handful have approached the police.Aparna N said since the matter came to light, they have been trying to gather details of all persons who may have been duped. “Till date, we have found 11 persons. All of them are from two villages in Morigaon district.”Local media reports suggested the racket could be linked to several such cases in other districts of the state. Police said those arrested in Morigaon do not seem to have been operating elsewhere.Buying and selling of human organs are prohibited under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act. Organs can be donated to close relatives, others in need of transplantation for medical reasons after proper authorisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kidney-selling-racket-busted-in-assam-3-arrested-101626338646956.html

They want the administration to reconsider the decision.Last year, Jammu and Kashmir Service Selection Board (JKSSB) announced vacancies for 8,575 Class IV posts in various departments of the Union Territory. The minimum qualification for the posts was set as matric while the maximum was set as Class 12, though aspirants with higher qualifications were also allowed to appear in the entrance tests.Now the agency has called 9,652 shortlisted aspirants for document verification; however, it has sought an affidavit from the candidates stating that they don’t have a qualification higher than Class 12 as of August 2020 and if JKSSB comes to know that the candidate possesses a qualification above that, his/her services will be terminated ab-initio.Also Read | Army sets up school with modern facilities in J&K’s Poonch“It is unconstitutional, unethical, illogical and inhuman. These rules are so injustice driven. They declare fresh graduates eligible and highly qualified candidates who have struggled for years and are also at the verge of becoming overage ineligible,” said Aijaz Ahmad Bhat, an MBA.He said he was desperate for the job as he has a family to look after. “I will choose a Class IV job any day over depression and being idle at home. Some candidates have secured less percentage in their graduation, which makes them ineligible to apply for any graduate level post. Where will they go?” he said.Nasreena Fayaz, 37, said she was a postgraduate in psychology and had an M.Ed degree from Kashmir University. “I am a single parent and have to look after my son. I applied for a JKSSB jobs many times but unfortunately was not successful before. This is the first time my name appeared in any selection list. I want to do this job as I am on the verge of becoming overage for any government job,” she said.Shahid Akbar Wani, who said he has done MA, MEd and MPhil, said that he wanted to become a teacher but there had been a freeze on the posts from 2018.“In such circumstances, I have no other option but to go for a Class IV job. If the administration wants me to burn down all my higher degrees to get this job, I am ready, because I have a huge responsibility to take care of my aged parents, two siblings, wife and a daughter,” he said.Ashiq Hussain Lily, JKSSB’s member controller of examinations, said that they are following the policy of the government.“Whatever general administration department has decided we are following that,” he said.Another official of the SSB, on condition of anonymity, said that these posts were for lower qualified aspirants who are not eligible for higher posts.“Of the 50,000 posts which have to be filled, 8,575 have been kept for lower qualified youth while the rest are for those with higher qualifications,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-qualified-aspirants-irate-after-being-barred-from-class-iv-jobs-101626336546691.html

15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Scientists introduce China’s monkfruit in Himachal||In a first, scientists of CSIR’s Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), Palampur, have introduced the cultivation of monkfruit in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. IHBT director Sanjay Kumar said monkfruit cultivation was initiated on a trial basis by planting 50 seedlings in farmer Manav Khullar’s fields at Raison in Naggar tehsil of Kullu on Monday. If successful, the fruit will be grown commercially. Also read: Covid positivity rate in Himachal drops to 1%Monkfruit (Siraitia grosvenorii) was originally grown only in China and known as luohan guo. It’s a small, green melon named after the monks who cultivated it. The fruit is known the world over for its sweetness and is used as a non-caloric natural sweetener. Despite its demand, this crop was only cultivated in China till recently. “Suitable agro-climatic conditions are also available in India, particularly in Himachal Pradesh. Keeping in mind the importance and essentiality of non-nutritive natural sweeteners, we have introduced monkfruit in Kullu,” Kumar said. ICAR brought fruit seeds from China in 2018 He said the monkfruit seeds were brought to India from China through Indian Council of Agricultural Research’s National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi, in March 2018. Principal scientist Probir Kumar Pal and his team developed the technology for generating quality planting material, its basic agronomic cultivation practices, fruiting technique and post-harvest management. At present, monkfruit is being cultivated at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-run IHBT with good quality fruits under farm conditions. “The plant grows well in mountainous areas with an annual mean temperature of 16 to 20°C and humid conditions. Himachal Pradesh is a suitable for its large-scale cultivation,” said Kumar. He said initially the project was funded by CSIR and now its cultivation is being promoted with financial support from the Himachal Pradesh Council for Science, Technology and Environment, Shimla. Pal said the plant starts bearing fruit in eight months if the atmosphere is conducive. Experiments have shown that the average life of the plant is four to five years. The fruit weighs 60-65g and in some cases 100g. The average yield is 1kg from each plant. Healthy alternative for sugar Kumar said the intake of added cane sugar can lead to lifestyle diseases such as insulin resistance, Type-2 diabetes, liver problems, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease. Monkfruit offers a healthy alternative. Since India is home to 6.24 crore people with Type-2 diabetes, this is a wonder fruit for them, said the director. He said the IHBT has signed a material transfer agreement with Khullar and provided 50 plants of monkfruit for field trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/scientists-introduce-china-s-monkfruit-in-himachal-101626331206904.html

And yet, it is so much part of the daytime landscape that not finding Mr Khan would be like living in a world suddenly bereft of a beloved friend.“I stayed at home during the lockdown… I survived by borrowing money from friends,” he says, insisting he has no complaint to make about his situation. “Everyone is suffering with their businesses these days.”Mr Khan’s juice kiosk exists only for the summer. As soon as the winter ends, he is done selling diapers and turns his street establishment back into what his late father founded decades ago—a sherbet stall.There’s only bel, or wood apple, sherbet here. Watching the man is as calming as dunking down his drink. He sits as motionless as a statue, which makes him look like a hallucination—for the rest of the street is a maddening blur of pedestrians and rickshaws.The stall consists of a table with a large pan filled with sherbet. “My papa, Hakeemuddin, started it decades ago... he would sit on this same spot.”The sherbet is kept cold with slabs of ice that stand like icebergs in the sea. In the evening, the market lights shine out of the still surface of the sherbet. Inevitably, the sherbet seller stirs the liquid at some point, instantly destroying the world that was existing in it.This humid afternoon, masked shoppers are stopping by the stall, clamouring for a cool glass of the drink. Life appears to carry on as if the pandemic-related tragedies were but a blip in the sherbet stall’s history.It used to stay open until beyond midnight, but now, in obedience of the new regulations, shuts down at 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-sherbet-stall-s-history-101626301554674.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||In the city of cars, auto thieves make a killing||On May 28 last year, when the first Covid-19 lockdown was still in force, a Toyota Fortuner SUV belonging to the father of former Indian cricketer and BJP’s east Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir was stolen from outside their Old Rajendra Nagar house in central Delhi. A CCTV camera in which the crime was captured showed the thieves took nearly two minutes to dismantle the Fortuner’s security gadgets, start the vehicle, and flee in it. More than 10 months after, the stolen car is yet to be recovered.“Police filed an untraced report, saying they could not find the vehicle. The insurance company compensated the loss. There has been absolutely no progress in the case,” said Gambhir’s media manager Animesh Choudhary.Delhi tops the list when it comes to cases of vehicle theft reported in all of India’s 28 states and eight Union territories (UTs). A vehicle is stolen every 12 minutes in the national capital; in Mumbai, one is stolen every four hours , and in Bengaluru every two hours, according to 2019 data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).Cars and two-wheelers are the most common items stolen across the city after mobile phones (at least 175 mobile phones were stolen every day in Delhi between January and February 2017, the Union government had told the Lok Sabha that year).Delhi Police data shows that, in the last 10 years (between 2011 and 2020), a total of 307,000 vehicles were stolen in the Capital. This number is more than the number of registered vehicles in all of Srinagar on March 31, 2017 (according to a report mentioned in the road transport year book 2016-17 of the ministry of road transport and highways).According to the Delhi Economic Survey report, there were 11.8 million motorised vehicles in Delhi as of March 31, 2020. Cars and jeeps make around 28% of the total registered vehicles, and two-wheelers about 67%.Delhi Police officers say that vehicle thefts constitute about 14% of all the crimes in the city. Even during the first hard lockdown, which restricted the movement of people, about 83 vehicles (more than three an hour) were stolen every day in Delhi between March 15 and 30, 2020.“The lockdown not only restricted the movement of people but also increased the presence of security personnel on streets and borders. But that made little difference to auto lifters as they still managed to steal 1,243 vehicles in just 15 days,” said a police officer who asked not to be named.Between January 1 and June 15 last year, 13,130 vehicles were stolen in the city. This number rose to 15,667 during the corresponding period this year.Experts say that stealing a vehicle is a less risky crime for thieves because it is often carried out either late at night or in secluded areas where human intervention or physical contact with the owners is minimal. At the same time, it is highly profitable as compared to thefts of cellphones or wallets.Of the 35,019 vehicle theft cases in 2020 only just 4,183 (11.94%) stolen vehicles were recovered. Among them, 72% were two-wheelers, 21% were cars, and the others were commercial vehicles.“Unlike other traditional crimes such as snatching and robbery, vehicle thefts aren’t the matter of attention during crime review meetings as they should be. The e-FIR facility (launched in 2015) has helped complainants register FIRs, and within 21 days get the “untraced” reports of their stolen vehicles needed for insurance claims. It has, however, given a free run to auto lifters, who know that vehicle thefts aren’t an area of attention for the police because they are largely non-violent. Earlier, complainants used to pester police officers -- but with the e-FIR facility, complainants hardly mount pressure because the report is generated automatically,” said Delhi Police’s retired assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Rajender Singh, who was instrumental in catching Delhi-NCR’s notorious burglar and auto thief, Bunty.Retired IPS officer Prakash Singh, who headed the Uttar Pradesh Police between 1991 and 1993, also believes that by giving less attention to vehicle theft cases, police are encouraging criminals to commit such crimes without the fear of law.“Delhi Police personnel may be overburdened, but they cannot simply overlook the high number of vehicle theft cases reported every day. If this lack of concern continues, more and more criminals will join this crime and it will be the vehicle owners who will ultimately suffer. The police should work on curbing this menace and encourage vehicle owners to install gadgets that can secure their vehicles,” said the former IPS office.Experts also say that Delhi’s geography, and the sheer number of vehicles here, make the crime extremely hard to crack down on. Delhi shares over 100 porous border points with Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan in an amorphous National Capital Region that make it easy to take stolen vehicles across state lines .Organised networkUnlike the other street crimes, such as snatching and robbery, which only need collaboration between criminals and receivers, there is an organised network of vehicle thieves with multiple channels spread across various states for stealing vehicles in Delhi, and selling them in places as far as the North-East, and sometimes even smuggle them into Nepal. Earlier this month, the central district police arrested two auto lifters from Kashmir who would come to Delhi to steal cars, and sell them to buyers in the Valley. Since 2015, their tally was over a 100 stolen vehicles.A serving Delhi Police officer, who asked not to be named, said that gangs involved in vehicle thefts are of two types -- locals, and those from other states. The local gangs primarily steal engine control modules (ECM), batteries, and tyres of parked cars, and some steal vehicles to dismantle them and sell them for parts. The gangs from outside the city are part of a larger machine -- they steal makes and models of vehicles as demanded by their receivers, who even ask them to look for a particular colour, he said.“They also use a code word for each member of the gang. “Surveyors” look for vehicles in demand and conduct reconnaissance of the area where they are parked. “Mechanics” dismantle the security gadgets of the vehicle, steal it, and park it a few kilometers away. The other members of the gang then collect the stolen vehicles, drive them out of the city, and hand them over to the receivers, who sell them to potential clients after preparing fake documents,” the officer said.Another police officer said that while cars or their parts are mostly stolen for sale, motorbikes and scooters are also stolen in Delhi by criminals involved in street crimes such as snatching and robbery.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said several interstate gangs operate in Delhi to steal vehicles, and there are several challenges in preventing thefts and recovering vehicles.“Firstly, we get very less time to react. The vehicles are mostly stolen during night and the crimes are reported to the police in the morning after the owners find their vehicles missing. By that time, the stolen vehicles pass through various channels and reach other states. As the registration number plates are replaced with fake ones, the vehicles easily cross the borders. Even if we follow the trail, the chances of recovering the stolen vehicles are less because many of them are dismantled quickly at scrap markets,” he said.Refuting the contention that vehicle thefts are not an area of concern for the city police, Biswal said that every police district in Delhi has a dedicated anti auto theft squad (AATS) that works on vehicle theft cases, and on gangs involved in such crimes.“We take several measures to check the rise in vehicle theft. They include analysis of the vehicle theft pattern and modus operandi of the gangs. Identification of affected areas and time zone is done and deployment of police staff is done accordingly. Meetings are also held with resident welfare associations (RWA) for restricting entry-exit points of their colonies during night, deploying security guards and installing CCTV cameras,” Biswal said.Raman Mehta, RWA president of Greater Kailash Part-1 said, “Vehicle theft incidents were quite common in our neighbourhood because of the scarce parking space and multiple entry-exit points. We analysed the problem and held meetings with the local police. We restricted the entry-exit and the results were impressive and there was a drastic decline in vehicle theft cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-the-city-of-cars-auto-thieves-make-a-killing-101626301082869.html

The woman has filed a complaint with the Uttarakhand Police’s cyber cell in state capital Dehradun.Senior superintendent of police, cyber cell and special task force, Ajay Singh said the woman, a resident of Dehradun’s Mothrowala area, told the police that she wanted to give a Golden Retriever puppy to her daughter as her birthday gift.According to her complaint, Singh said, she searched for pet dealers online on June 20 and came across one who offered to sell her one for ₹15,000. Once she agreed, the person sent her an email asking her to deposit ₹5,000 as advance. She was told to pay the remaining amount after delivery.The following day, she received another email from the accused who asked her to deposit ₹1.30 lakh in his bank account as a refundable amount.“She again deposited the amount. Following that, the accused then sent several more emails demanding money on pretext of shipping charges, handling charges and others totalling ₹66.39 lakh. She deposited all of it in the accused’s bank account,” said Singh.It is not clear why she made the payments running into lakhs.But, Singh said, it was only after the accused sent her another email on July 3 telling her that the “puppy has arrived at Jolly Grant airport of Dehradun for delivery” but demanded more money that she decided to file a First Information Report.“In the email, the accused demanded ₹25lakh more as other handling charges…. This time, the woman decided to inform the police and file a complaint. We have registered a case and have started a probe to nab the accused,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/dehradun-cops-look-for-online-fraudster-who-got-woman-to-pay-rs-66-lakh-for-pup-101626299342635.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Phagwara ex-tehsildar’s interim bail plea dismissed in attached property sale case||The district and sessions court in Kapurthala has dismissed the interim bail petition of former Phagwara tehsildar Praveen Kumar Chibber, who is accused in a case of selling properties that were attached in the multi-crore Bhola drug case. On June 30, the police had booked Chibber, who is now posted as Shahkot tehsildar in Jalandhar district, Harmesh Kumar Gaba, an accused in the Bhola drug case, and a patwari for allegedly selling around 14 kanal land attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Phagwara superintendent of police (SP) Sarabjit Singh said Chibber is absconding. The Enforcement Directorate (ED)’s zonal office (Jalandhar) had filed a complaint with the Kapurthala senior superintendent of police (SSP) in October last year against Gaba, brother of Goraya-based businessman Chunni Lal Gabba, who is also facing money laundering charges in the Bhola drug case. The ED said it came to light that Gaba sold properties, including 14 kanal land situated in the Hadiabad area of Phagwara, attached by the adjudicating authority (PMLA). “Despite the issuance of provisional attachment order and eviction notice to sub-registrar, Phagwara, the authorised officer in connivance with Harmesh Gaba, knowingly allowed the sale of properties, which is subject matter in the appellate tribunal and the special PMLA court,” the ED said. The police in their probe found that Harmesh sold the 14 kanal land to eight persons on different dates. According to the Phagwara SDM’s report, negligence was found on part of Chibber and the area Patwari. A case was registered under Section 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian penal Code (IPC) at the Phagwara police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/phagwara-ex-tehsildar-s-interim-bail-plea-dismissed-in-attached-property-sale-case-101626294903738.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Dera chief’s name dropped from sacrilege FIR, says jathedar; SIT rebuts claim||Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Wednesday accused the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege incidents of dropping the name of Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh from an FIR in one of the desecration cases. The SIT, however, denied the charge saying the Sirsa-based sect chief was not named in the case and it did not give a clean chit to anyone. Addressing a press conference in Amritsar, the jathedar of the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhism, said the probe team filed a chargesheet pertaining to FIR number 128 in a Faridkot court a few days ago. “It is surprising that the SIT, which filed a challan regarding the FIR number 128, removed the name of Dera Sacha Sauda chief from the case. It raises suspicion. There is politics at play. We have been saying there should not be politics over this issue,” he claimed. “Why his name (dera chief) was removed quietly? Is it for taking mileage in the 2022 assembly polls?” he asked. He demanded that the dera head be brought to Punjab from a Haryana jail and be questioned about the sacrilege incident. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is serving a 20-year jail term in a Haryana jail for raping two of his women disciples in his ‘ashram’. He was convicted in August 2017 by a special CBI court in Panchkula. The FIR pertains to finding of torn pages of the Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari on October 12, 2015 and it was registered at the Bajakhana police station in Faridkot. ‘Probe in cases moving fast’ SIT head SPS Parmar asserted the investigation in the cases is moving fast in the right direction. He denied giving a clean chit to Gurmeet Ram Rahim or anyone else, rejecting the claims as “malicious social media propaganda”. Parmar said nobody is above the law and if evidence is found against anyone at any point during the ongoing investigations, due action would be initiated against such persons as per the law of the land. Investigations into the three cases pertaining to Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala are still open, Parmar underlined. He said as per challan of FIR number 128, it is clearly mentioned that if and when any evidence comes against anyone in these desecration cases, they shall be brought to book and supplementary challans shall be presented against those who figure at any point during the ongoing investigation. Parmar said the Dera Sacha Sauda head was named as accused in FIR number 63, which pertains to theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from the Burj Jawahar Singh Wala gurdwara. In this case too, the investigation is underway by the same SIT and nobody has been given clean chit, he said. On July 9, the SIT filed its first chargesheet against six dera followers in a case of desecration. The six accused who were arrested were Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny; Shakti Singh; Ranjit Singh, alias Bhola; Baljit Singh; Nishan Singh; and Pardeep Singh. They were arrested in May. In February this year, the CBI on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court had handed over the documents and files related to the 2015 incidents to the Punjab Police SIT. The previous SAD-BJP government had handed over the three cases -- theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of the Guru Granth Sahib from a Burj Jawahar Singh Wala gurdwara; putting up of handwritten sacrilegious posters in Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala; and torn pages of the holy book found at Bargari-- to the CBI. The Punjab government had handed over the probe to an SIT in September 2018 after the state assembly passed a resolution withdrawing consent to the CBI to probe these cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dera-chief-s-name-dropped-from-sacrilege-fir-says-jathedar-sit-rebuts-claim-101626294902478.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Protesting unemployed teachers marching to CM’s residence cane-charged||Unemployed teachers demanding jobs were cane-charged by police when they were holding a protest march to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s residence in Patiala on Wednesday. Over 100 protesters were detained, with over a dozen receiving minor injuries.Earlier, the protesters under the banner of the Unemployed TET-Passed ETT Teachers’ Union marched towards the CM’s residence in support of their demand for jobs. However, they were stopped by the police near YPS Chowk in the city. Union’s state president Deepak Kumar said that the Punjab government promised to hold meetings with them but the officials failed to turn up on the scheduled day. “The police are resorting to lathi-charge every time we try to hold a protest near the CM’s residence. We were holding a peaceful march when the police used force against us. The government has completely ignored our demand for jobs in government schools. Now, the government has scheduled a meeting with us on July 20,” he said. The union is demanding a notification for recruitment for all 12,000 vacant posts of TET-ETT teachers and an increase in the upper age limit to 42.Other teachers’ unions condemned the action against the protesting ETT teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protesting-unemployed-teachers-marching-to-cm-s-residence-canecharged-101626294062801.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Children bound to look after parents, says HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has upheld the cancellation of property transfer from a senior citizen to her son by a single judge bench, observing that the children are expected to look after their elderly parents properly “which is not only a value-based principle but a bounden duty as mandated by law”. The high court bench of justices AG Masih and Ashok Kumar Verma observed that the Parliament enacted the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, to uphold the dignity and respect of a senior citizen in old age. “State had serious concern about the challenge faced by the people in their old age. Apart from physical vulnerabilities, they face emotional and psychological challenges. On account of these frailties, they are totally dependent,” the court added. The case in hand was of a 76-year-old widow whose husband had left one house and one shop in her possession in order to ensure her well-being. As per order, her son started giving her beatings and transferred this property in his name fraudulently in 2015. The widow approached the panchayat for conciliation proceedings two to three times but it did not yield any result. Consequently, she approached the Tohana sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in Fatehabad, who acts as the maintenance tribunal under the 2007 law. She had pleaded for the registry of the house and the shop to be returned to her and for the protection of her life, liberty and dignity. The SDM in 2019 directed the son to transfer the house back in mother’s name and provide ₹2,000 per month as subsistence to her. The transfer deed of 2015 was also ordered to be cancelled. Against this order, the son approached the appellate tribunal, Fatehabad, which reversed the findings but said that widow be paid maintenance and allowed to reside in her house. This order was challenged by the widow before a single judge bench whereby the SDM order was directed to be maintained. Before this bench, the son had challenged order of the single bench. Now, the high court has upheld the order by the SDM. The high court observed that Section 23 (1) of the Act of 2007 explicitly stipulates that in case the children fail to take care of their parents after transfer of their parent’s property in their favour, the said transfer of property shall be deemed to have been made by fraud or coercion or under undue influence and shall at the option of the transferor be declared void by the tribunal. “It is often seen that after receiving the property from their parents, the children abandon them. In such a situation, (2007) law is an enabling lifeline for such old-aged parents and senior citizens who are not looked after by their children and become neglected lots,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/children-bound-to-look-after-parents-says-hc-101626294002140.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Amritsar arms seizure: Cops say consignment flown from Pak via drones||A large cache of arms and ammunition, including 48 foreign-made pistols, recovered from a car at Kathunangal village in Amritsar on June 11 was dropped on the Indian side by Pakistani drones at three locations in Gurdaspur and Tarn Taran districts, the Punjab Police’s state special operation cell (SSOC) has claimed. Nearly 80-kg heroin, which was also part of the consignment, is yet to be recovered, the officials said.The SSOC had intercepted a Hyundai i-20 car at a checkpoint at Kathunangal and recovered two nylon bags containing the pistols and ammunition. Jagjit Singh, alias Jaggu (25) of Purian Kalan village in Gurdaspur was arrested on the spot.The cache included 19 Turkey-made 9mm Zigana pistols, 37 magazines and 45 rounds; nine China-made .30 bore pistols and 22 magazines; 19 Star Mark pistols of .30 bore, 38 magazines and 148 rounds; and an Italian Baretta 9mm pistol and two magazines. Director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta had said Jagjit was directed by Darmanjit Singh, alias Darman Kahlon, a former gangster based in the US, to collect the consignment and wait for further instructions. The weapons were meant for ‘carrying out terror activities’ across the country, he had said.An SSOC official asking not to be named said, “It has emerged that the weapons were dropped by drones at Dera Baba Nanak, Kalanaur (Gurdaspur) and Khemkaran (Tarn Taran). We are working to find where the heroin was further smuggled to. We have also initiated the process to bring Darman back from the US.”He, however, didn’t disclose the exact time of the weapons being dropped on the Indian side.On Tuesday, the SSOC brought an alleged Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) operative Maan Singh Nihang of Samurai village in Gurdaspur on a production warrant from a Ferozepur jail for questioning in connection with the weapon seizure case. Maan was produced in the court of judicial magistrate who sent him to police custody till July 16. Maan’s name emerged in the case during interrogation of the other accused.Maan, who is facing several criminal cases, was one of the prime accused of a alleged terror module that was busted by the counter-intelligence wing in September 2019. With the arrest of the module’s members, the police had recovered five AK-47 rifles, 4 Chinese-made pistols, nine hand grenades, five satellite phones, ₹10 lakh in fake Indian currency. The consignment was also allegedly flown from Pakistan in drones. A drone was also recovered by the police later on.SSOC assistant inspector general (AIG) OS Ghuman said, “Our investigation is still underway and we can’t disclose anything as yet.” Sources said earlier the SSOC had brought five accused from various jails of the state on production warrant in this case. Darman, the alleged kingpin in the case, has been linked to banned organisations like the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) and the Babbar Khalsa International (BKI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amritsar-arms-seizure-cops-say-consignment-flown-from-pak-via-drones-101626293702589.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC asks trial court to adjourn ED case against Hooda||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday directed a Panchkula special court to adjourn the hearing into an Enforcement Directorate (ED) case against the former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda beyond August 18.The matter pertained to the ED probe of alleged money laundering in allotment of a plot to Associated Journal Limited (AJL), publisher of the National Herald newspaper. “The trial court directed to adjourn the case beyond the date fixed in high court,” said Hooda’s counsel, Arshdeep Singh Cheema. A detailed order is awaited.The plea was taken up by the bench of justices Ajay Tewari and Vikas Bahl of the ED case registered on July 15, 2016. It filed prosecution complaint before Panchkula trial court on August 26, 2019, and trial court took note of it on September 26, 2019 and summoned Hooda as accused. On Thursday, the trial court was to consider the issue of framing of charges against Hooda. The CBI court has framed charges against him in the case but trial stands stayed from the high court. He has argued that there is neither any legal sanction nor any material warranting for his prosecution under the offence of money laundering. The complaint is liable to be dismissed as same is violative of constitutional protection granted under Article 20 (1) of the Constitution of India against the retrospective operation of penal provision. He has claimed that no prosecution can be lawfully launched on the basis of a complaint which, admittedly from respondent side, is subject matter of further investigation before the prosecuting agency. Hence, he has sought quashing of August 2019 complaint and September 2019 proceedings under which cognisance was taken by the trial court. The money laundering probe was based on a CBI probe into the same controversy in which allegations are that the property allotted to AJL in the year 1982 was taken back in 1992 since AJL did not comply with the conditions of allotment. But when Hooda became the chief minister in 2005, he allowed the re-allotment of the plot to AJL at old rates. At the time of the registration of the CBI FIR, late Moti Lal Vora was the chairman of AJL and Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul were among the shareholders. The newspaper was launched in 1938 by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-asks-trial-court-to-adjourn-ed-case-against-hooda-101626293521930.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Additional guidelines issued for floor-wise registration of homes||Chandigarh Haryana revenue department has issued additional guidelines pertaining to registration of floors as separate dwelling units in Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) residential sectors. Financial commissioner (revenue) Sanjeev Kaushal said that this has been done to check leakage of stamp and registration duty. He said that in case of residential plots developed by HSVP, different floors have been allowed as separate dwelling units. However, it has been observed that the various instructions/guidelines issued in this case are not being strictly followed. Therefore, additional guidelines/instructions have been issued. All the decisions taken by the HSVP should be followed in letter and spirit. As per the guidelines, a single floor cannot be registered by the registering officers in the name of two or more separate persons by dividing the same. Hence, only horizontal complete floor is allowed to be transferred and registered under the Registration Act, 1908. There shall be no fragmentation of the plot vertically and all independent floor owners shall jointly own the full plot of land having independent floors. The apportionment of land cost for the purpose of stamp duty and registration fee shall be in equal proportion amongst all independent floors. It shall be 50% each for two floors, 33.33% each for three floors and 25% each for four floors and as per the collector rates fixed from time to time Prior permission of HSVP shall be mandatory before registration of a specific floor of a plot whether vacant or built up. If a constructed floor is transferred, apportioned cost of plot as well as cost of construction of that floor as per the collector rate shall be combined for the purpose of levy of stamp duty and registration fee. For the registration of such independent floors, in addition to the normal stamp duty, 1 % extra stamp duty will be paid by the applicant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/additional-guidelines-issued-for-floor-wise-registration-of-homes-101626293347307.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana to have ‘grain ATMs’ across state||The Haryana government is planning to install “grain ATMs” across all the government-run ration depots to ensure speedy and transparent distribution of wheat, rice and millet among the eligible ration card holders. Already, as a pilot project, and in what the government says “country’s first grain ATM” has become functional in Farrukhnagar of Gurugram. “The grain banks will function on the lines of ATM system, and the consumer will be able to fetch food grains from the machine with the press of a button,” deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who also holds the portfolio of food and civil supplies, said in Chandigarh on Wednesday. He said that after the successful completion of this pilot project at Farrukhnagar, there is a plan to install such food grain supply machines at government depots across the state. The deputy CM said these machines will prove helpful in distributing food grains to the government depot operators and also save their time. The grain ATMs will be installed under the World Food Programme of United Nation and is called automated, multi commodity, grain dispensing machine. According to Ankit Sood, an officer associated with this programme, the error in the measurement of grain is negligible and this machine can dispense up to 70-kg grains in five to seven minutes. It is equipped with biometric system and a touch screen. The beneficiary has to enter the Aadhar card or ration card unique number. On biometric authentication, the food grains prescribed by the government to the beneficiaries will be automatically filled in the bags installed under the machine. Three types of grains wheat, rice and millet can be distributed through this machine. Dushyant said with the installation of ‘grain ATMs’, complaints regarding long queues and ration quantity will be redressed. “The objective of installing this machine is to ensure that the right quantity should reach the right beneficiary, besides the transparency in the public food distribution system,” said Dushyant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-to-have-grain-atms-across-state-101626293044381.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||PO in ₹30 theft case, arrested after 31 years||Thirty-one years after he was booked, arrested and released on bail for stealing ₹30 from the pocket of a farmer in 1990, Kaithal police arrested the accused, a proclaimed offender. However, the court released him as he had already spent a night in the police custody immediately after the crime was committed. The accused, Subhash Chand, 52, of Dhrondi village of Jind district, was declared a proclaimed offender by a local court in September 1996. According to the case file, Karam Singh of Jaswanti village had filed a complaint on December 3, 1990, at the Kaithal sadar police station that he was standing at a bus-stand near Keorak village when the accused allegedly stole ₹30 from his pocket. On his complaint, Subhash was booked under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code. Kaithal superintendent of police Lokender Singh said a day after the registration of the FIR, the police had arrested Subhash and also recovered the stolen money from his possession. An official said Subhash was arrested and released on bail the next day by a court (December 4, 1990).

15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Veggie rates shoot up in Ludhiana due to fuel rate hike, unfavourable weather||The hike in fuel prices coupled with unfavourable weather condition has affected the vegetable supply, causing its rates to shoot up in the city. Vegetables such as capsicum, onion, and tomatoes are burning holes in pockets and disturbing the household budget of many. Another reason cited by vegetable sellers behind the inflation is the increase in transportation cost. Rain in the areas from where vegetables are supplied has also impacted their prices. The rate of capsicum and French beans has increased ₹20 in the last seven days. The price of bottle gourd and cucumber has also shot up by ₹20 and ₹15, respectively, while onion has become ₹10 costlier. A wholesale dealer at the vegetable market, Rakesh Bhatia, said, “Due to rain in Himachal Pradesh, the supply of a few vegetables has been affected. Vegetables such as capsicum and cauliflower come from the state. Cabbage and bottle gourd arrive from Kullu. The prices are expected to remain the same next week as well.”A homemaker, Geetika Chaudhary, said, “The increase in vegetable prices has impacted our household budget. My kids are fond of pasta, pizza and capsicum is the main ingredient to prepare these items. With the hike in rates, I have cut down on the consumption of a few vegetables and prefer buying paneer than French beans and capsicum.”Subhash Kumar, a vegetable seller, said, “If the supply remains affected in the coming days too, then the vegetable price are likely to increase more by ₹10 to ₹20.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/veggie-rates-shoot-up-in-ludhiana-due-to-fuel-rate-hike-unfavourable-weather-101626292506291.html

They include New Kundanpuri, Shivpuri, Madhopuri, Gandhi Nagar, Gopal Nagar, Fish market at Tajpur road, and near Jamalpur sewer treatment plant (STP).The civic body has also identified 172 low lying points including, those in Haibowal, Shivpuri, Transport Nagar, Sundar Nagar, Chaura Bazar, Sekhewal, Dhoka Mohalla, Cycle market at Gill Road, Partap Chowk to Dholewal Chowk, Giaspura, Daba Road, Panj Peer Road, New Kundanpuri, Damoria Bridge, CRPF Colony in Dugri, etc.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said,” Staff will be deployed at these points during the rainy season to expedite the process of draining out the rainwater. Sandbags have also been arranged to prevent the nullah from overflowing.”The officials stated that the civic body has also ensured that the drains that go through the interior parts of the city including, Haibowal, Domoria bridge, Chaura Bazar, Dholewal chowk, among other areas, and drain out into the Buddha Nullah, have been cleaned.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “The sewer lines and road gullies are being cleaned. Storm sewers have also been installed at a few sites including, the Clock Tower area. I had inspected the ongoing work of cleaning of Buddha Nullah for the second time this season on July 10.”24/7 flood control room established in Daresi areaThe district administration has set up a 24/7 flood control room (0161-2749120) in the Daresi area to deal with the menace of water logging. Sabharwal said upon receiving a complaint, the staff will promptly reach the spot.Ongoing projects might cause trouble: ResidentsThe residents are apprehensive about the tall claims being made by the MC. They rued that the ongoing projects of installation of sewer lines near Lakkar Bazar Chowk, and cleaning of sewer lines in different parts of the city, will leave them a harried lot during the rainy season. Former councillor Parminder Mehta said, “The MC had earlier dug up the road from Rekhi Cinema Chowk to Clock Tower for laying of storm sewer lines. It failed to level and repair the patch after the work was done owing to which the potholed road might lead to accidents.”Now, they have dug up the road near Lakkar Bazar chowk for laying sewer lines when the monsoon has already arrived, this too poses risk to the commuters, he added.Area councillor Rakesh Prashar said the storm lines have already been installed near the Clock Tower area. “The work of laying sewer lines near Lakkar Bazar Chowk will be completed in a day or two. The projects were taken up so that residents don’t face any trouble due to water logging during monsoon season,” he added. Meanwhile, Surinder Kaur Manna, councillor of ward number 54, stated that the MC is working to clean the sewer lines but this should have been done before the monsoon.Water logging was witnessed for a short period in areas including Abdullapur Basti, and Chandigarh Road after the city received 25.2 mm of rainfall on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-gears-up-to-prevent-water-logging-during-monsoon-101626292505064.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Akali leaders detained while trying to gherao residence of Punjab cabinet minister||More than 24 Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders, including former ministers Maheshinder Singh Grewal, Hira Singh Gabria, and Darshan Singh Shivalik, were detained by police following the protest they held outside the residence of Punjab cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu near Kochar Market here on Wednesday.The SAD leaders have been accusing Ashu of sheltering LIP chief Simarjeet Singh Bains who was booked under rape charges two days ago. Akali leader Harish Rai Dhanda and suspended DSP Balwinder Singh Sekhon had been raising the issue for the last one year and mounting pressure on both the police and the ruling Congress regime.After the registration of FIR on Monday, Dhanda, Grewal and party’s district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon had sought the arrest of Bains within 24 hours failing which they warned of gheraoing the house of Ashu.Gabria sustains injuryHira Singh Gabria sustained an injury while being taken to the police station, which prompted councillor Mamta Ashu, who is the wife of Bharat Bhushan Ashu, to visit Sarabha Nagar police station to take stock of Gabria’s condition.However, heated arguments were witnessed between Mamta and SAD leaders at the police station. Mamta accused the Akali leaders, particularly Dhanda, of deliberately dragging Ashu in the controversy. She said “there were many rape victims who were also seeking justice, but the SAD leader never stood with them”.“Mamta Ashu complained that SAD leaders dragged her husband into the controversy. We told her that Ashu represents the government, and we are asking the government to tell us as to why Simarjeet Singh Bains was being given shelter,” Grewal said.The protest began at 10am when a large number of SAD workers led by Dhillon, Grewal, Dhanda, and Youth Akali Dal (rural) president Prabhjot Singh Dhaliwal gathered outside the house of Ashu.Dhanda was highly critical of the cabinet minister and said that it was at “Ashu’s behest that Bains was roaming free”.Soon, women workers from Istri Akali Dal arrived at the protest site and begin raising anti-Congress slogans. Heavy police deployment was made outside the minister’s residence to tackle any eventuality.The protesters headed towards Ashu’s house in Model Gram but were stopped by police at the Kochar Market chowk.Traffic leading to the chowk from ESI Hospital Road was also diverted for over an hour, leading to chaos in Jawahar Nagar and surrounding area.The agitation gained momentum as women workers of the party first tried to scale the barricades.However, on failing to do so, the male workers of the Youth Akali Dal attempted to break the security cordon, but the police foiled their plan.A tug of war-like situation went on for half an hour following which the police detained Gabria, Grewal, Shivalik, Dhanda and Dhillon, while several others were also taken into custody.‘Bains is a Congress worker in disguise’“We will continue to fight for the justice to the rape victim. Now, it is no secret that Bains is a Congress worker in disguise and being provided full shelter and support by his political masters,” said Dhillon.“This is an utter lawlessness. Instead of taking action against Simarjeet Singh Bains and his accomplices, the police have arrested the SAD leaders, who are fighting for the justice,” said Dhaliwal.Meanwhile, ACP (Civil Lines) Jatinder Singh Chopra said the SAD workers were detained for security purpose and later released from the custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-leaders-detained-while-trying-to-gherao-residence-of-punjab-cabinet-minister-101626292503988.html

In a statement, Mann said the state government had failed miserably to provide 24-hour uninterrupted power supply along with other facilities to the industry. “During the 10-year rule of the Badal government, traders were troubled by goonda taxes and now the Congress leaders are harassing industrialists, due to which they are showing interest in investing in Uttar Pradesh,” he alleged in a statement. The AAP leader claimed that over 50 industries in steel parts, dyeing units, yarn, cycle parts, textile and other sectors had reportedly shown interest in investing in UP and got details of land available in different districts, sops, including 24-hour power supply. “This will be disadvantageous for Punjab,” he said, demanding that the state government should compensate the industry for their financial losses due to power shortage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-s-wrong-policies-turning-industry-to-other-states-mann-101626291661581.html

15-07-2021||Other||Neurological disorder incidence has doubled in Punjab: ICMR study||Chandigarh Neurological disorders like stroke, headaches, and epilepsy have doubled in Punjab over the past 30 years, experts in field have found after research.The empirical result that has been established is that in 1990, 4% of all disorders were neurological disorders; in 2019, this percentage doubled to 8%. Neurological disorders affect the brain and nerves, especially in the spinal cord.The Indian Council of Medical Research and the Public Health Foundation of India conducted the research. Their findings have been published under the title ‘The burden of neurological disorders across states of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990–2019’ in one of the leading global medical journals, Lancet Global Health, on July 14 (Wednesday), under the name of India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative. The study aimed at increasing awareness about these disorders, early identification, cost-effective treatment, and rehabilitation.Speaking on the trend of neurological disabilities in Punjab, Dr Gagandeep Singh, professor, Dayanand Medical College, Ludhiana, said, “The burden of non-communicable neurological disorders is increasing across the country. In Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh, these spread mainly due to the ageing population. Communicable diseases contributed to the majority of total neurological disorders burden in children younger than five years, non-communicable neurological disorders were the highest contributor in all other age groups.”“Among other neurological disorders — stroke, headache, and epilepsy are the leading contributors in Punjab. The state has lower disability burden due to stroke, when compared to the national average, but residents of Punjab have higher incidence of headache and epilepsy disorders, as compared to the national average,” he said. “There is, however, a need to scale up the treatment coverage of epilepsy in governmental schemes such as the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram and Ayushman Bharat. Policies and practices focusing on safe births, preventing head injury and stroke would help in averting a substantial proportion of epilepsies,” Dr Gagandeep added.He cautioned that high blood pressure, air pollution, dietary risks, high-fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index are increasing the risk of neurological problems in adults.Dr Dheeraj, professor, department of neurology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, who was also part of the study, said, “Hypertension is very common among Punjab residents, as a result of which neurological disorders have also doubled. The state is making efforts to create awareness about stroke due to which, lower number of deaths were reported due to this disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/neurological-disorder-incidence-has-doubled-in-punjab-icmr-study-101626289861641.html
15-07-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay set to conduct next semester online as well||The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay will conduct the autumn semester online, even as the institute opens up its campus to students gradually.Institute director Subhasis Chaudhuri said, “We are opening more and more gradually for PhD students, senior BTech and MTech students requiring lab access. However, the teaching will still be online and not physical until it is advised so by the appropriate health authorities.” The autumn semester for undergraduate or BTech students kicks off on July 26.The institute shut down completely on March 28 last year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic with an early summer vacation announced on April 1. Then on June 25, the institute declared that the entire autumn semester will be conducted online in the interest of students’ safety. Since then, almost all teaching and academic activities, barring research work, are held online.However, in December last year, the institute put in place a plan for slow rebooting of research work and to determine which students should be called in first and how. A committee was set up with student and faculty representatives.While undergraduate students and incoming masters and PhD students can complete their semester remotely, research scholars and senior masters students have to mandatorily complete their research projects to complete their course work. Thus, scholars who needed access to laboratories for their work were allowed to come back on priority.Prita Pant, head of the reboot committee and professor in the department of metallurgical engineering and materials sciences, had earlier told HT that measures were put in place to ensure social distancing and rational shifts in labs. “A checklist has been shared with labs and department heads. The heads and the guides will take a final call on whether it is essential for the student to come to campus,” Pant had said. Currently there are around 3,000 students on campus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-set-to-conduct-next-semester-online-as-well-101626289500690.html

A visitor, Jaswinder Singh, said he and his family were happy to visit the Rock Garden, and that his children had been waiting for a long time to visit here.The decision to reopen the garden was taken in a review meeting of the UT administration on July 13. Earlier, the garden was reopened in November last year, eight months after it was closed in March 2020 due to the outbreak of the pandemic.Nearly 5,000 people used to visit the Rock Garden every day after it was reopened in November last year.

15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: GMSH to start RT-PCR testing soon||In an effort to strengthen the medical facilities at the government hospitals before a possible third Covid wave, the UT health department has decided to start reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing at the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH) in Sector 16 here.RT-PCR test detects the presence of viral RNA and is quite accurate. It is the most recommended test for tracing infection in individuals suffering from influenza-like symptoms and Covid-19.During the peak of the first and second waves, the health department was struggling to conduct RT-PCR tests at the government facilities and to catch up with the daily testing targets set by the Union ministry of health.Besides private hospitals, the UT health department was dependent on Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, for RT-PCR testing.GMSH only has TrueNat machineMeanwhile, GMSH-16 only has a TrueNat machine that gives results in three to four hours, but is only meant for testing of emergency cases and not mass-scale testing. Besides, rapid antigen tests (RAT) are being conducted at various government facilities in UT, which gives results in 30-45 minutes, but is not accurate.The PGIMER has a capacity to test 4,000 RT-PCR samples per day. In the absence of the machine at the UT health department’s hospital, GMSH-16 sends around 1,000 to 1,200 samples to PGIMER daily for testing. Some samples are also being sent to GMCH-32.During the peak of the second wave in April and May, more than 600 samples were being given to private labs daily, and a huge amount of money was being paid to them by the UT administration.A top official of the GMSH, on the condition of anonymity, said, “RT-PCR testing is the need of the hour as a third wave can hit any time. A proposal has been sent to the central government to set up a RT-PCR machine at GMSH, which will initially have the capacity to test 400 samples daily. Testing, where we were lacking during the first and the second wave, will be enhanced. It will take approximately a month to start the facility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhgmsh-to-start-rt-pcr-testing-soon-101626288841297.html

A senior party functionary said the core committee of the state unit has deputed senior functionaries to talk to these leaders. He added that disciplinary action against them would be initiated only if they continue to give statements on the lines of Joshi. Sources added that Avinash Rai Khanna, who is in-charge of BJP for Himachal Pradesh, and Union minister Som Parkash have been asked to speak to Bhandari on the issue of supporting Joshi. Bhandari is also a close relative of Khanna. Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma, himself, has successfully placated former minister Master Mohan Lal. The two leaders met over a cup of tea on Sunday. Lal had criticised the Centre for not giving enough representation to Punjab in the recent Cabinet reshuffle. After his meeting with Sharma, Lal said, “The party is like my mother and I won’t leave it.” “Those leaders who have expressed their feelings over Joshi’s expulsion have done no wrong. The party respects their feelings. These leaders are well aware that Anil became ‘minister Anil Joshi’ only because of the BJP. The party expelled him with a heavy heart,” Sharma said. Joshi had already decided to leave party: Sharma The state BJP chief, who is being targeted by Joshi for giving wrong feedback to the party high command on farmers’ protests, claimed that Joshi was lying on the issue. “Even Joshi is aware that how closely the Central and the state unit functions. You look at Sunday’s Rajpura episode. Within half an hour of some miscreants attacking our leaders and holding them hostage, our Central leadership called them up and extended full moral support. Can anyone believe, that the Central leadership was not aware what was happening in Punjab when these laws were enacted?” he claimed. He added that Joshi had already made up his mind to leave the BJP and did media interviews against the state and Central leadership in a well-planned manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chorus-of-support-for-joshi-state-unit-moves-to-quell-disquiet-101626288301117.html

15-07-2021||Mumbai||Nana Patole: Maharashtra Congress’s man of the moment||Even as senior Congress leaders resorted to damage control over his statements that irked allies Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena, state Congress chief Nana Patole continued with his remarks targeting friends and foes of his party. “We have to be prepared so that we do not face betrayal like we had to in 2014,” Patole said on Wednesday, while justifying his announcement that the Congress will prepare to be on its own in next Assembly elections in 2024. His remarks, a jibe at alliance partner NCP, came in less than 24 hours after a group of Congress leaders comprising AICC in-charge of Maharashtra HK Patil and state ministers Ashok Chavan and Balasaheb Thorat met NCP chief Sharad Pawar to discuss various issues related to the three-party coalition in the state. Patole, who was the first Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP to speak against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policies in 2017 and later quit the party to return to the Congress, has been kicking up controversies since he took up the responsibility of the party’s state unit five months ago. His statements have led to tension within the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) on several occasions as allies NCP and Sena have reacted angrily. Patole, who was appointed as the state unit chief of Congress in February this year, has been in the news ever since he took over. Immediately after taking over, he announced to not allow Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar to release their films in Maharashtra for their “one-sided political stand”. He also alleged that his phone was put under surveillance by previous Fadnavis government. More recently, he irked Congress’s allies by announcing to go solo in all the forthcoming elections. His demand to probe allotment of a tender in mining and energy departments had stunned leaders from his own party as the bidding was directly related to a department held by his party colleague Nitin Raut.His latest controversy is over his remarks that he was under surveillance by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and home minister Dilip Walse-Patil. The remarks were dismissed by the NCP which said the state Congress chief misunderstood the routine function of state police’s intelligence branch that keeps tabs on all political activities in the state. In a meeting with party’s local leaders in Lonavala on Saturday, Patole also said that Sena and NCP backstabbed the Congress when it came to releasing funds for the local bodies under them.This irked the other two ruling parties who reacted sharply. NCP chief Sharad Pawar ridiculed Patole by saying that the latter was “a minor leader whose comments do not warrant a response”.Pawar’s reaction upset the senior party leaders even in Congress, as they feel that it could have a negative impact on smooth functioning of the three party-ruled MVA. It was one of the reasons why HK Patil-led delegation called on Pawar on Tuesday. Pawar reportedly asked the delegation if Congress was serious about going solo in the forthcoming elections. Party insiders said HK Patil on Tuesday held a separate meeting with Patole and advised the latter to avoid any direct attack on Pawar or leaders of the MVA.It, however, did not stop Patole from continuing his statements. On Wednesday, he said his party was firm on its decision as they do not want to be cheated like 2014. Patole was referring to the 2014 assembly polls, when NCP pulled out of the alliance with Congress just ahead of the elections. Pawar’s party was irked with then chief minister Prithviraj Chavan who they suspected was trying to corner NCP leaders by raking up various scams and helping the BJP to target them. The Congress was caught unaware as the NCP withdrew support to the government. Both the parties lost the election. NCP leader Shashikant Shinde reacted: “Every party has its own right to expand its base, but Patole should take care of a few facts, why talking.”Patole, 58, comes from Bhandara area of Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. A three-term Congress MLA, he shifted to the BJP ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He defeated NCP’s Praful Patel to get elected as MP from Bhandara-Gondiya. He quit in December 2017 by openly criticising Modi for the ‘anti-farmer policies’ of the central government. He returned to Congress and was appointed as head of the party’s farmers’ wing, All India Kisan Congress. He returned to the Assembly in 2019 as a Congress legislator and was made speaker of the assembly, the post he held till he resigned in February this year. His task was cut out: Reviving the Congress which was pushed to the fourth position in 2014 and 2019 Assembly elections in the state. Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said Patole has his own style of working. “He has been doing his work of expanding the party base in Maharashtra and as a state unit chief he is following his brief. There could be misinterpretation of his statements. Sometimes his analysis could be based on misreading. Whatever Patole says is in the interest of the party with the sole intention of encouraging the party workers. Even in the past, most of the local body elections were fought separately by Congress and NCP, barring a few exceptions,” he said.Former Maharashtra Congress chief Manikrao Thakre said that Patole has been able to charge up party cadre ever since he has taken the charge. Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana too has slammed Patole for his controversial statements and said that it needs to be seen if they have helped them in energizing the party cadre. He said that if it has energised the party, the Sanjivani buti, the magical herb in mythology, needs to be given to the party at national level as it is in very bad shape in many states. Meanwhile, Patole has announced a cycle rally to Raj Bhavan (Governor’s house) on Thursday to protest against Central government over rising fuel prices. Political analyst Prakash Akolkar said, “Patole’s rhetoric may be the party’s strategy to occupy political space. I will say what Raut is doing for the Sena, Patole is doing for his party. Thackeray and even Pawar know the final decision over alliance and other critical issues will be taken by the party’s central leadership.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nana-patole-maharashtra-congress-s-man-of-the-moment-101626287940553.html
15-07-2021||Mumbai||‘Sachin Vaze never said he handed over money to ex-home minister’||Terming the probe initiated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh “unjustified”, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader’s lawyer on Wednesday claimed that dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze has not made any mention of handing over money either to Deshmukh or his personal assistant in his affidavit before justice KU Chandiwal’s inquiry commission. Deshmukh came under the scanner after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in a letter to the chief minister and others levelled serious allegations of corruption against him. Singh claimed that Deshmukh had summoned some Mumbai Police officers, including Vaze, and informed them that he had a target to collect ₹100 crore from Mumbai and had instructed them to collect at least ₹3 lakh- ₹4 lakh from bars and restaurants, hookah parlours and such other establishments in Mumbai every month. Deshmukh’s lawyer, advocate Kamlesh Ghumre, claimed at a press conference that the probe being conducted by ED was more in the nature of harassment than a genuine investigation. Ghumre pointed out the contradictions in affidavits submitted before the inquiry commission and the statements being recorded during the probe by the central agencies. Ghumre said Deshmukh’s son and wife were also being summoned by the ED, but they have chosen not to join the agency’s probe. The lawyer added that Deshmukh’s wife, in reply to ED’s summons, has said that she is aged and is suffering from various ailments and has requested the ED to interview her through video-conferencing. Ghumre added that she was just a housewife and has nothing to do with the entire episode. “Deshmukh feels this investigation is not justified, hence he is not joining the investigation. Whatever documents ED wants, the agency should at least tell us. We have Zoom and other ways to hold video conferences, but you are directly asking us to join questioning.” Ghumre on Wednesday claimed that Singh’s allegations have turned out to be false. “Vaze hasn’t mentioned anywhere in the affidavit (filed before the inquiry commission) that he has given any money to Deshmukh. Vaze, in his affidavit, has never said that he met Deshmukh in February. In fact, he has mentioned that he had just met Deshmukh once,” Ghumre claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-never-said-he-handed-over-money-to-ex-home-minister-101626287762839.html

The university is planning to start the even semester of the upcoming session simultaneously for both first-year and ongoing batches.It is expected that winter and summer breaks will be given in the upcoming session, after they were suspended last year due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-first-year-classes-likely-to-get-delayed-101626287522330.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||Covid vaccination pace plummets as Delhi short on supplies again||Nearly half the vaccination centres in Delhi were closed on Wednesday and new vaccinations dropped nearly 50% compared to the previous day, as the state government ran short of supplies again.Officials warned that the pace was likely to drop further on Thursday.Just over 64,000 doses were administered on Wednesday at 671 vaccination centres — the city has 1,374 centres in all.On Tuesday, 129,000 doses were administered.State health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said the drop was due to shortage of doses. “We have to shut down vaccination centres because of a lack of vaccines,” Jain said.In a tweet on Wednesday, he stressed that the city has “gained control over the second wave of Covid-19”, and said the government was strengthening Delhi’s health infrastructure.Senior government officials said the state had fewer than 64,000 doses of Covishield in stock as on Wednesday morning.It was not immediately clear how many doses of Covishield were administered on Wednesday, but officials said Delhi was yet to receive new doses till the time of going of print.The government also had a stock of around 246,000 doses of Covaxin — only 20% of which were to be used for first doses — as on Wednesday morning.“Only 20% of Covaxin stocks can be used for first dose, since Covaxin stocks are limited and have irregular delivery cycles,” said the government’s vaccination bulletin on Wednesday.Delhi’s vaccination rates have been erratic even after June 21, when the Centre took control of purchasing and distribution.In over three weeks since then, vaccinations peaked on June 26, when the city administered over 207,000 doses in a single day. On three days, between June 26 and 29, Delhi administered doses to more than 200,000 every day.However, the numbers dipped sharply on weekdays, with jabs falling to 22,353 doses on July 7 (not including Sundays, when most government vaccination centres are shut).“Our stock has been completely exhausted. We are waiting to hear from the state store on whether we will get any more doses before opening the slots for tomorrow (Thursday),” said a senior official from New Delhi district, where vaccinations actually picked up on Wednesday with 6,716 jabs administered as against 3,992 the day before.The worst performer on Wednesday was north-east district where only 918 jabs had been administered till 6pm, compared to over 10,800 jabs administered the day before, according to data from the Centre’s CoWIN dashboard.“Yes, there is a shortage of vaccines; the supply isn’t regular. For now, we are not looking at adding any centres because we have more capacity than vaccines at the moment,” said an official from the district.This is likely to continue for the month, another senior district official said on Wednesday.“We had to shut some of the vaccination centres on Wednesday. There have been days when we could run only a couple of centres because of the shortage of doses. And, this is likely to continue for the month because Delhi’s allocation for the month was low. Hopefully, with production being ramped up, more doses will be available from next month,” the official added.In a series of tweets, Union health minister Mansukh Mandviya on Wednesday said problem with vaccine slots was down to mismanagement by the states.“In June, 11.46 crore vaccine doses were made available in the states and union territories and in July this was increased to 13.50 crore doses. How many doses will be available in July was communicated to the states on June 19. If despite the information being provided by the Centre in advance, there is mismanagement and long queues, then it is clear where the problem lies and who is responsible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vaccinations-slump-as-delhi-falls-short-of-jabs-101626287520562.html
15-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai accounts for 35.11% traffic violation cases in Maharashtra in 6 months||Mumbai has recorded 35.11% of all the traffic violation cases reported in Maharashtra in the past six months, reveals the latest statistics compiled by Maharashtra highways. Mumbai, which caters to 20% of the state’s vehicular population, has recorded 38 traffic violation cases from January to June 2021, followed by Pune with 16.83 lakh cases. Pimpri-Chinchwad with 5.6 lakh traffic violation cases stands at third place, followed by Thane (5.4 lakh cases), Nagpur (4.6 lakh cases) and Navi-Mumbai (4.2 lakh cases).Police officers said there has been 61% growth in traffic violations in the state for the six months — January to June 2021, as compared to the corresponding period last year.“We are concentrating on enforcement. Our aim is not to collect money but maintain a record of traffic violators and also collect fines from those who violate traffic laws. This will send the right message and people will soon start following the law. The e-challan system has helped us maintain a good record of traffic violators and those repeating violations will be dealt with strictly,” said additional director general of police, Traffic, Maharashtra, Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay.Collection of traffic fines has, however, gone down by 9% in the past six months. As per the latest figures of Maharashtra highways from January to June 2021, around 108 crore cases of traffic violations have been registered in the state, levying a total fine of ₹333 crore. The authorities, however, could collect only ₹59 crore from the violators.Last year in all 67 lakh cases was registered and the total fine collected via e-challan stood at ₹65 crore and the pending due amount was ₹209 crores.Mumbai, which has around 20% share of the vehicle population of the state, contributed to 35% cases of violations, levying 31% of the fine and recorded 26.4% of the fine collected.“Mumbai has around 38.04 lakh cases of a traffic violation for the six months period which was 59% more from last year’s 23.85 lakh cases. The Mumbai traffic police managed to collect fines of ₹16 crores, while challans issued were of ₹104 crores,” said a Mumbai Police officer.Pune recorded 16.83 lakh cases of traffic violations which were 70% more compared to last year, the overall vehicle share of Pune city stood at 11% of the vehicle share of the state. The total outstanding fine from Pune violators stood at ₹64 crores and Pune Police managed to collect ₹8 crore.The Pimpri-Chinchwad police registered around 5.6 lakh traffic cases, a whopping 212% more compared to last year and collected ₹2.3 crore in fines. Their outstanding e-challan fines was at ₹16 crore in the twin city having 5% of the state’s vehicle population.Thane city, though has a larger vehicular population - 9.31% of the state’s population - ranked fourth in traffic violations with around 5 lakh traffic violation cases for the period of six months - around 79% more than the corresponding period for 2020. While the violators owed ₹19 crore towards fine, Thane police could collect only ₹3 crore from them.In the past six months, Nagpur Police have recorded around 4.6 lakhs traffic violations - about 84% more than the cases recorded in the corresponding period last year. Nagpur police collected a fine of ₹6.7 crore from traffic violators however they owed ₹15 crore from the violators in form of unpaid e-challan by motorists. Nagpur city has around 11 per cent of the total vehicle share in the state.The Navi-Mumbai recorded 4.2 lakh cases, about 27% more compared to the cases registered in the corresponding period last year, and levied a fine of ₹16 crore. However, collected ₹2.21 crore towards outstanding fines. The vehicle share of Navi-Mumbai is 6% of the state.“Apart from the high vehicular density, implementation of traffic regulations in Mumbai is stricter also the number of traffic policemen in the city is far higher than any other city in the state. Also, the system of booking violators through close circuit television cameras is far more effective in Mumbai than any other city,” said transport expert Ashok Datar, explaining perhaps why more cases of traffic violations are registered in Mumbai than any other city in Maharashtra.Datar said the comparative hike is seen in the past six months because of relaxation in lockdown norms and less fear of Covid, as compared to last year.“People are coming on streets for work purposes this year more and trains having been closed (for except those engaged in essential services) they are taking out their vehicles,” said Datar.In this period the lowest number of cases - 16,353 were recorded in Vidarbha’s Gadchiroli town where the traffic authorities levied fines of ₹38 lakh and recovered ₹21 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-accounts-for-35-11-traffic-violation-cases-in-maharashtra-in-6-months-101626287521115.html
15-07-2021||Mumbai||Vortex: A tiny weather system that interfered with Mumbai monsoon||After a dry spell at the beginning of the week, rainfall activity intensified in Mumbai on Wednesday morning and moderate showers continued through the day. The Santacruz station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) — which is indicative of the city — received 5.5mm rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Wednesday while the Colaba station, representative of the island city, recorded 37.6mm rainfall in the same period. A small low pressure system called a vortex formed towards the north of the city’s coast made conditions more conducive for rainfall on Wednesday. It amplified the southwesterly winds, resulting in more rain. The city clocked in a total 89.6mm of rainfall in the 24 hours ending 8:30am on Wednesday. Mumbai has so far seen 1,259.3mm rain since June 1, which is about 48% in excess of the seasonal normal for the period. However, in the first 12 days of July, the city recorded 148.3mm of rain, which is -55% of the normal (332.9mm).IMD had anticipated as much as 200mm of rainfall in about 24 hours between Sunday and Tuesday. However, on Monday, the city received only 2.8mm of rainfall as most of the rainfall had been deposited in the sea. Incidentally, a similar vortex had moved clouds away from the city earlier this week, resulting in little rainfall inland.So, what is this weather phenomenon that interrupted or meddled with the southwest monsoon rains? Usually, during the monsoon season, southwesterly winds in the lower part of the atmosphere push clouds and rain from the Arabian Sea towards land. While this is the ideal condition for monsoon activities, some low-pressure activities near the coast can interfere with the wind movement. Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD student at the University of Reading, England, said, “Imagine mixing coffee in a cup of milk with a spoon. You can see the coffee swirl in the cup. This is what a vortex would look like in the atmosphere if we were able to see it straightaway. It is a small low-pressure circulation that is powerful enough to interfere with southwesterly winds.”The location of these vortices and their subsequent interaction with southwesterly winds can have an impact on how much rain the city gets. A vortex forms when there is a significant upward motion of the air over a region, for example hot air rising from the sea. In such a situation, the air from surrounding regions rushes to this region and the effect of earth’s rotation adds a swirling effect.The most common reason for the formation of a vortex is low pressure along the west coast. Usually, low pressures occur when hot air over the sea rises and wind starts blowing from the land into the sea. This creates a vortex of air swirling along the coast. On Sunday, even as clouds formed along the coast, a vortex disturbed the wind pattern, blowing clouds away from the city, said Shubhangi Bhute, scientist at IMD Mumbai. “Incidentally, Raigad received a decent amount of rainfall as the clouds moved south on Sunday and Monday,” Bhute added.However, on Wednesday, as the vortex moved towards the north-end of Mumbai’s coast, it amplified the southwesterly winds, thereby increasing rainfall activity. Estimating where the vortex can form can help predict heavy rain spells in Mumbai, said Deoras. “One can well predict such heavy rains in Mumbai by estimating where a vortex can form. However, numerical weather prediction models, which can well predict large-scale features of the monsoon, are often not able to well simulate the location and intensity of small vortices, resulting in forecasting failures,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vortex-a-tiny-weather-system-that-interfered-with-mumbai-monsoon-101626287461585.html

Justice Prateek Jalan ordered the CBSE to consider a petition by Deepa Joseph, mother of a Class 10 student studying in a CBSE-affiliated school in the city, who paid ₹2,100 as examination fee.The CBSE opposed the plea, saying that the exams were cancelled after the preparations were made for the exams.Advocate Rupesh Kumar submitted that CBSE was a self-financing body and its expenditure was principally funded by the examination fees collected from students appearing for Class 10 and 12 board examinations. He added there is no direct correlation between the physical conduct of board exams and fees charged from students.Advocate Robin Raju, appearing for Joseph, contended that since the board examinations have been cancelled, at least some part of the examination fee ought to be refunded to the students.The court disposed of the matter with the direction to the CBSE to take a decision on the representation by Joseph for the refund of the examination fees. It also recorded that the parties will have no objection to justice Jalan hearing the petition even though he will be a beneficiary on account of his son being in Class 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-asks-cbse-to-take-decision-on-refunding-board-exam-fee-in-8-weeks-101626287461007.html

The irrigation department has claimed there will be no immediate water cuts in the district. Barvi dam has received a total of 651mm rainfall this year, followed Bhatsa at 542mm and Andhra at 428mm. With the temperatures soaring in the city in the last week of June, fear of water cuts was looming over Thane city. However, with the heavy rains recorded over the past few days, water stock in major dams like Bhatsa, Barvi and Andhra increased. Last year at this time, the water level in Barvi dam was at 44%, Bhatsa had a water stock of 44.9% and Andhra 33%. Except Andhra dam in Pune district which has less water stock, the other dams situated in Thane district have received good rainfall and increased water stock. An irrigation department official said, “If the rainfall continues, Barvi dam may overflow soon and we will not have to announce water cuts this year. Soon we shall start using only the surface run-off water that flows into Ulhas river, which will also help save additional stock of water.” Jambul and Mohane areas of the Ulhas river are the prime source of water for Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/water-levels-rise-at-lakes-supplying-water-to-thane-101626287400572.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Admn set to rationalise regulatory norms||The Chandigarh administration is set to give a major overhaul to the UT’s governance process by simplifying rules, laws, procedures and different sets of compliances.The process will need a thorough scrutiny of various legislations, regulations, administrative processes and procedural requirements. In view of this, UT adviser Dharam Pal on Wednesday chaired a meeting with all administrative secretaries and heads of departments in attendance. The aim was to examine the relevance and rationale of various compliances, and to rationalise and simplify them. “The burdensome regulatory compliance adds unnecessary procedure, time and cost for citizens/business that hinders the overall ease of living and doing business. These compliances become no longer relevant due to innovative practices and economic developments,” said Pal.The adviser directed all officials to take necessary steps to make government to business and government to citizen interface simple and transparent. According to the adviser’s directions, the reforms process involves four steps. After exhaustive analysis of various legislations, rules, regulations, schemes, grants and subsidies, officials will have to conduct stakeholder consultation to identify burdensome aspects of different compliances. In addition to it, steps will be taken to decriminalise acts and provisions in case of minor civil offences, while redundant laws will be repealed, amended or subsumed.The bureaucracy dominated Chandigarh administration has consistently failed to deliver on ease of doing business. For the second year running, the UT was at the bottom of the ease of doing business rankings in 2020. Of the 187 reform points under the rankings, Chandigarh implemented only nine. There was no action on the rest of the 178. According to the report, reforms were implemented in some areas falling under the reform heads of access to information, obtaining electricity connection, and environment. However, the performance or quality of implementation was “not good”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhadmn-set-to-rationalise-regulatory-norms-101626287281588.html
15-07-2021||Chandigarh||SKM suspends Haryana BKU leader Charuni for a week for advocating Mission Punjab||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Wednesday suspended Haryana BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni for seven days for suggesting that Punjab farmer outfits involved in the stir against the Centre’s farm laws should contest the assembly polls next year. The SKM is an umbrella body of various farmer unions protesting the Centre’s farm laws. The suspension of Charuni, a prominent farm leader from Haryana and a core member of the agitation, has exposed the rift within the farmer union leadership on testing political waters ahead of the assembly elections “Following Charuni’s repeated statements that morcha members should launch mission Punjab and contest polls, we have decided to suspend him for a week”, senior SKM leader Balbir Singh Rajewal told reporters. Rajewal said Charuni had been telling the Punjab farmer leaders to take a political plunge. “We had been telling him that we have no such programme. The SKM was not formed to contest polls but to lead the agitation,” said Rajewal, adding that during the suspension period Charuni will not be allowed to share the morcha stage and make any statement on behalf of the umbrella body. Charuni, in a video message, said his suspension was wrong and it won’t change his stand. “I want to make it clear that I am still in favour of farmer leaders from Punjab contesting the upcoming assembly polls,” he said. The farmer leader, who enjoys a huge support in Haryana, especially in northern districts, said he floated the idea of Mission Punjab to ensure that farmers join active politics and have a say in the policy making process. “All political parties, including those in the Opposition, have done nothing for the farmers. Defeating the BJP will not help us until we form our own government. If we don’t do so, it will directly benefit the opposition parties in the poll arena,” he said. Charuni, however, made it clear that his suspension will not have any impact on the agitation, and he will continue his support to the protest against the controversial farm laws. Since the beginning of the agitation in November last year, Charuni’s supporters were leading the protests at several toll plazas in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/skm-suspends-charuni-for-advocating-mission-punjab-101626286560411.html
15-07-2021||Noida||New system tested to remove barriers at toll plazas on Delhi-Meerut Expressway||Vehicles could soon zip past the toll plazas on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway [DME] without halting to pay as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has successfully tested a system that can read FASTags and deduct the toll.The authority is currently testing toll-collection through the automatic number plate readers (ANPRs), which automatically reads vehicle registration plates at entry as well as exit points and compute the toll according to distance travelled. The vehicle will be required to stop at the exit point to pay the toll. The new system, which will be the first in India, is expected to remove this as well.“We are also testing a new setup which will automatically detect vehicles with FASTags and will read the registration plate of the vehicle at both ends and automatically deduct the toll. The barriers at the exit point will remain open. In case of non-FASTag vehicle, the barrier will not open,” said Mudit Garg, project director from NHAI.“This facility has passed tests conducted in the last seven days at two lanes on each side at the three toll plazas in phase 4 of the DM. No vehicle passes through the new setup without detection.”The DME connects Delhi to Meerut over a stretch of about 60km with about 10km in Delhi under phase 1 of the project.The phase 2 spans 19.8km from UP-Gate to Dasna in Ghaziabad while 32km phase 4 is an access-controlled expressway of six lanes and connects Dasna to Meerut.“Initially, the FasTags were issued on the basis of chassis number of the vehicle and not linked to registration plate. Through our ANPR mode, we are reading the registration plates for determining distance travelled by the vehicle. So, only few of such vehicles have issues while passing the new setup at tolls. But we will resolve it soon. The new setup will be made operational once we start tolling for DME,” Garg added.The phase 2 and 4 of the DME were opened for regular passenger movement in April but is yet to toll its users.The entire DME stretch has several entry/exit points like the ones at Akshardham in Delhi besides the ones at Indirapuram, ABES College, Eastern Peripheral Expressway and Bhojpur in Ghaziabad and a final at Kashi toll at Partapur in Meerut.The officials familiar with development said that a team from the Centre is likely to arrive soon for inspection of the DME stretch, especially the phase 4.“Once, the team conducts inspection and submit report, the tolling is likely to start. They will inspect the new systems installed on the expressway and examine functioning,” the officer added.The NHAI has already made it clear that no two-wheelers will be allowed on expressway lanes of the DME. In case they do, the ANPRs will be used for getting the registration number of vehicle and violations will be sent to respective district police for issue of chalans.At present, the phase 1 sees almost 120,000 passenger car units (PCUs, a measure of traffic that takes into account different vehicle makes) per day while it is about 60,000 in phase 2 and in range of 35,000-40,000 for phase 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/new-system-tested-to-remove-barriers-at-toll-plazas-on-delhi-meerut-expressway-101626286260420.html

Tapping a recommended route lets you view information on the stops. Tap the bus stop to see a listing of all arriving buses, where relevant real-time information is depicted by the green or red beacon,” said the statement.“We would like to thank DIMTS and the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology in Delhi for their partnership in this integration,” said Ramesh Nagarajan, director product management, Google.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-google-join-hands-to-provide-real-time-bus-data-101626285360250.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro’s Tughlakabad-Aerocity line gets Ridge board approval||Delhi Metro’s Tughlakabad-Aerocity corridor got the green signal from the Ridge Management Board (RMB) on Wednesday, senior officials aware of the matter said. At least 1,000 trees will have to be cut in the Ridge, considered the green lung of the Capital, for the construction of the section.HT first reported in February that the Metro line would traverse the Ridge, and flagged its environmental impact.A senior government official, who attended the RMB meeting confirmed that the Tughlakabad-Aerocity corridor -- a 5.2-km portion of which will pass through the Ridge -- was cleared after “considering alternative alignments”. The total length of the Tughlakabad-Aerocity corridor is 23.6km. Of the 5.2km corridor in the Ridge, 1.739 km will be in the Southern Ridge, 1.182 km in South Central Ridge, and 2.373 km in Morphological Ridge (a part of the Ridge that has ridge-like features, but is not part of the notified forests).“The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) presented three alignments before the RMB today (Wednesday), and after deliberations it was decided that the original alignment presented by the DMRC will cause the least damage to trees. The project has been given a go-ahead,” said an official who asked not to be named. In a meeting in June, RMB asked DMRC to explore all alternative alignments for the section.Permission letters exchanged between DMRC and the Delhi forest department showed that 1,072 trees will be cut, of which 466 are in the Southern Ridge, 455 in the South Central Ridge, and 151 in the Morphological Ridge.Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC said the agency made a lot of effort to minimise the impact of construction on the Ridge.“An area of 31 hectares with approximately 8,000 trees was earmarked in the Ridge at Rangpuri Pahadi for the train depot on this line. But now, the plan for the depot has been dropped, and the DMRC is augmenting capacities in the Sarita Vihar and Ajronda depots and extending this line beyond Tughlakabad up to Sarita Vihar Depot to cater to this new line,” Dayal said.He added, “In addition to this, DMRC has saved over 350 trees during station construction. We appreciate the decision by the Ridge Management Board to approve the alignment of the Tughlakabad-Aerocity corridor. This will help us in taking the project forward.”The Tughlakabad-Aerocity corridor of Delhi Metro came under the environmental scanner early this year when permission documents submitted before the forest department revealed the Metro’s plan to take this section from within the Ridge. In March, the proposal was first presented before the RMB, where a decision on its clearance was deferred.All construction in the Ridge have to be cleared by both the city forest department as well as RMB.Later, activists filed a petition in the Delhi high court, where the matter was referred to the central empowered committee (CEC) for a thorough inspection of the Metro route to see if there was a possibility of saving trees or re-routing the section from outside the green space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-ridge-board-gives-go-ahead-to-metro-s-tughlakabad-aerocity-corridor-101626285302718.html

Of the 34 PSA plants, 30 will be installed in hospitals run by the Delhi government and four in central government hospitals.On Wednesday, Baijal chaired a review meeting on the installation of 160 PSA oxygen plants, which are to be installed in both government and private sector hospitals in the city this year and collectively produce more than 148 metric tonne (MT) of medical oxygen per day, said the official who asked not to be named.Baijal stressed on sticking to the deadlines for each plant and ensuring that a situation, such as the last and the worst wave of Covid-19 so far in the Capital, does not get repeated, said the official.“The LG’s office was informed that a total of 160 PSA plants with a capacity of 148.11MT were being installed... The LG enquired how the figure of 160 plants was arrived at, and was informed that it was based on the requirement of around 150MT as submitted by hospitals,” said the official.While 66 PSA plants, including 17 under the PM-CARES fund, are being set up in state-run hospitals, 10 are being installed in central government and 84 in private hospitals. Of the 66 plants planned in Delhi government hospitals, 36 have been commissioned, 27 are expected to be unveiled by August 31, and three more by October 31, said the official.“Six out of the 10 plants to be installed in central government hospitals have already been commissioned.

15-07-2021||Delhi||Rain to intensify later this week: Met||The Capital on Wednesday continued to receive moderate to heavy rain, with temperatures settling around 35 degrees Celsius a day after monsoon hit Delhi, 16 days behind schedule.Some parts of the city received over 100mm rainfall on Wednesday, and officials of the India Meteorological Department said showers were likely to intensify in the coming days.IMD recordings showed that, the distribution of rain on Wednesday was patchy -- Safdarjung weather station recorded 54.6mm, Palam 10.8mm, Lodhi Road 62.8mm, the Ridge weather station 118.8mm, and Aya Nagar 13.3mm of rain.“Isolated and scattered rainfall is expected over north-west India till July 16, with isolated, heavy rains over Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh north Rajasthan, north Madhya Pradesh and south Uttar Pradesh between July 17 and July 19,” IMD in its Wednesday forecast.Officials also said that Delhi was likely to receive “normal to slightly below normal” rain this monsoon.“There are various meteorological parameters — such as easterly winds and monsoon trough, among others — a combination of which determine the intensity of the rainfall received in a particular area. Looking at the current parameters, it can be predicted that Delhi may have a near-normal monsoon,” a senior Met official said.Temperatures on Wednesday were slightly higher than the previous day, but officials forecast a dip in the mercury from July 17 because of increased rainfall.The maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory on Wednesday was 35°C, higher than Tuesday’s 30.9°C, but within the normal temperature range for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 26°C, a notch below normal.At Palam, the daytime temperature was 34.5°C, one degree below normal, and the minimum temperature was 27°C.Akshay Deoras, an independent weather forecaster and PhD student at University of Reading in England, said, “It seems that this weekend will be good for rains in Delhi, particularly July 18, since current forecast suggests reduced maximum temperature on July 18, cloud cover and good rainfall in the region.”The southwest monsoon arrived in Delhi on Tuesday, after several incorrect predictions by IMD. This is the most delayed monsoon onset in the national capital since 2002, when monsoon rains arrived on July 19. According to the weather office, the usual date for monsoon onset in Delhi is June 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/showers-in-delhi-likely-to-intensify-later-this-week-says-met-101626285241038.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||Cop hurt after nabbed suspect attempts to flee||A Delhi Police head constable and an arrested man involved in over 50 cases of snatching and robbery were injured in an exchange of fire when the suspect, who was arrested on Tuesday night, attempted to escape police custody after snatching a constable’s service pistol in outer Delhi’s Aman Vihar on Wednesday morning, officers said.The police and the suspect, identified as Sumit Bagga, were on the way to Rajiv Nagar Extension near Begumpur, when Bagga asked policemen to stop the vehicle so he could relieve himself, said DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal.“Bagga grabbed constable Pramod’s service pistol fired two rounds, one of which hit head constable Jaswinder. He retaliated and fired at Bagga, who was then overpowered,” said Tayal.The constable and suspect were taken to a hospital. They are both out of danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-cop-injured-after-arrested-suspect-attempts-to-flee-in-aman-vihar-101626285240389.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||Monsoon malady: Roads flood with just 2 days' rain||Even as the monsoon arrived in the national capital 16 days behind schedule on Tuesday, a delay that state officials said gave them enough time to de-silt the city’s drains and prepare it for the rains, all it took was a few hours of rain to lead to waterlogging and for Delhi’s traffic to be thrown out of gear. Data from the state traffic police shows that at least 96 roads from a list of 150 stretches identified as “waterlogging prone” last month ended up with knee-deep water after Tuesday’s showers.The list of stretches was sent to all road-owning agencies, including the state Public Works Department (PWD), the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the three municipal corporations (north, south and east MCDs), the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), and the Delhi Cantonment Board, warning them of impending snarls and choked drains as a result of the showers.Despite this, information from the Delhi traffic control room revealed that long traffic jams were reported from and around many of these stretches on Tuesday and Wednesday.The list includes Azadpur underpass, Pragati Maidan, Airport underpass, Palam Colony (below Palam flyover), Adchini T-junction, Hyatt flyover, RK Puram Sector 12 (near DPS School), Dabri Mor, Najafgarh-Uttam Nagar T-junction, Okhla underpass, Patparganj Road, Swami Dayanand Marg, Ramdev Chowk in Narela, Bhajanpura main road, Jahangirpuri Metro station and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) flyover, among others.Traffic police said that Azadpur Chowk, which was among the stretches flagged by the department last month, was submerged in rainwater on Tuesday. The stretch was shut and traffic diverted towards Mukarba Chowk, as PWD officials worked on getting the road dry.Similarly, road 57 near Swami Dayanand Marg (towards Shahdara), which also featured in the list, was also closed for traffic on Tuesday evening because of severe waterlogging.And, officials said, traffic is only likely to get worse, with the Met department predicting more intense showers in coming days.Muktesh Chander, special commissioner of police (traffic), said a list of flood-prone stretches is prepared and shared with road-owning agencies every year.“These stretches are no longer a secret. All the agencies by now know which roads under their jurisdiction are prone to water-logging. Though the job of the traffic police is only to manage traffic, every year we communicate our concerns and send a list of such stretches. But ultimately it will have to be fixed by the agencies concerned,” he said.As traffic on these roads crawled, civic and road-owning agencies blamed each other.“Even though the work of de-silting drains was delayed this year because of the Covid-19 lockdown, we have completed the process. Usually, de-silting large drains takes around three months, but we started it in March and despite the break, managed to finish work on all the drains by the first week of July,” said a senior PWD official.The official added, “The major reason behind water-logging every year is the large quantities of waste, mostly plastic, that gets clogged in drain mouths and leads to water flowing back to roads. No matter how much you clean the drains, the trash continues to pile up and end up clogging them.”Meanwhile, municipal bodies directed blame at the PWD and the state’s Irrigation and Flood Control Department, for not maintaining drains along arterial roads, which they said then overflows into internal streets.“Our drains are 100% de-silted, but since the Delhi government has not done its share to clean the main drains, water overflows from arterial roads into colony roads,” claimed south Delhi mayor Mukesh Suryan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-at-least-96-of-150-stretches-flagged-by-traffic-cops-witness-waterlogging-after-first-monsoon-rain-101626285186182.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||Containment zones dip to lowest in over a year||With the Covid-19 caseload in the Capital at its lowest level in over 15 months, Delhi on Wednesday saw the lowest number of containment zones in over a year, and one district has no containment zone for the first time in 13 months, government records showed.According to data from the state government’s revenue department, 472 spots in Delhi’s 11 districts were demarcated containment zones as on Wednesday. This is the lowest since 448 containment zones were recorded in the city on July 8 last year, days after the state government implemented a micro-containment policy.Also, as on Wednesday, none of the 472 containment zones were in the south-east district, which houses areas such as New Friends Colony, Lajpat Nagar, Jangpura, Okhla, and Sarita Vihar. The last active containment zone in the south-east district was de-notified on Monday (July 12), government records said.At the same time, over 37% of the contained areas (176) as on Wednesday were in the New Delhi district, followed by north Delhi (86) and south Delhi (64).No district in Delhi has had zero containment zones since June 14, 2020, according to the data, and in that time, around 73,000 separate spots have been identified as Covid-19 hot spots, and subject to strict curbs as the Capital went through four waves of the infection (between June and July; September; November; and from April to May).In 2021, so far, the fewest number of containment zones was recorded on March 12, when the city had 488 hot spots. However, on that date, no individual district recorded zero containment zones, senior officials said.At its peak, Delhi touched 24,000 containment zones, for the week ending April 30, 2021.Containment zones are spots with high instances or clusters of Covid-19 cases where economic activities are regulated, and movement is prohibited. The phased relaxations on lockdown regulations do not apply in areas notified as containment zones, and state teams deliver essential goods to doorsteps. Containment zones can be de-notified only 14 days after the last new case. Under the government’s micro-containment policy, these zones are limited to single houses, flats, apartment buildings or clusters of a few houses in a lane, blocks or pockets in residential or commercial areas.Till late June 2020, the city had much larger containment zones — entire lanes and blocks, which government officials said led to several complaints from people who were not infected and were still put under a lockdown-like situation. These areas could be de-notified only after 28 days of not recording a new case. The policy was changed following a meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah on June 26, 2020, in the light of the first wave of the pandemic in the city.The Centre stressed on adopting a policy of micro-containment – essentially sealing smaller areas and keeping fewer people under heightened surveillance. The new policy was implemented on June 30, 2020.At its peak, Delhi added a daily average of 25,294 new Covid-19 cases for the seven days ending April 23 this year, as a fourth wave of infections took hold of the city. However, since mid-May, cases, hospitalisations and deaths have reduced, and in the seven days ending Wednesday, Delhi added a daily average of 72 new cases, showed state government data.The Capital on Wednesday added 77 new Covid-19 cases, and one more virus death.State officials and health experts said the containment policy had paid off.“The city has very few active cases, and zero containment and single-digit containment numbers are achievements. To effectively manage the disease, the government will continue with its micro containment policy,” said Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said, “Micro-containment has been a very effective strategy in terms of arresting the spread of the disease. The policy is effective and has to face less resistance from people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-year-no-hot-spots-in-south-east-delhi-101626285121003.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||Metro body, DDA join hands to expand network in Narela||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) are working on a plan to expand Metro connectivity in north-west Delhi’s Narela, where the land-owning agency has planned large-scale housing and commercial projects.DMRC has planned a 23km-long Metrolite corridor between Rithala and Narela as part of its Phase-4 project. A DDA official said the current alignment of the corridor either does not touch or just passes by the periphery of the areas where economic activities have been planned.The two agencies are now working on a proposal to construct a 5.6km-long line from the Rithala-Narela corridor to connect the Pooth Khurd and Holambi Kalan areas.The land-owning agency has decided to pay DMRC ₹1,000 crore for the construction of the Metro project and has made provision of ₹400 crore in its budget for the fiscal 2021-22, officials said.“We have been holding joint inspections with DMRC officials to finalise the alignment of the line. Our teams recently did a site inspection to assess the feasibility of the proposed line that will cater to a much larger area in Narela sub-city,” said a senior DDA official aware of the development.Last year, DDA wrote to DMRC to rework the alignment of its Phase 4 Rithala-Narela line — one of the two Metrolite projects in Delhi — to sync it with the development proposed in Narela. The corridor will pass through sectors 25, 26, 31, 32 and 36 in Rohini, Barwala, Pooth Kalan, Bawana industrial areas 1 and 2, Narela, etc.DMRC officials said DDA has been informed that one single alignment cannot serve the entire Narela area.Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said, “In addition to the original corridor already proposed between Rithala and Narela, a spur of 5.6km from Puth Khurd to Holambi Kalan has been suggested to serve future developments in the area. However, these alignments have not yet received the mandatory approval from the government.”With over 25,000 flats in Narela DDA plans to develop the area which is one of the three sub-cities planned by it (other two are Rohini and Dwarka) in a big way. The agency has hired a consultant to develop a concept for “development of Narela sub-city”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dda-dmrc-working-on-metro-connectivity-to-narela-101626285061754.html
15-07-2021||Delhi||Have collected 100k+ signatures against corporation’s ‘harsh’ policies, say AAP leaders||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday said that they have collected the signatures of more than 100,000 traders across the national capital as part of its ongoing campaign against taxes and duties levied by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD). The BJP dismissed the AAP’s claim as “misleading”.While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations.The Capital goes to the municipal polls next year.During a press conference of the AAP’s head office in central Delhi on Wednesday, the party’s spokesperson and Greater Kailash MLA, Saurabh Bhardwaj, said, “Milestone of 100,000 signatures reached by AAP in its ongoing signature campaign against BJP-ruled MCD’s harsh new policies and increase in taxes. Shopkeepers in bazaars have a lot of resentment towards the BJP-ruled MCDs...Traders and professionals are openly admitting that the MCDs are looting as much money as they can because the BJP knows that it might lose the next elections.”Dismissing the statement as “misleading”, Delhi’s BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “I am an Old Delhi-based trader and have not heard of any AAP campaign among traders in Old Delhi or any other prominent market. Traders of Delhi have always stood by BJP... Problems that traders are facing due to rise in some civic charges will be resolved soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/resentment-among-traders-towards-mcds-says-aap-bjp-refutes-claim-101626285061074.html
15-07-2021||Pune||Internet connectivity in Pune rural areas major hurdle for online classes||PUNE It’s been 15 months of various degrees of Covid lockdown, and students from rural Pune are struggling to get an online education. Access to internet in the rural areas is a major challenge.“In 15 months, no concrete steps to provide devices have been taken by the rural administration. When they talk about online school, steps should at least be taken for an internet connection,” said educational activist Sachin Jamage, working president, Vande Mataram Organisation.To beat the network issues, villagers are finding different ways to ensure education happens.“We don’t have internet network, so what we do is we find a big open space and arrange offline classes, either in a temple hall or on a ground. We make sure social distancing is followed,” said Kisan Gore, teacher, Tamini High School, Mulshi taluka.The state school state department has released the updated GR which says: “Zones with not a single Covid-19 case will be allowed to restart physical classes for Class 8-12, after receiving the consent of parents.”“We held meeting with parents and they have agreed to offline classes for students. RT-PCR test or rapid antigen tests will be done for every student and tracher,” said More.A teacher from Shirur taluka on condition of anonymity, said, “Rural administration should have done something to increase internet reach in villages. However, many social organisations came forward, but the administration is missing.”Uhlas Vairagi, a parent from Maval, said, “There is network in the village, but it is only used for calling, internet range hardly exists. The government should start working on these aspects in the rural parts”Zilla Parishad CEO Ayush Prasad and education officer (secondary) Sunanda Wakhare did not respond to phone calls or queries made via WhatsApp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/internet-connectivity-in-rural-areas-major-hurdle-for-online-classes-101626281040015.html
15-07-2021||Other||‘Don’t throw me out’: Sister Lucy argues her case in Kerala HC||Sister Lucy Kalappura, the Catholic nun who was expelled from the Franciscan Clarist Congregation in 2019, and who had spoken out against rape-accused bishop Franco Mulakkal, pleaded her case in the Kerala high court on Wednesday as she argued against her eviction from a convent in Mananthawady, Wayanad. The Congregation defrocked the 55-year-old nun alleging indiscipline, and even the Vatican turned down her appeals against her eviction from the convent. The Congregation moved court after its attempts to have her vacate failed. “Do not throw me out on the street. I have been a practising nun for 39 years. I do not have anywhere else to go. It is important for me to stay at the convent to continue my position as a nun,” said Kalappura as she broke down in court. Earlier her lawyer withdrew from the case as Kalappura does not have enough money to pay the fees.The court has provided her with police protection, but the Congregation has argued that her continued stay at the convent and the presence of police personnel has been troubling others staying there. “I am a woman, a nun fighting for justice. It is important for my nunship that I continue in the convent,” Kalappura pleaded. She added that she filed a suit before a court in Wayanad against her eviction and sought permission to stay there till her plea was heard.A single bench of Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan said it is difficult for her to stay at the convent and get police protection too. “This is for your own safety. You have made serious allegations against the vicar. You have admitted yourself that you are subjected to ill-treatment... It is better to move out. We can give you protection,” the court said. But Kalappura insisted she will have to stay at the convent to continue her religious duty and obligation. The court reserved its judgment.The nun has maintained that she was victimised for supporting the agitation for the arrest of Mulakkal, the deposed bishop of Jalandhar who was accused of sexual assault by another nun in 2018. In her book titled Karthavinte Namathil (In the name of Christ), she has claimed that sexual abuse and assaults have been rampant in convents and seminaries and there needs to be institutional reforms. She has also alleged in the book that there were four sexual assault bids on her, and many nuns succumb to intimidation. The church has rejected the charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dont-throw-me-out-kerala-nun-argues-her-case-in-court-101626262139588.html
15-07-2021||Noida||Yamuna Expressway authority allots residential plots via lucky draw||The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) on Wednesday allotted residential plots via a lucky draw. Officials said the process was video-recorded to maintain transparency.The lucky draw was organised at the Community Centre in Sector P3 amid presence of at least 2% of the allottees out of a total of 15,634, who had applied for a total of 440 plots, sized 1000 square metre (sqm), 60sqm, 90 sqm and 120sqm, said officials. The draw was supervised by a three-member committee.“We sent links to all applicants so that they can join the allotment process via Facebook. We called only 2% of all applicants to make sure social distancing rules are adhered to,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.The property title will be transferred after finishing the formalities and offering possession to successful applicants, said officials.Officials said the scheme was intended for those looking for small plots in the two categories. Residential plots were available in sizes of 60sqm, 90 sqm and 300sqm, and a few plots of 1,000 sqm, available in sectors 18, 20 and 22D, among other areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yamuna-expressway-authority-allots-residential-plots-via-lucky-draw-101625682020940.html
15-07-2021||Noida||Working to resolve realty sector issues in Noida: UP minister||Uttar Pradesh infrastructure and industrial development minister Satish Mahana on Thursday said the state government is trying to resolve the issues of stalled real estate projects in Noida and Greater Noida.Addressing the media via video, the minister said that working on various suggestions given by stakeholders, the government is trying to resolve bottlenecks in stalled projects. “A number of builders in Noida and Greater Noida have been declared defaulters as they have not delivered their projects on time. It’s obvious that with their hard-earned investments stuck for many years, thousands of homebuyers must be cursing their fates. The state government has received some proposals, which include pledging units with different development authorities,” he said.He added that there are huge investments coming in the electronic sector. “All industrial development authorities in the state have been asked to provide land to mega and above-category industries within 15 days from the date of application. Through this preferential allotment system, three mega companies, including a tech giant, have been benefited so far. Also, the state government set up a dedicated helpdesk at Invest UP in April 2020, which has far attracted more than 96 investment intents, including intents from companies from around 10 countries, including Japan, US, UK, Canada, Germany, South Korea, Singapore worth around ₹66,000 crores,” he said.Claiming to provide an ecosystem through industrial parks, Mahana said that the country’s “first mega leather park” is being made in Unnao. “Spread over 42 acres, the park is planned with a total estimated cost of ₹550 Crores. It’ll also improve Kanpur’s position among the top 10 largest leather-producing hubs of the country. Besides, a logistics hub and a heritage city are also coming up along the Yamuna Expressway,” he said.Mahana also said that the government is developing a Trans-Ganga City on 1,144 hectares at Unnao. “To capitalise on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway, we are developing a Perfume Park along with a perfume museum at Kannauj on 30 hectares of land. A mega food park at Baheri in Bareilly is also being constructed and is likely to be ready-to-move by October this year,” he said, adding that the state government is providing instant incentives to new industrial units to create growth centres in the Poorvanchal, Madhyanchal and Bundelkhand regions.Replying to a query on the progress of upcoming expressways, the minister said that the 340.82-km-long Purvanchal Expressway will be in operation from next month as 95% of the work has been completed. “Over 60% of the work has been completed on the 297-km Bundelkhand Expressway. For the proposed Ganga Expressway, more than 5,000 hectares has been acquired. Besides, our government has paid ₹5,000 crore to approximately 63,500 farmers for this project as compensation,” he said, adding that work on the Ganga Expressway is expected to start from September and will be completed within 36 months of commencement.He also claimed that UP has been the only state to have reported “zero man days loss” during the second wave. “It was mainly due to the activation of district industries centre (DIC) at the ground level in coordination with the district administration, to issue orders for opening of factories of essential services, like food and milk processing units, and to ensure essential services vehicles keep on moving. During the initial days, the department of industries also ensured the duty passes to all the concerned persons,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/working-to-resolve-realty-sector-issues-in-noida-up-minister-101625159377457.html
