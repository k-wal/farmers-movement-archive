16-07-2021||World||Russia says US mission in Afghanistan has failed||Russia on Friday said that the United States had failed in its mission in Afghanistan and blamed the withdrawal of foreign forces for the war-torn country's rapidly deteriorating stability.Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan have capitalised on the last stages of the withdrawal of foreign troops to launch offensives, capturing a swath of districts and border crossings, and encircling provincial capitals.The White House had tried to paint the drawdown of foreign troops in "the most positive colours", Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday."But everyone understands that the mission failed," he told reporters at a conference in Uzbekistan attended by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.Lavrov earlier blamed the "hasty withdrawal" of US and NATO troops worsening security in Afghanistan and warned of instability spreading to neighbouring countries."In recent days we have unfortunately seen a rapid deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan," he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies."In light of the hasty withdrawal of the US and NATO troops, there is huge uncertainty around the future of the political and military situation in this country," he told reporters.Russia hosted Taliban representatives in Moscow last week, where the insurgent group claimed to have control over about 85 percent of Afghanistan.Moscow is closely watching the Taliban's advance and concerned about the potential for instability reaching neighbouring ex-Soviet Central Asian countries where Russia maintains military bases.Lavrov said the crisis had increased the threat of terrorism and worsened problems surrounding drug trafficking, which he said had reached "an unprecedented level"."It's clear that, in this situation, there is a real risk of instability spreading to neighbouring countries," he said in Tashkent, according to Russian news agency TASS.Earlier this week, ex-Soviet Tajikistan said nearly 350 Afghan refugees had crossed its border fleeing Taliban advances.Tajikistan's President Emomali Rakhmon conducted inspections at border guard posts on Friday, having earlier called up 20,000 reservists to bolster defences along the country's shared border with Afghanistan.Russia's defence ministry said this week it was staging military drills in Tajikistan where it has a base aimed at buttressing border security with Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-us-mission-in-afghanistan-has-failed-101626455095142.html

16-07-2021||World||Three doses better than two? Debate over third Covid shot intensifies||As the Delta variant spreads rapidly throughout the world, the prospect of a third "booster" shot is gaining interest even in nations where a large proportion of people are vaccinated.Experts say it is too soon to know for sure if countries will need to organise a third vaccine round later in the year. Some suggest that priority should be given to hundreds of millions in the global south who have not even gotten their first jab yet.Why three?Earlier this month, manufacturers Pfizer/BioNTech said they would ask US and European authorities for permission to provide a third dose of their vaccine.They said this was aimed at ensuring stronger immunity in individuals than that bestowed by two doses.The developers said that two doses of their vaccine protected against severe Covid-19 for at least six months.But faced with emerging variants, they said they anticipated some decline in efficacy over time.The White House's chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci, speaking on CNBC on Tuesday, said Pfizer/BioNTech's third-dose application was "an appropriate preparation (for) the eventuality that you might need a booster"."But when you translate that into, 'We will need a booster, everyone's going to get a booster,' that is not appropriate," Fauci said.He added that there were still too many people who are not fully vaccinated with two doses, let alone three.What do authorities say?There is currently no sign that medical agencies will recommend a third dose for everyone who has already received two.The European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Control says it is still too early to tell if a third dose is needed."There is not yet enough data from vaccination campaigns and ongoing studies to understand how long protection from the vaccines will last, also considering the spread of variants," they said in a joint statement.Didier Houssin, director of the World Health Organization's emergency committee, said he didn't believe there was enough evidence to justify recommending a third dose at this point.He also warned that talk of a third dose could "aggravate concerns over access to vaccines" at a time where most countries have only a tiny percentage of people fully inoculated.Hungary's President Viktor Orban on Friday said that some citizens would be able to access a third injection from the start of August.Hungary has largely gone it alone in terms of vaccines, widely using Chinese and Russian shots instead of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson makes approved for use in the EU.Useful for vulnerable people?Although mass third dose campaigns don't appear to be on the horizon, several countries have already started giving third doses to certain people.These include individuals who have a weakened immune system, including those who have undergone organ transplants, or suffer from cancer or renal problems.Among these, the bodies natural immune response to pathogens is suppressed, which means the immune response provoked by vaccines can be less powerful.Along with France, Israel this week began giving third doses to certain people."Recent data showed that the immune response provoked by two doses were insufficient among severely immunosuppressed individuals," France's vaccine committee said in May.For its part, Israel justified its decision by pointing to "a large number of cases in recent weeks" as well as the risk posed to immunocompromised patients.Or the elderly?France went a step further on Monday in announcing that a "booster campaign" would start from September for people fully vaccinated early in the year.The vaccination council said earlier this month that it was starting its third dose drive with over 80s."Scientific data to support this proposal are still limited, but taking into account studies showing a fall in antibody levels in this population, and the potentially serious impact on the care system, it appears reasonable," the council said.It added that it was possible younger people would eventually have access to a third shot, depending on how the pandemic progresses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-doses-better-than-two-debate-over-third-covid-shot-intensifies-101626454449420.html
16-07-2021||World||Experts warn UK over 'murderous' end to Covid-19 curbs||The UK government's plan to scrap day-to-day pandemic restrictions in England next week has no basis in science and amounts to premeditated murder for thousands of people, scientists warned on Friday.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week it was "highly probable" the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is over as he pressed ahead with Monday's reopening, despite the Delta variant spreading out of control.The step is justified by two-thirds of all UK adults now being fully vaccinated, he said, but England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned that infection rates are on track to reach "quite scary" levels.After convening for an emergency discussion about the UK plan, international scientists including advisers to other governments had brutal words for Johnson."I've written that I believe that the strategy of herd immunity is actually murderous," US scientist William Haseltine said."It is knowledge that you are doing something that will result in thousands, and in some cases tens of thousands of people dying. It is a disaster as a policy," he added.The UK government denies it is pursuing a policy of "herd immunity" by letting the Delta variant let rip, but concedes that daily infection rates could triple to 100,000 in the weeks ahead, adding to strains on hospitals."I don't think we should underestimate the fact that we could get into trouble again surprisingly fast," Whitty said on Thursday, urging the public "to take things incredibly slowly" as restrictions ease.From Monday -- dubbed "Freedom Day" by some media -- the government will lift most restrictions on public gatherings in England and allow businesses such as nightclubs to reopen.Mandates covering face masks and work from home will be lifted as Johnson promotes a new approach of personal responsibility, although he has also urged people not to "throw caution to the winds".'Pingdemic'The devolved governments of Scotland and Wales set their own health policy and will keep in place a legal requirement to wear face coverings in enclosed spaces such as shops and on public transport. Northern Ireland looks set to follow them.The foreign scientists attending Friday's online meeting warned that England was falling out of step not just with its neighbours in the UK but with the rest of the world.The meeting was organised by the authors of a protest letter published by medical journal The Lancet last week that originally carried 122 signatories.Another 1,400 scientists have since added their names."In New Zealand we've always looked to the UK for leadership," said Michael Baker, professor of public health at the University of Otago in Dunedin."You have a remarkable depth of scientific knowledge. You've done remarkably well in vaccine development and roll-out. Remarkable clinical trials that we're drawing on," he said."And that's why it just seems so remarkable that you're not following even basic public health principles here."Professor Chiou Shu-Ti, former head of Taiwan's Health Promotion Administration, said she was "very concerned" that younger age groups and clinically vulnerable people were left exposed by the UK plan."In our culture there is a saying that it is unethical to take the umbrella away from people while it's still raining," Chiou said."And it's actually raining very hard. So I hope the politicians can take that into consideration, to keep the umbrella there for those people not having a raincoat."The surge in infections sweeping Britain led to more than 530,000 people being instructed to self-isolate by a government-run app in the week to July 7, the highest total since January, according to latest data.Some companies such as carmaker Nissan have been losing staff en masse after they were pinged by the app -- in a brewing crisis described by media as a "pingdemic".Butchers, another industry hit hard, have even warned of national meat shortages unless the app is made less sensitive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-warn-uk-over-murderous-end-to-covid-19-curbs-101626454152155.html
16-07-2021||World||'Reputational, legal damages': US warns firms of risk of doing business in Hong Kong||The Biden administration issued a blanket warning Friday to US firms about the risks of doing business in Hong Kong as China continues to clamp down on political and economic freedoms in the territory.Four Cabinet agencies — the departments of State, Treasury, Commerce and Homeland Security — released the nine-page advisory that alerts companies about the shifting legal landscape in Hong Kong and the possibility that engaging with Hong Kong business could incur reputational and legal damages.At the same time, Treasury announced sanctions against seven Chinese officials for violating the terms of the 2020 Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which calls for asset freezes and other penalties against those who participate in the crackdown.President Joe Biden had previewed the new advisory on Thursday, telling reporters at the White House that the business environment in Hong Kong is “deteriorating” and could worsen.“Businesses, individuals, and other persons, including academic institutions, research service providers, and investors that operate in Hong Kong, or have exposure to sanctioned individuals or entities, should be aware of changes to Hong Kong’s laws and regulations,” said the notice, which is titled “Risks and Considerations for Businesses Operating in Hong Kong.”“This new legal landscape ... could adversely affect businesses and individuals operating in Hong Kong. As a result of these changes, they should be aware of potential reputational, regulatory, financial, and, in certain instances, legal risks associated with their Hong Kong operations,” it said.Secretary of State Antony Blinken highlighted the advisory in a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the passage of China's new national security law that he said had a profoundly negative effect on Hong Kong.Blinken said the risks to business include "potential electronic surveillance and lack of data privacy, reduced access to information, and potential retaliation against companies for their compliance with US sanctions.”“The business advisory outlines these emerging risks to inform US individuals and businesses and recommends increased awareness and due diligence," he saidThe American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, meanwhile, responded to the advisory by acknowledging the business environment “is more complex and challenging” but saying that it would continue its work.“We are here to support our members to navigate those challenges and risks while also capturing the opportunities of doing business in this region,” it said in a statement. It added that “Hong Kong remains a critical and vibrant facilitator of trade and financial flow between the East and West.”The United States under both the Trump and Biden administrations has determined that since the passage of the national security law, Hong Kong no longer enjoys the significant autonomy from mainland China that Beijing had pledged to respect for 50 years when it assumed control of the former British colony in 1997.As such, Hong Kong no longer enjoys preferential US trade and commercial privileges and certain officials in Hong Kong have been hit with US sanctions for their actions in cracking down on democracy.China is one of the rare areas in which the Biden administration has largely hewed to Trump's policies.Friday's warning came on the heels of a similar advisory issued earlier this week reminding American companies about potential sanctions liability if they engage in business with Chinese entities that operate in the western Xinjiang region, where China is accused of widespread repression of Uyghur Muslims and other minorities.The seven officials targeted for sanctions are Chen Dong, He Jing, Lu Xinning, Qiu Hong, Tan Tieniu, Yang Jianping and Yin Zonghua. All seven serve as deputy directors of the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, an agency the US accuses of repeatedly undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reputational-legal-damages-us-warns-firms-of-risk-of-doing-business-in-hong-kong-101626451081410.html
16-07-2021||World||UK's plan to remove Covid restrictions threat to world, warn 1,200 scientists||UK Prime Minister’s Boris Johnson’s plan to lift almost all restrictions from Monday amid a raging pandemic is a threat to the world and could lead to the emergence of deadly variants capable of evading vaccine-induced immunity, international experts have warned. Speaking at an emergency summit, scientists and physicians raised concern over the UK’s decision to kick off the final phase of the four-step roadmap out of lockdown while the country is witnessing a worrying surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, largely driven by the highly contagious Delta variant.Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University, expressed shock at Boris Johnson’s statement that suggested proceeding with the reopening. Gurdasani said that the government is implicitly accepting that the National Health Service (NHS) will come under immense pressure with thousands of hospitalisations and around 100-200 deaths per day during the peak of the pandemic.“We only have 51% of our population now fully vaccinated. Opening up at this point in time, fully acknowledging that a delay in the plan by four weeks stage 3 allowed us to vaccinate many more people, makes absolutely no sense,” said Gurdasani, adding that millions of people will get infected and hundreds of thousands will get Long Covid.Government advisers from around the world sounded alarm bells about the reopening plan, saying any variant that becomes dominant in the UK will likely spread in the rest of the world, given the country’s position as a global travel hub. “The UK policy doesn’t just affect us. It affects everybody and everybody has a stake in what we do,” Christina Pagel, the director of University College London’s clinical operational research unit, told the virtual meeting.The experts wondered why the UK government was not following even basic public health principles. “We cannot understand why this is happening in spite of the scientific knowledge that you have,” said José Martin-Moreno of the University of Valencia, a senior adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO).The summit meeting was held after hundreds of scientists, doctors, nurses and other professionals signed a letter published in The Lancet medical journal, condemning the government’s “dangerous and unethical experiment.” The letter has now been signed by more than 1,200 scientists.On Thursday, the UK reported more than 48,000 Covid-19 cases, the highest in six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-plan-to-remove-covid-restrictions-threat-to-world-warns-1-200-scientists-101626451727971.html
16-07-2021||World||Afghan Prez slams Pakistan for not doing enough for political solution||With Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and world leaders in the audience, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani used a regional conference in Tashkent on Friday to launch a blistering attack on Islamabad for failing to prevent foreign terrorists sneaking into Afghanistan and not doing enough to pressure the Taliban to join peace talks.Ghani used his address at the conference, hosted by Uzbekistan to foster connectivity between Central and South Asia, to criticise Pakistan for failing to deliver on its commitments to influence the Taliban to participate in negotiations and to prevent the cross-border movement of jihadi fighters.The president’s remarks reflected the Afghan government’s frustration over the Taliban’s refusal to begin talks to find a political settlement while it conducts a massive campaign to capture territory amid the rapid drawdown of US and NATO forces. Afghan officials have repeatedly blamed Pakistan for not putting pressure on Taliban leaders present on Pakistani soil to launch peace talks.Khan, who addressed the conference after Ghani, responded to the allegations by saying he was “disappointed” by the Afghan leader’s comments and that no country had “tried harder to get Taliban on the dialogue table than Pakistan”.Ghani told the audience, which included US deputy national security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and special representative Zalmay Khalilzad, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, that intelligence estimates indicated the “influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters from Pakistan and other places in the last month as well as support from their affiliates and the trans-national organisations” for the Taliban.“There’s a consensus among credible international observers that [the Taliban have] not taken any steps to sever their relationship with terrorist organisations,” he said.Contrary to the “repeated assurances by Prime Minister Khan and his generals that Pakistan does not find a Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in Pakistan’s interest and short of use of force, will use its power to influence to make the Taliban negotiate seriously, networks and organisations supporting the Taliban are openly celebrating the destruction of the assets and capabilities of the Afghan people and state,” he said.Ghani said Afghanistan is not asking for sympathy but for a clear definition of interest. “Embracing regional connectivity and support for a political pathway to walk back the Taliban and their supporters from the brink of descent to hell is a win-win approach. To plunge Afghanistan into all-out war is to plunge the region into radical uncertainty,” he said.“Pakistan, therefore, needs to be engaged coherently and urgently from the perspective of regional interest,” he added.While Afghanistan is grappling with a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and a severe drought, the Taliban unleashed a destructive wave of attacks across the country by deploying more than 5,000 prisoners released under the terms of the peace deal the group signed with the US last year, Ghani said.This was contrary to the Taliban’s commitment to the US to pursue a political solution, and the group had embarked on a systematic campaign of destruction and looting of public assets, car bomb attacks, assassinations, targeted killing of women and civil society leaders and summary execution of prisoners of war, he said. “These practices are forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee to cities and secure provinces. The only choice offered by the Taliban is that of submission and surrender,” he added.Ghani made it clear that while his government is committed to peace, the Afghan security forces will continue the fight. “We are prepared to face the Taliban and their supporters for as long as it takes, until they realise that a political solution is the only way forward,” he said.He added, “We, therefore, call on the Taliban to engage with the government of Afghanistan to end the war and the destructive recent onslaught. Also, we call on Pakistan to use its influence and leverage for peace and cessation of hostilities.”Khan said in his address that Pakistan’s foremost priority is stability in Afghanistan as it is “petrified” about the possible influx of more refugees at a time when it is supporting three million Afghan refugees.“Let me just say that the country that is going to be most affected by turmoil in Afghanistan is Pakistan...the last thing Pakistan wants is more conflict,” he said.“I can assure you that no country has tried harder to get Taliban on the dialogue table than Pakistan. We have made every effort short of taking military action against Taliban in Pakistan...to get them on the dialogue table and to have a peaceful settlement there.”Khan added, “To blame Pakistan for what is going on in Afghanistan, I feel, is extremely unfair...and I feel really disappointed that we have been blamed for what is going on in Afghanistan.”Khan also questioned whether the Taliban would compromise at a time when the US has set a date for the exit of its troops. “Why would they listen to us when they are sensing victory?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-ghani-slams-pakistan-for-not-doing-enough-for-political-solution-101626451515124.html

Extending India’s condolences to their families, the foreign secretary called on member states to undertake all measures mandated by the Security Council to ensure the protection of humanitarian workers.To ensure accountability for serious violations, Shringla said the UN body must assist national authorities to strengthen their legal frameworks for protecting humanitarian workers and also consider sanctioning violation such as attacks on humanitarian and medical personnel.But, he cautioned, “such measures should have wider regional and international support, in the absence of which, there may be further deterioration of the humanitarian crisis and shrinking of the humanitarian space”. As it was happening in Syria, where, he added, it had a “worsening impact of such measures on humanitarian operations on the ground”.The foreign secretary went on to reiterate India’s commitment to “working with the international community to address global humanitarian challenges in an effective and comprehensive manner”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avoid-politicisation-of-humanitarian-work-india-tells-unsc-101626450674033.html

16-07-2021||World||WHO chief says push to discount Covid lab leak theory 'premature'; China reacts||Undermining the World Health Organization’s own March report on the origin of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the head of the UN health agency on Thursday said that the push to discount the lab leak theory was “premature.” Speaking to reporters in Geneva, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledged the possibility of coronavirus leaking in a laboratory accident.“I was a lab technician myself, I’m an immunologist, and I have worked in the lab, and lab accidents happen,” Ghebreyesus said. “It’s common.”Researchers have been trying to identify the origin of Sars-Cov-2 since its first outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan. But they have not been able to arrive at a definitive conclusion, given the challenge faced by investigators to access raw data, according to the WHO chief, during their probe earlier this year in China.The lab leak theory has been floating around from the initial days of the pandemic but was largely dismissed as a conspiracy theory. The hypothesis gained momentum after top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said he was not totally convinced with the theory that the virus “developed naturally.” Fauci’s remark was followed by US President Joe Biden ordering intelligence officials to “redouble” their efforts to probe the possibility of a Chinese laboratory link.Also Read | ‘Will look into WHO proposal’: China on next phase of probe into coronavirus originAmid growing international pressure for another investigation, Ghebreyesus has asked China to be more transparent as scientists search for the origins of the coronavirus. He told reporters that the UN health agency is “asking actually China to be transparent, open and cooperate, especially on the information, raw data that we asked for at the early days of the pandemic.”“We need information, direct information on what the situation of this lab was before and at the start of the pandemic,” he said, adding that China's cooperation was critical. “If we get full information, we can exclude (the lab connection).”Responding to the WHO’s changed stance on Covid origins, China has denied that international experts were not given adequate access for investigation. Citing the report published in March, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that the investigators "agreed that the hypothesis that a lab leak led to the outbreak is extremely unlikely."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-says-push-to-discount-covid-lab-leak-theory-premature-china-reacts-101626439000113.html
16-07-2021||World||Hong Kong national security police raids student union office||Hong Kong’s national security police on Friday raided the office of a university student union after student leaders last week commemorated a man who killed himself after stabbing a police officer, local media reports said.Police raided the office at the University of Hong Kong and cordoned off the area around it, the South China Morning Post newspaper said. No union members were in the office at the time.It was not clear if anything was seized or if any arrests were made. Police did not immediately comment.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam earlier this week urged the university and police to take action after student leaders passed a motion expressing “deep sadness” and appreciating the “sacrifice” of the man who attacked the police officer.The man, identified as Leung Kin-fai, was described by police as a “lone wolf” domestic terrorist who was politically radicalized. On July 1, Leung stabbed a police officer with a knife before turning the weapon on himself.Leaders of the student union later apologized for passing the motion and stepped down from their posts.Despite the apology, the university issued a statement saying it no longer recognized the student union and would investigate the incident and “take action against the students concerned.”Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law in Hong Kong last year after months of anti-government protests in 2019 that included violent clashes between student-led protesters and police.Over a hundred pro-democracy activists have been arrested under the law, which outlaws subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign collusion to interfere in the city’s affairs.Critics say the law has been used to stifle dissent in Hong Kong and restricts freedoms promised to the former British colony for 50 years that are not found on the mainland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-national-security-police-raids-student-union-office-101626428443613.html

Some districts were completely cut off from the outside world."Everything was under water within 15 minutes," Agron Berischa, a 21-year-old decorator from Bad Neuenahr in Rhineland-Palatinate state, told AFP."Our flat, our office, our neighbours' houses, everywhere was under water."Residents were shocked by the damage as floodwaters continued to rise overnight."We rushed home and found ourselves waist-deep in water. And overnight another 50 centimetres were added," said Christoph Buecken in Eschweiler in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW).Adding to the devastation, several more people were feared dead in a landslide in northern Germany on Friday triggered by floods.Hundreds were unaccounted for in the country, while the death toll in Belgium jumped to 23 with more than 21,000 people left without electricity in one region.Luxembourg and the Netherlands were also hammered by heavy rains, inundating many areas and forcing thousands to be evacuated in the city of Maastricht.Fearing the worstIn Germany's hard-hit Ahrweiler district in Rhineland-Palatinate, several houses collapsed completely, drawing comparisons to the aftermath of a tsunami.At least 24 people were confirmed dead in Euskirchen, one of the worst-affected towns just to the north."I fear that we will only see the full extent of the disaster in the coming days," Chancellor Angela Merkel said late Thursday from Washington, where she met with President Joe Biden."My empathy and my heart go out to all of those who in this catastrophe lost their loved ones, or who are still worrying about the fate of people still missing."The number of casualties in Rhineland-Palatinate has reached 60, bringing the national toll to at least 103, authorities said Friday.In Ahrweiler, around 1,300 people were unaccounted for, although local authorities told Bild the high number was likely due to damaged phone networks.Regional interior minister Roger Lewentz told local media that up to 60 people were believed to be missing, "and when you haven't heard from people for such a long time... you have to fear the worst"."The number of victims will likely keep rising in the coming days," he added.Billions in damageSeveral people were dead and missing after a landslide in Erftstadt-Blessem in NRW, local officials said Friday."Houses were largely swept away by the water and some collapsed," the Cologne local authority said on Twitter, while a spokeswoman for the local government told AFP there were "confirmed" deaths.Gerd Landsberg, head of the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, said the cost of the damage was likely to run into "billions of euros".In Belgium, the army has been sent to four of the country's 10 provinces to help with rescue and evacuations.The swollen Meuse river "is going to look very dangerous for Liege", a nearby city of 200,000 people, warned Wallonia regional president Elio Di Rupo.In Switzerland, lakes and rivers were also swelling after heavy overnight rainfall. In Lucerne in particular, Lake Lucerne had begun to flood the city centre.Some parts of western Europe received up to two months' worth of rainfall in two days on soil that was already near saturation, according to the World Meteorological Organization.Climate change?The severe storms have put climate change back at the centre of Germany's election campaign ahead of a September 26 poll marking the end of Merkel's 16 years in power.Speaking in Berlin on Friday, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Germany would "only be able to curb extreme weather situations if we engage in a determined fight against climate change".The country "must prepare much better" in future, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said, adding that "this extreme weather is a consequence of climate change".Because a warmer atmosphere holds more water, climate change increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.In urban areas with poor drainage and buildings located in flood zones, the damage can be severe.North Rhine-Westphalia premier Armin Laschet, the conservative running to succeed Merkel, called for "speeding up" global efforts to fight climate change, underlining the link between global warming and extreme weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flooding-in-europe-death-toll-reaches-103-in-germany-at-least-118-dead-in-europe-101626433061121.html

All parties should respect the opinion of the scientists and should refrain from politicizing it.”Ghebreyesus urged China to cooperate in the second phase of investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and insisted that, “We owe it to the millions who suffered and died.” The WHO chief asked China to be “transparent, open and cooperate” as the lack of raw data, especially from the early days of the outbreak, is hindering the probe.Also Read: 'Should set aside LAC standoff to revive ties': ChinaZhao, however, defended China’s attempts at cooperation, stating that raw data was shared with the expert team that was dispatched to study the origin, and that the experts were in agreement with the country’s stance. “China showed the expert team the raw data that should be considered,” Zhao said. “The experts clearly stated on multiple occasions that they acquired a large amount of data and information, and fully understood that some information related to personal privacy cannot be copied or taken away,” he added.The Group of Seven countries, also known as the G7, have been calling on China to allow a “timely, transparent, expert-led and science-based” study into the virus’s beginnings. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison became the latest representative to join the group’s call. US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci has however cautioned that the world may never find out the precise origin of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-look-into-who-proposal-china-on-next-phase-of-probe-into-coronavirus-origin-101626431560857.html
16-07-2021||World||Russian plane that went missing found, survivors seen: Officials||Russian officials hailed a "miracle" on Friday after a passenger plane made an emergency landing in a Siberian field and all 18 people on board emerged, suffering only cuts and bruises.The An-28 plane, operated by Siberian Light Aviation (SiLA), was flying from the town of Kedrovy to Tomsk when communication was lost, Governor Sergei Zhvachkin's office said.The emergencies ministry announced later that the plane had been found, apparently after making a "hard landing", and that survivors had been spotted.The aviation agency said the plane had been found 155 kilometres (96 miles) from the airstrip in Tomsk.Zhvachkin's office announced that everyone on board, including three crew, were alive and that medics had "recorded mainly bruises and abrasions"."We all believed in a miracle. And thanks to the professionalism of the pilots, it came true: everyone is alive," the governor said.Images circling on social media showed the plane flipped upside down with dirt inside the cabin and its nose destroyed.Zhvachkin said that all of the passengers and crew would be taken to the regional capital Tomsk, where they would be examined by doctors.The Interfax news agency cited a local official as saying that six passengers refused to take a helicopter from the crash site to Tomsk and would be travelling instead by minibus.Soviet-era planesThe incident comes just 10 days after the crash of an An-26 plane in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka peninsula, killing all 28 people on board.Antonov planes were manufactured during the Soviet era and are still used throughout the former USSR for civilian and military transport. They have been involved in a number of accidents in recent years.News agency TASS reported that the An-28 plane had passed all safety checks but cited a SiLA executive as saying that the flight had been delayed by 10 hours because of bad weather.The An-28 is a twin-engine light turboprop plane with a usual capacity of 17 passengers.A local transport source told the Interfax news agency that the plane was built in 1989 and used by Russian airline Aeroflot and in ex-Soviet Kyrgyzstan before going into service with SiLA in 2014.Russia, once notorious for plane accidents, has improved its air traffic safety record in recent years.But poor aircraft maintenance and lax safety standards persist.In May 2019 a Sukhoi Superjet belonging to the flag carrier airline Aeroflot crash-landed and caught fire on the runway of a Moscow airport, killing 41 people.In February 2018, a Saratov Airlines An-148 aircraft crashed near Moscow shortly after take-off, killing all 71 people on board. An investigation later concluded that the accident was caused by human error.Flying in Russia can also be dangerous in the vast country's isolated regions with difficult weather conditions such as the Arctic and the Far East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-plane-with-at-least-13-onboard-goes-missing-near-siberia-reports-101626432529770.html

However, we are not, by any means, out of the woods yet on this. We shouldn't also underestimate the fact that we could get into trouble again surprisingly fast," Professor Whitty, who is also the chief medical adviser (CMA) to the UK government, said on Thursday at a webinar hosted by the Science Museum, London.The senior physician also had a word of caution as the UK approaches July 19 "Freedom Day," when all legal restrictions related to Covid-19 induced lockdown will be lifted. "I expect most people to continue using precautions like face masks in closed spaces even if these are no longer a legal requirement for next week. People are saying that even if they themselves are relatively low-risk, they will modify their behaviour as people around them are at high-risk," Professor Whitty remarked.Also Read | 'Will move away from legal restrictions': UK PM Johnson confirms ending Covid measuresThe warning from the medic, who appears alongside prime minister Boris Johnson during the latter's briefing on coronavirus, comes at a time when there has been a major upswing in the UK's daily Covid-19 cases even as the government confirmed earlier this week that all legal restrictions related to the Covid-19 lockdown will end on July 19. On Thursday, official data showed 48,553 fresh cases and 63 deaths due to the viral disease, as against 42,302 cases and 49 deaths for a day earlier.Also Read | UK minister ‘confident’ plans to ease Covid curbs will go ahead amid new spikeThe surge in daily cases in the UK has coincided with the recently concluded Wimbledon championships which were hosted entirely in England, and the Euro, which was hosted by 11 cities across the continent, including London, which was also the venue for the semifinals and the final.

16-07-2021||World||Russia outlaws media portal that said Vladimir Putin fathered secret child||Russia has outlawed an investigative media portal for publishing a report last year that alleged President Vladimir Putin had secretly fathered a daughter outside his marriage. The country’s prosecutor general declared the portal, Proekt Media, an “undesirable organization,” as it “posed a threat to the foundations of constitutional order and security of the Russian Federation,” according to a report in Bloomberg.The article, published by Proekt, had claimed that the daughter of a multi-millionaire woman who is a shareholder in Bank Rossiya bears a close resemblance to Putin. The bank is under the control of Yury Kovalchuk, a billionaire close to Putin. The report was dismissed by the Kremlin as “tabloid fodder”. Putin was married to Lyudmila Aleksandrovna Ocheretnaya till 2014 and the couple have two daughters.The media outlet has also published investigative pieces exposing alleged corruption and abuses by top officials and tycoons close to Putin.Russian authorities have designated its editor, Roman Badanin, and several of its reporters as “foreign agents”. Badanin and several journalists working for the portal were also subjected to raids in June under a 2017 defamation case, just as Proekt was getting ready to publish an investigative report on interior minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev and his wealth.The Russian government has outlawed more than 30 groups under a 2015 law that made membership in “undesirable” organisations a criminal offence. Besides Proekt, two popular independent outlets -- Meduza and VTimes -- have been designated as “foreign agents” in recent months. Last month, a Moscow court outlawed organisations founded by Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny for allegedly being extremists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-outlaws-media-portal-that-said-vladimir-putin-fathered-secret-child-101626430853812.html
16-07-2021||World||Delta variant cases among fully vaccinated people cause worry in Australia||The highly contagious Delta variant has caused the biggest threat to Australia’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) response in months as the number of fully vaccinated people catching the infection is rising. A nurse at Westmead Hospital in New South Wales and a worker at the Brisbane international airport are reported to have Covid-19 despite being fully vaccinated against the disease, according to The Guardian.Australia reported 103 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Friday and the bulk of it came from Sydney, taking the total caseload in the ongoing outbreak, which began a month ago, to more than 1,000. The latest Covid-19 outbreak in Australia has claimed two lives and 75 patients have been hospitalised, reported Associated Press.While the number is still low as compared to the rest of the world, the resurgence is a sharp turnaround for a country that was successful in keeping small flare-ups in check for months. The state of Victoria has announced some form of lockdown conditions for Sydney, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in the country."I can't stress to the community my absolute concern that we need to work harder at reducing mobility and reduce our interactions with others," New South Wales Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said.Experts have warned of more breakthrough infections with the rapid spread of the Delta variant, saying the vaccines aren’t perfect. Hassan Vally, an associate professor in epidemiology at La Trobe University in Australia, said that vaccination and PPE aren’t fail-safe even though they reduce the risk of infection, The Guardian reported.Critics have blamed the resurgence on low vaccination rates, frequent changes in vaccine guidance leading to hesitancy, and lax quarantine at the international border. Less than 10% of the Australian population has been fully vaccinated, which is below many developed nations. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has blamed the low vaccination rate on supply shortages of Pfizer’s vaccine and the restrictions on AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine due to the blood clot scare.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-cases-among-fully-vaccinated-people-cause-worry-in-australia-101626430400129.html

Khan was responding to a question on whether “talks and terror can go hand in hand”."We can tell India that we [Pakistan] have been waiting for a long time to coexist as civilised neighbours...but what to do? the ideology of RSS has come in between," said Khan, while evading a question on whether Pakistan has no control over the Taliban anymore.Khan was in Tashkent for the Central-South Asia conference to discuss the “challenges and opportunities in Uzbekistan.” About 250 participants and 40 delegates from different countries are supposed to take part in the two-day conference.

On Thursday, Afghanistan vice president Amrullah Saleh accused Pakistan Air Force of providing air support to the Taliban militants in the border areas of Chaman and Spin Boldak, a claim rejected by Islamabad."Pakistan air force has issued (an) official warning to the Afghan Army and Air Force that any move to dislodge the Taliban from Spin Boldak area will be faced and repelled by the Pakistan Air Force. Pak air force is now providing close air support to Taliban in certain areas," Saleh tweeted.Responding to the accusation, Pakistan foreign office said in a statement that such statements undermine their “sincere efforts” to play their part in the peace talks. Last week, the Pakistani military said that Islamabad is a facilitator of the Afghan peace process and not a guarantor. "Of course other stakeholders have been a part of this, but Pakistan has played a key role," said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director-general Babar Iftikhar in an interview with ARY News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-evades-question-on-taliban-blames-rss-ideology-for-no-talks-with-india-101626429101615.html

At the time we thought that statins may inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 infection through their known anti-inflammatory effects and binding capabilities, which may potentially stop the progression of the virus."The ACE2 receptor, or the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is the regulatory target of statins, and helps control blood pressure. Last year, it was discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily uses the ACE2 receptor to enter lung cells.For their study, which was published in the journal PLOS One, the research team used data from the American Heart Association's Covid-19 Cardiovascular Registry. Then, they applied their original findings to 10,541 patients across the United States, who were hospitalised with the coronavirus disease. The study was conducted across 104 hospitals from January to September 2020.Elaborating on the research, Daniels said, "We performed more advanced analyses as we attempted to control for comorbidities, socioeconomic status and hospital factors. The study confirmed our prior findings that statins reduce risk of death among patients hospitalised for Covid-19." She also said that most of the benefits appeared to be among patients with good medical reasons for taking the drug.Daniels further cautioned that just like any other observational study, it cannot be said with certainty that the reduced death risk due to Covid-19, found associated with statins, is due to statins themselves. However, she hoped that the findings act as an incentive for patients to continue using the drug.Statins reduce blood cholesterol levels by blocking liver enzymes which make cholesterol. They are such widely prescribed that according to the US Centers for Disease Control, 93% of patients using a cholesterol-reducing drug use a statin.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/patients-taking-cholesterol-reducing-drug-at-lower-risk-of-death-due-to-covid-19-study-101626424920060.html

The remaining five who tested positive for the variant are Filipinos who came back from the United Kingdom (UK), the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar. One person succumbed to the variant after being rushed to a hospital in the capital city of Manali on June 28, Vergeire added.Also Read| ‘Early stages’ of Covid-19 third wave, amid Delta surge: WHOAuthorities in the Philippines are currently struggling to arrest the spread of the variant as it has led to a recent spike in daily cases and deaths. The country on Thursday recorded 5,221 new cases while 82 more people succumbed to the viral disease, taking the caseload and death toll to 1,490,665 and 26,314 respectively. On Wednesday, 3,806 cases and 140 deaths were reported. The Philippines currently has the second-highest Covid-19 caseload across South Asia.Apart from the Delta variant, the Philippines also has its own variant of Covid-19 called P.3, which was downgraded by WHO from a variant of interest to an alert for further monitoring, according to a report by GMA news online on Tuesday. The P.3 variant, first identified in the country in mid- February this year, has infected 166 people, the GMA news online report added.With regard to vaccination, the Philippines has administered 13,442,299 doses, which are sufficient for just 6.2 per cent of its population based on a two-dose regimen, data compiled by Reuters showed on Friday. The country will receive 3.2 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine during this month from the United States.The Delta variant, which was first detected in India in October last year, has wreaked havoc across the globe with more than 111 countries reporting cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday the spread of the variant is leading to an increase in cases and deaths due to the Covid-19. “We expect it (Delta variant) to soon be the dominant Covid-19 strain circulating worldwide if it isn’t already,” Ghebreyesus added.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-reports-first-locally-transmitted-cases-of-delta-variant-101626416991179.html

Young Afghans are reportedly engaging with the Islamist military organisation on the audio-based app Clubhouse to argue with its members and pitch counter-offensive tactics."Some say the Taliban have changed, but I wanted to hear from them, in their own voice, if they really have," said Sodaba, a 22-year-old man from Kabul. Women's rights are one of the several things he is concerned about in the evolving landscape of his country, and Sodaba wants to hear the Taliban's views on it, straight from its members. He told the news agency AFP that he wanted to know if the Islamic fundamentalist group still held its "strict beliefs, especially on women".The Clubhouse audio app allows users to dip into "rooms", either to listen or virtually put their hand up to speak in discussions, which according to the platform's guidelines cannot be recorded nor comments quoted. Scores of youngsters in Afghanistan are now populating the platform with an intent to engage the Taliban in discussions.Some of the popular topics include the Taliban's view of the afterlife, how to have a happy relationship, and Persian poetry. Many have wanted to weigh in on the reasons behind the quick fall of rural districts to the militants, with dozens waiting for their turn to speak.In a country riddled by insurgency, a platform for engaging with the Taliban in political discussions attracts the most listeners. The members of the Taliban sometimes moderate the chatrooms, and things may get heated up very fast as the proponents and critics clash on ideas, including war, human rights, and the role of women in society.A few users are fearful that the Taliban is violating Clubhouse policies by recording conversations that can be used for future retribution. "The Taliban called me rude and cut my mic after I spoke the truth about them," a user by the name of Haanya Saheba Malik tweeted. She later told AFP that the Taliban openly declared "those of us calling for human rights infidels and deserving of death."Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid denied that threats were being made. The group, which has adopted an increasingly professional approach to public relations and social media, calls Clubhouse a "good platform to talk to and find understanding with those who oppose".The approach is a marked shift from the past when the Taliban rarely engaged in open discussion. However, such changes are only gradual in an ever-shifting technological landscape, with nearly half of Afghanistan's 37 million residents now having access to the internet and 13 million using social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-youth-debate-taliban-over-poetry-and-human-rights-on-clubhouse-101626411885107.html

16-07-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada reviews Covaxin for emergency-use authorisation||Canadian health authorities have placed Covaxin, Indian company Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine, under review for possible emergency-use authorization (EUA).The confirmation came in the form of an updated list of vaccines, antivirals and other Covid-19-related treatment listed by Health Canada. Among the latest entries is the candidate proposed by Vaccigen, the Canadian affiliate of Ocugen, the US biopharma company that has entered into an agreement with Bharat Biotech for manufacturing and distributing Covaxin in North America.The date listed by Health Canada for the application was June 30. While Covaxin was not specifically named, its medical ingredients were described as a “whole virion inactivated coronavirus” meant for human use.Whether Canada requires an additional vaccine is a separate debate, since it has placed orders for up to 404 million doses from various manufacturers, including 180 million doses from the four vaccines that currently have EUA in the country – the ones developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson.However, a decision to approve Covaxin is likely to depend less on domestic demand and more on an effort to standardise Covid-19 vaccines globally.In a media briefing on Thursday, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, Howard Njoo, said they were “looking more now at international collaboration, and international consistency”, according to a report in the outlet iPolitics.Ocugen had commenced discussions with Health Canada with regard to the authorisation of Covaxin in June. On Thursday, it released a statement saying “it had initiated a rolling submission to Health Canada”. That process was recommended and accepted by Canada’s interim order relating to Covid-19 drugs, and “transitioned to a new drug submission for Covid-19, which permits companies to submit safety and efficacy data, and information, as they become available. Often referred to as a rolling review, this allows Health Canada to start its review right away, as information continues to come in, to accelerate the overall review process”.Shankar Musunuri, chairman of the board, CEO and co-founder of Ocugen, said, “We thank Health Canada for their upcoming review of Covaxin and look forward to working with them so that we can offer the possibility of another safe and effective option to be used in their fight against Covid-19 and its Delta variant.”The Canadian review comes as Bharat Biotech has also submitted Phase 3 trial data to the World Health Organization (WHO) for its authorisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-reviews-covaxin-for-emergency-use-authorisation-101626412572505.html

The official death toll in the disaster is estimated at somewhere around 45, while news agencies independently reporting on the floods indicated that the actual number might be several counts higher.In Germany's Cologne area alone, at least 20 to 30 people are estimated to have lost their lives in the floods, while 28 more reportedly died in the Ahrweiler district in Rhineland-Palatinate, according to the Die Welt daily, which cited local police records on the floods. As many as 50 to 70 people are estimated missing following the floods, said interior minister Roger Lewentz.Among the German villages worst hit by the flood was Schuld, where several homes collapsed and dozens of people remained unaccounted for. Some villages were reduced to rubble as old brick and timber houses couldn't withstand the sudden rush of water, often carrying trees and other debris as it gushed through narrow streets. Even rescue operations took a hit, reported the Associated Press, due to blocked roads and internet outages across the Eifel, a volcanic region of rolling hills and small valleys.The floods in Germany also affected neighbouring Belgium, where the Vesdre River spilt over its banks and sent water churning through the streets of Pepinster, near Liege, where a rescue operation by firefighters went wrong when a small boat capsized and three elderly people disappeared. “Unfortunately, they were quickly engulfed,” said Mayor Philippe Godin. “I fear they are dead.”The Meuse River in Liege, a city with a population of 200,000, also overflowed its banks and authorities urged people to shift to higher ground. In Verviers, too, several bodies -- victims of the flood -- were found, but the prosecutor's office could not come up with an exact death toll in the incident.The full extent of the damage was still unclear, with many villages cut off by floods and landslides that made roads impassable. Many of the dead were only discovered after floodwaters receded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floods-ravage-germany-and-belgium-over-60-dead-dozens-missing-across-europe-101626407268012.html
16-07-2021||World||Canada likely to allow entry to fully vaccinated travellers by early September||Canada prime minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday that the country could start allowing entry to fully vaccinated Americans as of mid-August for non-essential travel. Moreover, Canada should be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travelers from all countries by early September, he added.Also Read | Why Indians are choosing Canada over US, experts testify before US lawmakersTrudeau spoke with leaders of Canada’s provinces and his office released a readout of the call. He noted that if Canada’s current positive path of vaccination rate and public health conditions continue the border can open.“Canada would be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travelers from all countries by early September,” the readout said. “He noted the ongoing discussions with the United States on reopening plans, and indicated that we could expect to start allowing fully vaccinated US citizens and permanent residents into Canada as of mid-August for non-essential travel.”Trudeau noted Canada continues to lead G20 countries in vaccination rates with approximately 80% of eligible Canadians vaccinated with their first dose and over 50% of eligible Canadians fully vaccinated. He said case numbers and severe illnesses continue to decline across the country as vaccination rates continue to increase.In the early days of the pandemic, the US and Canadian governments closed the more than 5,500-mile (8,800-kilometer) border to nonessential traffic. With increasing vaccination rates and dropping infection rates, some were annoyed the two governments hadn’t laid out detailed plans to fully reopen the border.Canada began easing its restrictions earlier this month, allowing fully vaccinated Canadians or permanent legal residents to return to Canada without quarantining. But among the requirements are a negative test for the virus before returning, and another once they get back.Also Read | Canada says no to Covid-19 test report from India, wants flyers to take 'third country' routePressure has been mounting on Canada to continue to ease the restrictions at the border, which have been in effect since March of last year.Providing exemptions for travel into Canada amid the pandemic is politically sensitive and Trudeau is expected to call a federal election next month.Trudeau said his ministers would share more details on the border early next week.Commercial traffic has gone back and forth normally between the two countries since the start of the pandemic. Canadians are able to fly into the United States with a negative Covid-19 test.The US Travel Association estimates that each month the border is closed costs $1.5 billion. Canadian officials say Canada had about 22 million foreign visitors in 2019 — about 15 million of them from the United States.Canadian officials have said they would like 75% of eligible Canadian residents to be fully vaccinated before loosening border restrictions for tourists and business travelers. The Canadian government expects to have enough vaccines delivered for 80% of eligible Canadians to be fully vaccinated by the end of July. The US only allowed for exports of vaccines into Canada in early May.Major League Baseball and the Toronto Blue Jays are hoping to win an exemption to allow for home games to be played in Toronto starting July 30. Allowing unvaccinated players into the country remains a sticking point but protocols will be put in place. The Blue Jays played home games during the shortened 2020 season in Buffalo, New York, and started this season in Dunedin, Florida, before moving to Buffalo.The Canadian government didn’t allow the team to play at home in Toronto because of the risk of spreading Covid-19, citing frequent travel required in the US during a baseball season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-likely-to-allow-entry-to-fully-vaccinated-travellers-by-early-september-101626403589428.html
16-07-2021||World||EU sets Uyghur and Hong Kong conditions for investment agreement||The members of the European Parliament have underlined the conditions to be met before the legislature gives its consent to the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). The conditions have been listed in a draft report prepared by foreign affairs committee of the European Parliament, which calls for using the CAI as a leverage instrument to improve the protection of human rights and support for civil society in China.The pre-ratification commitments listed in the report include a timetable for China's ratification and implementation of key labour laws and concrete measures towards putting an end to human rights violations against the Uyghur minority in the country. It also demands a recommitment by China to uphold its international commitments to Hong Kong.Also Read | Xi Jinping warns foreign foes not to mess with ChinaThe resolution also supports for the United Nations (UN) to carry out legal investigations into alleged genocide and crimes against humanity taking place in Xinjiang and a unilateral ban on the import of products from forced labour and child labour or any other form of modern slavery.The European leaders have urged stronger cooperation with other democratic players such as Japan, India, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. They have called for combining the strength of global liberal democracies in order to respond to China’s changing role and growing influence in multilateral organisations.The resolution presented by the leaders strongly demands the bloc to revisit strategy to deal with China, in view of its strong economic growth and ambitious foreign policy agenda. The members condemned the Chinese ruling dispensation for its poor track record of human rights.Calling for a more assertive strategy against China, the members of the 27-nation bloc have proposed a new EU-China policy in the draft report based on six pillars: Opening dialogue on global challenges; engagement on human rights issues through economic leverage; analysis of the threats and challenges; building partnerships with like-minded partners; fostering open strategic autonomy and defending core European interests and values.The members also called for dialogues on human rights to be held regularly and a solid benchmarking of the progress made in bilateral talks. They also demanded opening of a channel to talk to China on possible ways to ensure better global preparedness to respond to pandemics.The European Parliament members also sought China's cooperation in an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Talking about the trade frictions, the European leaders demanded lifting the counter-sanctions imposed by the Chinese government on EU entities and individuals, who Beijing accused of "severely harming its sovereignty and interests and maliciously spreading lies and disinformation". The sanctions were imposed in March against 10 individuals and four entities in response to similar action by the EU against a Chinese entity and individuals over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.The draft report will now be submitted to a vote in the European Parliament as a whole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-sets-uyghur-and-hong-kong-conditions-for-investment-agreement-101626401920345.html
16-07-2021||World||Covid-19 in US: Los Angeles County to reimpose mask mandate amid rise in cases||Los Angeles County will reimpose its mask mandate this weekend in the latest sign that public health officials are struggling with an alarming rise in coronavirus cases tied to the highly contagious Delta variant.The county, home to 10 million people and the nation's second-largest city, Los Angeles, is one of several jurisdictions to recommend or mandate wearing masks or other pandemic restrictions in recent days as cases rise to worrisome levels in many parts of the United States."We’re requiring masking for everyone while indoors at public settings & businesses, regardless of vaccination status so that we can stop the increased level of transmission we're seeing," the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said on Twitter Thursday.The mandate will go into effect Saturday night at a minute before midnight, the agency said.The announcement follows six straight days of more than 1,000 new Covid-19 cases reported in Los Angeles County, with nearly 400 people hospitalized with Covid-19 as of Wednesday, up 275 from the week before. Nine new Covid-19 deaths were reported on Wednesday.More than 1,500 new infections were reported on Thursday, and the county has become a place of "substantial" transmission, based on criteria set by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Los Angeles County health officer, Dr. Muntu Davis, said in remarks provided to reporters.Other California counties and other states are also grappling with a spike in coronavirus cases, led by a mutation of the coronavirus known as the Delta variant and predominantly affecting people who are unvaccinated.Also on Thursday, Sacramento and Fresno Counties in California recommended that masks be worn indoors even by people who are vaccinated. Austin, Texas, on Thursday urged people who are not vaccinated or are otherwise high-risk to avoid travel, indoor gatherings, dining out and shopping, and to wear masks.Earlier this week, Yolo County in California also recommended indoor masking, and in Springfield, Missouri, children and teachers have been required to wear masks during summer school."Everyone, including those who are vaccinated, should be aware of high-risk situations including being indoors, in crowds, and around unvaccinated and unmasked individuals and consider wearing a face covering in these settings,” said Fresno County Public Health physician Dr. John Zweifler.Data from the CDC show high levels of coronavirus transmission in numerous states, including Missouri, Mississippi, Florida, Nevada and Utah.Across the country, health officials urged residents who have not yet done so to become vaccinated. Vaccines are approved and available for all people as young as 12 years old. In Los Angeles County, just 0.09% of new cases were among people who had been vaccinated, officials said.“Our best protection against Covid-19 continues to be the vaccine," said Sacramento County Public Health Officer Olivia Kasirye. "We urge all eligible residents to get vaccinated in order to protect themselves, and their family and friends.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-us-los-angeles-county-to-reimpose-mask-mandate-amid-rise-in-cases-101626398001944.html
