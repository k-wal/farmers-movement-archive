It added that foreign secretary Sohail Mahmood had met the Afghan envoy on Sunday to brief him on all the steps taken by Pakistan and to reassure him of full cooperation. “We hope that the government of Afghanistan would reconsider its decision,” the Foreign Office said.Saleh said in a tweet: “President @ashrafghani instructed @mfa_afghanistan to call back our ambassador from Islamabad along with all senior diplomats. The abduction of Afgh ambassador’s daughter & her subsequent torture has wounded the psyche of our nation. Our national psyche has been tortured.”He added in another tweet, “This isn’t the first case but the first spectacular case involving a lady. Harassment of diplmts/local staff with integrity who reject collaboration is in the menu of Islamabad agencies.”On Saturday, Afghanistan had demanded full security for its diplomats in Pakistan after Selsela Alikhil, 26, the daughter of Afghan ambassador Najibullah Alikhil, was abducted, held for almost five hours and assaulted by unidentified men in Islamabad on Friday.The Afghan foreign ministry had summoned Pakistani ambassador Mansoor Ahmad Khan in Kabul to lodge a strong protest over what it described as a “grave incident”. Pakistan’s Foreign Office had described the incident as an act of “man-handling” and said police have launched an investigation.A statement made by Selsela Alikhil said she was kidnapped when she boarded a taxi at Blue Area, a commercial district in Islamabad located a short distance from the Parliament. She said an unidentified man who was let into the taxi by the driver had beaten her and called her the daughter of a communist.A medical report stated she had injuries to her wrists, ankles and head.The latest downturn in bilateral ties came days after President Ghani accused Pakistan of not taking action to prevent the “influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters” in the past month and not delivering on repeated assurances to use its power to influence the Taliban to join negotiations. Ghani made the allegations at a regional conference in Uzbekistan while Prime Minister Imran Khan was in the audience....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-recalls-envoy-diplomats-from-pakistan-after-kidnapping-of-ambassador-s-daughter-101626630382231.html

This is almost double the last record of the fastest internet speed in the world held by researchers from the University College of London. The speed was 178 Tbps.What 319 terabytes per second mean:1. The full form of Tbps is terabytes per second. One terabyte means 1,000 gigabytes. One gigabyte is 1024 megabytes.2. According to a report of 2020, the highest mobile broadband speed was experienced in South Korea, which was around 100 Mbps (megabytes per second).3. The same report said Singapore had the highest fixed-line broadband speed, which was 2015 Mbps.4. Hong Kong, according to the report, had an internet speed of 210.73 Mbps and Romania had 194.47 Mbps speed.5. India's download speed was shown as 38.19 Mbps in case of fixed broadband and 12.16 Mbps in case of mobile broadband, the 2020 report said.6. With 178 Tbps, the last-held record of the fastest internet speed, one can download entire Netflix in just one second, reports said. With almost double that speed, entire Netflix will be insufficient for 319 Tbps.6. Many reports said that 319 Tbps means one can download 57,000 full-length movies in 1 second or the entire library of Spotify in less than three seconds.7. Nasa's system runs at 400 gigabytes per second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/downloading-over-50-000-movies-in-a-second-what-japan-s-319-tbps-internet-speed-means-101626627500055.html

The unidentified suspect entered the store, filled a bag with candles and then started spraying people with mace.“This is an only in Miami story,” Doral Police spokesman Rey Valdes told the Miami Herald. “You can’t make this up.”About 35 people were affected. Some were taken to hospitals for treatment, including the store manager, but officials were not sure how many or whether any had to be admitted. Bear mace is a strong irritant to a person's eyes and respiratory system.A portion of the mall was evacuated after the macing Saturday. The man believed responsible got away in a cab.The suspect could face numerous armed robbery and aggravated battery charges once he is arrested, Valdes said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-can-t-make-this-up-candle-thief-uses-bear-mace-repellent-on-mall-patrons-in-us-101626627141238.html
18-07-2021||World||Japan sets internet speed record by transferring 319 Tb/s over 3,001 km||Researchers in Japan have demonstrated an internet speed of 319 terabits per second, setting a world record. A team of researchers at Japan’s National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) used advanced fiber optic technology with a 4-core optical fibre of standard outer diameter of 0.125 mm to perform the speed test, breaking the previous record of 178 Tb/s set by engineers in Japan and Britain a year ago.To achieve the record speed, the researchers constructed a recirculating transmission loop experimental set-up by combining two kinds of rare-earth-doped fiber amplifiers. The combination of erbium and thulium doped-fiber amplifiers and distributed Raman amplification enabled a long-distance transmission over 3,001 km.“The 4-core MCF with standard cladding diameter is attractive for early adoption of SDM fibers in high-throughput, long-distance links, since it is compatible with conventional cable infrastructure and expected to have mechanical reliability comparable to single-mode fibers,” the Japanese research institute said in a paper published earlier this month.NICT stressed that it was crucial to demonstrate how new fibers can meet the demand of apparent “explosive increase” from new data services. The research institute further noted that the result from the latest internet speed test will help the realisation of new communication systems that can support the new “bandwidth hungry services,” adding that they will continue to explore ways to further increase the transmission capacity of “low-core-count multi-core fibers and other novel SDM fibers.”“Further, we will work to extend the transmission range to trans-oceanic distances,” NICT said.The research paper was published at the International Conference on Optical Fiber Communication which was held virtually from June 6-11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-sets-internet-speed-record-by-transferring-319-tb-s-over-3-001-km-101626625183592.html
18-07-2021||World||UK PM Boris Johnson's U-turn on plan to skip quarantine after Covid exposure||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and finance minister Rishi Sunak will both self-isolate in line with national guidance, abandoning heavily criticised plans to take part in a pilot scheme that would have allowed them to continue working.The U-turn comes a day after health minister Sajid Javid said he had tested positive for COVID-19 and at a time when the government's coronavirus response is under intense scrutiny.Almost all remaining restrictions in England will be lifted on Monday despite a surge in infections as ministers put their faith in the advanced vaccine programme.Cases are rising by more than 50,000 a day and hundreds of thousands of Britons are being asked to self isolate for 10 days, causing havoc for employers and parents, prompting train cancellations and forcing some businesses to close their doors.The government announced at 0700 GMT that Johnson and Sunak had been exposed to a person with COVID-19 and would take part in a trial scheme that allowed them to keep working instead of self-isolating.But less than three hours later that decision had been reversed after a flurry of criticism from voters, political opponents and business owners."We did look briefly at the idea of us taking part in the pilot scheme... but I think it's far more important that everybody sticks to the same rules," Johnson said in a video message from his country residence, where he will isolate until July 26.Opposition politicians had said it was hypocritical for Johnson and Sunak to have tried to exempt themselves from some of the rules."Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have been busted yet again for thinking the rules that we are all following don’t apply to them," said Labour Party leader Keir Starmer.Sunak also acknowledged the backlash over their initial decision."I recognise that even the sense that the rules aren’t the same for everyone is wrong," he said on Twitter.The government's handling of the pandemic has been dogged with episodes that have damaged public trust - most recently when then-health minister Matt Hancock was pictured kissing an adviser, in breach of social distancing regulations. He later resigned.Housing minister Robert Jenrick confirmed that the government would go ahead with its "freedom day" plan on Monday, removing the requirement to wear face masks, lifting limits on social gatherings and allowing high-risk businesses to reopen.Johnson used his video message to plead with the public to take a cautious approach to the change of rules."Please, please, please, be cautious," he said."Go forward tomorrow into the next step with all the right prudence and respect for other people, for the risks that the disease continues to present and, above all, please, please, please when you're asked to get that second jab ... please come forward and do it."Ministers argue that the vaccination programme, under which 87.8% of the adult population has had one vaccine and 67.8% have been double vaccinated, has largely broken the link between cases and mortality."The last time we had cases at the level we do today, the number of people dying from the virus was 30 times the number it is today," Jenrick told the BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-s-u-turn-on-plan-to-skip-quarantine-after-covid-exposure-101626620830280.html

A Beijing-based veterinary surgeon was infected with the virus after he dissected two dead monkeys in early March, according to China CDC Weekly.The 53-year-old veterinarian started experiencing nausea and vomiting and a month later, fever and neurological symptoms followed. He visited several hospitals but eventually died on May 27, China CDC Weekly revealed Saturday.Around mid-April, researchers collected cerebrospinal fluid from the patient for next-generation sequencing and the readings suggested possible alphaherpesvirus infection. They also collected several specimens including blister fluid, blood, nasal swab, throat swab, and plasma to further identify the etiological agent.The samples were sent to the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (IVDC) of China CDC. The IVDC conducted four sets of RT-PCR to detect BV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), monkeypox virus and orthopoxvirus, however, the sample tested positive only for BV.Also Read | Rare but not alarming: All you need to know about monkeypox found in TexasAll close contacts of the patient are reported to have tested negative for the virus and are safe from it, for now, reported Global Times.

Many airfields under Americans including the Bagram air base which have been vacated due to the ongoing power tussle with the Taliban.The Indian workers involved in civil works have also been asked to move out. Indian public sector company WAPCOS had some officials there for dam projects. India had recently also announced works worth around $350 million including the Shahtoot dam for providing drinking water to the city of Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-fighters-taliban-told-to-target-india-built-assets-in-afghanistan-report-101626609876295.html
18-07-2021||World||Bitcoin a climate calamity? UN experts see sustainable development in cryptocurrencies||Despite issues of greenhouse gases produced in Bitcoin mining, the United Nations believes that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology could play an important role in sustainable development.In recent months, many people around the world have raised concerns about Bitcoin mining, an energy-intensive process that involves using powerful computers round the clock to solve complex mathematical problems. Citing environmental concerns, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that his company would no longer accept Bitcoin. This led to a collapse in Bitcoin’s market value, which was earlier skyrocketing on the back of confidence shown by the same tech billionaire.Tim Berners-Lee, who wrote the source code of the World Wide Web, described Bitcoin mining as “one of the most fundamentally pointless ways of using energy.”Why does the Bitcoin network require a staggering amount of energy?Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that has no physical existence. New Bitcoins are brought into circulation as a reward for a process known as 'mining'. The proof of transaction in cryptocurrencies is not stored in a central database, rather stored in a block and recorded by a distributed network of miners.The miners are rewarded with new Bitcoins for each block they mine successfully. Recording a block involves solving mathematical problems which get more complex with each mining. Over the years, the algorithms kept getting longer and more complex, requiring special computers with colossal processing powers to record the block.Naturally, such processes are energy-extensive and often rely on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal. As per an estimate by the University of Cambridge, Bitcoin mining consumes more than 178 (TWh) annually.Also Read | Tesla suspends Bitcoin use. Here's how mining cryptocurrency affects the climateWhat does the UN say?The UN experts believe that cryptocurrencies could actually improve their stewardship of the environment. In a report last month, the United Nations said that transparency is one of the most useful aspects of cryptocurrencies and can provide a trusted record of transactions, especially in countries with weak institutions and high levels of corruption. The World Food Programme (WFP) has found that blockchain technology can help ensure that cash gets to those who need it most.It could be also helpful in protecting the environment since it has been used as a tool to eliminate illegal fishing in the tuna industry. The UN experts believe that the technology could provide a transparent way to show how countries around the world are taking action to reduce their impact on the climate.On the issue of power consumption, the UN noted that many players in the industry are working to address it by switching to a different method to verify transactions. According to the report, the Ethereum Foundation has said that the energy cost of each transaction could be cut by 99.95% by switching to a different method called Proof of Stake, or PoS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bitcoin-a-climate-calamity-un-experts-see-sustainable-development-in-cryptocurrencies-101626605165317.html
18-07-2021||World||UK announces 15 new research programs to study 'long Covid'||The UK’s Department of Health and Social Care said on Sunday that the UK government has allocated nearly 20 million pounds (equivalent to 27.5 million US dollars) to study what is called “long Covid,” adding that 15 new research programs will be launched for the study.Also Read: Fully vaccinated UK health secretary Sajid Javid tests positive for Covid-19In “long Covid,” people have symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), such as fatigue and neurological disorders, for a period longer than usual.“People who have long Covid will benefit from the new research programs, which will help to understand the condition better, improve diagnosis and find new treatments. The 15 new research studies will allow researchers across the United Kingdom to draw together their expertise from analysis long Covid among those suffering long-term effects,” the department stated in a press release.The release further said that the programs will focus on several aspects, including efforts to understand the condition better and identify it, the evaluation of different treatments, as well as measures to ensure better integration of specialist, hospital and community services for people with long Covid.The announcement by the Department of Health comes in the wake of a latest study which stated that while many people can fully recover from Covid-19, a significant portion of people continue to experience its symptoms for “several months.” The aim of launching these studies is to help those affected return to normal lives, the release further stated.In recent days, the UK has seen a fresh uptick in daily coronavirus infections, driven primarily by the Delta variant which was first found in India last year. Despite this, virtually all Covid-19 restrictions will come to an end on July 19, as confirmed by the government earlier this week. However, experts, alarmed at the rise in daily cases, have urged prime minister Boris Johnson’s administration to continue with certain safety measures, with former health secretary Jeremy Hunt warning that a lockdown “may have to be re-imposed.”(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-announces-15-new-research-programs-to-study-long-covid-101626604632728.html
18-07-2021||World||Europe: Death toll due to flooding climbs to over 180||BERLIN (AP) — The death toll from flooding in Western Europe climbed above 180 on Sunday after rescue workers dug deeper into debris left by receding waters.Police put the toll from the hard-hit Ahrweiler area of western Germany's Rhineland-Palatinate state at more than 110 and said they feared the number may still rise. In neighboring North Rhine-Westphalia state, Germany's most populous, 45 people were confirmed dead, including four firefighters. And Belgium has confirmed 27 casualties.Chancellor Angela Merkel was due to visit Schuld, a village near Ahrweiler that was devastated by the flooding, later Sunday. Her visit comes after Germany's president went to the area on Saturday and made clear that it will need long-term support.Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said he will propose a package of immediate aid at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, telling the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that more than 300 million euros ($354 million) will be needed. And he said that officials must start setting up a rebuilding program which, from experience with previous flooding, will be in the billions of euros.Although rain has stopped in the worst-affected areas of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, storms and downpours have persisted in other parts of western and central Europe. There was flooding Saturday night in the German-Czech border area, across the country from where last week's floods hit, and in Germany's southeastern corner and over the border in Austria.Some 65 people were evacuated in Germany's Berchtesgaden area after the Ache River swelled. At least one person was killed.A flash flood swept through the nearby Austrian town of Hallein late Saturday, but there were no reports of casualties.Heavy rain and storms caused serious damage in several parts of Austria.Climate scientists say the link between extreme weather and global warming is unmistakable and the urgency to do something about climate change undeniable.Scientists can’t yet say for sure whether climate change caused the flooding, but they insist that it certainly exacerbates the extreme weather that has been on show around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-death-toll-due-to-flooding-climbs-to-over-180-101626598212130.html

The researchers comprising those from Royal Holloway, University of London, analysed the encryption protocols used by Telegram and highlighted the vulnerabilities in its cloud chats.Telegram said it acknowledged the vulerabilities highlighted by the researchers and fixed them in latest update. The platform uses MTProto protocol to secure its cloud chats, something like the Transport Layer Security (TLS), a popular cryptographic standard meant to ensure security of data in transit.Explaining what they set out the achieve, the researchers said in their study that they launched four attacks on the security protocols used by the popular messaging app and the last one "broke the authentication properties of Telegram’s key exchange, allowing a MitM attack"."Telegram uses its MTProto “record layer” - offering protection based on symmetric cryptographic techniques - for two different types of chats. By default, messages are encrypted and authenticated between a client and a server, but not end-to-end encrypted: such chats are referred to as cloud chats," said the study.They said though the platform offers end-to-end encryption (E2EE) through a feature called "secret chats", the cloud chats aren't encrypted. They then described the methods used to attack Telegram's security protocol and how they succeeded.The vulnerabilities gave an adversary the chance to "reorder" messages, said researchers, adding that it can allow the hackers to manipulate Telegram bots. The messaging app uses cloud chats to control several automated bots.“The latest versions of official Telegram apps already contain the changes that make the four observations made by the researchers no longer relevant," Telegram wrote in a blog post on Friday.Apps like Telegram and Signal have seen massive surge in downloads and usage after WhatsApp updated its privacy policy that included a controversial change of linking data of WhatsApp users to Facebook's other products and services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/telegram-vulnerabilities-highlighted-by-researchers-platform-says-issue-fixed-101626596188613.html
18-07-2021||World||Explained: How to become a space tourist and the cost||Space will soon become a place, not just for astronauts but also tourists who can book a flight to go to the edge of unknown and take experience of a lifetime. Two billionaires - Virgin Galactic's Richard Branson and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos are taking early strides to open up the frontier for space tourism.While Branson successfully spent some time at the edge of the space, Bezos - through his other company Blue Origin - will undertake the journey on July 23.The nearly 11-minute flight will see Blue Origin crossing the Karman Line, 100 kilometres above, from where the limit of the space starts and descend through a parachute to a desert in Texas.What will it take to become a space tourist?Nothing much actually. The person interested to go to space should be in reasonable shape. Virgin Galactic has said that its training will last for five days during which the astronauts will learn how to make the most of time spent in microgravity, as well as how to be safe and comfortable during periods of high acceleration. The company will also keep aerospace medical experts on hand to offer advice and help and check pre-flight fitness.Blue Origin, meanwhile, will teach the potential astronauts everything they need to know for the space visit. Though it has not listed the day-wise training schedule, Blue Origin expects the participants to be able to climb seven flights of stairs (the height of the launch tower) in under 90 seconds. It has also prescribed a height requirement between 5'0" and 110 pounds (152 centimetres and 50 kilograms) and 6'4" and 223 pounds (193 cm and 100 kg).What will be the cost?This is the part which takes space tourism to selct few. Virgin Galactic sold the initial tickets at $200,000 to $250,000 each. And it has warned that the price will increase in the future. The company has so far sold 600 tickets.Blue Origin has so far not announced the price of its tickets.For those looking for a cheaper option, Florida-based company Space Perspective is taking space tourists on its Spaceship Neptune - a balloon-shaped pressurised capsule - for $125,000 a seat. However, the capsule will ascend only 19 miles - far from the boundary of space, and weightlessness. Still, 300 seats for 2024 have all been sold.How soon can space tourism begin?Virgin Galactic has said it will launch regular commercial flights from 2022, after two more test flights. Once the full-fledged operations are launched, the goal is ambitious: 400 flights per year.As for Blue Origin, no detailed calendar has been announced. The company's spokesperson, however, said earlier that they plan to launch their operations in 2022.What about Elon Musk?Musk and his company SpaceX is also getting into the space tourism game, but its plans involve journeys that are far longer. The costs are also predicted to be astronomical - tens of millions of dollars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-to-become-a-space-tourist-and-the-cost-101626594084634.html
18-07-2021||World||Covid-19 virus piggybacks only black carbon emission, says study||A new study has suggested that Covid-19 virus piggybacks only black carbon emitted during biomass burning and not all PM2.5 particles. The study, conducted by Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and published in the journal ELSEVIER, is based on data collected from Delhi from September to December last year and the 24-hour average of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and black carbon (BC).PM2.5 are fine particles which penetrate deep into the body and ignite inflammation in the lungs and respiratory tract that leads to the risk of having cardiovascular and respiratory problems including a weak immune system. PM2.5 consists of black carbon, often called soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among others.Several studies have linked air pollution to higher Covid-19 cases. A study carried out in Italy correlated the incidence of coronavirus cases with PM2.5 levels, authors Aditi Rathod and Gufran Beig said, reports news agency PTI."However, in this paper, we argue that not all PM2.5 particles carry the virus. It is only black carbon which is emitted during biomass burning which carries the virus," Beig, senior scientist and founder-project director, System of Air Quality Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), said."Delhi was worst affected by the novel coronavirus infection. However, when the situation was returning to normal after about six months with minimum fatalities, it suddenly encountered a reversal with a 10-fold increase in infection counts, coinciding with the onset of the stubble burning period in neighbouring states," the study noted.The study says that the aged biomass black carbon particles tend to aggregate and react with other compounds to grow in size, providing temporary habitat to viruses leading to the rapid increase in Covid-19 cases, which declined after the crop burning stopped.The researchers found that the concentration of black carbon "directly corresponds to the speed at which infections spread after the onset of winter and stubble burning period and then reduced with a declining trend in BC with reduction in stubble fire counts".The surge in black carbon emission is directly related to the additional contribution of stubble burning-induced PM2.5 concentration transported externally from stubble burning regions, the study stated.In another study conducted earlier, Beig and his co-authors had said that people living in Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are more likely to contract Covid-19 due to prolonged exposure to high concentration of PM 2.5. "Higher number of Covid-19 cases have been found in places like Maharashtra, Delhi, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Bihar, Karnataka, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh with prolonged exposure to high concentration of PM2.5," the report had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-virus-piggybacks-only-black-carbon-emission-says-study-101626587916926.html
18-07-2021||World||India to Canada: Speed up study permits before new semester starts in September||India has conveyed its concerns to the Canadian government regarding hurdles that more than 33,000 Indian students are facing in their bid to reach Canada in time as the new semester at various universities start in September.The concerns were raised by India’s external affairs ministry with the Canadian high commission in New Delhi, while its Indian counterpart in Ottawa has taken it up with Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry.The final decision on the issue rests entirely with Canadian authorities.While Canadian missions in India have given Indian students priority and booked appointments for them, it appears the process could drag until September or later. It includes submitting biometric details and mandatory medical examination.Earlier, due to Covid-19 lockdowns in Canada, universities allowed international students to attend classes online based on approval-in-principle of their study permits. However, as the situation normalises in Canada due to a fall in coronavirus cases, the educational institutions are no longer accepting delays and advising students to seek deferrals.India has asked Canada to provide additional appointments in July and August to clear the study permit backlog and to request universities to extend their deadlines or take into consideration the delay in getting those documents for reasons beyond the control of the students.India has also linked this to the problem that students are facing in travelling to Canada, due to the absence of direct flights as Ottawa barred them since April 22 over fears of the Delta variant of the virus. Without direct connectivity, students have been forced to travel via other countries and require a negative Covid test result from the last point of departure for Canada before being allowed to board the flight.India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, confirmed that the concerns have been officially conveyed, as he told HT, “We have strongly taken up issues relating to students with the Canadian government as well as universities to facilitate their mobility from India to Canada.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-to-canada-speed-up-study-permits-before-new-semester-starts-in-september-101626587719695.html

18-07-2021||World||Gunshots fired outside Washington baseball stadium, at least 4 injured||Four people were shot outside a baseball stadium crowded with thousands of spectators in the US capital on Saturday, causing the game to be abruptly halted as fans were ushered out.Police said four people had been shot but there was "no ongoing threat," without clarifying the condition of the gunshot victims.AFP journalists who were at the game said some spectators had rushed for the exits after hearing a dozen or more gunshots outside the stadium, while others remained in their seats at the announcer's initial urging.Several bursts of automatic gunfire could be clearly heard in the stadium in footage of the game posted on social media.The United States has a long and painful history of deadly gun violence, in the form of a steady daily toll of shootings as well as high-profile mass killings that have targeted schools, workplaces, and shopping centers.The lights of multiple police cars lit up the street and sirens could be heard as the crowd attending the game between the Washington Nationals and the San Diego Padres was then asked to leave the stadium.Police tweeted officers were "responding to a shooting... in which two people were shot outside of Nationals Park," in the Navy Yard neighborhood of southern Washington, DC."This is currently an active investigation and it appears there is no ongoing threat at this time," it added.Shortly after, the department tweeted that "two additional victims associated with this incident walked into area hospitals for treatment of gunshot wounds."The Washington Post quoted police as saying two of the wounded had non-life-threatening injuries, with a man shot in the leg and a woman shot in the back.The condition of the other two people who showed up at hospitals was not known.An intersection by the Third Base Gate where the shooting occurred was sealed off by police.Minutes after the incident, the Washington Nationals official account tweeted that "a shooting has been reported outside of the Third Base Gate at Nationals Park" and encouraged fans to exit the ballpark.Players had headed for the dugouts after the shots rang out and the game was suspended in the bottom of the 6th inning, with the Padres leading by eight runs to four.The game is to be resumed on Sunday.There have been just over 100 homicides in Washington this year, many of them involving firearms.Police on Saturday offered a $60,000 reward after a six-year-old girl was shot dead the day before while riding a scooter in southeast Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunshots-fired-outside-washington-baseball-stadium-at-least-4-injured-101626579384370.html
18-07-2021||World||Earth's richest man Bezos to blast off into space on Tuesday||Jeff Bezos, the richest person in the world, is set to join the astronaut club Tuesday on the first crewed launch by Blue Origin, another key moment in a big month for the fledgling space tourism industry.The mission comes days after Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson crossed the final frontier, narrowly besting the Amazon magnate in their battle of the billionaires.Blue Origin's sights are, however, set higher: both literally in terms of the altitude to which its reusable New Shepard craft will ascend compared to Virgin's spaceplane, but also in its future ambitions.Bezos founded Blue Origin back in 2000, with the goal of one day building floating space colonies with artificial gravity where millions of people will work and live.Today, the company is developing a heavy-lift orbital rocket called New Glenn and also a Moon lander it is hoping to contract to NASA under the Artemis program."They've had 15 successful New Shepard uncrewed flights and we've been waiting years to see when they're going to start flying people," Laura Forczyk, founder of space consulting firm Astralytical, told AFP, calling it an "exciting time" for enthusiasts.New Shepard will blast off at 8:00 am Central Time (1300 GMT) on July 20 from a remote facility in the west Texas desert called Launch Site One, some 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of the nearest town, Van Horn.The event will be live streamed on BlueOrigin.com beginning an hour and a half before.- Richest, oldest and youngest -Joining Bezos on the fully autonomous flight will be barrier-breaking female aviator Wally Funk, who at 82 is set to be the oldest ever astronaut, Dutch teenager Oliver Daemen, the company's first paying customer, who will become the youngest astronaut.Rounding out the four-member crew is Jeff Bezos' brother Mark, a financier who directs the Bezos Family Foundation and works as a volunteer firefighter.The pair are best friends, and Jeff shared the moment he asked his younger sibling to join him in a viral video on Instagram last month.Notably absent is the mysterious winner of a $28 million auction for a seat, who had "scheduling conflicts" and will take part in a future flight, and has asked to remain anonymous, the company said.After lift-off, New Shepard will accelerate towards space at speeds exceeding Mach 3 using a liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen engine with no carbon emissions.The capsule soon separates from its booster, and the astronauts unbuckle and begin to experience weightlessness.The crew will spend a few minutes beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, at 62 miles altitude (100 kilometers), as the spacecraft peaks at 65 miles high (106 kilometers).They will be able to admire the curvature of the planet -- and the inky black of the rest of the universe -- from large windows that comprise a third of the cabin's surface area.The booster returns autonomously to a landing pad just north of its launch site, while the capsule freefalls back to Earth before deploying three giant parachutes, and finally a thruster, to land gently in the west Texas desert.- Bigger prizes -Beyond the first flight, relatively little is known about Blue Origin's future tourism plans.The company has a history of secrecy, its existence only becoming public knowledge three years after its creation. It then pursued a policy of "self-imposed silence" until 2015.Unlike Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin hasn't officially started selling tickets -- Daemen won his spot through the auction process. The company wants two more flights this year, then "many more" in 2022, it told AFP.Forczyk, the analyst, said it will all depend on the level of demand that is generated by these early flights, and how well the industry recovers from accidents "which there inevitably will be, because spaceflight is inherently risky."Elon Musk's SpaceX will enter the fray in September with an all-civilian orbital expedition on its Crew Dragon, and is tying up with another company, Axiom, for visits to the International Space Station.Beyond tourism, Blue Origin would like to supplant SpaceX as NASA's leading private sector partner, and sees New Shepard as "sort of the stepping stone and also the way to make money along the way for the greater ambition," said Forczyk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/earths-richest-man-bezos-to-blast-off-into-space-on-tuesday-101626570837768.html

"President Biden’s goal was for 70% of Americans to be vaccinated by July 4. Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed."Covid-19 misinformation has spread during the pandemic on social media sites including Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc-owned YouTube. Researchers and lawmakers have long accused Facebook of failing to police harmful content on its platforms.The company has introduced rules against making specific false claims about Covid-19 and vaccines for it, and says it provides people with reliable information on these topics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-says-it-is-not-accountable-for-us-failing-to-meet-vaccine-goals-101626569549865.html
