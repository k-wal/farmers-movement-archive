Dozens of trains in the region were delayed for up to 40 hours.Li Yongsheng was found Friday afternoon in a garage under the Jincheng International Plaza in Zhengzhou's Jinshui District, The Paper said. It said he was trapped when the garage flooded Tuesday and lay on a ventilation duct surrounded by floating cars.A photo on The Paper's website showed Li being guided by rescue workers through chest-deep water. It said he was hospitalized with a crush injury.On Saturday, skies were mostly clear but parts of Zhengzhou and other cities including Hebi, Xinxiang and Anyang still were under water.In Hebi, rescuers were moving people out of neighborhoods where water was up to two meters (six feet) deep, The Paper said. It said authorities intentionally flooded parts of Hebi on Saturday afternoon to lower water levels elsewhere.A video on The Paper's website showed rescuers in boats making their way down streets through waist-deep water.In Zhengzhou, a city of 12 million people, bodies and more than 200 wrecked cars were found in the Jingguang North Road Tunnel, where water up to 13 meters (43 feet) deep was pumped out, The Paper reported.The Ministry of Emergency Management sent flood drainage teams with 300 people and equipment from neighboring provinces, the official Xinhua News Agency said.Direct economic losses were estimated at 13.9 billion yuan ($2 billion), according to Xinhua.

We have made our best case and they have given their best assurance,” said the Foreign Secretary.Indian High Commissioner to the UK Gaitri Issar Kumar said that the Indian mission in London has been keeping the pressure on over the issue.“In the High Commission, the assessment is that the extradition has been decided, the only thing is this remaining legal process which they are duty bound to do because it is a judicial process,” she said.Meanwhile, Mallya’s bankruptcy case will return to the High Court in London on Monday, where a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) are pursuing a bankruptcy order against the 65-year-old businessman to recoup unpaid loans.Before he leaves for New Delhi on Saturday evening, the Foreign Secretary also confirmed that the first UK-India Consular Dialogue is scheduled for September, when a whole range of consular issues including easier student visa processes are to be discussed.“The first Consular Dialogue between the UK and India will take place in September. There are a number of consular issues, which is bound to be when there is so much people to people connect,” said Shringla.“I reminded them about a quick decision on the extradition of economic offenders such as Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi. I also pointed out that criminals like Jayesh Patel were in custody and he needs to be deported to India as soon as possible. He is here on fake identity documents, there is need for him to face justice back in India,” he said.While Nirav Modi is seeking permission to appeal against his extradition in the High Court in London, Jayesh Patel – wanted in India for murder and around 50 criminal offences – is fighting his extradition at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London since his arrest earlier this year.Among a range of consular and migration issues that came up during the Foreign Secretary’s UK visit, he also received an update on the Migration and Mobility Partnership (MMP), which had been signed between UK Home Secretary Priti Patel and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in May.“It was an important landmark decision by the two sides. The Joint Working Group that will get into the nitty-gritty and operational details of this partnership and how to operationalise it, will be meeting in August,” he said, adding that the MMP would lead greater two-way exchange of students and professionals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vijay-mallya-extradition-shringla-says-uk-govt-gave-best-assurance-101627146348544.html

The virus is rapidly spreading in some areas with low vaccination rates, threatening the pandemic response of the United States as the Biden administration sought to out vaccinate the variants of concern.“Folks the Delta variant is no joke. Please protect yourself and your loved ones – get vaccinated,” the US president tweeted on Saturday.Folks the Delta variant is no joke. Please protect yourself and your loved ones – get vaccinated.The United States started an aggressive vaccination drive following the approval of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. About half of the US population is now fully vaccinated against Covid-19 but vaccine hesitancy has been a major impediment in the Biden administration’s goal to achieve herd immunity through vaccination.Over the past week, the daily average fatalities due to Covid-19 has surged 48% to 239 while hospitalisations are also on the rise. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said that the Delta variant now accounts for 83% of all sequenced Covid-19 cases in the country, a sharp rise from 50% at the beginning of July. With the Delta variant rapidly spreading across the country, public health experts are urging the US CDC to recommend face masks even for fully vaccinated people.CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky said the decisions on mask mandates could vary locally depending on vaccination rates and surge in Covid-19 cases. She acknowledged that the United States is “at another pivotal moment in this pandemic” as the country is witnessing a resurgence of the virus. However, the agency has not given any indication of bringing back federal guidelines on face masks for fully vaccinated individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-is-no-joke-biden-s-desperate-request-as-us-sees-another-covid-surge-101627146647077.html

During its extended 44th session held online, the World Heritage Committee selected the cultural sites in Saudi Arabia, Austria, Belgium, Czechia, France, Germany, Italy, the UK for World Heritage List, days after removing Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City from it.The inscription of sites on the World Heritage is scheduled to continue through 28 July. Dholavira, an archaeological site in Gujarat which represents the ruins of an ancient city of the Harappan civilization, and the Glorious Kakatiya Temples and Gateways in Telangana will also be examined for inscription on Unesco’s list.Here are the five newly inscribed sites on World Heritage List:Ḥimā Cultural Area, Saudi ArabiaIt contains a substantial collection of rock art images depicting hunting, fauna, flora and lifestyles in a cultural continuity of 7,000 years. For centuries, travellers and armies have left rock inscriptions on the site, most of which are preserved in pristine condition, said Unesco. It is located at the oldest known toll station on an important ancient desert caravan route where centuries-old wells still produce fresh water.The Great Spa Towns of EuropeThis transnational site comprises 11 towns located in seven European countries: Baden bei Wien (Austria); Spa (Belgium); Františkovy Lázně (Czechia); Karlovy Vary (Czechia); Mariánské Lázně (Czechia); Vichy (France); Bad Ems (Germany); Baden-Baden (Germany); Bad Kissingen (Germany); Montecatini Terme (Italy); and City of Bath (UK). These towns, developed around natural mineral water springs, bear witness to the international European spa culture.“Together, these sites embody the significant interchange of human values and developments in medicine, science and balneology,” said Unesco.Also Read | These sites make the most of their Unesco World Heritage tagCordouan Lighthouse, FranceThis active lighthouse located near the mouth of the Gironde estuary in the Atlantic Ocean was built in white limestone dressed blocks at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries and was remodelled in the late 18th century. Calling it a masterpiece of maritime signalling, Unesco said that the monumental tower embodies the great stages of the architectural and technological history of lighthouses.Mathildenhöhe Darmstadt, GermanyThe neighbourhood in west-central Germany was established in 1897 as a centre for emerging reform movements in architecture, arts and crafts. The buildings were created by its artist members as experimental early modernist living and working environments and were expanded during successive international exhibitions in 1901, 1904, 1908 and 1914, according to Unesco.“Today, it offers a testimony to early modern architecture, urban planning and landscape design, all of which were influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and the Vienna Secession,” the UN agency said.Padua’s fourteenth-century fresco cycles, ItalyThe site, composed of eight religious and secular building complexes, houses a selection of fresco cycles painted between 1302 and 1397. While the fresco cycles were painted by different artists for different types of patrons, they maintain a unity of style and content.“As a group, these fresco cycles illustrate how, over the course of a century, fresco art developed along a new creative impetus and understanding of spatial representation,” said Unesco.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-sites-in-saudi-arabia-europe-inscribed-on-unesco-s-world-heritage-list-101627142186418.html

Emirates said in a statement that any passenger who has been to these four Asian countries in the last 14 days will not be allowed to travel from anywhere to the UAE."UAE Nationals, holders of UAE Golden Visas and members of diplomatic missions who comply with updated COVID‑19 protocols, are exempt and may be accepted for travel," the Dubai-based airline said.Earlier this week, the UAE extended the ban on international flights from the four countries amid concerns over coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases largely driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. The UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority had suspended inbound flights from India to Dubai on April 24 in the wake of the deadly second wave of Covid-19."If your flight has been cancelled or impacted by route suspensions due to COVID‑19 restrictions, you don’t need to call us immediately for rebooking. You can simply hold on to your Emirates ticket and when flights resume, get in touch with us or your booking office to make new travel plans," said Emirates.The highest number of expatriates in the UAE are from India, followed by Pakistan and Bangladesh, making the aviation industry of the Gulf nation heavily dependent on visitors from these Asian countries. But the spread of deadly variants of concern prompted the UAE to suspend international flights as a precautionary measure. While the number of Covid-19 cases in India has declined in recent days, authorities around the world are still concerned about the spread of the Delta variant that could jeopardise the pandemic response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emirates-extends-flight-suspension-to-uae-from-india-pak-two-other-countries-101627137139982.html

The report also said that the group has now strengthened its positions ‘in and around’ Kabul from where it conducts attacks against minorities, activists, government employees and personnel of the Afghan National Defence and security personnel.'Afghanistan situation dangerous': Indian embassy in advisory for its nationalsThe report points out that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan has moved into other provinces and have formed sleeper cells in Nuristan, Badghis, Sari Pul, Baghlan, Badakhshan, Kunduz and Kabul. The sleeper cells were formed despite territorial, leadership, manpower and financial losses during 2020 in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces.Afghan mission will end on August 31: Joe BidenThe report highlighted that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) prioritised efforts to resurge and started recruiting and training new supporters. “Its leaders also hope to attract intransigent Taliban and other militants who reject the Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the United States of America and the Taliban and to recruit fighters from the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq and other conflict zones,” it said.US pledges $100 million in emergency aid for Afghan refugeesEstimates of the strength of ISIL-K range widely as one member state reported 500-1,500 fighters while another unit said it could rise to as many as 10,000 over the medium term. Another member state of the UN said that ISIL-K continues to be ‘underground and clandestine’. The report said Shahab al-Muhajir cooperates with Sheikh Tamim, who heads the al-Sadiq office. Tamim’s office is tasked with building networks to connect ISIL-K with ISIL presences in the wider region.Threat from the Al-QaedaAl-Qaeda continues to maintain its presence in at least 15 Afghan provinces, primarily in the eastern, southern and south-eastern regions, according to the Monitoring Team as reported in the 12th report to the Security Council Committee in June. The AQIS or Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent continues to operate under Taliban protection in Kandahar, Helmand and Nimruz provinces in Afghanistan. The report said that the AQIS is now led by Osama Mahmood, who is still unlisted. The AQIS consists of Afghan and Pakistani nationals but Indians, Bangladeshis and Myanmarese have also joined its ranks.Taliban offers peace deal, in exchange asks for Afghan President to be removedIt also said that Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri’s status remains unknown and he is suspected to be ‘alive but ailing’ in Afghanistan. The Al-Qaeda earlier this year tried to showcase al-Zawahiri in a video where he is seen threatening Myanmar but member states believe that dated footage was used which further adds to the ‘rumours of his decline or demise’. The report suggests that Al-Qaeda has suffered even more severe leadership attrition.The member states reported that Zawahiri’s successor could be Mohammed Salahaldin Abd El Halim Zidane aka Sayf-Al Adl. Al Adl is currently located in Iran, according to the report.As Taliban advances, Afghan military overhauls war strategy to limit losses“Sayf- Al Adl, his most likely successor, is reported to remain in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Member States differ as to what Al Adl’s options would be if he was called upon to succeed al-Zawahiri, but most assess that he would have to move and that basing himself in Afghanistan might not be an option,” the report said.Nearly 500,000 killed in a decade of Syria war: ReportSince the Taliban is committed to suppressing any international terrorist threat due to the agreements in the peace deal, the leadership succession process within Al-Qaeda remains complicated. Some member states cast doubt that Al Adl may not be travelling to Afghanistan to assume his role but might choose to base himself in Africa. The report highlighted that the ISIL and Al-Qaeda affiliates still continue to operate in central, south and southeast Asia notwithstanding key leadership losses in some cases and sustained pressure from security forces.Taliban tightens grip over Afghanistan; levies high taxes, recruits forcefullyPakistan’s Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) also is rising as a threat in the region and has led to a rise in cross-border attacks after the unification of splinter groups.

24-07-2021||World||US makes it harder for Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson to be called astronaut||When billionaires Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson went to space in their private suborbital flights earlier this month, the space tourists were called commercial astronauts by many. But the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has tightened its definition of the word “astronaut”, making it harder for people like Bezos and Branson to be called commercial astronauts.The FAA is the only US agency that awards astronaut wings to passengers on a commercial spacecraft since the Nasa and US military recognises only their employees as astronauts. On Tuesday, the agency published updated guidelines, eligibility, and criteria for the Commercial Space Astronaut Wings program.According to the updated eligibility requirements, space explorers must go through the required training to be certified as an astronaut and fly beyond 80 kilometres above the Earth surface as a flight crew on a permitted launch or reentry vehicle. They also must have “demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety, or contributed to human space flight safety.”The updated guidelines were published the same day Amazon CEO along with three other crew members blasted off his Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket-and-capsule combo and touched down after about 10 minutes of flight. New Shepard was a fully autonomous spacecraft and didn’t have any Blue Origin staff onboard during its maiden human spaceflight.Watch: Jeff Bezos floats in space shuttle, passes Skittles in zero gravity | Blue OriginSince the flight was completely computer-controlled from Earth, Jeff Bezos and other space tourists didn’t contribute to human space flight safety during the flight. This means the four New Shepard passengers wouldn’t qualify for astronaut wings under the new FAA rules. While Branson and other passengers on SpaceShipTwo were designated by Virgin Galactic as crew members testing the spacecraft, it’s not clear whether they “contributed to human space flight safety.”However, founders of Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic could still be awarded honorary astronauts wings if the FAA believes their contribution to commercial human spaceflight “merits special recognition.” The associate administrator for Commercial Space Transportation (AST-1) has complete discretion in bestowing honorary wings for demonstrating “extraordinary contribution or beneficial service to the commercial human space flight industry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-makes-it-harder-for-jeff-bezos-richard-branson-to-be-called-astronaut-101627130334868.html

This technology is rooted in the protection of human rights – including the right to life, security and bodily integrity – and that’s why we have sought alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, to make sure our products are respecting all fundamental human rights," it said which is a stand its executives still maintain.Without confirming, or denying, if the software was sold to India, the company had said that its "products are licensed to government intelligence and law enforcement agencies for the sole purpose of preventing and investigating terror and serious crime"."To protect the ongoing public safety missions of its agency customers and given significant legal and contractual constraints, NSO Group is not able to disclose who is or is not a client or discuss specific uses of its technology," the written statement had said.Amidst the latest controversy, Israel has established a committee to review the allegations of misuse of the NSO group's surveillance software and hinted at a possible "review of the whole matter of giving licences".“The defence establishment appointed a review committee made up of a number of bodies," lawmaker Ram Ben-Barak, the head of Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, told Army Radio on Thursday.“When they finish their review, we’ll demand to see the results and assess whether we need to make corrections," Ben-Barak, who earlier was the former deputy head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, added. Israel’s priority was “to review this whole matter of giving licenses”, he stressed.NSO''s chief executive, Shalev Hulio, welcomed the move, telling Army Radio that he would “be very pleased if there were an investigation so that we’d be able to clear our name”.Hulio claimed that there was an effort “to smear the whole Israeli cyber industry".Ben-Barak noted that Pegasus had helped “expose many terror cells”, but “if it was misused or sold to irresponsible bodies, this is something we need to check".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nso-says-pegasus-helps-millions-to-sleep-well-at-night-walk-safely-on-streets-101627129375628.html

The participants were grouped on the basis of age groups and their blood serum, contained in test tubes, was exposed to the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as to the P.1 variant, which is also called gamma, and was first found in Brazil.The study found that the youngest group (all participants in their 20s) had a nearly seven-fold in antibody response as compared to that in the oldest group (participants between 70 and 82 years of age), prompting the team to conclude that "the younger a participant, the more robust the antibody response."However, Tafesse and the team also stressed that despite the study, Covid-19 vaccines still appear effective enough to prevent infection and severe illnes among people across almost all age groups. "The good news is that our vaccines are really strong," he said.Tafesse further remarked that the research, in fact, highlights the need for everyone to get vaccinated against Covid-19. "Older people aren't entirely safe just because they are vaccinated. The people around them really need to be vaccinated as well," he concluded.(with ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/older-people-have-fewer-antibodies-against-covid-19-study-101627126627871.html
24-07-2021||World||Pak Army deployed at Afghan border to stop conflict from spilling into Pakistan||Pakistan deployed its army personnel at forward positions along the Afghanistan border as Taliban forces continue to capture almost two-thirds of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of US and NATO troops, according to a report by Dawn.Pakistan minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said that Pakistan soldiers have now replaced the Frontier Constabulary (FC), Levies Force and other militias from the frontline positions. US President Joe Biden earlier in June said that the United States will withdraw all its forces from Afghanistan by August 31 this year - a decade after it began a war in Afghanistan in retaliation to the 9/11 attacks.“Regular army troops are manning the border after replacing the paramilitary forces,” Ahmed was quoted as saying by Dawn. He said the decision was taken owing to the volatile situation across the border. He further added that the decision was taken to contain the influx of refugees, armed army personnel and militants from Afghanistan into Pakistan.“Paramilitary troops including the Frontier Constabulary, Levies, Rangers are deployed at the borders to deal with regular issues including illegal border crossing, smuggling. However, the current volatile situation (in Afghanistan) demands that regular military troops be deployed along the border,” Ahmed further added. Pakistan army spokesperson major general Babar Iftikhar said that the move to replace the paramilitary forces will help in preventing the conflict from spilling into Pakistan.People familiar with the developments told Dawn that Pakistan Army faces the challenge of not only stopping the inflow of refugees but also the inflow of Afghan army personnel as well as Taliban fighters. They also said that Pakistan fears that the conflict could spill over to the mainland if Taliban forces enter Pakistan following Afghan army troops due to the strong Taliban presence in areas bordering Pakistan. More than 1,000 Afghan army personnel fled to Tajikistan in July to escape clashes with the Taliban.Pakistan and Afghanistan governments are already at loggerheads after the Taliban took control of Spin Boldak border crossing. The Afghanistan Air Force also wanted to attack Taliban positions from the Pakistani side of the border. The proposal was met with disapproval from Islamabad.“Pakistan does not want to see any such situation when the Afghan air force might use our airspace without permission to attack Taliban and in retaliation the militants attack Pakistani positions creating a new issue,” experts told Dawn. The Pakistan government refrained from commenting on the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan and said that the conflict was an internal matter of Afghanistan and it has taken no sides.“It is time that the Afghan politicians and their military leadership learn to deal with their issues. We do not want to see that Pakistani soil is used in any way or by any side in the Afghan conflict, and we have assured the Afghan leadership of this policy,” Ahmed further added. Pakistan also said that it will not welcome any more refugees from Afghanistan.There are two key border crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan - Chaman in Balochistan and Torkham in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa - along with several other small trading points.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-deployed-at-afghan-border-to-stop-conflict-from-spilling-into-pakistan-101627121706677.html

The two neighbours earlier in the year signed a ceasefire agreement.On a question on Afghanistan, the Acting Assistant Secretary said that the US expects all the countries in the region to have a shared interest in a stable and secure Afghanistan going forward.Secretary of State Tony Blinken is slated to visit India next week during which Afghanistan would be a major topic of discussion.“We will certainly be looking at talking with our Indian partners about how we can work together to realise that goal, to find ways to bring the parties together, and continue to pursue a negotiated settlement to end the longstanding war," Thompson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-and-pakistan-needs-better-compliance-to-resolve-bilateral-issues-says-us-101627121340802.html

In Sydney, protesters were seen uprooting plants and picking bottles from the sidewalks and hurling them at the police, reported Bloomberg. Another crowd was captured on video, chanting “freedom freedom” and marching in the city’s central business district.David Elliott, police and emergency services minister for New South Wales, criticised the protesters, telling reporters that “these are the sort of people who are going to prolong this lockdown”. About 50 people have been arrested so far in Sydney. Rallies also took place in other cities like Melbourne. The actual number of protesters is not yet known but Elliot indicated around 3,500 people participated in the mass protests. “What we saw today were 3,500 very selfish boofheads,” he said.The protest organisers had dubbed the protest a "freedom" rally and publicised it on social media pages associated with vaccine disinformation and conspiracy theories, reported AFP. Resentment has been growing amongst the masses over the Scott Morrison government’s handling of the pandemic. Most of the protestors were seen walking maskless and were carrying signboards with slogans like "Wake up Australia" and "Drain the Swamp".Millions of Australians have been put under lockdown as a combination of the Delta variant and slow vaccine rollouts have been leading to a rise in the number of cases. Australia has administered enough doses for just 21% of its population, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.The country’s vaccination drive has slowed down further after a new advisory recommending the AstraZeneca jab only for those aged 60 and above was released last month. However, faced with mounting rates of infection and supply constraints of the Pfizer shot, the government’s technical advisory group has asked adults in the Sydney area to consider the AstraZeneca shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antilockdown-protesters-hold-freedom-rallies-in-australia-pelt-cops-with-plants-and-bottles-101627122092847.html

I have nothing to add for the moment.”“The visit of high-ranking Pakistani officials holds significance after a tragic incident in Upper Kohistan. Nine Chinese nationals working on the Dasu hydropower project were killed when a bus transporting them to the construction site met with an accident,” Pakistan’s Geo News said in a report on Friday.Islamabad has blamed hostile forces behind the bus explosion, which according to them, was carried out to create misunderstandings between Pakistan and China, the Geo News report claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remains-of-9-chinese-nationals-killed-in-pak-bus-explosion-returned-to-china-101627106413360.html

"The press reports of 18th July 2021 also appear to be an attempt to malign the Indian democracy and its well-established institutions," Vaishnaw said in Parliament.India, the minister said, has an "established protocol when it comes to surveillance... any form of illegal surveillance is not possible with the checks and balances in our laws and our robust institutions."Minister of state for external affairs Meenakshi Lekhi on Thursday said that the story on the alleged snooping through Israeli spyware Pegasus is "concocted, fabricated and evidence-less" and that the news reports based on it call for "defamation".When asked about the Pegasus snooping case in India, Thompson said:"We – I don't have any particular special insights into the India case.""I know this is a broader issue, but I will say that we've been, I think, quite vocal about trying to find ways for companies to be able to ensure that their technology is not used in these types of ways. And we will certainly continue to press those issues," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spy-technology-against-society-journalists-always-concerning-us-on-pegasus-101627103278443.html

24-07-2021||World||Do not set new global climate benchmarks, says Yadav at G20 meet||Union environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, said the world “should not be shifting goalposts and setting new benchmarks for global climate ambition” at the G20 Energy and Climate joint ministerial on Friday, referring to diplomatic pressure to announce a net zero emissions target by mid-century.In a session on ‘Paris Aligned Financial Flow’ at the ongoing G20 summit, India made an intervention stating that “the momentum of climate action can only be accelerated when there is enough support through means of implementation including finance and technology.” “We should not be shifting goalposts and setting new benchmarks for global climate ambition,” Yadav said at the summit according to a statement issued by the environment ministry on Friday.The United Nations is pushing for a global coalition committed to net zero emissions by 2050 which will cover all countries, Antonio Guterres, United Nations Secretary General had said in April ahead of Virtual Leaders’ Summit on Climate convened by the US.He also called on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to phase out coal by 2030, and 2040 elsewhere.Prime Minister, Narendra Modi announced the launch of India-US Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 at the Leaders Summit on Climate. While not making any changes or upgrades to its commitments under the Paris Agreement, PM Modi underlined that India was already doing its part and that India’s per capita carbon emissions are 60% lower than the global average.Yadav maintained the same position and said there is a need to cut absolute emissions rapidly while taking into account the Paris Agreement which emphasised on respective historical responsibilities, delivery of promised climate finance and technologies at low cost keeping in perspective per capita emissions, differences in per capita GDP and the unfinished agenda for sustainable development.“India remains steadfast in its commitments to join and lead efforts to combat climate change within the multilaterally agreed convention and its Paris Agreement,” the environment ministry said in a statement adding that India has exhibited exemplary resolve by achieving its pre 2020 voluntary commitment of reducing emission intensity.“The issue of climate finance takes a critical shape as we accelerate the implementation of nationally determined contributions towards achieving goals of the Paris Agreement , and are severely affected by the social and economic impacts of the COVD pandemic. India has exhibited resolve through its pre-2020 climate commitments by achieving a 24% reduction in emissions, against our voluntary commitment of 20-25% by 2020,” Yadav said in his intervention.He also made it clear that India will accelerate action on climate change only when there is enough support from developed countries on finance and technology.“We will continue to focus on the implementation of our ambitious plans through concrete actions domestically as well as globally through international collaboration such as the International Solar Alliance, Coalition of Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, etc. The momentum of climate action can only be accelerated when there is enough support through means of implementation including finance and technology,” he said.“For the G20 to take leadership in achieving the Paris goals as a block, the developed country members of the G20 have to take leadership in fulfilling the commitment of USD100 billion per year target. We have taken note of the recent finance support announcements of some G20 developed countries. However, a lack of action and ambition in delivering climate finance is impeding ambitious climate actions," India said highlighting that the current scale, scope, and speed of climate finance actions of G20 developed country members were not matching the expectations towards meeting the commitments.India made it clear that initiation of work on long-term finance by developed countries will provide a clear signal for developing country members of G20 to make bolder decisions and develop long-term strategies in curbing climate change.49 parties to the Paris Agreement representing 60 countries and 54.1% of global GHG emissions, have so far communicated a net-zero target according to Climate Watch.India reduced support to the fossil fuel industry by 4% from 2015 to 2019 even as the countries in the G20 forum of the world’s major economies are not walking the talk in addressing the climate crisis, a new BloombergNEF report released on Tuesday said. The G20 countries provided $636 billion in direct support for fossil fuels in 2019, which is just 10 less than that in 2015, it added.The report by BloombergNEF, a global research organisation, noted India has reduced the support, but it has 66 coal power plants in the pipeline. India is second only to China, which has 247 coal power plants in the making among G20 countries while Indonesia has 33.Most G20 countries have announced ambitious climate targets to reach the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5-degree C compared to pre-industrial levels. But the report said they provided $3.3 trillion support for coal, oil, gas, and fossil-fuel power between 2015 and 2019. It added the sum could have funded 4,232GW new solar power plants or over 3.5 times the size of the current US electricity grid."India’s disappointment with the shortfall in climate finance is understandable. Recent emphasis on net zero targets to stay within 1.5 deg C warming may also feel like shifting of negotiating goalposts. But recent extreme events have shown that even small degrees of average global warming can lead to dangerous heat waves, floods, and cyclones. For India, scaling up renewable energy and nature-based solutions can bring new jobs and better health, but much depends on clean technology partnerships for industrial production," said Ulka Kelkar, director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute, India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/do-not-set-new-global-climate-benchmarks-says-yadav-at-g20-meet-101627072404772.html
24-07-2021||World||Vaccinated people make up 75% of recent Covid-19 cases in Singapore||Vaccinated individuals accounted for three-quarters of Singapore's COVID-19 infections in the last four weeks, but they were not falling seriously ill, government data showed, as a rapid ramp-up in inoculations leaves fewer people unvaccinated.While the data shows that vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe cases, it also underscores the risk that even those inoculated could be contagious, so that inoculation alone may not suffice to halt transmission.Of Singapore's 1,096 locally transmitted infections in the last 28 days, 484, or about 44%, were in fully vaccinated people, while 30% were partially vaccinated and just over 25% were unvaccinated, Thursday's data showed.While seven cases of serious illness required oxygen, and another was in critical condition in intensive care, none of the eight had been fully vaccinated, the health ministry said."There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent serious disease when one gets infected," the ministry said, adding that all the fully vaccinated and infected people had shown no symptoms, or only mild ones.Infections in vaccinated people do not mean vaccines are ineffective, experts said."As more and more people are vaccinated in Singapore, we will see more infections happening among vaccinated people," Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore (NUS)."It is important to always compare it against the proportion of people who remain unvaccinated...Suppose Singapore achieves a rate of 100% fully vaccinated...then all infections will stem from the vaccinated people and none from the unvaccinated."Singapore has already inoculated nearly 75% of its 5.7 million people, the world's second highest after the United Arab Emirates, a Reuters tracker shows, and half its population is fully vaccinated.As countries with advanced vaccination campaigns prepare to live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease, their focus is turning to preventing death and serious diseases through vaccination.But they are grappling with how to differentiate public health policies, such as mask wearing, between the vaccinated and those who are not.Both Singapore and Israel, for example, reinstated some curbs recently to battle a surge in infections driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, while England lifted almost all restrictions this week, despite high caseloads."We've got to accept that all of us will have to have some restrictions, vaccinated or not vaccinated," said Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Canberra Hospital in the Australian capital."It's just the restrictions are likely to be higher for those unvaccinated than vaccinated people, but that may still mean they have mask mandates indoors, for instance."The Singapore data also showed that infections in the last 14 days among vaccinated people older than 61 stood at about 88%, higher than the figure of just over 70% for the younger group.Linfa Wang, a professor at Duke-NUS Medical School, said elderly people had been shown to have weaker immune responses upon vaccination.In Israel, which also has a high vaccination rate, about half of the 46 patients hospitalised in severe condition by early July had been vaccinated, and the majority were from risk groups, authorities said.It was not immediately clear if the Singapore data reflected reduced protection offered by vaccines against the Delta variant, the most common form in the wealthy city state in recent months.Two doses of vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca are nearly as effective against Delta as against the previously dominant Alpha variant, according to a study published this week.Singapore uses the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in its national vaccination programme.Friday's 130 new locally-transmitted infections were off this week's 11-month high. The recent rise in cases prompted authorities to tighten curbs on social gatherings in the push to boost vaccinations, particularly among the elderly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-people-make-up-75-of-recent-covid-19-cases-in-singapore-101627069953748.html
24-07-2021||World||Search for bodies concludes at Florida condo collapse site||Firefighters on Friday declared the end of their search for bodies at the site of a collapsed Florida condo building, concluding a month of painstaking work removing layers of dangerous debris that were once piled several stories high.The June 24 collapse at the oceanside tower killed 97 people, with at least one more missing person yet to be identified. The site has been mostly swept flat and the rubble moved to a Miami warehouse. Although forensic scientists are still at work, including examining the debris at the warehouse, there are no more bodies to be found where the building once stood.Except during the early hours after the collapse, survivors never emerged. Search teams spent weeks battling the hazards of the rubble, including an unstable portion of the building that teetered above, a recurring fire and Florida’s stifling summer heat and thunderstorms. They went through more than 14,000 tons (13,000 metric tonnes) of broken concrete and rebar, often working boulder by bounder, rock by rock, before finally declaring the mission complete.Miami-Dade Fire Rescue’s urban search-and-rescue team pulled away from the disaster site Friday in a convoy of firetrucks and other vehicles, slowly driving to their headquarters for a news conference to announce that the search was officially over.At a ceremony, Fire Chief Alan Cominsky saluted the firefighters who worked 12-hour shifts while camping out at the site.“It’s obviously devastating. It’s obviously a difficult situation across the board,” Cominsky said. “I couldn’t be prouder of the men and women that represent Miami-Dade Fire Rescue.”Officials have declined to clarify whether they have one additional set of human remains in hand that pathologists are struggling to identify or whether a search for that final set of remains continues.If found, Estelle Hedaya would bring the death toll to 98.Hedaya was an outgoing 54-year-old who loved to travel and was fond of striking up conversations with strangers. Her younger brother Ikey has given DNA samples and visited the site twice to see the search efforts for himself.“As we enter month two alone, without any other families, we feel helpless,” he told The Associated Press on Friday. He said he gets frequent updates from the medical examiner’s office.Leah Sutton, who knew Hedaya since birth and considered herself a second mother to her, is worried that she will be forgotten.“They seem to be packing up and congratulating everyone on a job well done. And yes, they deserve all the accolades, but after they find Estelle.”The collapse also fueled a race to inspect other aging residential towers in Florida and beyond, and it raised broader questions about the nation’s regulations governing condominium associations and building safety.Shortly after the collapse, it became clear that warnings about Champlain Towers South, which opened in 1981, had gone unheeded. A 2018 engineering report detailed cracked and degraded concrete support beams in the underground parking garage and other problems that would cost nearly $10 million to fix.The repairs did not happen, and the estimate grew to $15 million this year as the owners of the building’s 136 units and its governing condo board squabbled over the cost, especially after a Surfside town inspector told them the building was safe.A complete collapse was all but impossible to imagine. As many officials said in the catastrophe’s first days, buildings of that size do not just collapse in the U.S. outside of a terrorist attack. Even tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes rarely bring them down.The disaster was one of the nation’s deadliest engineering failures. A set of overhead walkways collapsed at a Kansas City hotel in 1981, killing 114 people attending a dance. But that wasn’t the structure itself. A Washington, D.C., movie theater collapsed in 1922, killing 98. But that came after a blizzard dumped feet of snow on the flat roof.In the weeks after the collapse, a 28-story courthouse in downtown Miami, built in 1928, and two apartment buildings were closed after inspectors uncovered structural problems. They will remain shut until repairs are made.The first calls to 911 came at about 1:20 a.m., when Champlain residents reported that the parking garage had collapsed. A woman standing on her balcony called her husband, who was on a business trip, and said the swimming pool had fallen into the garage.Then, in an instant, a section of the L-shaped building fell straight down. Eight seconds later, another section followed, leaving 35 people alive in the standing portion. In the initial hours, a teen was rescued, and firefighters believed others might be found alive. They took hope from noises emanating from inside the pile that might have been survivors tapping, but in retrospect the sounds came from shifting debris.Rescue crews worked tirelessly, even when smoke and heat from a fire inside the building’s standing portion hampered their efforts. They persisted when the temperatures pushed into the upper 90s (35 Celsius) under the blazing sun, some toiling until they needed IVs to replenish fluids. They carried on when Tropical Storm Elsa passed nearby and dumped torrential rain. They left the pile only when lightning developed.The portion of the building that remained standing posed another grave threat as it loomed precariously above the workers. Authorities ordered it demolished on July 4.In the end, crews found no evidence that anyone who was found dead had survived the initial collapse, Cominsky said.The dead included members of the area’s large Orthodox Jewish community, the sister of Paraguay’s first lady, her family and their nanny, as well as a local salesman, his wife and their two young daughters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-for-bodies-concludes-at-florida-condo-collapse-site-101627069588754.html

One, VTimes, shut down last month, saying it lost advertisers and other business partners after the designation.The five individuals added to the list on Friday were from various outlets and included Mikhail Rubin, deputy editor of Proekt, an investigative news outlet that was declared "undesirable" on national security grounds last week.President Vladimir Putin's opponents see the moves against the media as part of a crackdown on the opposition before a parliamentary election in September. Denying a crackdown is underway, the Kremlin has described Russia's media market as vibrant, with many different outlets to choose from.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-declares-media-outlet-the-insider-a-foreign-agent-101627069207561.html

All you need to know||US health officials on Thursday reported cases of untreatable fungus in two Dallas-area hospitals and a nursing home in Washington DC. Candida auris, a harmful form of yeast, is considered dangerous to hospital and nursing home patients with serious medical problems as it can cause bloodstream infection and even death.CDC’s Meghan Ryan said they are witnessing “clustering of resistance” for the first time in which patients seemed to be contracting infections from each other. A cluster of 101 Candida auris cases detected at the Washington DC nursing home included three cases that were resistant to all three kinds of antifungal medications.A cluster of 22 Candida auris cases in two Dallas-area hospitals included two with that level of multidrug resistance. The CDC has concluded that the infections were spread from patient to patient, unlike in 2019 when scientists concluded that the resistance to the drugs in three patients in New York formed during treatment.Also Read | Candida auris: Mysterious fungus that infected Covid-19 patients at US hospitalWhy is Candida auris a serious health threat?According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than one in three patients with invasive Candida auris infection die. The US health agency has termed the emerging fungus as a serious global health threat.The CDC is concerned about the “superbug” because it is often multidrug-resistant, which means it is resistant to multiple antifungal drugs used to treat the infection. The difficulty to identify the infection using standard laboratory methods compounds the problem since misidentification may lead to wrong treatment.How to identify a Candida auris infection?Most people with serious Candida infections have underlying health conditions so it becomes more difficult to know if one has a Candida auris infection.

It has been reported that the unexplained phenomenon has caused sickness and even brain damage in US diplomats and intelligence officials in Cuba, China, Russia and some other countries.Burns, tapped by US President Joe Biden as the first career diplomat to serve as CIA chief, said in a National Public Radio interview that he has bolstered his agency’s efforts to determine the cause of the syndrome.He said among other steps, he tapped an officer who once led the hunt for Osama bin Laden to head a task force investigating the syndrome, and said he tripled the size of the medical team involved in the probe.The agency has shortened from eight weeks to two weeks the time that CIA-affiliated people must wait for admission to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, he added.“It’s a profound obligation I think of any leader to take care of your people and that is what I am determined to do,” Burns said. He said a US National Academy of Sciences panel in December found that a plausible theory is that “directed energy” beams caused the syndrome. There is a “very strong possibility” that the syndrome is intentionally caused, and that Russia could be responsible, he speculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/havana-syndrome-sickened-100-cia-officers-says-chief-101627065070527.html
