Earlier this week Taliban fighters entered the capital of the western province of Badghis, seizing police and security facilities and attempting to take over the governor's office before special forces pushed them back.Insurgents have made a fresh push to gain territory in recent weeks, emboldened by the departure of foreign forces. The Pentagon believes that after taking dozens of district centres, the Taliban will make a push for provincial centres.In southern Afghanistan, too, clashes continued.India said on Sunday it had temporarily repatriated officials from its consulate in Kandahar, a major city in southern Afghanistan."Due to the intense fighting near Kandahar city, India-based personnel have been brought back for the time being," Arindam Bagchi, chief spokesperson at India's foreign ministry, said in a statement."India is closely monitoring the evolving security situation in Afghanistan," Bagchi said, adding that India's consulate in Kandahar was being run by local staff temporarily.Taliban officials said on Friday that the Sunni Muslim insurgent group had taken control of 85% of Afghanistan's territory. Afghan government officials dismissed the assertion as propaganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-forces-repel-taliban-assault-on-provincial-capital-says-governor-101626024964794.html

Bandla was to evaluate the human-tended research experience, the company had said in a pre-flight announcement, using an experiment from the University of Florida that requires several hand-held fixation tubes that will be activated at various points in the flight profile.Aircraft VMS (Virgin Mother Ship) Eve took off from a runway in New Mexico at around 10.40 am (US eastern time) carrying spacecraft VSS (Virgin Spaceship) Unity underneath. The mother ship was to release the spaceship at an altitude of 40,000 feet. VSS Unity was to fire its engines for a climb powered at three times the sound of sound, before returning for a glide down to the runway.Branson’s flight into space has raised some questions about if he actually did cross over the barrier where space begins. The flight took him roughly 55 miles above sea-level (88.5km), whereas space is said to actually begin at around 62 miles (100km).Blue Origin, which plans to send its billionaire founder Jeff Bezos and his brother into space nine days from now, made that point about Branson’s flight two days ago. “We wish him a great and safe flight, but they’re not flying above the Karman line and it’s a very different experience,” Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith told The New York Times.The Karman line is an imaginary line that separates Earth from space and is about 62 miles above (100km) above sea level, which is where Bezos is headed. “From the beginning, New Shepard (the Blue Origin flight) was designed to fly above the Karman line so none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name. For 96% of the world’s population, space begins 100km up at the internationally recognised Karman line,” they added in a tweet, adding, “Only 4% of the world recognises a lower limit of 80km or 50 miles as the beginning of space. New Shepard flies above both boundaries. One of the many benefits of flying with Blue Origin flight.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experience-of-a-lifetime-says-branson-on-his-maiden-space-flight-101626024458589.html

11-07-2021||World||Sydney may extend Covid lockdown after 1 death due to Delta variant||As cases rise across Australia, the New South Wales government on Sunday said it may not lift the lockdown next Friday. The local government asked people to venture out only when it is ‘absolutely necessary’ to break the chain of transmission after Australia reported 77 new cases, its highest this year, according to news agency Reuters.The Australian government, which is battling an outbreak of the Delta variant, fared better than most developed nations with relatively low Covid-19 cases and deaths so far. The country reported 31,000 cases since the start of the pandemic and 911 deaths. However, the New South Wales government’s strong response comes after the nation reported its first locally contracted Covid-19 death. New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian said it is unlikely that the lockdown will be lifted on July 16, adding that she will be shocked if the number of cases does not rise to 100 by Monday.Following Sunday’s record, it is likely that the three-week lockdown of more than 5 million people in Sydney and its surrounding areas will be extended. “Given where we're at and given the lockdown was supposed to be lifted on Friday, everybody can tell it's highly unlikely at this stage,” Berejiklian was quoted as saying. The recent outbreak in Sydney has infected 566 people of whom 52 people are hospitalised with 15 of them in intensive care while five require ventilation.The neighbouring state of Victoria has closed its borders with New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory in a bid to break the chain of transmission. Victoria did not report any case in the last 11 days.The recent outbreak of the Delta variant and the subsequent lockdown have led to fears regarding the economy. AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver, while speaking to Bloomberg, said the closure of the city will cost the economy A$ 1 billion. Oliver also said the lockdown may lead to ‘more government lockdown assistance’ for the economy.The outbreak also indicates that plans for an Australian-Singapore travel bubble could be delayed until the end of 2021, Australia’s trade minister Dan Tehan told the Sydney Morning Herald. He said the plan has been pushed back ‘due to the third wave of the virus’.Vaccination driveThe vaccination rollout in Australia has remained slow due to supply constraints and changing medical advisories on the AstraZeneca vaccine. The health authorities said that 11 people hospitalised in Sydney are below 35 years of age and three quarters of these patients did not receive a single dose of the vaccine. Australia is vaccinating people over 40 and groups at risk due to their health conditions and people who can be exposed to Covid-19 while working. Australia has vaccinated 26% of its 26 million people with the first dose of the vaccine, according to news agency Bloomberg.(With inputs from Bloomberg, Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-may-extend-covid-lockdown-after-1-death-due-to-delta-variant-101626004602916.html
11-07-2021||World||Pakistan braces for fourth Covid wave as fresh infections witness three-fold rise||Pakistan is bracing for what has been described as the country’s fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, with the number of fresh daily Covid-19 cases registering a three-fold rise over the corresponding figures from just three weeks ago.The country’s ministry of national health services on Sunday put the number of those who tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 24 hours at 1,980, while the number of those who succumbed to the viral disease in the same duration was recorded at 27. In contrast, three weeks ago, on June 21, the new daily caseload stood at just 663. In another concerning development, the positivity rate crossed 4 per cent for the first time since May 31 when it was at 4.05 per cent.According to the health ministry, Pakistan’s confirmed tally of Covid-19 infections has reached 9,73,824 of which 22,582 cases have resulted in deaths. The official data also shows that 9,13,203 people have recovered from the infection, while more than 2,100 people are still in a critical condition.Health experts have attributed this sudden uptick in cases to the reopening of the business and tourism sectors and have urged the government to announce a lockdown so that the festival of Eid al-Adha can be observed in accordance with pandemic-related restrictions. The government has also come under fire for holding board examinations of secondary and higher secondary students, despite warnings from Opposition parties, and protests by students. Going ahead with the examinations, health experts have warned, could lead to a further spike in fresh daily infections.However, according to reports, the Pakistan government is banking on its vaccination drive to prevent any further surge in Covid-19 cases. The government says it has administered more than 19 million doses of anti-Covid vaccines and has been urging people to get themselves inoculated at the earliest.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-braces-for-fourth-covid-wave-as-fresh-infections-witness-three-fold-rise-101626002461560.html

This means the Victorian border is effectively closed to New South Wales and the ACT," the Department of Health said in a statement on Facebook.Starting at midnight, people residing in NSW and ACT will not be allowed to enter Victoria, with some exceptions. Victoria residents will be allowed to enter the state if they have a valid permit. Those allowed to return to Victoria from red zones are required to get tested and immediately quarantined for 14 days. People attempting to enter Victoria with no permit will be fined a sum of AU$4,957 (US$3,710) and made to quarantine until they can be sent back.In the past 24 hours, NSW saw 77 locally acquired new cases of Covid-19 and five from overseas. The state has a total of 514 active cases. In comparison, Victoria has no new acquired cases.Australia began its vaccination campaign in February, but delays of vaccine deliveries and concerns about AstraZeneca side effects slowed down its rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-victoria-to-close-borders-with-neighbouring-states-amid-covid-surge-101625998827347.html
11-07-2021||World||Saudi sets upper limit for subsidy cuts with gasoline price ceiling||Saudi Arabia’s government set an upper limit for the domestic cost of gasoline, a rare move to soften the impact of higher living costs on citizens.The decision, which represents a step back from unpopular subsidy cuts, comes just days after the International Monetary Fund urged officials to reduce subsidies even further.The ceiling for gasoline prices will be set at June’s levels, or 2.18 riyals (58 cents) per liter of 91 octane, as of Saturday, according to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. The decision was made to “decrease the burden of living costs on citizens and residents” and “support local economic activity,” a state committee for amending energy prices said in the statement.The change will alleviate the pain of subsidy reforms introduced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and is a nod to complaints from Saudis about the rising cost of living under his economic diversification program. Inflation in the world’s largest oil exporter stood at 5.7% in May -- the latest figure available -- driven by higher food and vehicle prices as well as a move to triple the value-added tax last year. Even as the IMF urged Saudi Arabia to “press ahead” with subsidy cuts in a statement on Thursday, it simultaneously called for “enhancing the social safety net” to help low-income households.Saudi officials have closely monitored discontent as Prince Mohammed’s plan was rolled out over the past five years, and have occasionally reversed or eased changes that drew vocal grumbling as the kingdom’s social contract is reshaped. Because Saudi Arabia’s July gasoline prices had already risen above June’s levels, the price cap immediately brought the cost of 91 octane gasoline down by about 10 halalas (3 cents) per liter.Local gasoline prices are among the lowest in the world -- around two-thirds that in the U.S. But they’ve drawn particular ire as they’ve risen since 2015, when the subsidy reform was introduced to promote more efficient consumption and help plug a budget deficit brought on by plunging oil prices. Today, some Saudis believe that increasing oil prices should actually lead to lower costs at the gas pump because of the boost they provide to government finances.Last week, crude prices jumped briefly to the highest in more than six years in New York after a bitter fight between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates plunged OPEC+ into a crisis and blocked a supply increase. Crude’s surge, combined with a rally in other commodities, has central banks fretting about inflation again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-sets-upper-limit-for-subsidy-cuts-with-gasoline-price-ceiling-101625997348481.html

11-07-2021||World||Myanmar faces huge spike in daily Covid-19 cases, oxygen supply crisis||Myanmar, which has been under a military coup since February this year, is grappling with a massive increase in cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since mid-May. According to the health ministry, Myanmar has reported 188,752 cases and 3,756 deaths till now. On Saturday, the country saw another record high of 4,377 new cases, while 71 people succumbed to the virus. However, health experts have said the actual count is much higher than the official figures due to a significant drop in testing.A shortage of oxygen supplies to treat critical patients of the viral disease coupled with an increased spread of the Delta variant and lack of vaccine doses has added to the rebellion-hit nation’s poor response towards combating the pandemic.Yangon and Mandalay, the country’s two big cities are finding it difficult to procure oxygen supplies on time. Speaking to news agency Associated Press, Soe Win, a resident of Yangon, said he had to wait in line for hours to secure oxygen for his grandmother, suffering from Covid-19. “I have been waiting since 5 in the morning until 12 noon but I’m still in line. Oxygen is scarcer than money,” Win added.Last week, photos emerged of people waiting in queues to buy the life-saving gas in the Kalay city, located in the north-western Sagaing region.To deal with the crisis, Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on Friday ordered oxygen plants to operate at full capacity along with conversion of industrial oxygen for treating infected patients. Investment and foreign trade minister Aung Naing Oo, meanwhile, said on Saturday the government is dropping all duties and licensing requirements for importing oxygen concentrators.Before February’s military coup, Myanmar, under the leadership of Suu Kyi, had weathered its second surge of the pandemic beginning August 2020 by severely restricting travel, sealing off Yangon city and curbing poll campaigning in Covid-19 hotspots where lockdowns were in place, according to AP.Suu Kyi had often appeared on television and advised the public on how to deal with the overall Covid-19 situation.However, she was ousted in February, leading to widespread protests which were mostly violent. Medical workers, who are at the forefront of combating the pandemic, spearheaded a popular civil disobedience movement that called on professionals and civil servants to not cooperate with the junta, AP reported.Military hospitals, which continued to provide treatment, were shunned by a majority of the population. Doctors and nurses, who boycotted the Junta system, started running makeshift clinics, following which they were arrested.“Under Suu Kyi, the government and volunteers worked together to control the disease, but it is difficult to predict what the future holds under military rule,” Zeyar Tun, founder of the civic action group Clean Yangon, told AP.Meanwhile, all schools in Myanmar have been closed for two weeks and stay-at-home orders have been issued for badly hit neighbourhoods in cities. The government is in talks with Russia and China to secure vaccine doses on an urgent basis.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-faces-huge-spike-in-daily-covid-19-cases-oxygen-supply-crisis-101625989015209.html

11-07-2021||World||Sputnik V gives 90% protection against Delta strain of Covid-19: Scientist||Viral vector and mRNA vaccines, including Russia's Sputnik V, provide enough protection against the new Delta strain of the coronavirus, Head of the Novosibirsk State University's Laboratory and corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) Sergey Netesov told Sputnik."According to data from the UK, the US and other countries, mRNA and vector vaccines, including our Sputnik V, protect against it [the Delta variant], albeit to a lesser extent, but they do protect against it. They offered 95 per cent protection against the initial strain and now they give 90% protection against the 'delta' variant," Netesov said.He added that the vaccines already developed should be used as they are quite effective.At the end of June, Vladimir Gushchin, the head of the population variability mechanisms laboratory of the Gamaleya research center that developed the Sputnik V vaccine, said that the Russian shots guarantee almost 100 per cent protection against severe and fatal cases of Covid-19 caused by the Delta strain.Russia became the first country in the world to register a vaccine against the coronavirus, dubbed Sputnik V, in August 2020.Sputnik V, also known as Gam-Covid-Vac, uses two different engineered adenoviruses (rAd26 and rAd5 for the first and second doses, respectively) to deliver the genetic code for the spike protein of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) into human cells. Adenoviruses usually cause only mild illness in humans and by opting for two different delivery mechanisms, instead of just using one engineered adenovirus like the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines do, the Russian developers were aiming to increase the efficacy of the vaccine.According to an interim analysis from a trial published in The Lancet medical journal, the Sputnik V vaccine has 91.6 per cent efficacy. Meanwhile, the Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, which developed Sputnik V, and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) have reported that Sputnik V has 97.6 per cent efficacy.Unlike for both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, there have been no reports of rare blood-clotting conditions in people vaccinated with Sputnik V from Russian health authorities or from over 60 countries now using Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sputnik-v-gives-90-protection-against-delta-strain-of-covid-19-scientist-101625983311405.html

11-07-2021||World||Amid corruption worries, Bulgaria votes in second national election in 3 months||Bulgaria votes on Sunday in a snap poll that could further drop approval ratings for ex-prime minister Boyko Borissov's GERB party, after a previous election in April produced a fragmented parliament that failed to form a viable coalition government. The current election rerun could produce similar results as the last time, the latest opinion polls suggest, amid widespread corruption and deficiencies in the rule of law and media freedom in the country.Bulgaria's current caretaker government has made public allegations of widespread corruption during the Borissov regime, claim that has also been repeated by global actors against the NATO and EU member-nation.The anti-corruption campaign of Borissov's opponents was additionally boosted by the sanctions the US Treasury imposed last month against several Bulgarian public officials and business leaders for corruption.Polls suggest a tight race between Borissov's party, which came first in April with over 26% of the vote, and its main rival, the anti-elite There is Such a People, led by popular TV entertainer Slavi Trifonov.The opposition Socialist Party is tipped to rank third, followed by the liberal anti-corruption group Democratic Bulgaria and the ethnic Turkish MRF party.The new center-left alliance 'Stand Up! Mafia Out!' emerged after last year's anti-government protests and is projected to pass the 4% hurdle to enter parliament.According to political analyst Dimitar Ganev, there are few chances for Borissov to return to the office for a fourth term regardless of whether the GERB finishes first in the election because most political groups have rejected the idea of cooperating with the ex-ruling party.The 12,000 polling stations close at 8 pm. There are 6.7 million eligible voters who are electing 240 lawmakers. Preliminary results are expected around midnight Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-corruption-worries-bulgaria-votes-in-second-national-election-in-3-months-101625978492761.html

China, for its part, sees preventing a North Korean collapse as crucial to its security interests and would need to boost ties with North Korea and other traditional allies amid fierce rivalry with the United States, some experts say.Kim said in his message that the bilateral treaty “is displaying its stronger vitality in defending and propelling the socialist cause of the two countries ... now that the hostile forces become more desperate in their challenge and obstructive moves.”Under the 1961 treaty, North Korea and China are committed to offering one another immediate military and other aid in the event of an attack.North Korea-China ties go back to the 1930s, when Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong Un, led Korean guerrillas as they fought alongside Chinese soldiers against Japanese colonizers in northeastern China. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1949, one year before North Korea launched a surprise attack on South Korea and started a three-year war that killed hundreds of thousands of people.China fought alongside North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War, while US-led UN forces supported South Korea. About 28,500 US soldiers are still stationed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea. China doesn’t deploy troops in North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaders-of-north-korea-china-vow-to-strengthen-ties-101625977671566.html

"The mention of Imran Khan's name now only brings to mind how the people were robbed of flour, sugar," she said, reported Geo News.She said all one can recall are "queues for flour and sugar"."The elderly stood in line and they were given a mere 1.5 of sugar. Can 1.5 kg of sugar be enough for a house of 10 to 12 people?" she asked.Maryam's remarks came as she addressed a rally in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Sharda town, reported Geo News.While comparing Khan with former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, she said, "When one thinks of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, one recalls 'motorways' and 'progress'."Further, she said, "no one believes in the selected"; he (PM Imran Khan) "neither has respect at home nor abroad".The PML-N vice president urged the audience to participate robustly with the whole families in the coming July 25 elections.

11-07-2021||World||With Afghan pullout, US ditches 'forever wars'||Joe Biden's pullout from Afghanistan has stunned with its speed, but Washington already decided four years ago that it was fed up with "forever wars" and turned its attention to traditional great power competition with China and Russia.Fighting stateless terror groups like Al-Qaeda and Islamic State consumed the US security establishment, and trillions of dollars, since the September 11, 2001 attacks.Biden predecessor Donald Trump came to office in 2017 promising to quit Afghanistan, calling the war there a "mess" and a "waste."The conflicts there and in Iraq had come to be characterized by unending troop deployments, persistent levels of violence, and no ability to conclusively defeat the enemy.By 2020 Trump had overcome resistance and laid the ground for pullouts, leaving only 2,500 troops in each country by the time he stepped down in January. Biden accepted that trajectory, announcing Thursday that US military involvement in Afghanistan would conclude by August 31."We are ending America's longest war," he said. "The United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies created to respond to a world as it was 20 years ago."- Challenge from Putin and Xi - The 9/11 attacks blindsided the US security establishment, forcing a whole-of-government refocus and the launching of the "War on Terror."The US and NATO allies invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban government, which had protected Al-Qaeda.And then-president George W. Bush took advantage to also invade Iraq to overthrow strongman Saddam Hussein, hoping to remake the Middle East and snuff out a broader threat.The initial assaults largely succeeded quickly, with Al-Qaeda fractured and on the run in Afghanistan, and Saddam deposed and captured in Iraq.But in both cases the United States and allies remained on the ground, hoping to rebuild each country, and unable to pull out without risking a return to the pre-9/11 situation.Then, starting in 2013, US security leaders rebooted their views when new Chinese President Xi Jinping began aggressively expanding his country's military.Seeking to counter and surpass US military strength, China began building armed bases on disputed islets in the South China Sea, added a base in Djibouti and planned other bases around Asia and the Middle East.Meanwhile in 2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin sent forces to seize Ukraine's Crimea and supported an insurgency in eastern Ukraine.Two years later Moscow mustered an aggressive campaign to influence the US presidential elections.During the same period, young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un embarked on an ambitious plan to develop nuclear weapons with missiles that could threaten the United States.Trump's 2017 National Security Strategy confirmed the pivot."China and Russia challenge American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity," it said."They are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence."- New flashpoints: Ukraine and Taiwan - Reminiscent of the Cold War, the reorientation meant a Pentagon push to expand its navy, build stronger long-range bomber and submarine strike forces, and update its nuclear weapons.It has also meant countering the Chinese and Russian challenge in new domains, with the Pentagon establishing both Space Command and Cyber Command.The new priorities took root under Trump, and Biden confirmed them in March in his own national security policy."The distribution of power across the world is changing, creating new threats. China, in particular, has rapidly become more assertive," it said."Both Beijing and Moscow have invested heavily in efforts meant to check US strengths and prevent us from defending our interests and allies around the world."Instead of Afghanistan and Iraq-Syria, Ukraine and Taiwan are the new flashpoints.Both have recently received more and more advanced US weaponry to deter, respectively, Russia and China.The Pentagon created a new office focused on China. US naval vessels regularly sail the waters around Taiwan and in the South China Sea, implicitly challenging China's territorial claims.As for Russia, Biden has sought to strengthen bonds with NATO allies.Over the past week, too, US vessels took part in exercises in the Black Sea where Russian forces were conducting their own manuevers.Counter-terrorism doesn't end with the Afghanistan pullout, the Pentagon stresses.But it is turning more remote-directed -- using air and missile strikes from remote bases and vessels to act in Afghanistan where Al-Qaeda still operates."We are repositioning our resources and adapting our counterterrorism posture to meet the threats where they are now," Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-afghan-pullout-us-ditches-forever-wars-101625973856034.html

She received nursing care at home and hadn’t been vaccinated. Her respiratory symptoms rapidly worsened and she died five days later. When her respiratory samples were tested for variants of concern, both strains were found in two tests. The researchers could not say whether the co-infection played a role in rapid deterioration of her health.Earlier in January, Brazilian scientists reported two cases of Covid-19 co-infection, but the study hasn’t yet been released in a scientific journal. Researchers have also previously found evidence of people becoming infected with multiple strains of influenza.“The global occurrence of this phenomenon is probably underestimated due to limited testing for variants of concern and the lack of a simple way to identify co-infections with whole genome sequencing. Being alert to co-infections remains crucial," said Anne Vankeerberghen, the lead author of the study and a molecular biologist from OLV Hospital in Aalst, Belgium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-dies-after-being-infected-with-2-covid-19-variants-experts-concerned-101625965463462.html

All four Afghan provinces share borders with Pakistan – Kunar and Nangarhar with the erstwhile tribal areas and the other two with Balochistan.Terrorist fighters from other Pakistan-based groups such as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Jamaat-ul-Arhar, Lashkar-e-Islam and al-Badr have also been spotted fighting alongside the Taliban in sizeable numbers, these people said on condition of anonymity.Pakistani terrorists have also been sighted in Ghazni, Khost, Logar, Paktia and Paktika provinces in south and southeast Afghanistan, the people said, citing the latest reports from security agencies. In these regions alone, the number of Pakistani fighters from LeT has been estimated at 7,200, the people added.“LeT men are being hired as advisers, commanders and administrators by the Taliban in several areas,” one of the people cited above said. “There has also been fresh recruitment of fighters in Pakistan by LeT and JeM for fighting in eastern Afghanistan,” the person added.Reports suggest that Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the military chief of the Afghan Taliban and son of late Taliban chief Mullah Mohammad Omar, is working closely with LeT and JeM commanders.Security agencies have also learnt of hundreds of Taliban fighters being trained in LeT camps at Hyderabad, a town in Pakistan’s Punjab province located between Faisalabad and Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The training was done with the support of the Pakistani military, the people said.“The LeT and JeM terrorists are deployed in Afghanistan in groups of about 200, which includes five to eight suicide bombers. There are also reports of Pakistani intelligence officials being embedded with these groups, which is a tactic that was resorted to in the past,” said a second person.The information gathered by the security agencies is largely in line with the findings in the latest report by the UN Security Council’s analytical support and sanctions monitoring team, which was issued in June and said the Afghan Taliban had shown no signs of cutting ties with al-Qaeda and other foreign terrorist groups.“A significant part of the leadership of Al-Qaida resides in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border region, alongside Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent. Large numbers of Al-Qaida fighters and other foreign extremist elements aligned with the Taliban are located in various parts of Afghanistan,” the UN report had said.In mid-2020, the UN sanctions monitoring team had stated in another report that 6,500 Pakistani terrorists were operating in Afghanistan, and JeM and LeT played a key role in bringing foreign fighters into the country.There have been reports that LeT and JeM, both blamed for high-profile attacks in India, have sent hundreds of fighters to Afghanistan since 2019, following increased pressure on Pakistan from organisations such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and Western powers to crack down on terror groups.The Taliban have dramatically expanded their hold on Afghan territory in recent months, leaving the US-backed government in control of little more than 20% of the country, according to data compiled by the Long War Journal, Bloomberg reported on Saturday. The insurgent group now holds 204 of 407 districts, up from 73 at the beginning of May, while the Afghan government only controls 74 currently. The rest are contested.The latest UN sanctions monitoring team’s report cited an unnamed UN member state as reporting that “there is regular communication between the Taliban and Al-Qaida on issues related to the peace process” in Afghanistan. The report further said that al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), which consists primarily of Afghan and Pakistani nationals, “operates under the Taliban umbrella” from Kandahar, Helmand and Nimruz provinces.AQIS is “reported to be such an ‘organic’ or essential part of the insurgency that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to separate it from its Taliban allies”, the report said, adding that the widow of former AQIS leader Asim Umar was among 5,000 Taliban prisoners freed in 2020 as part of the agreement with the US.The Haqqani Network, which has close ties with Pakistan’s military and intelligence, “remains a hub for outreach and cooperation with regional foreign terrorist groups and is the primary liaison between the Taliban and Al-Qaida”, the UN report added.Taliban’s failure to cut ties with foreign terrorists is a clear violation of the agreement the group signed with the US in Doha in February 2020, which paved the way for the drawdown of American forces. Under the pact, the Taliban had made a commitment to take several steps to prevent any group or individual, including al-Qaeda, from using the soil of Afghanistan.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said reports of LeT’s presence in Afghanistan are not new but the group’s involvement in the current violence are worrisome.“The presence of LeT in parts of Afghanistan is not new. But the withdrawal of US troops and expanding control of Taliban since last year have encouraged LeT to increase its presence and activities. Clearly, the group is looking to up its activities after lying low for the past few years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paks-terror-groups-join-taliban-war-india-wary-101625948635708.html
