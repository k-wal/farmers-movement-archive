He said in case of such an event it will allow Japan to help defend the self-ruled island with the United States.“If a major incident happened (over Taiwan), it’s safe to say it would be related to a situation threatening the survival (of Japan). If that is the case, Japan and the US must defend Taiwan together,” Aso was quoted as saying.China didn't take Aso's remarks kindly as Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian called the comments ‘extremely wrong and dangerous’, and also invoked references to China’s colonial past.“China rejects this and has lodged solemn representation with Japanese side. Japan’s militarism once committed deplorable crimes against China. Some Japanese politicians still want to make Taiwan its own which shows their failure to learn lessons from history,” Zhao was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Lijian said that these comments run counter to the ‘One China’ policy.Lijian said that no country should have any doubts regarding China’s will to protect its sovereignty. He said that no one should also underestimate the determination of the Chinese people. “China was no longer what it was in history and we will never allow any country to interfere in the Taiwan question,” Zhao said.Earlier on July 1, Chinese president Xi Jinping while addressing the nation during the centenary celebrations of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) said that ‘reunification of Taiwan with the mainland is a historic mission and an unshakable commitment’.Japanese defence minister Nobuo Kishi said that a comprehensive judgment will be taken based on the situation and information collected if it threatened Japan’s survival and the exercise of collective self-defence was necessary. The Japan Times report also said Tokyo, which maintained a silence on affairs related to Taiwan, recently hardened its stance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-irked-by-japan-deputy-pm-s-comments-on-protecting-taiwan-101625594142818.html
06-07-2021||World||Recipe for even more powerful COVID-19 vaccines found: Report||Scientists have found a recipe for even more effective and powerful vaccines against the coronavirus and its rapidly emerging variants, based on the way human cells activate the immune system in response to COVID-19 infection.Researchers from Boston University and the Broad Institute of Harvard University in the US noted that it is the first real look at exactly what types of “red flags” the human body uses to enlist the help of T cells sent out by the immune system to destroy infected cells.Until now, COVID-19 vaccines have been focused on activating a different type of immune cell, B cells, which are responsible for creating antibodies.The researchers noted that developing vaccines to activate the other arm of the immune system -- the T cells -- could dramatically increase immunity against coronavirus, and importantly, its variants.The findings, published in the journal Cell, suggest that current vaccines might lack some important bits of viral material capable of triggering a holistic immune response in the human body.The researchers performed experiments on human cells infected with coronavirus, isolating and identifying those missing pieces of SARS-CoV-2 proteins inside the lab.Based on the new information, "companies should reevaluate their vaccine designs," said Mohsan Saeed, a virologist at Boston University, and co-corresponding author of the research paper.The team, including computational geneticists Pardis Sabeti and Shira Weingarten-Gabbay, hoped to identify fragments of SARS-CoV-2 that activate the immune system’s T cells.From the start of COVID pandemic, scientists have known the identity of 29 proteins produced by SARS-CoV-2 virus in infected cells -- viral fragments that now make up the spike protein in some coronavirus vaccines, such as the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson preventives.Spike protein helps the virus to enter and infect the human cells.Later, scientists discovered another 23 proteins hidden inside the virus’ genetic sequence.However, the function of these additional proteins has been a mystery until now.The latest findings reveal that 25 per cent of the viral protein fragments that trigger the human immune system to attack a virus come from these hidden viral proteins."It is quite remarkable that such a strong immune signature of the virus is coming from regions (of the virus’ genetic sequence) that we were blind to," said Weingarten-Gabby, the paper’s lead author."Our discovery … can assist in the development of new vaccines that will mimic more accurately the response of our immune system to the virus,” Sabeti added.T cells not only destroy infected cells but also memorise the virus’ flags so that they can launch an attack, stronger and faster, the next time the same or a different variant of the virus appears, the researchers said.That, they said, is a crucial advantage, because the coronavirus appears to delay the cell's ability to call in immune help.The researchers said a new vaccine recipe, incorporating some of the newly discovered internal proteins making up the SARS-CoV-2 virus, would be effective in stimulating an immune response capable of tackling the newly emerging coronavirus variants.Given the speed with which these variants continue to appear around the world, a vaccine that can provide protection against all of them would be a game changer, they added.

But with about 296 million doses of mRNA vaccines having been administered as of June 11, the benefit is clear in all populations, including adolescents and young adults, the researchers reported.READ: Covid-19: Canada warns of ‘very rare risk’ of heart issues from mRNA vaccinesVaccines made by Moderna Inc. and the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE partnership are the only mRNA inoculations authorised for emergency use in the US. The issue was first explored in a June 23 meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.There has been increasing concern that these possible cardiovascular side effects could threaten vaccine uptake among young Americans as the highly transmissible delta variant is hitting under-vaccinated hot spots of the country.The agency report said that fact sheets should be provided before mRNA vaccinations. The US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization has been modified to include information on myocarditis after receipt of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/messenger-rna-vaccine-benefits-outweigh-heart-risks-u-s-cdc-says-101625592075375.html
06-07-2021||World||UK to ease compulsory Covid-19 self-isolation rules for fully vaccinated from Aug 16||The UK government on Tuesday announced that from August 16, fully vaccinated people in England will not have to undergo a 10-day compulsory self-isolation if a close contact tests positive for Covid-19.UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the House of Commons said the policy will also apply to anyone under the age of 18, currently not eligible for jabs.Under the new regime, anyone who comes in contact with a Covid-positive case would be expected to take a PCR test soon after being informed about it by the National Health Service (NHS) Test and Trace system.“From the 16th August, when even more people will have the protection of both doses and when modelling suggests that the risks from the virus will be even lower, anyone who is a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated,” Javid told MPs.“If someone gets their second dose just before or just after the 16th of August, they would need to wait two weeks after which their second jab can take effect and give them these new freedoms. As we make this change, we will be drawing on the huge capacity we have built for testing and sequencing and advising close contacts who are fully vaccinated to take a PCR test as soon as possible so they can get certainty about their condition,” the minister said.The announcement was followed by another Commons statement by UK Education Secretary Gavin Williamson to confirm an end to the so-called "bubble" system in schools, which has led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive test.UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will update Parliament later this week on removing the need for fully-vaccinated international travellers to isolate themselves when they return from an amber list or medium virus risk country.Currently, they are required to self-isolate in their homes for 10 days on their return, with a 10-day compulsory quarantine in place for red list or high risk virus countries – which currently includes India.The changes for the schools system will come in from July 19, the date UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed on Monday as the timeline for an end of all legal lockdown restrictions such as work from home where possible, one-metre plus social distance and face masks in indoor settings.“So, as we come to the fourth step [of the lockdown roadmap], we have to balance the risks,” Johnson said in a Downing Street virtual briefing.“We must be honest with ourselves that if we can’t reopen our society in the next few weeks, when we will be helped by the arrival of summer and by the school holidays, then we must ask ourselves when will we be able to return to normal,” he said.To the critics calling for a delay, the UK PM warned the alternative was to open up in the winter when the virus will have an “advantage”.While the final decision on the timeline will be made based on coronavirus infections and hospitalisations data next Monday, the plan for England is for an end to all restrictions on July 19.The devolved regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own lockdown rules based on localised data, but by and large follow the parameters in England.“I understand that some people are cautious about the idea of easing restrictions. But we must balance the risks,” Sajid Javid said in a Commons statement on the Covid-19 lockdown plans.“This pandemic is far from over, and we’ll continue with caution. But we’re increasingly confident that our plan is working, and that we can soon begin a new chapter based on the foundations of personal responsibility and common sense rather than the blunt instrument of rules and regulations,” he said.The minister, who has been in the post of Health Secretary for around 10 days since predecessor Matt Hancock resigned, has said it is important to move on from a Covid-focus."And we can't live in a world where the only thing we are thinking about is Covid and not about all the other health problems, not about our economic problems, or education challenges, and we have to make use of a vaccine that is thankfully working,” he said.Opposition Labour Party as well as some doctors and trade unions have expressed concern that the lifting of all restrictions, including face masks in enclosed spaces, may be premature as the Delta variant cases continue to rise in the UK.A further 28,773 cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday, and there were another 37 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-ease-compulsory-covid-19-self-isolation-rules-for-fully-vaccinated-from-aug-16-101625590434603.html

It further claimed that business continuity was ensured after the attack and owing to the company’s “rapid remediation and mitigation measures” several small and medium-sized businesses were saved from devastating impacts to their operations.Experts have pointed the attack to the Russian-based REvil gang after a post on the Happy Blog in dark web, previously associated with the gang, claimed responsibility for the attack, threatening that more than a million systems have been affected.Also read | Kaseya ransomware attack: Hackers demand $70 million ransom to restore data‘Limited impact’The company’s statement came a day after the hackers demanded a ransom of $70 million in Bitcoins, several news agencies reported earlier on Monday.“On July 2, at approximately 2 p.m. EST, Kaseya was alerted to a potential attack by internal and external sources. Within an hour, in an abundance of caution, Kaseya immediately shut down access to the software in question. The attack had limited impact, with only approximately 50 of the more than 35,000 Kaseya customers being breached,” Kaseya said in the statement.“While impacting approximately 50 of Kaseya’s customers, this attack was never a threat nor had any impact to critical infrastructure,” it further claimed.Many customers, who are managed service providers, use Kaseya’s technology for managing the IT infrastructure of local and small businesses that typically have less than 30 employees, the company also highlighted. “Of the approximately 800,000 to 1,000,000 local and small businesses that are managed by Kaseya’s customers, only about 800 to 1,500 have been compromised,” it further said. The company also assured that it is working closely with all government agencies following the breach.Meanwhile, CEO Fred Voccola said that “Our global teams are working around the clock to get our customers back up and running. We understand that every second they are shut down, it impacts their livelihood, which is why we’re working feverishly to get this resolved.”Also read | Hit by a ransomware attack in US? Your payment may be tax deductibleExperts doubtfulDespite Kaseya’s statement, cybersecurity experts opined that it is too early for the company to make a decisive assessment about the impact of the attack, a major reason being, the attack was launched on the fourth of July weekend, a holiday in the USA and businesses might become aware only on returning to work on Tuesday.“Given the relationship between Kaseya and MSPs, it’s not clear how Kaseya would know the number of victims impacted. There is no way the numbers are as low as Kaseya is claiming though,” the Associated Press (AP) quoted Jake Williams, chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm BreachQuest.Another cybersecurity firm Sophos commented that it was too soon to have any assessment of the impact. “It’s too soon to tell, since this entire incident is still under investigation” Sophos said, according to AP.Ciaran Martin, cybersecurity professor at the University of Oxford said this could be the biggest ransomware attack of all time. “It's probably the biggest ransomware attack of all time. Because of the nature of the attack there's still a lot of uncertainty over its impact,” news agency AFP quoted Martin as saying.He also said that the total number of victims was “potentially huge” because the attack was a supply chain attack, typically targeting a company that serves thousands of firms, who in turn provide IT services to smaller businesses.Of the many victims, Swedish supermarket chain Coop was one among the high profile customers. The cash registers of the company were paralysed because of the attack and according to spokesperson Kevin Bell, many of the 800 stores of the supermarket remained closed on Monday. He also said that the few hundreds that managed to reopen had to rely on other methods of payment by the customers.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/revil-ransomware-attack-experts-cast-doubts-as-it-firm-kaseya-says-800-to-1-500-customers-compromised-101625590763240.html

They said Swamy was a defender of indigenous people’s rights in India and was ‘falsely imprisoned’ according to a report by news agency PTI.“The news from India today is devastating. Human Rights Defender and Jesuit priest Fr. Stan Swamy has died in custody, nine months after his arrest on false charges of terrorism. Jailing human rights defenders is inexcusable,” Mary Lawlor was quoted as saying by the news agency. Lawlor, who is the special rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders for the United Nations, had earlier expressed her concerns regarding the health condition of Stan Swamy. She had also sought possible specialist treatment for him while describing the charges levelled against him as ‘unfounded’.The special representative for human rights from the European Union, Eamon Gilmore echoed similar sentiment and said that the European Union raised his case repeatedly with authorities. “I am very saddened to hear that Fr #StanSwamy has passed away. A defender of indigenous peoples’ rights. He was held in detention for the past 9 months. The EU had been raising his case repeatedly with authorities,” Gilmore said via a tweet where he had also tagged Lawlor’s tweet.Swamy who was arrested for creating unrest in 2020 for in connection with the Elgar Parishad case and lodged at the Taloja Central Jail in Navi Mumbai. The authorities claim that the priest made inflammatory speeches made at a conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, by the Elgar Parishad near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial following which violent clashes were triggered. Swamy died while waiting for his bail to be cleared. Investigative agencies also allege that the conclave was held by people with Maoist links.Swamy died at Mumbai’s Holy Family Hospital on Monday, a day after he suffered a cardiac arrest. Swamy also suffered from Parkinson's disease and several other ailments and was put on ventilator support. He had also tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-eu-human-rights-officials-condemn-stan-swamy-s-death-101625585927703.html
06-07-2021||World||Tropical Storm Elsa lashing Florida Keys, to strengthen slowly||The weather was getting worse in southern Florida on Tuesday morning as Tropical Storm Elsa began lashing the Florida Keys, complicating the search for survivors in the condo collapse and prompting a hurricane watch for the peninsula's upper Gulf Coast.In addition to damaging winds and heavy rains, the Miami-based US National Hurricane Center warned of life-threatening storm surges, flooding and isolated tornadoes. A hurricane watch was issued for a long stretch of coastline, from Egmont Key at the mouth of Tampa Bay to the Steinhatchee River in Florida's Big Bend area.Bands of rain were expected to reach Surfside on Florida's Atlantic coast, soaking the rubble of the Champlain Towers South, which collapsed June 24, killing at least 32 people. Search and rescue crews have worked through rain more than 100 others listed as missing, but must pause when lightning threatens, and a garage area in the pancaked debris already filled with water Monday, officials said.Elsa’s maximum sustained winds strengthened to 60 mph (95 kph) early Tuesday. A slow strengthening is forecast through Tuesday night and Elsa could be near hurricane strength before it makes landfall in Florida. Its core was about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Key West, Florida, and 270 miles (435 kilometers) south of Tampa. It was continuing to move to the north-northwest at 12 mph (19 kph).The forecast included the possibility of tornadoes across South Florida on Tuesday morning and across the upper peninsula later in the day.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded a state of emergency to cover a dozen counties where Elsa was expected to make a swift passage Wednesday, and President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for the state ahead of the storm.Forecasters predicted Elsa would hit coastal Georgia and South Carolina after Florida. Georgia's coast was under a tropical storm watch, as was much of the South Carolina coast. Forecasters said tornadoes could strike in the eastern Carolinas and Virginia as Elsa moves north.The storm surge could reach 5 feet (1.5 meters) over normally dry land in the Tampa Bay area if Elsa passes at high tide, forecasters said. Commander Col. Ben Jonsson said only essential personnel were being allowed Tuesday morning on MacDill Air Force Base, which is located along the bay on the South Tampa peninsula.Tampa International Airport planned to shut down Tuesday at 5 p.m.At a Tuesday morning news briefing, DeSantis reminded residents not to focus on the Tropical Storm Elsa’s so-called “cone of concern” because the storm’s “impacts are expected well outside that area.”“And if you look at how the storm is it’s incredibly lopsided to the east,” DeSantis said. “So most of the rainfall is going to be east of the center of the storm.”Elsa’s westward shift spared the lower Florida Keys a direct hit, but the islands were still getting plenty of rain and wind Tuesday. Tropical storm warnings were posted for the Florida Keys from Craig Key westward to the Dry Tortugas and for the west coast of Florida from Flamingo northward to the Ochlockonee River.Margarita Pedroza, who lives on a boat off Key West, told WPLG a stronger storm would have forced her ashore, but she was riding this one out. "Just batten down the hatches and get ready for it,” she told the television station.“It doesn’t seem like it’s as strong as some of the other storms that have come around, so hopefully the winds won’t be as strong and maybe it’ll be some rain, but hopefully not too much rain,” she said.Cuban officials evacuated 180,000 people against the possibility of heavy flooding from a storm that already battered several Caribbean islands, killing at least three people. But Elsa spent Sunday and much of Monday sweeping parallel to Cuba’s southern coast, sparing most of the island from significant effects.It made landfall in Cuba near Cienega de Zapata, a natural park with few inhabitants, and crossed the island just east of Havana. Tuesday’s rainfall across parts of Cuba was expected to reach 10 inches (25 centimeters) with isolated maximums of 15 inches (38 centimeters), resulting in significant flash flooding and mudslides. But there were no early reports of serious damage on the island.“The wind is blowing hard and there is a lot of rain. Some water is getting under the door of my house. In the yard the level is high, but it did not get into the house,” Lázaro Ramón Sosa, a craftsman and photographer who lives in the town of Cienega de Zapata, told The Associated Press by telephone.Sosa said he saw some avocado trees fall nearby.Tropical storm conditions were continuing over central and western Cuba on Tuesday morning, even as the storm reached Florida.Elsa was the first hurricane of the Atlantic season until Saturday morning and caused widespread damage on several eastern Caribbean islands Friday. As a tropical storm, it resulted in the deaths of one person on St. Lucia and of a 15-year-old boy and a 75-year-old woman in the Dominican Republic.Elsa is the earliest fifth-named storm on record, said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-elsa-lashing-florida-keys-to-strengthen-slowly-101625583743302.html
06-07-2021||World||Florida building collpase: Death toll climbs to 32 after rescuers find 4 more bodies in rubble||The discovery of four more victims in the rubble of a collapsed condominium building raised the death toll to 32, officials said Tuesday as a ramped-up search effort faced new threats from severe weather with Tropical Storm Elsa.Lightning forced rescuers to pause their work for two hours early Tuesday, Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah said. He said workers have removed 5.5 million pounds of debris from the pile.At the site of the collapsed building Tuesday morning, power saws and backhoes could be heard as workers in yellow helmets and blue jumpsuits sifted through the rubble for a 13th day. Stiff winds of 20 mph (32 kph) with stronger gusts blew through the area as gray clouds from Elsa’s outer bands swirled above.Bands of rain were expected in Surfside as Elsa strengthened with potential to become a hurricane again before making landfall somewhere between Tampa Bay and Florida's Big Bend and crossing northern Florida.The search crews can work through rain, but lightning from unrelated thunderstorms have forced them to pause at times, and a garage area in the rubble has filled with water, officials said.The delays frustrated rescue crews, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said.“Truly they live to save lives, and they’ve pushed ahead no matter what is thrown in their way,” she said at a Monday evening news conference.Still, crews got a big boost when the unstable remaining portion of the Champlain Towers South building came down Sunday. The demolition — prompted by fears that the structure could fall — allowed rescuers into previously inaccessible places, including bedrooms where people were believed to be sleeping at the time of the disaster, officials said."The site is busier and more active now than I’ve seen it since we began, now that the damaged building is down,” Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said, adding that heavy equipment was now able to move freely around the site.Rescuers hoped to get a clearer picture of voids that may exist in the rubble as they search for anyone still trapped under the fallen wing of the building, but they found very few voids, Jadallah told family members late Monday.No one has been rescued alive since the first hours after the collapse, but rescuers were still holding out hope of reuniting loved ones.“We continue to remain focused on our primary mission, and that is to leave no stone unturned and to find as many people as we can and to help bring either some answers to family and loved ones or to bring some closure to them,” City of Miami Fire Rescue Capt. Ignatius Carroll said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-building-collpase-death-toll-climbs-to-32-after-rescuers-find-4-more-bodies-in-rubble-101625583228934.html

The wife of the farm owner declined to tell the exact date of death when the AP reached her through Facebook.“We would rather not remember him by a date — it's been a traumatic event for our family,” AP quoted her as saying.The 6-foot-10-inches or nearly 2.1 meters tall weighing 2,500 pounds or 1,136 kg horse was certified as the world's tallest living horse by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2010.Jerry Gilbert, the owner of the farm, told WMTV that the horse was a "superstar" and a “truly magnificent animal.” Big Jake was born in Nebraska and weighed 240 pounds (109 kilograms) at birth, about 100 pounds (45 kilograms) heavier at birth compared to a typical Belgian foal, Gilbert said, according to AP.Gilbert plans to memorialize Big Jake by keeping his stall empty and inserting a brick on its outside with his picture and name.He added that the other horses know of his death and are grieving as Jake left a huge void.“It's very quiet (at the farm)," Jerry Gilbert said, reported AP.“The other horses know. I think they have their own grieving time because Jake was the centre of attention around here. There is a huge void. It feels like he's still here, but he's not," he added.Social media was abuzz with the news of his demise, as netizens posted about the news of his death in Wisconsin worldwide.

06-07-2021||World||Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine ‘less effective’ against Delta variant: Israel||Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine was less effective in stopping people from getting infected with the Delta variant of coronavirus in the country in recent weeks, the Israeli government has said. According to Bloomberg, data from Israel’s health ministry showed the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine protected 64 per cent of the country’s people against the virus between June 6 and early July, down from the earlier 94 per cent. This decline has been observed amid the emergence and rise in cases of Delta variant in the country, the data revealed.Moreover, the surge in Delta variant cases also coincided with the lifting of restrictions due to the virus at the start of June in Israel, Bloomberg reported. However, the government data also showed that the Pfizer vaccine jab is protecting people from severe illness and hospitalisation. The vaccine jab showed 93 per cent effectiveness in ceasing people from hospitalisation – only marginally dropping from 97 per cent revealed in an earlier government study.Pfizer Inc’s spokesperson Dervila Keane declined to comment on the Israel government findings, Bloomberg added. She emphasised on research showing the vaccine’s continued protection against new coronavirus mutations – although it was slightly decreased in some cases. Keane told Bloomberg that evidence till now indicates that the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine will “continue to protect against these variants.”Although Israel had one of the world’s most effective vaccination drives and administered vaccine jabs to about 57 per cent of its population, several of the new coronavirus cases are being identified among such people, Ynet news services reported. According to the website, last Friday, 55 per cent of the newly infected citizens were inoculated with Covid-19 vaccine doses. Furthermore, as of July 4, the country has as many as 35 serious cases of the virus as opposed to 21 seen on June 19.As per the Bloomberg report, a statement by the Israel Prime Minister’s office said that the government has plans to study vaccinated people who contracted Covid-19, including factors such as pre-existing conditions, inoculation dates, and age, in order to gauge the vaccine’s efficacy and the rate at which it wears off.The government is mulling over reinstating additional curbs after restoring a mandate to wear masks indoors in public spaces. However, the health ministry told Bloomberg that no decision has yet been made on recommending a third vaccine dose for the citizens.Although Pfizer CEO Dr Albert Bourla has said that people will likely require to be administered a third vaccine jab within 12 months of getting fully vaccinated, Bloomberg reported.This development comes only a week after the Indian government stated that they will soon close the deal with Pfizer to make it the fifth covid-19 vaccine available in the country. Notably, Moderna – the first international vaccine, was given a green signal on June 29. Meanwhile, Dr Bourla recently said that an agreement with the Indian government is being finalised.Towards the end of June, Reuters reported that Pfizer’s medical director in Israel, Alon Rappaport told local broadcaster Army Radio that research from the lab and areas where Delta variant has replaced the British Covid-19 variant as the “common variant,” point that Pfizer vaccine is “very effective”, nearly 90 per cent in preventing Covid-19.The Delta variant was first identified in India and has now spread to at least 98 countries. A subtype of the variant, Delta Plus, has already been detected in more than 50 samples in the country. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the world is in a very “dangerous period” of the pandemic owing to more transmissible variants, like Delta, which is rapidly emerging as the dominant strain in several countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-less-effective-against-delta-variant-israel-101625561277982.html

The protests, organised by the Association des Ouïghours de France was meant as a medium to raise awareness about the ongoing genocide.A little over 30-minute long video, which was shared by Association des Ouïghours de France on its Facebook page, showed protesters waving the community’s blue flag and displaying banners with ‘Terroriste China’ (Terrorist China). Slogans were also shouted against the atrocities committed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against Uyghurs.Monday’s protests in France come as President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks on several issues including the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic (Covid-19) along with other international and regional issues. According to news agency Bloomberg, an Elysee official pointed out that both Macron and Merkel evoked the Chinese government’s crackdown on the Uyghur community.As tensions between the European Union and China are growing, the former has accused China of committing human rights abuses against Uyghurs, along with suppressing Hong Kong’s democratic fabric.Earlier, scores of people from the Tibetian, Mongolian, Vietnamese, Taiwaneese, Hong Kong and Uyghur communities staged a protest at the Bastille square in France’s Paris on June 24, where they demanded a boycott of next year’s Winter Olympics in Beijing over human rights violations against ethnic groups, ANI reported.Despite global provocation, China still continues to deny any wrongdoing against Uyghurs. Time and again, it has denied claims that ethnic Muslims have been forced into internment camps, work programs and birth-control initiatives, Bloomberg reported. However, an assessment by the United Nations claims that Uyghurs- anywhere from tens of thousands to “upwards of 1 million” have been detained.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uyghur-community-in-france-protests-against-china-s-atrocities-in-xinjiang-101625559317872.html
06-07-2021||World||Imran Khan, Kim Jong-un on RSF's 'press freedom predators' list||Press watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has released a list of 37 heads of states who massively cracked down on press freedom. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban are among the “predators of press freedom”, said RSF.Two women, Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Hong Kong’s administrative chief Carrie Lam, have also been added to the list. This is the first time that women leaders have found a place on the press freedom predators' list.The list was released on Monday. The list has come out after a gap of five years; the RSF released the last list in 2016.The global press body said that 17 of the 37 leaders have been added for the first time on the list. It has accused these leaders of "creating a censorship apparatus, jailing journalists arbitrarily or inciting violence against them".At least 19 countries have been show in the red colour by the RSF, which it says shows the bad situation for journalism. Sixteen countries have been coded black, which RSF says the situation is "very bad".The average of the predators included in the list is 66 and one-third of them are from the Asia-Pacific region.Some of the other inclusions in the list are Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, Myanmar's Min Aung Hlaing, Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammad bin Salman, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte.In the case of Imran Khan, the RSF said, "In the shadows, behind candidate Khan, the military reasserted the deep state," adding that cases of brazen censorship are legion since he became prime minister."Newspaper distribution has been interrupted, media outlets have been threatened with the withdrawal of advertising and TV channel signals have been jammed," the RS further said.Talking about Bin Salman, the report said, “His repressive methods include spying and threats that have sometimes led to abduction, torture and other unthinkable acts. Jamal Khashoggi’s horrific murder exposed a predatory method that is simply barbaric.”Khashoggi was a Saudi journalist who visited the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul to procure documents to marry and was brutally slain inside it in 2018.About the women on the list, the RSF said, "Lam's predatory exploits include the adoption of a digital security law in 2018 that has led to more than 70 journalists and bloggers being prosecuted.”The watchdog's chief urged world governments to disavow the practices used by the leaders it singled out and to recognize the positive contributions made by an independent press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-kim-jong-un-on-rsf-s-press-freedom-predators-list-101625550652360.html

The AN-26 plane lost contact with air traffic control while attempting to land, TASS separately cited a source as saying. The plane was flying from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to Palana in the Kamchatka Peninsula when it did not make a scheduled communication, the Interfax and RIA Novosti agencies cited the emergencies ministry as saying, according to news agency Reuters.AFP reported that the 28 people on board included six crew members and there were one or two children among the 22 passengers. A search has been launched and rescue workers are on standby, the agency added.Russia, once known for aircraft-related accidents, has improved its air traffic safety records in the past few years. However, poor maintenance of air crafts and a low level of safety standards still prevail. Flying is also dangerous in the country’s isolated regions with difficult weather conditions.This incident in Russia comes exactly two days after a Philippine air force aircraft crashed on a southern island on July 4, killing 50 people. The July 4 crash is the worst air disaster for the Asian country in nearly three decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-plane-with-28-people-on-board-goes-missing-in-far-east-region-reports-101625548993403.html

The 'lying flat' movement involves lying down and doing as little as possible.The movement has bene triggered by fears among the young population that they won't be able to do better than their parents. The fear stems from the fact that employees are working harder, and for longer hours, but prices are rising faster than incomes.According to local media reports, the unemployment rate among those aged between 16-24 in China is 13.1 per cent, and the overall unemployment rate is 5.5 per cent. To add to this, more than 20 crore youngsters have graduated in China in the last year, ready for employment.A generation ago, the road to success in China was hard work. But this new movement seeks to break the established norm, defying the country's long-held prosperity narrative by refusing to participate in it."I have been chilling," 31-year-old Luo Huazhong wrote in a blog post titled "Lying Flat Is Justice" in April. "I don't feel like there's anything wrong."Luo quit his job as a factory worker, and decided to opt for odd jobs and survive on his savings. He biked 1,300 miles from Sichuan Province to Tibet to live his new life.The post, which showed Luo lying on his bed in a dark room with the curtains drawn, soon went viral. Soon, Chinese millennials started celebrating the post as an anti-consumerist manifesto. "Lying flat" went viral and has since become a broader statement about Chinese society.And Beijing is certainly not happy.Censors have deleted a tangping (which means 'lying flat') group with more than 9,000 members on Douban, a popular internet forum. The authorities also barred posts on another tangping forum with more than 200,000 members, according to an article written by Elsie Chen in The New York Times.China's internet regulator further ordered online platforms to "strictly restrict" new posts on tangping, according to The New York Times report.The state news media has called tangping "shameful".But experts say the movement is a turning point for China. "Young people feel a kind of pressure that they cannot explain and they feel that promises were broken," said Xiang Biao, a professor of social anthropology at Oxford University who focuses on Chinese society. "People realise that material betterment is no longer the single most important source of meaning in life", said Xiang.China has a strict 996 culture, which means working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. There were protests in 2019 against the practice which sparked debate among leading Chinese businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lying-flat-gains-traction-in-china-as-youngsters-defy-norms-beijing-not-happy-101625542898189.html
06-07-2021||World||Atami mudslide: Japanese authorities continue rescue ops, 24 still unreachable||ATAMI, Japan (AP) — Rescue workers dug through sludge and debris Monday looking for more than 20 people who may be trapped after a torrent of mud, trees and rocks ripped with a roar through a Japanese seaside resort town, killing at least four people.Atami Mayor Sakae Saito said 24 people were still unreachable Tuesday morning, after the city late Monday released the names of more than 60 registered residents who were unaccounted for and the majority of them responded for the contact request. Officials were double checking the number because many of the apartments and houses in Atami are second homes or vacation rentals.Initially, 147 people were unreachable, but officials confirmed many safely evacuated or were simply not at home. In addition to the four people found dead, officials said 25 people have been rescued, including three who were injured.The disaster is an added trial as authorities prepare for the Tokyo Olympics, due to start in less than three weeks, while Japan is still in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, with cases steadily climbing in the capital and experts suggesting a need for another state of emergency.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters that rescue workers are doing their utmost “to rescue those who may be buried under the mud and waiting for help as soon as possible." Three coast guard ships, and six military drones were backing up hundreds of troops, firefighters and others toiling in the rain and fog.The landslide occurred Saturday after days of heavy rain in Atami, which like many seaside Japanese towns is built into a steep hillside. It tore through the Izusan neighborhood, known for its hot springs, a shrine and shopping streets. The town has a registered population of 36,800 and is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Tokyo.Shizuoka Gov. Heita Kawakatsu, who inspected the area Monday where the mudslide was believed to have started, said rain soaked into the mountainside apparently weakening the ground under a massive pile of soil at a construction site that then slid down the slope.The prefecture is investigating. Media reports said a planned housing development in the area was abandoned after its operator ran into financial problems.Witnesses described a giant roar as a small stream turned into a torrent, and bystanders were heard gasping in horror on cellphone videos taken as it happened.Naoto Date, an actor who was visiting Izusan, was awakened by sirens. His neighborhood is now awash in muddy water with rescuers wading through knee-deep sludge. Just blocks from his home, some houses have been completely washed away, with only their foundations still visible. Mangled traffic signs stick out from the mud. At the seafront, he saw cars floating along with debris from destroyed homes.“I grew up here, and my classmates and friends live here. I’m so sad to see my neighborhood where I used to play with my friends is now destroyed,” Date told The Associated Press by videocall from his home in Atami.While Date's mother, who was staying next door, has moved to a hotel along with other evacuees, the actor said he was staying away from evacuation centers because he is concerned about the coronavirus.The Izusan area is one of 660,000 locations in Japan identified as prone to mudslides by the government, but those designations are not widely publicized and public awareness is low. Early July, near the end of Japan's rainy season, is often a time of deadly flooding and mudslides, and many experts say the rains are worsening due to climate change.With other parts of the country expecting heavy downpours, authorities were urging people near hillsides in areas at risk to use caution. Public broadcaster NHK carried a program Monday about risk factors and warning signs that might precede a landslide.A year ago, flooding and mudslides triggered by heavy rain in Kumamoto and four other prefectures in the Kyushu region in southern Japan left nearly 80 people dead. In July 2018, hillsides in crowded residential areas in Hiroshima collapsed, leaving 20 dead. In 2017, mudslides and flooding in the Kyushu region killed 40.Miyoko Okamoto, an employee at a care home for the elderly, said the mudslide came close to but narrowly missed her house. She and her son ran out of the house, while her husband, a community association leader, escorted neighbors to safer ground.Okamoto said she hasn't been back home since fleeing because she is helping residents at the care home. “We were lucky to have survived, and that's most important," she said.But her neighbor is still looking for his wife. “They are good friends of ours," she said, "and that pains my heart.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/atami-mudslide-japanese-authorities-continue-rescue-ops-24-still-unreachable-101625538674223.html

A software developed by the company was used as a conduit by hackers linked to Russia to launch the attack.The firm's CEO Fred Voccola said that they are still trying to estimate the precise impact of Friday's attack.Kaseya is a company which provides software tools to IT outsourcing shops: companies that typically handle back-office work for companies too small or modestly resourced to have their own tech departments.The hackers, believed to be linked to the notorious REvil group, used the VSA software developed by Kaseya which helps companies remotely monitor their computer systems. The company said it sent a detection tool to nearly 900 customers.The disruption has been felt more keenly in Sweden, where hundreds of supermarkets had to close because their cash registers were inoperative, and New Zealand, where schools and kindergartens were knocked offline.A German IT company and two big Dutch IT services companies were also among the victims.The hackers who claimed responsibility for the breach have demanded $70 million to restore all the affected businesses' data. They got in touch with news agency Reuters and one of their representatives, without identifying the name, said, "We are always ready to negotiate."On Sunday, the White House said it was checking to see whether there was any "national risk" posed by ransomware outbreak but Voccola said that - so far - he was not aware of any nationally important organizations being hit.Ransomware criminals break into networks and sow malware that cripples networks on activation by scrambling all their data. Victims get a decoder key when they pay up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ransomware-attack-using-kaseya-software-affected-1-500-businesses-worldwide-101625531520766.html
06-07-2021||World||Germany lifts ban on travellers from delta variant hit India, other countries||Germany on Monday lifted a ban on travellers from India, the UK and three other countries, where the delta variant of coronavirus has been found in the samples of Covid-19 patients. In fact, the variant is the dominant one found in the UK which scuttled the Boris Johnson government's plan to open up the country.The Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency responsible for disease control and prevention, said that India, Nepal, Russia, Portugal and the UK have been downgraded to "high-incidence areas" from the current categorisation of "areas of variant concern". This would make it easier for travellers who are not German residents or citizens to enter the country.The current rules in Germany allow only its citizens to enter the country from a variant nation and are subjected to two-week quarantine, regardless of their vaccination status. The "high-incidence areas" status will allow anyone from such countries to enter Germany provided they produce a negative test on arrival and quarantine on arrival for 10 days.The quarantine period can be shortened to five days if they test negative for Covid-19. The new norms will be effective from Wednesday.Travellers from high-incidence areas are also exempt from quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated.German health minister Jens Spahn had said last week that the federal government will look into the situation (of allowing travellers form delta variant-hit countries) "in the next few days".The relaxation in curbs is driven by the fact that vaccines have been found effective against the delta variant, which was first discovered in India."We think that in the foreseeable future, those who have received double jabs will... be able to travel again, without having to go into quarantine," German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said on Friday.Last month, Dubai eased restrictions on Indian travellers who have received two doses of a UAE-approved Covid-19 vaccine. The country has approved the vaccines made by Sinopharm, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sputnik V and Oxford-AstraZeneca.The passengers from India are required to undergo a rapid PCR test four hours prior to departure to Dubai. They must also undergo another PCR test on arrival in Dubai. Following their arrival, the passengers from India should undergo institutional quarantine until they receive their PCR test result, which is expected within 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-lifts-ban-on-travellers-from-delta-variant-hit-india-other-countries-101625528827991.html
