South Carolina's governor said the state would not reverse its mask restriction, but Arkansas leaders are weighing whether to revisit an April law banning local and state government entities from requiring masks.Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson has faced growing calls to lift that ban, at least for schools, as virus cases and hospitalizations surge in the state.Ford Motor Co., meanwhile, said it would reinstate face mask protocols for all employees and visitors at its Missouri and Florida facilities. The two states are among the hardest-hit by the summer surge in which the U.S. is now averaging more than 60,000 new cases a day, driven by the highly contagious delta variant spreading through unvaccinated populations.Other government leaders said they will hold off reinstating mask rules for now.Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said he’s not considering imposing a mask mandate in schools or statewide, though he urged Pennsylvanians to follow federal guidance. The Democrat said state mandates on masks were necessary before there was a vaccine.“People have the ability to make the decision to get a vaccine,” he said, speaking Tuesday on Pittsburgh radio station KDKA-AM. “If they do, that’s the protection.”The CDC's new guidance applies to places with at least 50 new cases per 100,000 people in the last week, which is roughly 60% of all U.S. counties, federal officials said.Nearly all of the South and Southwest is subject to the guidance, but most communities in the Northeast — with the exception of major metro areas like New York City and Boston — are exempt for now, according to the CDC's COVID tracker.Elsewhere, conservative officials pushed back against reviving mask mandates, setting up the potential for a patchwork of regulations within states and counties.In Missouri, the St. Louis County Council voted Tuesday to reverse the county’s mask mandate, just a day after it became one of the first reinstated in the country.But Democratic County Executive Sam Page insisted Wednesday that the mandate remained in effect and blamed the pushback on politics.“This is a national problem that went all the way up to the top with the last president," he said. "And we do have some folks in our country who work very hard to undermine public health efforts with a lot of very inflammatory rhetoric.”On the other side of the state, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, a Democrat, promised to provide details Wednesday on his plans to order mask wearing indoors in Missouri's largest city.“We cannot ignore the rapid spread of the COVID-19 delta variant in Missouri — outpacing much of the country,” he said in a statement. “We will do all we can to ensure our corner of this state is safe.”Meanwhile in Springfield, a hospital began expanding its morgue capacity as the state’s virus death toll soared. Steve Edwards, the CEO of CoxHealth, said his company brought in temporary cooling equipment because 75 patients in area hospitals have died this month.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that her agency's updated guidance was prompted by new data suggesting vaccinated people can pass on the virus in rare cases.“I know this is not a message America wants to hear,” she told CNN. “With prior variants, when people had these rare breakthrough infections, we didn’t see the capacity of them to spread the virus to others, but with the delta variant, we now see that you can actually now pass it to somebody else.”Walensky stressed that COVID vaccines are working by preventing greater levels of hospitalization and death.Unvaccinated people, she also noted, account for the vast number of new infections. Two-thirds of the vaccine-eligible population in the U.S. has received at least one dose.“We can halt the chain of transmission,” she told “CBS This Morning” on Wednesday. “We can do something if we unify together, if we get people vaccinated who are not yet vaccinated. If we mask in the interim, we can halt this in just a matter of a couple of weeks.”In Provincetown, Massachusetts, where officials earlier this week re-imposed an indoor mask requirement following a surge in COVID-19 cases this month, store owner Patrick Patrick says he doesn’t mind asking customers to mask up once more.The owner of Marine Specialties, a long running Army-Navy store, had been leery of officials dropping virus safety mandates ahead of what many expected would be a busy summer season. He even tried to require customers to mask up in his store through the summer, before finally relenting in June.“If we’d stuck with masks all along, I don’t think we’d be having this conversation,” Patrick said, adding that he’s required all his staff to be masked and vaccinated. “They’re not entirely fun, but we wore them all last summer, and we didn’t have a single case in Provincetown. Now see where we’re at.”As of Tuesday, the town had reported more than 750 cases of COVID-19 associated with the most recent cluster, which started around the busy July 4th holiday. Officials have said many cases are so-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people. Three people have been hospitalized, but no one has died.Patrick says the business drop-off has been significant, but he hopes the return of masks helps brings visitors peace of mind.“I don’t see masks as bad for business,” he said. “Maybe for a nightclub or bar it is. But if it gets people back out and feeling safe, it’s worth it. We take care of public health and safety, the dollars and cents will take care of themselves."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-cdc-guidelines-set-off-rush-to-reimpose-mask-mandates-in-us-101627494033091.html
28-07-2021||World||'Audacious theft': Woman who swapped pebbles for diamonds in London heist jailed||A woman who secretly swapped seven pebbles for 4.2 million pounds ($5.7 million) worth of diamonds has been sent to prison for her role in the audacious heist at a luxury jewelry store in London’s tony Mayfair district.Lulu Lakatos, 60, was sentenced Wednesday to 5 1/2 years in prison after a jury at Southwark Crown Court in London found her guilty of conspiracy to steal.Lakatos was part of an international gang that fled to France after stealing the diamonds from Boodles on New Bond Street on March 10, 2016. The gems haven't been recovered.“This was an audacious theft, carried out in plain view of experienced and professional staff at a renowned jewelers,” Detective Sgt. William Man of London’s Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. “The meticulous planning and execution of this theft reveals to me that those involved were highly skilled criminals.”In the days leading up to the heist, the criminals held a series of meetings with Boodles staff on the pretense that they represented a wealthy Russian investor who was looking to purchase gems, police said.Lakatos, who was born in Romania and lived in France, posed as a gem expert named “Anna” who then went to Boodles to value seven diamonds for the buyer.After she inspected the gems, which included a 20-carat heart-shaped diamond valued at more than 2.2 million pounds, they were individually wrapped and placed in a locked bag that was supposed to be held in the jeweler’s vault until payment was received. But when Boodles’ own expert became suspicious the next day, the bag was X-rayed and the store discovered nothing but seven ordinary pebbles.Lakatos had used a distraction to swap the bag containing the diamonds for an identical one containing the pebbles before it was locked in the vault, according to security camera video released by police.After leaving the store, Lakatos handed the bag containing the diamonds to one of her female accomplices, before ditching the long coat, hat and scarf she wore as a disguise and boarding a high-speed Eurostar train to France.She was arrested on a European arrest warrant last September and returned to Britain to stand trial.Two men who worked with Lakatos previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal and were sentenced to 3 years and eight months in prison. Police are still investigating the involvement of two other women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/audacious-theft-woman-who-swapped-pebbles-for-diamonds-in-london-heist-jailed-101627491544218.html

This equaled a 1.1 percentage-point difference in annual births, or roughly 23,000 excess babies in GOP counties that the authors tie to optimism over the election’s results.The effects also continued for the following two years for which data were available.What’s more, the gap was bigger in heavily partisan counties. The fertility gap between extreme Republican and extreme Democratic counties was 2.6 percentage points, according to the authors, Gordon Dahl and William Mullins of the University of California San Diego and Runjing Lu of the University of Alberta.Hispanic mothers also saw significantly fewer births than non-Hispanics, the authors wrote, noting some of the former president’s harsh rhetoric toward immigrants during his campaign.For some context, there was no partisan effect on fertility after former President Barack Obama’s 2008 victory, although the onset of the Great Recession complicated the data. The authors found some evidence that relative fertility fell in Democratic counties after former President George W. Bush’s 2000 win.The states with the highest birth rates shortly after the election were Utah, Alaska and the Dakotas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/love-for-trump-led-to-baby-boom-in-republican-counties-in-2016-101627491569052.html

US district judge Ann M. Donnelly ruled that the tablet recounting the epic of Gilgamesh, written in Akkadian, originated in present-day Iraq and entered the US contrary to federal law.The US state department on Tuesday said that the rare fragment was illegally imported to the country after it was bought by Hobby Lobby, a prominent arts-and-crafts retailer based in Oklahoma City, from an international auction house for more than $1.67 million. The law enforcement agents seized it from the museum in 2019.“This forfeiture represents an important milestone on the path to returning this rare and ancient masterpiece of world literature to its country of origin,” acting US Attorney Jacquelyn M. Kasulis said in a statement."This office is committed to combating the black-market sale of cultural property and the smuggling of looted artefacts," she added.The Gilgamesh Dream Tablet was discovered in 1853 in the ruins of the library of the Assyrian King Assur Banipal in Nineveh, situated in modern-day northern Iraq. In 2003, a US antiquities dealer purchased the tablet from a family member of a coin dealer in London and shipped it to the US by international post without declaring formal entry, according to the US state department.The antiquities dealer then allegedly sold the tablet with a false provenance letter that stated the ancient artefact had been inside a box of miscellaneous ancient bronze fragments purchased in an auction in 1981. The tablet changed hands several times in different countries along with the false letter.“Hobby Lobby consented to the tablet’s forfeiture based on the tablet’s illegal importations into the United States in 2003 and 2014,” the department added.Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi is reportedly set to take back 17,000 pieces of archaeological treasures when he returns on Thursday. However, it was not immediately clear whether the Gilgamesh tablet would be among those thousands of artefacts.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilgamesh-tablet-us-takes-step-to-return-3-500-year-old-looted-artefact-to-iraq-101627486349100.html

The daily death rate hit a record-high this week as cases surged, data by the country's ministry of health showed.Richard Rukwata, interim head of Zimbabwe's Medicines Control Authority, said in his statement earlier on Wednesday that "the drug's usage is valid for 12 months or until the public health emergency ends".“If additional satisfactory data needed for full registration are submitted in an application to the authority, then full marketing authorization could be granted,” Richard added.Earlier in June, the Zimbabwean government had requested the African Export-Import Bank to postpone the shipment of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine dosages citing concerns about blood clots and the government's inability to retain the vials of injections at the proper temperature.Zimbabwe has previously approved the use of the coronavirus vaccines such as India's indegenously produced Covaxin, China's Sinopharm and Sinovac, and Russsia's Sputnik V.According to Covid-19 data available on worldometers.info, Zimbabwe recorded 1,767 cases of coronavirus and 107 related deaths on Tuesday alone. The active cases in the country, with an approximate population of 1.46 crores, stood at 27,935.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases-zimbabwe-approves-j-j-vaccine-101627477610647.html
28-07-2021||World||Upset China gives lecture on democracy to India, US||A seemingly upset spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday gave a lesson on democracy to India and the US, the largest and oldest democracies no less, after it appeared that the two had ganged up against authoritarian China.All because the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, visiting India at present, talked about a rising global threat to democracies and that the two leading ones should stand together to support the threatened ideals.A Bloomberg question on whether the Blinken statement pointed a finger at the Middle Kingdom during the Chinese foreign ministry briefing on Wednesday triggered a passionate discourse on democracy from spokesperson, Zhao Lijian.“I want to stress that democracy is a common value of humanity. It is not a patent to any country. The way to realise democracy is diverse without a certain pattern or only one answer. A multiparty political structure is not the only form of democracy and democracy cannot be used to stoke confrontation,” Zhao said.The reference to the US went like this: “Some countries claim themselves to be democratic, but they face the problems of racial discrimination, political polarisation, among other issues.”“Is this the kind of democracy that they pride on?”Then, came the reference to neighbour, India - with the inevitable conclusion that money wins elections in India - and rhetorical questions, one after the other. “In some countries, without money you cannot get votes. Political parties place their interests above that of the people. Is this democracy or the rise of the wealthy? Some democratic countries contain others’ development. Is this democracy or hegemony? Is this the kind of democracy that you want?”The way to judge which country is democratic and which one is autocratic should not be decided by one certain country, Zhao mused. “The way to judge whether a political system is good is to see whether it can deliver progress of society, better livelihood and whether it is endorsed and supported by its people and whether it can make contributions to the progress of mankind.Zhao didn’t name either India or the US but clearly did not leave much to anyone’s imagination. Maybe, like Blinken’s statement.Elsewhere, the state-run tabloid Global Times was direct. “Such an arrangement, (Blinken’s visit) which closely follows (deputy secretary of state Wendy) Sherman’s visit to China on Sunday and Monday, is seen as a sign that the US will spend more efforts to rope in India to contain China and play the ‘India card’,” analysts told the tabloid.But all isn’t good between India and the US, the analysis said.One of the major rifts between New Delhi and Washington is the US decision to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, which has left India’s investment in the region for the past 20 years hanging in the air, Long Xingchun, from the Beijing Foreign Studies University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/upset-china-gives-lecture-on-democracy-to-india-us-101627484208789.html

What should be their guiding principles to navigate our exit?” Georgieva said in Washington, D.C., according to prepared remarks.Georgieva asked how central banks will adapt their tool kits to the post-pandemic policy landscape and how they’ll prepare for an acceleration in digital money.“These are just some of the difficult questions being faced by central bankers everywhere,” she said.The remarks come a day after the IMF warned that unequal access to vaccines is further widening the recovery gap between advanced and developing economies. The fund maintained its outlook for the biggest rebound in global economic growth in four decades, but changed its underlying regional forecasts.World output is still expected to grow 6% in 2021 following last year’s 3.2% drop, the fund said in an updated World Economic Outlook released Tuesday. It reduced the emerging-market forecast to 6.3% expansion, compared to the 6.7% increase projected in April, and raised the estimate for advanced economies by 0.5 percentage point to 5.6%.“Many emerging and developing economies are projected to grow slower than we had anticipated,” Georgieva said. “This difference is primarily due to dramatic differences in vaccine availability — thus, infection rates — and availability of fiscal space to act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-economy-in-crisis-due-to-vaccine-gap-amongst-nations-imf-chief-warns-101627481964700.html

In an interview with PBS NewsHour aired Tuesday night, Khan said that the US should have opted for a political solution when the presence of Nato forces in Afghanistan were at an all-time high and not when they had reduced the troops to “barely” 10,000."I think the US has really messed it up in Afghanistan," Khan told PBS NewsHour.The Pakistan premier opined that an “inclusive” political settlement that involves all factions, including the Taliban, will be the “only good outcome” for Afghanistan. Pakistan has been long accused of helping the Taliban militarily, financially and with intelligence inputs in their fight against the Afghan government, which Khan dismissed as “extremely unfair”.He said that thousands of Pakistanis lost their lives in the aftermath of the US war in Afghanistan when “Pakistan had nothing to do with what happened” on September 11, 2001, in New York.Also Read | 'Never would I say such stupid thing': Pak PM says he never blamed rape victimsWhen asked about a recent report of 10,000 Pakistani fighters crossing over the border to help the Taliban, he said, "This is absolute nonsense. Why don't they give us evidence of this?"Khan stressed that Pakistan hosts three million Aghan refugees of which the majority are Pashtuns, the same ethnic group as the Taliban fighters.“Now, there are camps of 500,000 people, there are camps of 100,000 people. And Taliban are not some military outfits, they are normal civilians. And if there are some civilians in these camps, how is Pakistan supposed to hunt these people down? How can you call them sanctuaries?” he argued.According to a report prepared for the UN Security Council, about 6,000 terrorists of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) are operating on the Afghan side of the border. While the TTP has “distinctive anti-Pakistan objectives”, it also supports the Afghan Taliban militants inside Afghanistan against Afghan Forces, the report by the UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-are-normal-civilians-pak-pm-imran-khan-on-providing-safe-haven-to-terrorists-101627478065679.html

Now they explicitly say that they cannot give guarantees that it would not happen again."Since April 9, Tehran and six world powers have been in talks to revive the nuclear pact ditched three years ago by then US President Donald Trump, who argued it favoured Iran.The sixth round of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington adjourned on June 20, two days after hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi was elected president of the Islamic Republic. Parties involved in the negotiations have yet to announce when the next round of negotiations will resume.Like Khamenei, Raisi has backed the revival of the nuclear pact but officials have said that his government might adopt "a hardline" approach. Khamenei, not the president, has the last say on Iran's state matters, including the nuclear policy.Iranian and Western officials have said significant gaps remained to reinstate the deal, under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program to make it harder to obtain fissile material for a weapon in return for relief from tough sanctions. Iran says it has never sought nuclear weapons and never would.HARSH SANCTIONSHarsh sanctions reimposed by Trump since 2018 have prompted Tehran to violate the deal's limits. However, Tehran says its nuclear steps are reversible if Washington lifts all sanctions.US President Joe Biden seeks to reinstate and eventually broaden the pact to put more limits on Iran’s nuclear work and its missile development and constrain its regional activities.Khamenei again flatly rejected adding any other issues to the deal."In the recent nuclear talks, the Americans staunchly insisted on their obstinate stance. When making promises and on paper they say they will remove sanctions, but in practice they have not and they will not," Khamenei said.Khamenei said Washington is "stubborn" and insists on adding a sentence to the existing nuclear deal."By adding this sentence, they want to provide an excuse for their further interventions on the nuclear deal and (Iran's) missile work and regional issues," Khamenei said. "Then if we refuse to discuss those issues, Americans will accuse Iran of violating the nuclear deal and they will say the agreement is over."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-leader-khamenei-blames-cowardly-us-for-halting-nuclear-talks-101627472099826.html

In its weekly epidemiological update, the UN health agency said most of the 69,000 deaths were reported in the Americas and Southeast Asia, taking the cumulative deaths to over 4 million.“The highest numbers of deaths per 100,000 population over the past week were observed in the Americas and South-East Asia Regions which reported 2.8 and 1.1 new deaths per 100,000 population, respectively,” the report said.The overall Covid-19 cases across the globe also jumped by 8% as about 540,000 daily infections were reported on average over the past week. The UN health agency warned about the rise in Covid-19 cases, saying “if these trends continue, the cumulative number of cases reported globally could exceed 200 million in the next two weeks.”Also Read | Covid-19: US brings back face masks to control spread of Delta variantOver the past week, the biggest numbers of new Covid-19 cases were reported from the US, Brazil, Indonesia, Britain and India, according to the report. While America and Brazil reported an increase in Covid-19 cases, Indonesia and Britain reported a decline. Negligible change in India’s Covid-19 cases was reported in the last week.The highly contagious Delta variant has now been detected in 132 countries, as per the report, spreading to eight new countries.Addressing the widespread concern over vaccine efficacy against variants of concern, the WHO said that though studies have shown a several-fold reduction in neutralization against variants, it does not directly correlate with reduced vaccine efficacy. Explaining the reasons, the UN agency stated that there is currently no known threshold of neutralization below which vaccines stop working. It also noted that some vaccines produce higher neutralizing antibody concentrations, so a reduction will “likely have a lesser effect” on the vaccine efficacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-global-covid-deaths-up-by-21-cases-could-exceed-200-mn-in-two-weeks-101627472933570.html
28-07-2021||World||China urges Taliban to crack down on ETIM||China on Wednesday told a Taliban delegation that it hopes the insurgent group will play a critical role in the reconstruction process of Afghanistan in the backdrop of US forces leaving the country.State councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi urged the Taliban to crack down on the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an Islamic group it alleges is fuelling unrest and separatism in China’s Xinjiang province from Afghanistan.Wang met Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban’s political chief, in Tianjin, a city some 100km from Beijing.On his part, Baradar said the Taliban is willing to establish an inclusive political structure in Afghanistan, which protects human rights as well as the rights and interests of women and children.FIRST VISIT OF TOP TALIBAN LEADER TO CHINABaradar, who heads the Taliban’s political office in Qatar and is the lead negotiator for talks with the US, is leading a nine-member Taliban delegation on a two-day visit to China.This is the first time a senior Taliban leader has visited China since the group launched an offensive to capture territories across Afghanistan, coinciding with the rapid drawdown of US and Nato forces.Calling the Afghan Taliban a “critical military and political force in the country”, Wang said the group is “expected to play an important role in the peace, reconciliation and reconstruction process of Afghanistan”.The Chinese diplomat called on the Afghan Taliban to put their national interests “…first and foremost, hold high the banner of peace talks, establish the goal of peace, create a positive image and adopt an inclusive policy”.China had hosted a low-profile meeting with a Taliban delegation in 2019, which met Deng Xijun, then the special envoy for Afghanistan.Back channel links with the group stretch back to the early 1990s through Pakistan, Beijing’s “iron brother”.The atheist Communist Party of China and the fundamentalist Taliban have little in common ideologically but shared mutual interests could form the basis of pragmatic if wary ties.The impact and the aftermath of the withdrawal of foreign forces from the war-ravaged country, the peace process and security issues were discussed during the meeting.EAST TURKESTAN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT THREAT“The sudden withdrawal of forces by the United States and Nato from Afghanistan marks the failure of United States’ Afghanistan policy, and Afghan people now face an important opportunity to stabilise and develop their own country,” Wang was quoted as telling Baradar in an official readout issued by the Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday.On the issue of ETIM, Wang said he hoped the Taliban would crack down on them as it was a “direct threat to China’s national security”, according to the readout.“The ETIM, an international terrorist group listed by the UN Security Council, poses direct threats to China’s national security and territorial integrity, and it is the common responsibility of the international community to fight against it,” he said.Wang called on the Taliban to draw a clear line from “…ETIM and other terrorist groups, and resolutely and effectively crack down on them, so as to remove obstacles and create favourable conditions for regional peace, stability and development”.China says ETIM is active in the northwestern frontier province of Xinjiang, which has a border of about 70km with Afghanistan, and is triggering unrest in the remote region.On his part, Baradar, as per the Chinese readout, said, “China has always been a trustworthy friend of the Afghan people”.“The Afghan Taliban, with sincerity for achieving peace, is willing to work with all parties to establish an inclusive political structure in Afghanistan that is accepted by all Afghan people and protects human rights as well as the rights and interests of women and children,” Baradar said.INVOLVEMENT OF CHINA IN AFGHAN PEACE PROCESSBaradar added that the Taliban hoped that China would be more involved in Afghanistan’s peace and reconstruction process, and play a bigger role in the country’s future reconstruction and economic development.He said the Afghan Taliban would make its own efforts in creating a favourable investment environment. “Politics, economy and issues related to the security of both countries and the current situation of Afghanistan, and the peace process were discussed in the meetings,” Taliban spokesperson Mohammed Naeem tweeted.Naeem added that the group was also meeting China’s special envoy for Afghanistan and that the trip took place after an invitation from the Chinese authorities. “(The) delegation assured China that they will not allow anyone to use Afghan soil against China,” Naeem said. “China also reiterated its commitment of continuation of their assistance with Afghans and said they will not interfere in Afghanistan’s issues but will help to solve the problems and ensure restoration of peace in the country.”HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN XINJIANGIt was not immediately known if the Taliban delegation brought up the issue of human rights abuses against Muslim minorities especially the Uighurs in Xinjiang during the meeting.It is however likely that as the two sides attempt to build a transactional relationship - security for China, international legitimacy for the Taliban, for one, - both will try to deftly negotiate the thorny issue of Beijing’s treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang. “We care about the oppression of Muslims, be it in Palestine, in Myanmar, or in China, and we care about the oppression of non-Muslims anywhere in the world,” a senior Taliban representative had recently told The Wall Street Journal. “But what we are not going to do is interfere in China’s internal affairs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-urges-taliban-to-crack-down-on-etim-101627472628062.html
28-07-2021||World||Chinese national shot at in Karachi two weeks after blast||A Chinese national was shot and wounded in Karachi on Wednesday, reported Reuters. The victim was shot at by two bike-borne masked men while he was enroute to Karachi’s industrial area. "Two men wearing face masks riding a motorcycle carried out the shooting," deputy inspector general Javed Akbar Riaz said. Riaz told AFP that the Chinese individual was not hit on any vital parts of his body and is currently stable.The latest attack on the Chinese individual comes just two weeks after 13 people, including nine Chinese citizens working on a dam project, were killed when their bus was hit by an explosion in Kohistan, northwest Pakistan, on July 14.The Chinese nationals who were killed were working at the Dasu hydroelectric project, which is being built by China in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province as a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project. It was not clear if the victim of the latest attack was also involved with any CPEC project.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called the attack an “isolated case” and expressed confidence in Pakistan’s ability to protect Chinese citizens. "We have full confidence in the Pakistan side's protection of Chinese citizens and property in Pakistan," he told the media persons at a briefing in Beijing.Zhao’s statement marks a change of Beijing’s tone, after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang had ruled the July 14 blast a "terrorist attack" and asked Pakistan to take to task the perpetrators of the crime.Even though Pakistani officials have not offered any concrete details on the explosion, Chinese media carried reports stating the blast was carried out by Uyghur militants or the Pakistani Taliban, according to AFP.China-funded projects have fuelled discontent in local separatist groups who claim the CPEC projects do not benefit locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-national-shot-at-in-karachi-two-weeks-after-blast-101627471362126.html

He was commenting on rape and his comment which he now has denied drew flak.In an interview with PBS NewsHour on Wednesday, Imran Khan said he was talking about Pakistani society and sex crimes, which are not limited to women. Asserting that he knows all his interviews and all that he says, Khan on Wednesday said that he would never say such a "stupid thing" that a person who is raped is somehow responsible. "Anyone who commits rape, solely and solely that person is responsible. So let’s be clear about that. No matter how provocative the woman is or whatever she wears, the person who commits rape is fully responsible. Never is the victim responsible," he said.He also said the compared to the Western countries, rape cases in Pakistan form a minuscule. "As far as a woman’s dignity and respect goes, I can say after going all over the world, this society gives more respect and dignity to women," Khan said.This was not the first time that Imran Khan was castigated as a "rape apologist" by international media. In April this year, in a state-run channel, he purportedly claimed that wearing a veil would protect women from sexual assault.Explaining his veil remark, he told Jonathan, "I said the concept of 'pardah' is to avoid temptation in society. We don't have discos here, we don't have nightclubs... So this is a completely different society, a way of life here...If a woman is wearing very few clothes, it will have an impact. It will have an impact on the men unless they’re robots. I mean it’s common sense."This explanation led to the outrage which, he said in the latest interview, was taken out of context deliberately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/never-would-i-say-such-stupid-thing-pak-pm-says-he-never-blamed-rape-victims-101627468873720.html

Britain’s strict travel rules owing to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has severely affected the airline and tourism industry, drawing flak for falling behind European Union in attracting tourists.According to LBC radio, Johnson said he wanted fully vaccinated US nationals to visit England as they did before the pandemic. "We want people to be able to come from the US freely in a way that they normally do. We're talking to them the whole time," LBC quoted Johnson as saying in an interview.Both the US and UK are witnessing another Covid-19 wave driven by a highly transmissible Delta variant but the countries are relying on high vaccination coverage to open up economies. While each of the four individual nations of Britain has the right to set different entry restrictions during the pandemic, any easing of travel restrictions could provide a huge boost to the travel industry reeling under 16 months of restrictions."At the moment we're dealing with a Delta wave, the U.S is dealing with a Delta wave, but be assured that we are on it the whole time. As soon as we have something to say about travel corridors you'll be hearing from us."Earlier this month, Britain removed almost all restrictions related to Covid-19 and opened up international travel under which fully vaccinated Britons and children under the age of 18 will no longer have to quarantine. The UK is reportedly set to announce similar relaxation for visitors from the US and the EU. Currently, non-Britons travelling to the UK from countries and territories on the “amber list” are required to quarantine for at least 10 days.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-discussing-travel-corridor-with-us-amid-delta-threat-report-101627468936838.html

Speaking at a joint press conference after India-US delegation-level talks, Blinken said the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hit both countries very hard and the US will not forget the aid and assistance India provided early in the pandemic.“I am proud we could return the gesture to India,” Blinken told the press conference, referring to the assistance provided to India during the second Covid wave.The top US diplomat said that the two sides discussed regional security issues including Afghanistan, echoing Jaishankar’s remark that there was much more convergence on the matter than divergence. Blinken stressed that both sides are committed to the proposition that there is no military solution to the conflict.“There has to be a peaceful resolution that requires the Taliban and the Afghan government to come to the table and we both agree, I think, strongly that any future government in Afghanistan has to be inclusive and fully representative of Afghan people,” said Blinken, adding that it has to be “Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process.”The Taliban have been rapidly making advances in Afghanistan after US troops started withdrawal from the war-torn region. But Blinken said that the US remains engaged in Afghanistan through important programmes that support the country economically through development and security assistance.“We are very much engaged in the diplomacy of working to bring parties together at the table for the resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan,” he added.Also Read | Antony Blinken meets Dalai Lama's representative in Delhi.

He added that India hopes the US will take a "sympathetic view" of other travellers as well in the days to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/few-relationships-more-vital-blinken-says-us-won-t-forget-india-s-early-pandemic-aid-101627466534686.html
28-07-2021||World||Taliban seek support of China for expanding footprint in Afghanistan||With frontline Taliban leader Mullah Baradar Akhund meeting Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on July 27, the conservative Sunni Islamist group is seeking support of Beijing to expand its footprint in Afghanistan after assuring the middle-kingdom that Afghanistan under Taliban will not allow its territory to be used by terrorists to target any third country. The assurance was given by Mullah Barader as Beijing is worried that Uighur extremist movement may get shelter in Emirate of Afghanistan through the Wakhan corridor.Mullah Baradar travelled to China for two days as the head of a high-ranking delegation of nine people and held separate meetings with Wang, China's deputy foreign minister and Chinese special representative for Afghanistan, the Taliban said in a statement."The meetings focused on political, economic and security issues related to the two countries, the current situation in Afghanistan and the peace process," the statement added.By reassuring Beijing that it will not allow the Afghan territory to be used against any third country, the Taliban are trying to allay global fears that Pakistan-based terror groups and pan-Islamic groups like Al Qaeda will not use the civilian strife in Afghanistan to establish terror training camps for targeting countries opposed to radical Islam. During its first term in power between 1996-2001, the Taliban gave shelter to majority of pan-Islamic terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, Harkat-ul-Ansar, HuJI Bangladesh, held training camps for Pakistan-based groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and virtually sponsored global jihad around the world.The Taliban delegation also thanked China for its continued cooperation with the people of Afghanistan, especially its continued cooperation in the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).According to Afghanistan watchers, the Taliban, with support of their handlers Pakistan, are seeking assurance from China to help them establish an emirate in Afghanistan lest US has second thoughts on the Sunni group after reports of large numbers of civilian casualties.The US has already declared that it will leave Afghanistan on August 31. "While Pakistan is trying to leverage its influence on Taliban to get close to revive its ties with the US, the Sunni Islamist group is piggybacking on Islamabad to strengthen its ties with China. The Chinese, on their part, are looking towards expanding the Belt and Road initiative into Afghanistan and thereon to Central Asia for taking a grip on bilateral trade with Afghanistan and exploiting resources like coal, copper and iron ore in that country," said diplomats based in US and India.China wants to use Afghanistan as a route to Central Asian republics of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-seek-support-of-china-for-expanding-footprint-in-afghanistan-101627462256131.html

The top US diplomat is on his maiden two-day official visit to India.Blinken, who took to Twitter soon after the meeting, shared a few photos from the gathering. The meeting was attended by Geshe Dorji Damdul, director of Tibet House in Delhi, cultural centre of the Dalai Lama. I was pleased to meet civil society leaders today. The U.S. and India share a commitment to democratic values; this is part of the bedrock of our relationship and reflective of India’s pluralistic society and history of harmony. Civil society helps advance these values. pic.twitter.com/5NL2WiQ13oBlinken also met briefly with Ngodup Dongchung, a representative of the Dalai Lama. A State Department spokesperson said, "Secretary Blinken had an opportunity to meet briefly this morning in New Delhi with a representative of His Holiness the Dalai Lama."Dongchung reportedly held a separate 10-minute meeting with US envoy Atul Keshap during the day.The meeting is the one of the most significant contacts the US has so far made with the Tibetan leadership since the Dalai Lama met then-president Barack Obama in Washington in 2016.Beijing says Tibet is a part of China and has labelled the Dalai Lama a dangerous separatist. China's foreign ministry has not responded to a request for comment.Close on the wheels of Blinken's visit, US defense secretary Lloyd Austin had said China was working against the shared principles and interests of the US and its partners across the Indo-Pacific. While the US and its friends are committed to inclusion and freedom of the seas, China had shown “unwillingness to resolve disputes peacefully and respect the rule of law”, he said.The CTA and Tibetan advocacy groups have received a boost in international support in recent months amid rising criticism of China's human rights record, particularly from the United States.In November, Lobsang Sangay, the former head of the Tibetan government in exile, visited the White House, the first such visit in six decades.A month later, the US Congress passed the Tibet Policy and Support Act, which calls for the right of Tibetans to choose the successor to the Dalai Lama, and the establishment of a US consulate in the Tibetan capital Lhasa.Earlier, the US said it backed India’s emergence as a leading global power and vital partner to make the Indo-Pacific a region of stability and economic inclusion.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-meets-dalai-lama-s-representative-in-delhi-will-china-respond-101627459741844.html

The US publication has quoted a report from Federation of American Scientists (FAS) to say that as many as 110 silos have been detected in the western desert area of the country.The FAS report, published on Monday, is based on satellite images obtained by the organisation. It said that this is the second such silo after one near Yumen in Gansu province, as reported by Washington Post. The second missile silo field in Hami (Xinjiang province) is located 380 kilometres from the Yumen site, according to FAS.Satellite data can be a powerful tool for reporters investigating important issues like the discovery of 100s of Chinese missile silos (x2), the impacts of extreme weather and natural disasters, & much more. Read our latest blog to see this work in action: https://t.co/SzD58gONdf pic.twitter.com/YVFr88JQ0cIt also claimed that the construction at Hami site began in March this year and is continuing at a rapid pace. The area is being developed in a grid-like outline, the FAS report said.As many as 14 dome structures are visible at the Hami construction site, FAS said based on the satellite pictures it obtained. The higher resolution images of the site were provided by Planet, it added."This is the second time in two months the public has discovered what we have been saying all along about the growing threat the world faces and the veil of secrecy that surrounds it," the US Strategic Command said on Twitter, reacting to the latest news about missile silos and tagging a New York Times story on it.This is the second time in two months the public has discovered what we have been saying all along about the growing threat the world faces and the veil of secrecy that surrounds it.https://t.co/OTFkP14H5oFAS said that these sites signify "the most significant expansion of the Chinese nuclear arsenal ever". It added that this is the most extensive silo construction since the US and Soviet missile silo construction during the Cold War.These silos will add to China's arsenal of nuclear tipped Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), which according to FAS has now swelled to 250 - constituting more than half of the size of the entire US ICBM force.Earlier, after the discovery of missile silos in Gansu, the United States had called the dramatic build-up "concerning" and called for practical measures to reduce the risks of destabilising arms race.Beijing, meanwhile, has said that its arsenal is dwarfed by those of the United States and Russia and it is ready to conduct bilateral dialogues on strategic security "on the basis of equality and mutual respect."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-building-second-nuclear-missile-silo-field-claims-report-us-concerned-101627455116842.html

There was no word on the meeting from the Chinese side or the Taliban. Several images of Wang with the Taliban delegation, which included spokesman Suhail Shaheen, were posted on social media. Baradar, who heads the Taliban’s political office in Qatar and has been the lead negotiator for talks with the US, met Wang in the northern city of Tianjin, the South China Morning Post reported citing sources familiar with the arrangements. This is the first time a senior Taliban leader has visited China since the group launched a massive offensive to capture territory across Afghanistan, coinciding with the rapid drawdown of US and NATO forces. China has hosted a Taliban delegation in 2019 that met Deng Xijun, then the special envoy for Afghanistan. Also Read | Pak’s TTP supports Taliban as 6,000 terrorists still in Afghanistan: UN reportChinese officials had in the past participated in talks with the Taliban along with representatives from Afghanistan, the US and Pakistan but these had not resulted in any forward movement in efforts to find a political settlement. At a meeting with his Afghan and Pakistani counterparts in June, Wang vowed to “bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream” and offered to host intra-Afghan peace talks. At a meeting between Wang and his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi in China on July 24, the two sides agreed to take joint actions to tackle the “spillover effect” from the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan. China and Pakistan are facing the “direct effect” of the worsening situation in Afghanistan and both countries will pursue the “hope for peace in an attempt to prevent a civil war in Afghanistan and mediate for negotiations between the Afghans”, Wang was quoted as saying by China’s state media. The two countries will “jointly combat terrorism, push all major forces in Afghanistan to draw a clear line with terrorism, resolutely crack down on terrorist forces such as the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), and prevent Afghanistan from falling again into being a hotbed for terrorism”, Wang added. According to a new UN report, ETIM has several hundred fighters in Afghanistan, primarily in Badakhshan and neighbouring provinces. ETIM wants to establish a Uyghur state in Xinjiang and facilitates the movement of fighters from Afghanistan to China, the UN report said. ETIM reportedly has relationships with al-Qaeda, Islamic State-Khorasan and Jamaat Ansarullah and Hajji Furqan, the group’s deputy commander, leads as many as 1,000 foreign terrorists, including 400 in Badakhshan province. ETIM continues to be China’s main concern in Afghanistan and the focus of its efforts to ensure peace and stability in the war-torn country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-delegation-meets-chinese-foreign-minister-wang-yi-101627454609763.html
28-07-2021||World||Canadian provinces reveal probing claims of abuse of indigenous children||Law enforcement officers in Canada’s Manitoba province have revealed that they conducted a decade-long investigation into claims of sexual abuse of indigenous children at a residential school there, while a similar probe has been launched in the province of Saskatchewan.The two disclosures follow a series of embarrassing discoveries of unmarked graves of indigenous children at or near the sites of Catholic church-run residential schools across Canada in developments that have jolted the nation.Manitoba’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said its Major Crime Services had been carrying probative investigations following allegations of sexual abuse at Fort Alexander Residential School. A probative investigation, it said, “means gathering information to determine what took place as well as the scope of the occurrences it commenced”.The Manitoba RCMP said the allegations were “historical in nature” and investigators travelled to Ottawa to review archival records of the school “to identify anyone involved” in the crimes that took place against indigenous children. Investigators interacted with over 700 people across North America “in an effort to locate any possible victims or witnesses” and a criminal investigation was launched in 2011. The probe team got hold of statements from 75 witnesses and victims.“There have been more than 680 investigational tasks identified and completed so far and more than 80 RCMP investigators have been engaged in this investigation,” the Manitoba RCMP said.CBC News, meanwhile, reported that Saskatchewan province’s RCMP was investigating a historical complaint about similar crimes having taken place at Timber Bay Residential School.Canada’s residential schools in question - operated by the Catholic Church from the late 19th century until the second half of the 20th – used to board indigenous children.Unmarked graves, numbering 215, were first found at the site of a school in Kamloops, British Columbia in June. The episode was followed a chain of similar discoveries at other locations, with the total number of graves of indigenous children discovered totalling over 1,100 so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-provinces-reveal-probing-claims-of-abuse-of-indigenous-children-101627453769692.html
28-07-2021||World||Trudeau: We have enough anti-Covid shots to vaccinate entire eligible population||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that Canada now has enough vaccines to fully inoculate every eligible person in the country against Covid-19.Trudeau said that with the arrival of the latest shipment of Covid-19 vaccines, Canada has so far received 66 million doses - enough for fully vaccinate everyone in the country two months ahead of the September deadline he had set.The Canadian PM’s announcement came shortly after the province of Quebec offered a third dose for those who require it for travel.“The best way to end this pandemic is for everyone to get their shots as soon as they can,” Trudeau said. “Today’s milestone is a clear sign that we are getting closer to this goal. I urge Canadians to book their vaccine today, to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their communities.” The effort to bring vaccines into the country was headed by Indo-Canadian minister of public services and procurement, Anita Anand. “The government has worked extremely hard to deliver vaccines to Canadians as fast as possible, and now has enough doses for every eligible person in Canada - two months ahead of our original projections,” Anand said. “This milestone was made possible by a true Team Canada effort across government.”So far, 79.66% of those above the age of 12 have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Of the total population eligible for anti-Covid jabs, 57.45% are fully vaccinated, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Canada’s vaccination programme had started in the second week of December last year.Meanwhile, with Covid-19 vaccines aplenty, Quebec has taken the extraordinary step of offering a third dose to those who need it for travel purposes. In its latest guidelines, the province said it considers “well protected against Covid-19” those who have received two doses of the AstraZeneca or Covishield jabs or a combination of the two, or one of either followed by an mRNA jab for the second. In Québec, it said “these individuals are considered to be adequately protected”, but that may not apply in all countries as “there is no international consensus on what is valid proof of adequate vaccination”.In what it described as an “exceptional measure”, it said “people who are required to get an additional dose of an RNA vaccine can get one in a vaccination centre, if required to travel outside the country”.However, it warned that such persons “must be properly guided to be informed of the potential risks associated with the additional dose, compared to the benefits of the planned trip. At this time, no study has assessed the impact of such an additional dose”.A debate is raging in Canada on this matter, since AZ has yet to be authorised in the United States, and Covishield in several European nations, and Canada’s policy of mixing and matching jabs could also be a hurdle for international travellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-we-have-enough-anti-covid-shots-to-vaccinate-entire-eligible-population-101627449268950.html

According to Bhutan's health ministry, the vaccines that were received from foreign donations were used up in this inoculation drive.Bhutan, situated between India and China, has a population of less than eight lakh. The Himalayan kingdom started vaccinating its population with the second dose of the Covid-19 shot from July 20 and within seven days i.e. by July 27 (Tuesday), 90% of the entire population had been fully vaccinated, said the country's health ministry.The United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) praised the rapid vaccination rate against Covid-19 in Bhutan and called it a "great success story".“We really need a world in which the countries which have surplus vaccines really do donate to those countries that haven’t received (shots) so far,” news agency AFP quoted Will Parks, Unicef's Bhutan representative, as saying. “And if there’s anything that I hope the world that can learn, is that a country like Bhutan with very few doctors, very few nurses, but a really committed king and leadership in the government mobilising society – it’s not impossible to vaccinate the whole country.”Bhutan had quickly used up the 550,000 AstraZeneca jabs donated by India back in March and early April for the first vaccine shots to its citizenry. However, due to a subsequent surge in Covid-19 infections in India, the exports were halted, which eventually led to a growing time gap between the first and the second doses.Bhutan later launched an appeal for donations, following which several Western countries sent Covid-19 vaccine doses to the Himalayan nation. Around half a million Moderna doses arrived from the United States soon, followed by 250,000 AstraZeneca shots from Denmark in mid-July.China, Bulgaria, Croatia, and other nations are also expected to send more than 150,000 doses of the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Sinopharm vaccines to Bhutan soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-fully-vaccinates-90-population-in-one-week-unicef-lauds-success-story-101627447149530.html
28-07-2021||World||Covid-19: US brings back face masks to control spread of Delta variant||The top US health agency has reversed its earlier mask protocol for those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, issuing a new guidance issued on Tuesday that recommends the use of face coverings in high-risk areas.“To maximise protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission,” the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in its latest guidance.More than two months ago, on May 13, the CDC had recommended that people who are fully vaccinated - those who received both shots of the two-dose Covid-19 vaccines such as Moderna and Pfizer - need not wear masks both indoors and outdoors.The Alpha variant of the coronavirus, which was prevalent at that time, was not as highly transmissible as Delta, which has been spreading rapidly in the United States feeding primarily on the unvaccinated. The CDC has called an ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”.Daily tallies of new cases have been spiking, going up to 89,418 on Monday, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker. Almost all new hospitalisation cases and deaths in the country are of those infected by the Delta variant of the virus.US President Joe Biden called the new guidance “another step on our journey to defeating this virus” and appealed to Americans who live in the areas covered by the CDC guidance to follow it. “I certainly will when I travel to these areas,” he said, underscoring his support for it.Republicans, especially former US president Donald Trump, slammed the new mask guidance as overreach by the government, continuing their opposition to mitigation measures.Their arguments have included questioning the efficacy and safety of Covid vaccines, which has prevented many of them from getting the shots that are free and easily available.“We won’t go back. We won’t mask our children,” said Trump, stepping up his attacks on mitigation measures. “Brave Americans learned how to safely and responsibly live and fight back.”Trump’s reluctance to use masks when he was president contributed to the politicisation of America’s fight against the pandemic, in which Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, has come to be portrayed as a villain by the former president’s allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-us-brings-back-face-masks-to-control-spread-of-delta-variant-101627447108590.html
28-07-2021||World||China gets Uyghur man arrested from Morocco, activists fear extradition||Moroccan authorities have arrested an Uyghur activist in exile based on a Chinese terrorism warrant distributed by Interpol, according to information from Moroccan police and a rights group that tracks people detained by China.Activists fear Yidiresi Aishan will be extradited to China, and say the arrest is politically driven and part of a broader Chinese campaign to hunt down perceived dissidents outside its borders.Morocco's General Directorate for National Security said Tuesday that a Chinese citizen was arrested after landing at Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca on July 20, upon arrival from Istanbul.He “was the subject of a red notice issued by Interpol due to his suspected belonging to an organization on the lists of terrorist organizations,” the directorate said.The red notice — the equivalent of being put on Interpol's most-wanted list — was issued at the request of China, which is seeking his extradition, the directorate said. It said Moroccan authorities notified Interpol and the Chinese authorities about the arrest, and the Chinese citizen was referred to prosecutors pending the extradition procedure.Moroccan police didn't publicly name the arrested man, but nongovernmental organization Safeguard Defenders identified him as Aishan. The group specializes in cases of people detained by China.Aishan, a 33-year-old computer engineer and father of three, has been based in Turkey since 2012, where he worked as a web designer and activist and has residency papers, according to friend and colleague Abduweli Ayup.Aishan worked on an Uyghur diaspora online newspaper and assisted other activists in media outreach and collecting testimonies of abuse in China's Xinjiang province.After repeated arrests in Turkey, Aishan left Istanbul for Casablanca on the evening of July 19, Ayup said. Aishan called his wife on Saturday and said he was being deported, according to Ayup, who is in touch with Aishan's family.Interpol and the Chinese Embassy in Morocco didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the arrest. The exact charges against him are unclear.Morocco ratified an extradition treaty with China in 2017, among several such treaties China has made in recent years.China has described its sweeping lockup of a million or more Uyghurs and other largely Muslim minorities as a “war against terror,” after knifings and bombings by a small number of extremist Uyghurs native to Xinjiang.Researchers say many innocent people have been detained for things like going abroad or attending religious gatherings.Safeguard Defenders has appealed to the Moroccan ambassadors in Washington and Brussels not to extradite Aishan. It is “not uncommon” for Chinese authorities to obtain Interpol red notices for Uyghur and other dissidents abroad, said Peter Dahlin of Safeguard Defenders.In a similar case, a Chinese teenager who says he's a US permanent resident was arrested in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in April while transferring for a flight. Chinese officials had sought Wang Jingyu, a 19-year-old student, over his online comments about deadly border clashes between Chinese and Indian forces last year.The US state department called it a human rights concern. Wang was freed in May, and he and his fiancee fled to the Netherlands.Experts say both cases feed into growing fears of extraterritorial reach by China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-gets-uyghur-man-arrested-from-morocco-activists-fear-extradition-101627443030152.html

28-07-2021||World||'Putin has a real problem': Biden says Russia messing with 2022 polls, warns cyberattacks could spell war||Joe Biden, the president of the United States of America, on Tuesday, accused his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, of trying to disrupt the 2022 US midterm elections, slated to be held in November next year, when all 435 seats in the US House of Representatives and 34 of the 100 seats in the Senate will be contested. Referring to Putin as "dangerous", the US president alleged that his Russian counterpart is leading an economy that only has nuclear weapons and "nothing else".Biden made these remarks to about 120 representatives of the US intelligence who gathered on this day at the headquarters of the office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI) in northern Virginia."Look at what Russia doing already about the 2022 elections and misinformation," said the US president, referring to the information he received during his daily briefing. Without elaborating much on the matter, Biden said that the Russian president's actions are a "pure violation" of the United States' sovereignty."Putin has a real problem," Biden said. "He is sitting on top of an economy that has nuclear weapons and nothing else. He knows he is in real trouble, which makes him even more dangerous in my view."The US president also pointed out the recent increase in cyberattacks, including ransomware, allegedly conducted by Moscow. "If we end up in a war, a real shooting war, with a major power, it's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach," Biden warned, adding that the ransomware attacks typically see hackers encrypting victims' data and then demanding money for restored access.The US midterm elections are scheduled to be held on November 8, 2022. As many as 39 state and territorial gubernatorial and numerous other state and local elections are also slated to be held around the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-has-a-real-problem-biden-accuses-russia-of-messing-with-2022-polls-101627438431162.html
28-07-2021||World||Vaccinated people in high Covid-risk areas of US need to mask again||People vaccinated against Covid-19 in high-risk parts of the United States should resume wearing masks indoors, the top health authority said Tuesday, a major shift in coronavirus guidance that underscores the country's struggle to suppress the Delta variant.President Joe Biden said the announcement showed that America needs to "do better" on vaccinations, adding that a mandate for the country's more than two million federal workers was now "under consideration."Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Rochelle Walensky relayed the mask decision in a press call, citing new data that shows that while vaccines remain highly effective, rare breakthrough cases involving Delta have an increased risk of onward transmission."In areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public indoor settings," she said.According to the latest CDC data, much of the southern United States is experiencing high or substantial transmission, while highly vaccinated parts of the Northeast are mostly experiencing moderate rates of community transmission.Substantial is defined as being between 50 to 100 daily cases per 100,000 people over a seven day average, while high is defined as more than 100 daily cases per 100,000.In a statement following the move, Biden said he would lay out new steps on Thursday to overcome a lag in vaccinations, which have stalled badly for months despite the fact the United States has the highest supply of any country.In a separate address to the US intelligence community, when asked about a possible vaccine mandate for US federal workers, Biden replied: "That's under consideration right now."On Monday, the Veterans Affairs department said it would require its frontline health workers, some 115,000 people, to get the shot, becoming the first federal agency to institute the requirement.- 'Temporary' measure -Walensky stressed that so-called "breakthrough" cases among people who are vaccinated remain rare -- authorized shots reduce the risk of symptomatic disease seven-fold, and hospitalizations and deaths by a factor of twenty.However, new CDC research showed that when a vaccinated person does become infected, their viral load is similar to an unvaccinated person."That leads us to believe that the breakthrough infections, rare as they are, have the potential to forward transmit at the same capacity of an unvaccinated person."To stem the spread of the Delta variant, the CDC will recommend schools adopt universal masking, including teachers, staff, students and visitors -- regardless of vaccination status -- when they reopen in fall, she added.As recently as last week, the CDC defended its May decision that vaccinated people do not have to wear masks indoors in most circumstances, with exceptions including public transit and hospitals.But infection numbers are now swelling, thanks to the Delta variant, which accounts for around 90 percent of cases.The latest seven day average of daily cases is more than 56,000, similar to levels last seen in April.Forty-nine percent of the US population is fully vaccinated, but the vaccination rate is heavily skewed between politically liberal and conservative parts of the country.Walensky stressed she saw masks as a "temporary" measure, adding: "What we really need to do to drive down these transmissions in areas of high transmission is to get more and more people vaccinated."- Vaccines the solution -Eric Cioe-Pena, director of Global Health at Northwell Health in New York, told AFP that rather than being a reflection of vaccines losing their efficacy, "this is a solution to a problem that exists because we have high levels of people that are not vaccinated.""The main predictor of how much Covid is going to surge in an area is the vaccination rate," he added, so areas that are highly vaccinated will be de facto exempted from the new guidance.According to a recent paper in the journal Virological, the amount of virus found in the first tests of patients with the Delta variant was 1,000 times higher than patients in the first wave of the virus in 2020, greatly increasing its contagiousness.Last month, Israel reinstituted mask mandates, just 10 days after lifting them, due to the Delta variant, and local US jurisdictions, including Los Angeles County, have taken similar steps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-people-in-high-covid-risk-areas-of-us-need-to-mask-again-101627436058377.html
28-07-2021||World||Considering mandatory vaccines for federal workers: Biden||President Joe Biden said he is weighing a requirement for federal workers to get vaccinated as the highly contagious delta variant spreads throughout the USA Covid-19 vaccine mandate for federal workers is “under consideration,” Biden told reporters on Tuesday after visiting the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in Virginia.The White House is considering whether to require workers to confirm that they’ve been vaccinated, or submit to regular testing and follow strict protocols like wearing masks, even in areas where there isn’t significant community spread, according to a person familiar with the matter.The president’s comments reflect the heightened concern among American public health officials about the delta variant. He made the remarks after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tightened mask guidance, advising that fully vaccinated individuals cover their faces indoors in places where the virus is rapidly spreading.“The more we learn, the more we learn about this virus and the delta variation, the more we have to be worried and concerned,” Biden said.The White House on Tuesday told staff that they must again wear masks at the complex.Covid fatalities in the US surged 48% over the past week to a daily average of 239 and hospitalizations are also on the rise. The CDC says the delta variant now makes up 83% of all sequenced Covid-19 cases in the US, up from 50% at the beginning of the month. Areas of the country with limited vaccination coverage are allowing spread of the highly transmissible variant.CDC Director Rochelle Walenksy said recent data suggests that some vaccinated people who get infected with the delta variant can spread it to others. Yet Biden, Walensky and other health officials stressed that getting a Covid-19 vaccine offers the best protection against death, hospitalization and illness.Just over 69% of American adults have had at least one vaccine shot, still short of the 70% goal Biden set for the country to meet by July 4.“There’s only one thing we know for sure: If those other 100 million people got vaccinated, we’d be in a very different world,” Biden said Tuesday. “So get vaccinated. If you haven’t, you’re not nearly as smart as I said you were.”In a written statement, Biden called the revised CDC guidelines “another step on our journey to defeating this virus.” He said he would follow it when he travels to areas with high rates of infection. Biden also said that on Thursday he would “lay out the next steps” for getting more Americans vaccinated, but did not specify them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/considering-mandatory-vaccines-for-federal-workers-biden-101627427718562.html
28-07-2021||World||Mask up: CDC set to tell Americans||US health officials will return to tighter guidelines for the use of masks, advising that fully vaccinated individuals wear them in public indoor settings in places where the coronavirus is spreading rapidly as part of a response to the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is expected to recommend that teachers, staff, students and visitors to K-12 schools wear masks indoors regardless of vaccination status, according to a preview of the guidance. Children should return to full-time, in-person learning in the fall with prevention strategies in place, the preview said.Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, has warned that the US is moving in the wrong direction in combating a new Covid wave spurred on by Delta.CDC director Rochelle Walensky is planning a press briefing where she’ll discuss breakthrough infections in vaccinated people and using masks to prevent further outbreaks in areas of substantial and high transmission.A growing number of public-health experts have urged the agency to recommend that even fully vaccinated people wear face masks in public amid the resurgence of cases fed by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.Fauci said new recommendations on face masks were under active consideration on CNN on Sunday.China: Nanjing sealed offThe city of Nanjing in eastern China has been virtually sealed off and residents advised to stay indoors after 31 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday in the past 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections up to 112 in the ongoing outbreak. Authorities said genetic sequencing of the virus from the cluster turned out to be of the Delta variant.Beijing calls on WHO to probe Fort Detrick labChina hit back at the US over the investigation into the origin of the Covid-19 virus, with Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the country’s foreign affairs ministry, suggesting on Monday that if labs are to be investigated, then the World Health Organization (WHO) should also probe Fort Detrick, which is a military base in Maryland, US.“If labs are to be investigated, then the WHO experts should go to Fort Detrick. The US should act transparently and responsibly as soon as possible and invite WHO experts for an inquiry into the Fort Detrick lab. Only in this way can truth be revealed to the world,” Zhao tweeted. The remark came in response to calls for a second round of investigation into the origin of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mask-up-cdc-set-to-tell-americans-101627419566102.html
28-07-2021||World||Vatican in the dock: Biggest criminal case in its modern history underway||A trial opened on Tuesday, within Vatican City’s imposing walls, of 10 defendants including a once powerful cardinal in a case based on a sprawling probe into the allegedly criminal management of the Holy See’s portfolio of assets, including donations by countless Catholics from the pews.Among the defendants is an Italian prelate, Angelo Becciu, a long-time Vatican diplomat whom Pope Francis raised to cardinal’s rank in 2018. After a web of scandals started unravelling during a two-year investigation, Francis gave Becciu the boot last year as chief of the Catholic church’s saint-making office. Francis also has removed Becciu’s rights as a cardinal.Less than three months ago, it would have been impossible for a cardinal to be in the dock in Vatican City state, which has its own justice system and even a jail. But Francis had a Vatican law changed so that Vatican-based cardinals and bishops can be prosecuted and judged by the Holy See’s lay criminal tribunal as long as the pontiff signs off on that. Becciu, 73, is charged with embezzlement and with pressing a monsignor to recant information he supplied to prosecutors about the handling of a disastrous Vatican real estate investment in London. Becciu has denied any wrongdoing.The presiding judge, Giuseppe Pignatone, is a retired chief prosecutor of Rome who earlier in his career took on the Mafia and economic wrongdoing in Sicily.To accommodate the largest criminal trial in the Vatican’s modern history, the hearings are being held in a large hall converted into a courtroom in the Vatican Museums. Defendants are alleged to have had various roles in actions that effectively cost the Holy See tens of millions of dollars in donated funds through poor investments, dealings with shady money managers and purported favours to friends and family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vatican-in-the-dock-biggest-criminal-case-in-its-modern-history-underway-101627419382734.html
