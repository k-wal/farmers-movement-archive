The search and rescue operation has stretched into the eighth day after the 12-storey Champlain Towers South in Surfside, Florida, partially collapsed last week.During a news conference on Thursday, Miami-Dade County Fire Chief Alan Cominsky was asked about a female voice that was heard in the initial hours of the search and rescue operation. Cominsky said that the rescuers heard a woman’s voice for several hours from underneath the rubble until she could no longer be heard."They were searching for a female voice, which we heard for several hours...eventually, we didn't hear her voice anymore," said Cominsky.“Eventually we didn't hear her voice anymore, we continued to search,” he said. “Again… that's emphasizing the magnitude of what we're going through,” he added.US President Joe Biden on Thursday arrived in Florida to offer comfort to the families of those who died in the collapse or remain missing after the condominium collapse. At least 18 deaths have been confirmed after six more bodies were found in the rubble, including two children, aged 4 and 10. Another 145 people remain missing.“This is life and death,” Biden said during a briefing. “We can do it, just the simple act of everyone doing what needs to be done, makes a difference.”“There’s gonna be a lot of pain and anxiety and suffering and even the need for psychological help in the days and months that follow," he said. "And so, we’re not going anywhere.”The rescue efforts were halted on Thursday after crews noticed widening cracks and up to a foot of movement in a large column, raising concern about the stability of the remaining structure, said Cominsky.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-condo-collapse-female-voice-was-heard-during-initial-rescue-efforts-says-official-101625160429915.html
01-07-2021||World||130 countries back deal on global minimum tax plan pushed at G7 Summit||Some 130 countries have backed a global minimum tax as part of a worldwide effort to keep multinational firms from dodging taxes by shifting their profits to countries with low rates.The agreement announced by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Thursday also provides for taxing the largest global companies in countries where they earn profits through online businesses but may have no physical presence.The agreement followed a proposal from US President Joe Biden for at least a 15% rate, an initiative that propelled the talks toward meeting a deadline for a deal by the middle of this year. The deal now will be discussed by the Group of 20 countries at meetings later this year in hopes of finishing the details in October and implementing the agreement in 2023.Under the deal, countries could tax their companies' foreign earnings if they go untaxed through subsidiaries in other countries. That would remove the incentive to use accounting and legal schemes to shift profits to low-rate countries since the profits would be taxed at home anyway.Not all of the 139 countries that joined the talks signed on to the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/130-countries-back-deal-on-global-minimum-tax-plan-pushed-at-g7-summit-101625157472313.html

Cheney was among the three House Republicans who voted for the impeachment of Donald Trump on the charge of inciting the riots that left five dead including a Capitol Police officer.Announcing the names for the select committee, Pelosi said that the January 6 attack was not simply an attack on a building, but an attack on the peaceful transfer of power. Apart from Cheney, the other members on the panel are Bennie Thompson, Zoe Lofgren, Adam Schiff, Pete Aguilar, Stephanie Murphy, Jamie Raskin, and Elaine Luria.After Pelosi’s announcement, Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney said in a statement that she was honoured to have been named to serve on the select committee to investigate the attack on the US Capitol. Recalling the insurrection, Cheney said that the day “saw the most sacred space in our Republic overrun by an angry and violent mob attempting to stop the counting of electoral votes and threatening the peaceful transfer of power. ““What happened on January 6th can never happen again. Those who are responsible for the attack need to be held accountable and this select committee will fulfill that responsibility in a professional, expeditious, and non-partisan manner,” she added.Liz Cheney was removed from GOP leadership earlier this year over her criticism of Donald Trump, whose allies have been railing against the Republicans who voted in favour of impeachment against the party line. The former President has even started a so-called revenge rally to endorse the primary challengers contesting against those who voted for the impeachment.“We’re giving tremendous endorsements,” Trump last week said in a telephonic interview with the conservative Newsmax channel. “Fake Republicans, anybody that voted for the impeachment doesn’t get it. But there weren’t too many of them. And I think most of them are being … primaried right now, so that’s good. I’ll be helping their opponent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pelosi-names-trump-s-republican-critic-liz-cheney-to-panel-investigating-jan-6-riot-101625153214657.html

Rumsfeld told a joint news conference that they discussed the “crisis and the tension in the region between India and Pakistan.”Citing Pakistan's then-president Parvez Musharraf’s speech, Rumsfeld said that Islamabad was taking certain actions and the United States was “certainly hopeful [it] will go a long way towards lowering tensions and promoting a constructive dialogue between India and Pakistan.”When asked whether Musharraf’s oral assurance was a reason enough for India to dismantle its military build-up, the defence secretary said, “India and Pakistan have to make these decisions. It's not the United States that makes these decisions. It's not any other country.”Also Read | US pushed for military cooperation with India after 9/11 attacks, says documentDuring Fernandes’ visit to Washington, reports had emerged that the United States had pressured Israel to not transfer the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) and other weapons to India. “Well, I do not think that the United States had put any pressure on Israel as far as I am aware,” Fernandes had told the press conference, saying there was no substance as far as he was concerned.Amid efforts from the international community to avert a crisis in the region, the situation seemed to have gone out of control after the Kaluchak terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir in May 2002. Ahead of Rumsfeld visit, however, Indian warships had started moving away from waters close to Pakistan, signalling a greater restraint.Rumsfeld visited New Delhi in June where he met Vajpayee, Fernandes, external affairs minister Jaswant Singh, and national security advisor Brajesh Mishra. "We feel that there are steps being taken which are constructive, and we must say that the leadership here in India has demonstrated their concern and their interest in seeing that things are resolved in an appropriate way," Rumsfeld said after meeting Singh and Mishra.The stand-off finally ended in October 2002 after months of diplomatic efforts from the international community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-donald-rumsfeld-who-died-aged-88-helped-india-pakistan-keep-peace-after-parliament-attack-101625152248026.html
