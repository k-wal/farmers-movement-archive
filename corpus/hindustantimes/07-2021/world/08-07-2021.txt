One percent of hate crime suspects had their cases resolved by a magistrate judge.The report did not provide an overall rate for the total number of suspects of federal crimes the department declined to prosecute during the study period. But the most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report available shows it declined to prosecute nearly 13% of people suspected of federal crimes in the 2018 fiscal year, a far lower rate.The department has warned that white supremacist groups https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-administration-unveils-plan-tackle-domestic-terrorism-2021-06-15 represent a rising security threat to the United States after the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol.At the same time, reports of hate-inspired attacks on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have also been on the rise, spurred by what many say were former President Donald Trump's inflammatory remarks blaming the COVID-19 pandemic on China.In May, Garland outlined new steps to help state and local police track and investigate hate crimes, which historically have been an under-reported crime to the FBI by local law enforcement, and called for the department to expedite the review of possible hate crimes.He also ordered all 93 U.S. Attorneys around the country to assign local criminal and civil prosecutors to serve as civil rights coordinators, and asked them to establish district alliances against hate to improve coordination with local law enforcement.Frank Pezzella, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that policy priorities are often a driving force behind whether hate crimes get prosecuted or not."Even at the precinct level - when there is a clear-cut policy ... that hate crimes are going to be pursued and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, it sends a message," he said.Thursday's report also showed that when U.S. Attorneys have pursued federal hate crime charges, they have been largely successful. Conviction rates for hate crimes rose, from 83% during 2005-2009, to 94% during 2015-2019.High-profile cases have included the successful prosecution of white supremacist Dylann Roof, who in December 2016 was found guilty of federal hate crimes after he gunned down nine Black parishioners at a church in South Carolina.In April, the Justice Department charged three Georgia men with federal hate crimes in last year's slaying of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who was gunned down as he was out jogging through a suburban neighborhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-chose-not-to-prosecute-82-of-hate-crime-suspects-101625765361432.html

The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) analysis showed that as of June 30, the deadline for applications for the new academic year, 9,930 applications were made by Indian students, up from last year’s 7,640 applications.While the increase in the number of applicants from Indian students has been on a steady rise in the past decade, the applications for the upcoming academic year has recorded the sharpest rise since 2012, the year from when UCAS analysis is available. India is only behind China in terms of most numbers of applications from foreign countries for British universities.There has been a 4% overall increase in total applicants from last year, which resulted in a more than 3% increase in offers made by British universities and colleges. UCAS has predicted that an increase in applications and offer making will see a record number of students starting university or college this autumn.Vivienne Stern, director of Universities UK International (UUKi), which represents over 140 British universities, said that the whole university community has shown incredible resilience this year. “It is really encouraging to see Indian students continue to make plans to study in the UK and we look forward to welcoming students safely,” she added.India remains on the UK’s travel “red list” which requires students with a valid visa to quarantine at a government-approved hotel for 10 days on arrival in the country. The UK has recently also announced that students will have the option to start online and travel later if necessary, or arriving for the start of term and being supported through any necessary quarantine period.“Today’s numbers show the clear demand for undergraduate study and apprenticeships is growing, rising significantly during the pandemic. Universities are ready to welcome more students onto courses this autumn and have worked hard to be flexible, enabling students to progress to their next level of study,” UCAS chief executive Clare Marchant said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/nri-news/record-applications-from-indian-students-for-uk-universities-despite-pandemic-101625764747030.html

Researchers have found single shots of these vaccines “barely” offered any protection.In India, AZ shots are being given under the Covishield brand, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. “Sera from individuals having received one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine barely inhibited variant Delta,” a group of French researchers said in an article published in journal Nature on Thursday. “Administration of two doses generated a neutralising response in 95% of individuals.”The finding is “good news”, Olivier Schwartz, lead author of the study and head of the Virus and Immunity Unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, told The Washington Post.This new study offers more clarity on the efficacy of vaccines against the Delta variant, which has been found to be more contagious than its previous versions and has caused maximum damage in India triggering the devastating second wave.The findings are along similar lines as those of a study released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) earlier this week, which said two doses of Covid-19 vaccines offer 95% protection against infection to 82% for those with only one shot. Delta is now tearing through parts of the United States with low levels of vaccination. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said Delta has emerged as the dominant strain in America, accounting for 51.7% of new infections, overtaking Alpha.The new study points to increased vulnerability to the Delta variant among people who have either not been vaccinated for whatever reason or who have skipped or delayed their second shots. In the United Kingdom, for instance, this variant was seen responsible for a recent surge because it opted to administer only one of the two shots of these vaccines to broaden coverage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/single-dose-of-two-shot-jabs-barely-work-against-delta-variant-study-101625764166220.html

"But we're used to it."On Tuesday, Russia recorded 737 virus deaths and 23,378 new cases -- a record for the country since the start of the pandemic.Almost all 760 beds are occupied in the Mariinsky hospital's "red zone", which is exclusively for Covid-19 patients.Doctors have not seen this many coronavirus patients since mid-January, when Russia was coming out of a second wave.And this time, they have also had to contend with the heat.While Russia's second city recorded its highest temperatures in more than a century at the end of June, staff at the Mariinsky worked for several hours dressed in full protective gear.- 'You have to get vaccinated' -Inside the intensive care department, patients in the most serious condition are hooked to ventilators.Two dozen patients of different ages lie either on their front or on their side.Many are awake. One middle-aged man lies on his back, looking at the machine he is hooked to while panting heavily. A younger woman lying on her side holds on to her ventilator tubes.All 24 beds of the intensive care unit are occupied, the head of the department Pavel Yermakov told AFP.He stresses that all the patients are in extremely serious condition and that a lot depends on their physical state "for them to get out".Within an hour, two bodies wrapped in black were taken away by staff."I am sorry," Yermakov said.But he added that "luckily, most get out."That was the case for Mikhail Konovalov, who spent several days in the intensive care department before beginning to recover."All I can say to everyone: you have to get vaccinated," the 45-year-old airport employee said from his hospital bed.But Russians continue to be sceptical towards vaccines.Despite free vaccinations having been available since December, so far only 18.5 of 146 million Russians have been fully vaccinated.The slow uptake illustrates hesitancy among the 54 percent of Russians who say they don't plan to get vaccinated.Outside the imperial-era hospital, a guard gestured to a line of people carrying flowers the way to the morgue."Since mid-June, more and more people end up here. It's Covid," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-doctors-battle-virus-and-heat-in-hospital-red-zone-101625749902488.html

The study, published in the journal Nature, highlighted the threat posed by viral mutations of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as the Delta variant is rapidly becoming the dominant strain across the world.The researchers found that the Delta variant, first detected in India, has mutations that allow it to evade some of the neutralising antibodies produced either by vaccines or previous coronavirus infection. The study, however, suggests that fully vaccinated individuals, with two doses of Pfizer-BioNtech or AstraZeneca vaccine, retain significant protection against the highly contagious Delta variant.The latest findings underline the urgency for administering the recommended regimen of two shots of Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccine to contain the virus at a time when Delta variant, a subtype of B.1.617 lineage, is threatening the pandemic response worldwide. India’s second wave of Covid-19 is believed to be largely driven by the Delta strain of coronavirus, which has been classified as a ‘variant of concern’ by the World Health Organization (WHO).Also Read | Delta variant is ‘Covid-19 on steroid’, says expert as US sees uptick in casesIn India, less than 5% of the population has been fully vaccinated and, taking the findings of the study at face value, the prevalence of Delta variant in the country suggests a large section remains under threat of the deadly contagion. While India has ramped up the vaccination drive in the past few days, experts have said that the third wave of Covid-19 could peak in October, given the low overall vaccination coverage.After weeks of lockdown-like restrictions in several states, authorities have started to gradually drop stringent measures amid a decline in Covid-19 cases. But the World Health Organization (WHO) emergencies programme head Michael Ryan on Wednesday urged countries to take extreme caution when reopening economies.“Countries opening up who have very low levels of vaccination coverage in the presence of variants is a real toxic mixture for your hospitals filling up again. And this is something that must absolutely be avoided,” said Ryan during a news conference in Geneva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/single-shot-of-pfizer-astrazeneca-barely-work-against-delta-variant-reveals-new-study-101625761285821.html

Naturally the foundation has been disturbed, so has the relationship,” Jaishankar further added.Jaishankar’s observation came in response to a question on how India views the rise of China. He said that there has been a rise of new powers after several nations won their independence from colonial rule all over the world.“China is part of an exception and China is part of a trend as well, because of its history, scale and power today. For us (India), it is a natural happening to some degree because we see ourselves in a similar situation. The timing may show we are a few years behind and the pace and intensity of it may be slightly different but broadly in the same time span India’s position vis-a-vis the world has also changed,” Jaishankar said.Jaishankar further said that China's rise impacts India as it is India’s immediate neighbour. He said its rise also impacts Russia and Eurasia and forums like BRICS show how each of these nations profits collaboratively.“For the last 40 years we maintained a stable relationship with China, there is a big economic element since China emerged as our second-largest economic partner,” Jaishankar said referring to India’s economic relationship with its neighbour.During his address, Jaishankar said India’s strategic, diplomatic and cultural ties with Russia are important in today’s world. He said that ties between both countries ranging over military to medicine as well as space and nuclear shows India’s commitment towards stronger ties with Russia. Jaishankar said that the 2+2 dialogue between PM Modi and President Vladimir Putin ‘promises to provide new vitality’ to India-Russia relations.Jaishankar will meet Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foundation-of-our-relationship-with-china-has-been-disturbed-jaishankar-101625751941300.html

However, the PM didn’t mention the complete schedule of the withdrawal of British troops.“All British troops assigned to NATO's mission in Afghanistan are now returning home,” Johnson informed the UK parliament in a statement, news agency Reuters reported. “For obvious reasons, I will not disclose the timetable of our departure, though I can tell the house (parliament) that most of our personnel have already left,” he further said, hinting that many soldiers had already left Afghanistan.Britain, one of the NATO allies, has been part of the war in Afghanistan which began after the September 11 attacks (9/11 attacks) in the United States. So far, 457 British Soldiers have lost their lives in the ongoing war of over two decades since 2001, according to a report by the Reuters.Also read | Afghanistan situation to figure in India-Russia talks tomorrowJohnson further said that the UK would continue to provide development assistance to Afghanistan. “I hope no one will leap to the false conclusion that the withdrawal of our forces somehow means the end of Britain's commitment to Afghanistan, we are not about to turn away, nor are we under any illusions about the perils of today situation and what might lie ahead,” his statement to the parliament further said, Reuters reported.Meanwhile, Britain’s Chief of the Defence Staff Nick Carter said it was “plausible” that Afghanistan’s state could collapse after the pull-out of international troops from the country, following Johnson’s statement.Carter also warned that a civil war, like in the 1990s, was possible “where you would see a culture of warlordism and you might see some of the important institutions like security forces fracturing along ethnic, or for that matter, tribal lines,” Reuters reported. “If that were to happen, I guess the Taliban would control part of the country. But, of course, they would not control all of the country,” he further said.US President Joe Biden in April ordered the complete withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan by September 11 and the Pentagon had earlier said that the process is 90% completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-british-troops-already-out-of-afghanistan-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tells-uk-parliament-101625751524118.html

Andy Slavitt told CNN on Wednesday that the Delta variant, first detected in India, is twice as infectious as the original strain of Sars-CoV-2 but presents “very little threat” to fully vaccinated individuals."We should think about the Delta variant as the 2020 version of Covid-19 on steroids," he said.The Delta variant has become the dominant variant in the United States, making up for more than half of the new Covid-19 cases in the country, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In some US states, the ‘variant of concern’ accounts for more than 80% of new infections, causing worry for authorities who are trying to achieve population immunity through high rates of vaccination.A recent analysis of Pfizer-BionTech vaccine efficacy by the Israeli government has renewed the debate around the Delta variant’s ability to escape immunity. Citing the analysis, the Israeli government earlier this week said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears to be less effective against infections caused by the Delta variant as compared to other strains. As of June 6, the Pfizer vaccine, based on mRNA technology, provided 64% protection against the Delta variant, the government had said.Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both based on mRNA, have been widely used in the United States for inoculation and a reduced efficacy could jeopardise the pandemic response and reopening of economies. Responding to the analysis from the Israeli government, top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci told CNN that "the Israelis know what they're doing," but the data is sparse.On Wednesday, World Health Organization (WHO) emergencies programme head Michael Ryan urged countries to take extreme caution when reopening economies amid the threat presented by the Delta variant. Ryan warned countries with low levels of vaccination coverage against opening up, saying the presence of variants could start filling the hospitals again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-is-covid-19-on-steroid-says-expert-as-us-sees-uptick-in-cases-101625749911181.html

The change in rules will be a huge boost to airlines and the tourism industry which has been reeling under months of restrictions."I can confirm today that from the 19th of July, UK residents who are fully vaccinated through the UK vaccine rollout will no longer have to self-isolate when they return to England," Shapps said.Currently, people travelling to the UK from countries and territories on the “amber list” are required to quarantine at home or at the place of their stay for at least 10 days. They also need to take a Covid-19 test on or before the second day and on or after the eighth day of their quarantine period. Destinations like Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United States are on the amber list.While the quarantine is no longer required from travellers from amber list countries, they still have to take a Covid-19 test before they arrive home, followed by another test on or before the second day of their arrival, said Shapps. Children under the age of 18 will also need to take tests.Airlines including British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair have been repeatedly calling for an end to mandatory 10-day quarantine, a rule that discouraged people from travelling abroad. Britain has vaccinated about 65% of its population which has given authorities the confidence to further relax the coronavirus-induced restrictions. However, non-Britons have to wait longer to be exempt from quarantine, said Shapps"We're working to extend our approach to vaccinated passengers from important markets and holiday destinations, later this summer, such as the United States and the EU," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-scraps-quarantine-norm-for-fully-vaccinated-britons-returning-from-amber-list-nations-101625744916241.html

The death of Novilia Sjafri Bachtiar has raised questions on the efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine which has been widely used in the fourth-most populous nation.Quoting an official of state-owned pharmaceuticals company BioFarma, Sindonews reported that Bachtiar was buried as per the Covid-19 protocols. Without revealing the cause of death, state enterprises minister Erick Thohir posted a message on Instagram mourning her "huge loss" at BioFarma, the company which makes the Sinovac vaccine in Indonesia."She was lead scientist and head of dozens of clinical trials done by BioFarma, including Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials in cooperation with Sinovac," he said.Bachtiar's death due to Covid-19, as reported by the local media, is not an isolated case as thousands of doctors and medical workers in Indonesia have been infected and many died despite being vaccinated with Sinovac. About 131 healthcare workers, mostly vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine, have died since June, according to independent data group Lapor Covid-19.Also Read | Indonesia doctors fell sick, many died after taking Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine: ReportThe concern over the efficacy of the vaccine has prompted the country to consider offering booster shots to the medical workers inoculated against Covid-19 using Sinovac’s vaccine, according to a Reuters report.

But Indonesia is battling a record-breaking surge in new Covid-19 cases and related deaths, led by the highly contagious Delta variant.

Beijing’s premier economic planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission, said in a notice Tuesday, reported Bloomberg.The top economic planner has also directed local authorities to strictly limit construction of towers taller than 250 metres, citing quality concerns and public safety hazards in some projects stemming from a lack of proper oversight. Construction of buildings exceeding 100 metres will have to be at par with the fire rescue capability and the scale of the city where the buildings will be built.“It’s primarily for safety,” said Qiao Shitong, an associate law professor at the University of Hong Kong told Bloomberg, adding that skyscrapers “are more like signature projects for mayors and not necessarily efficient,” Only 10 buildings in the world are over 500 metres and half of them are located in mainland China.These new directives come after the near 300-metre-high (980 ft) Shenzhen Electronics Group Plaza, one of China's tallest skyscrapers, was evacuated on May 18 after it began to shake. Videos shot by bystanders and shared by local media on Weibo shows the mammoth tower shaking on its foundation as scores of terrified pedestrians ran helter-skelter fearing a collapse.Building collapses are not rare in China, where lax construction standards and rapid urbanisation lead to constructions being thrown up in haste. Just last year Chinese authorities had banned construction of buildings taller than 500 meters in cities like Beijing, and urged urban planners to construct buildings which “highlight Chinese characteristics" instead of modelling them after world landmarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bans-construction-of-tallest-skyscrapers-over-public-safety-concerns-101625739080955.html

More than 4,000 scientists, doctors, nurses and other professionals signed a letter published in The Lancet medical journal, condemning the government’s “dangerous and unethical experiment” when the Delta variant of Sars-Cov-2 is driving the third wave of Covid-19 across the United Kingdom.“We believe this decision is dangerous and premature,” they wrote.On Wednesday, Britain reported over 32,000 new Covid-19 cases, the highest in over five months. But the government has maintained its position to remove most of the restrictions imposed to contain the virus. The scientists noted that more than 17 million people will remain with no protection against Covid-19 even after assuming that 20% of unvaccinated people are protected by the previous infection.“We believe the government is embarking on a dangerous and unethical experiment, and we call on it to pause plans to abandon mitigations on July 19, 2021,” the scientists said.Also Read | Delta variant, first identified in India, now 'dominant' in USThey warned that the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases will “probably continue until millions more people are infected”, given the high transmissibility of the Delta variant. Citing preliminary modelling data, the scientists said that the government's strategy provides fertile ground for the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants which would place all at risk, including those already vaccinated.“Spread of potentially more transmissible escape variants would disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged in our country and other countries with poor access to vaccines,” they added.Earlier this month, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that all restrictions would be lifted on July 19, branding it as “Freedom Day”. The scientists have suggested that the government should delay complete re-opening until everyone has been offered vaccination and uptake is high.“Until then, public health measures must include those called for by WHO (universal mask wearing in indoor spaces, even for those vaccinated), the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ventilation and air filtration), and Independent SAGE (effective border quarantine; test, trace isolate, and support),” they wrote.The letter was originally signed by a few researchers and now has more than 4,200 online signatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-call-on-uk-govt-to-abandon-dangerous-and-unethical-opening-plans-amid-delta-scare-101625736778493.html

The practice, which was prevalent from 1909-1979, the government sterilised some people, mostly with mental illness or physical disability, whom it deemed unfit to have children, according to news agency Associated Press. Some of the victims of this practice include people as young as 13-year-old, the AP report further said.The supporters of the 'eugenics' believed the people with such "undesirable traits should not have children" in order to improve the human race.According to the Associated Press, more than 20,000 people were sterilised under this practice until the law was repealed in 1979. Notably, since the practice is so old, only a few hundred people might be alive by now.The state has set aside $7.5 million for the reparations program, part of its $262.6 billion operating budget that is awaiting governor Gavin Newsom’s signature.California is the third state in the US after Virginia and North Carolina to make compensation to the victims of the so-called "eugenics movement". Along with this, the state government will pay compensation to women who were sterilised in the prisons. Of which, some cases could be as recently as 2010, the news agency also reported.Between 2005 to 2013, California sterilised at least 144 women, it also reported. "We must address and face our horrific history,” said Lorena Garcia Zermeño, policy and communications coordinator for the advocacy group California Latinas for Reproductive Justice. “This isn’t something that just happened in the past."It also reported that the state while all of the women signed consent forms, officials in 39 cases did not do everything that was legally required to obtain their permission for the sterilisation.The first eugenics sterilization law was introduced in Indiana state in 1907. Later, it expanded to 30 states. It reached California in 1909. It was by far the largest program, accounting for about a third of everyone sterilised in the United States under those laws.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-to-pay-25-000-as-compensation-to-victims-of-forced-sterilisation-101625731801380.html

The state media later ran a story citing a citizen as saying North Koreans broke down in tears at the sight of the thinner Kim, comments that could have been aimed at building public support as he tries to revive a sickly economy.Kim’s weight is tracked by spy agencies for insights about the autocratic and secretive regime in Pyongyang especially since his family has a history of heart disease.

He will also give detail as to how the new rules will affect under-18s who are not currently being vaccinated.Under existing rules on foreign travel, visitors to more than 100 destinations including the US market and some of the most popular European destinations are required to isolate for 10 days on their return to the UK.This is because these destinations are on the government’s amber list, rated as medium risk for coronavirus. The government currently advises Britons not to travel to destinations on the amber list or the high risk red list, with only a handful of countries judged to be safe enough to put on the green list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-british-travelers-no-longer-need-to-isolate-under-new-rule-101625724312139.html

Following the abrupt closure, several students shared screenshots, to which WeChat replied that the accounts were blocked "after receiving relevant complaints". "All content has been blocked and the account has been put out of service," it also stated in the notice. The company also cited a violation of government regulation on the management of online public accounts."Many of us suffered at the same time," news agency Reuters quoted an account manager of one group as saying. However, people quoted in the Reuters story declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue."They censored us without any warning. All of us have been wiped out," the account manager also said.Many LGBT rights supporters also took to social media to protest against the closure of students' accounts. "The era is regressing. China wasn't like this 10 years ago. Gradually we're losing all our freedoms," said a user on Weibo, as per ANI report.However, some online nationalists have welcomed the move, who claimed that they are run by "anti-China forces." "I support the blocking of the accounts...why should we keep these public accounts run by anti-China forces in our higher education institutions? Are we waiting for them to brainwash university students who have yet to form their values?" ANI quoted one user as saying.In 1997, China decriminalised homecuality, but not until 2001, the government classified it as a "mental disorder."However, in a controversial ruling in March this year, a Chinese court upheld a university's description of homosexuality as a "psychological disorder" and said that it was not a factual error but merely an "academic view".The Cyberspace Administration of China recently pledged to clean up the internet to protect minors and crackdown on social media groups deemed a "bad influence".Traditionally, LGBT student groups do not get the support of university authorities in their work to raise awareness about the community, despite the decriminalisation.In May, the loyalty of LGBT university groups to the government and the Communist Party was discussed between student groups, university representatives of the Communist Youth League - a department in charge of student affairs run by the Chinese Communist Party, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter, Reuters had reported.During the meeting, the students were asked if they were anti-Party or anti-China, and whether any of their funds had originated from abroad, it also reported.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-wechat-blocks-lgbt-accounts-users-slam-anti-homosexuality-crackdown-in-china-101625722811640.html

It gives a detailed explanation for SARS-CoV-2’s genetic signatures, early epidemiology and research undertaken at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. “It’s the first really systematic sift through all the data,” Holmes, a laureate professor who studies evolutionary biology at the University of Sydney, said in an email, according to Bloomberg."There has been a lot of news coverage of Covid’s origins in recent months, much of it speculation and some of it simply misinformation. We thought it was important to go back to the core scientific data and clearly and calmly work through what it told us," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origins-reflect-initial-spread-of-sars-17-years-ago-says-study-101625716629024.html

Sydney recorded 38 new Covid-19 cases in the community from the day before, with 21 of those in the south-western areas.“Those numbers are too high -- we need to get those numbers down. Please, please avoid contact with households with other households, please avoid visiting family and friends because you are not allowed to,” New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters on Thursday, reports Bloomberg.While economies such as the United Kingdom and United States are preparing to open up, Australia’s international borders remain largely closed to non-residents and comparatively small clusters of the coronavirus make even domestic travel difficult.On Wednesday, Australian politician Gladys Berejiklian announced the initial two-week lockdown, due to expire on Friday, would need to be extended for at least another week. She asked Prime Minister Scott Morrison to ramp up the vaccination rollout.Berejiklian has flagged that her government may need to impose harsher restrictions in three southwestern Sydney local government areas -- Fairfield, Liverpool and Canterbury-Bankstown.“The two biggest areas where people are spreading the virus is through household contacts of people close to them, and people who are undertaking activities with symptoms. We don’t want to prolong the lockdown, we don’t want to see Sydney or New South Wales going in and out of lockdown until we have the vast majority of our population vaccinated," Berejiklian said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydneys-delta-outbreak-reaches-record-daily-high-since-midjune-101625713960264.html

She told the Bloomberg news agency that this number is likely to be 52% now, which will be confirmed once the data for the two-week period ending July 3 comes in.Also Read | 'Lambda variant of coronavirus deadlier than delta': Malaysian health ministrySo far, the 'alpha' variant of Covid-19, first identified in the United Kingdom, had been dominant in the US. Now alpha cases constitute 28.7% of the total cases -- a declining trend -- while delta variant cases are on the rise.The data is a result of a study conducted by the CDC in which the health agency estimated proportions of the most common SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the US on a bi-weekly basis. The virus sequences have been collected in the national genomic surveillance since December last year.The US CDC categorised the delta Covid-19 variant as a 'variant of concern' last month, noting that the extent to which the strain has affected the country varies across regions. While the delta variant constitutes 30% of the total Covid-19 infections in the Pacific Northwest, it ranges to more than 80% of the cases in the Midwestern region of the country.

My friend saw something yellow coming (like) the sun. I took the picture and after (there was) a sound," said intern Clemence Lefaix, who is staying near the blast site and posted a photo of a bright orange light against the night sky in front of apartment buildings.A resident of Dubai's Marina district, close to the Jebel Ali port, told AFP they "saw the windows shaking"."I have been living here for 15 years and this is the first time I've seen and heard this," they said.There are 8,000 companies based at the Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) which contributed 23 percent of Dubai's gross domestic product last year. It is the Middle East's largest trade zone.The glitzy Gulf emirate of Dubai transformed itself over 50 years from a sleepy port town to a regional travel, trade and financial services centre.The city state is now home to more than three million people, mostly foreigners, compared with only 15,000 inhabitants in the 1950s.Unlike Abu Dhabi, the leading member of the UAE that sits on a large wealth of petroleum, Dubai has dwindling oil resources and has worked to develop non-oil industries, diversifying into services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/loud-explosion-rocks-dubai-port-no-casualty-101625701526796.html
08-07-2021||World||Key party in Malaysia ruling alliance pulls support for PM Muhyiddin Yassin||The largest party in Malaysia’s ruling alliance said Thursday that it will withdraw support for Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin immediately and urged him to make way for a new leader.The announcement is a political bombshell that could potentially trigger the collapse of the government if he refuses to quit and spark a general election.Muhyiddin took power in March 2020 after initiating the downfall of the former reformist government that won the 2018 elections. His Bersatu party joined with the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, which was ousted in the 2018 polls, and others to form a new government, but his alliance has a razor-thin majority in Parliament.UMNO president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Muhyiddin’s government has failed to curb the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, he said its inconsistent policies and half-baked lockdown measures have deepened the economic hardship.Zahid urged Muhyiddin to resign and make way for a temporary leader to take over until the pandemic eases and a general election can be held safely.“This is important to allow a government that is truly stable and has the mandate of the majority of the people to be formed,” he said in a statement after a meeting of UMNO’s top decision-making body.There was no immediate reaction from Muhyiddin or his party.UMNO’s decision came just hours after Muhyiddin named an UMNO lawmaker as his deputy, in what was seen as a calculated bid to persuade the party to stay on. Tensions have been brewing for months in the ruling alliance, with UMNO unhappy at playing second fiddle to Bersatu.The prime minister’s office named Defense Minister Ismail Sabri as the deputy premier and said he also would retain his security post. Muhyiddin had broken with tradition by not appointing a deputy premier to his Cabinet last year but named four senior ministers instead, two of which are from his own party and Ismail from UMNO.Muhyiddin’s office said Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein would take over Ismail’s post as one of the four senior ministers, while retaining his diplomatic portfolio. It had voiced hope that the promotions would unite the ruling parties and boost the government’s strength.Analysts said Muhyiddin has split UMNO by appointing second-tier leaders to his Cabinet and reinforced it with the new appointments. Both those two UMNO lawmakers are in a camp opposed to UMNO leader Zahid.But the move failed to stem the strong opposition in UMNO to Muhyiddin and his party.UMNO earlier this year said the party will not work with Muhyiddin’s alliance in the next general election. Its attempt to seek early elections has been stymied by a worsening coronavirus crisis, with the country plunged in a second national lockdown since June 1.Zahid noted that the country’s deaths from the pandemic had doubled to 5,768 since the lockdown began. Total confirmed coronavirus infections in Malaysia now stand near 800,000, with daily infections breaching 7,000 in the past two days.He said Muhyiddin abused a coronavirus emergency that was declared in January for his political gain. The emergency suspended Parliament, which means support for Muhyiddin’s leadership cannot be tested.Muhyiddin agreed to let Parliament resume July 26, ahead of the Aug. 1 expiration of the emergency, after growing pressure, including from the nation’s king.Zahid didn’t propose anyone as the interim prime minister but said UMNO will not support opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who has been lobbying for support. It is unclear how the political situation will pan out as no coalition now has a clear majority.“As long as Bersatu is in charge, UMNO will not be all right,” said Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-party-in-malaysia-ruling-alliance-pulls-support-for-pm-muhyiddin-yassin-101625687031406.html
08-07-2021||World||UN rights expert urges sanctions on Myanmar's oil and gas sector||A United Nations human rights investigator called on countries on Wednesday to impose economic sanctions on Myanmar's oil and gas sector to cripple the junta that took power five months ago.Myanmar has been in crisis since the military ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government on Feb. 1, unleashing nationwide anger that quickly turned into protests and strikes brutally suppressed by security forces, with nearly 900 killed.Thomas Andrews, UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said that no state had imposed any sanctions on its oil and gas sector, although some had slapped them on military-controlled enterprises and revenue from gems, timber and mining."Oil- and gas-sector revenues are a financial lifeline for the junta and are estimated to be close to what is needed for the junta to maintain the security forces that are keeping them in power. They should be stopped," he told the Human Rights Council.Andrews, a former US congressman from Maine, called for forming an 'Emergency Coalition for the People of Myanmar' that would also ban the export of arms to the military.The US delegation called for decisive action to prevent further bloodshed, saying: "We urge all nations to cease the export of arms and transfer of dual-use technology to the military junta."Earlier, the top UN human rights official Michelle Bachelet urged ASEAN countries to launch a political dialogue with the military junta and the democratically-elected leadership in Myanmar.The United Nations must be allowed to deliver humanitarian aid to civilians in Myanmar, as agreed with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), without it being "instrumentalised" by the military, she said.The ASEAN bloc agreed a five-point consensus with junta leader Min Aung Hlaing in April, "but unfortunately the Myanmar military leadership have shown little sign of abiding by it", Bachelet said."It is urgent for ASEAN to appoint a special envoy or team to get some kind of political dialogue underway. I encourage ASEAN to engage with the democratic leadership and civil society, not just the military front," Bachelet said.Sally Mansfield, Australia's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said: "We welcome ASEAN’s efforts to chart a course out of this crisis and look forward to the announcement of a Special Envoy."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-expert-urges-sanctions-on-myanmar-s-oil-and-gas-sector-101625686409051.html
08-07-2021||World||Tropical Storm Elsa to drench New York after lashing Florida||Tropical Storm Elsa is poised to gain strength off the coasts of New York and New Jersey on Friday, dumping heavy rain on the Northeast and the Canadian Maritimes after buffeting Florida earlier in the week.Elsa’s top winds fell to 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour as it spun across northern Florida Wednesday, the US National Hurricane Center said in a 2 p.m. New York time advisory. The storm is forecast to weaken to a tropical depression Thursday over the Carolinas and Virginia before entering the Atlantic once again off New Jersey. A depression is the weakest class of storm in the family of systems that includes hurricanes.“The question then becomes is it able to re-strengthen into a tropical storm,” said Paul Walker, a meteorologist with commercial forecaster AccuWeather Inc. Regardless of whether they’re from Elsa or another system in the East, there will be “good rains from the mid-Atlantic into New England and into Atlantic Canada.”Elsa is the fifth Atlantic storm this year and became the season’s first hurricane as it moved through the Caribbean last week, killing at least three people. It’s also the third named storm to hit the US this year. While meteorologists don’t expect the tally of Atlantic storms in 2021 to reach last year’s record of 30, they’re predicting a more active hurricane season than normal.Moisture from Elsa combined with a weather front moving across the East Coast could bring as much as 5 inches of rain or more from Georgia to New Brunswick, Canada, in the next five days, according to the US Weather Prediction Center.The storm’s worst winds will remain on its east side, mainly out to sea, Walker said.“Heavy rain could come up the I-95 corridor,” Walker said.After Elsa sweeps off into the North Atlantic, the basin is poised to calm down for the next week. Hurricane season began June 1 and runs until November 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-elsa-to-drench-new-york-after-lashing-florida-101625685821809.html
08-07-2021||World||Joe Biden visits community college in Illinois to sell voters on investments in families, education||President Joe Biden on Wednesday turned his focus to pitching his proposed investments in families and education, using a visit to a community college in an Illinois swing district to highlight how his spending on so-called human infrastructure would boost the economy.The president toured McHenry County College, a community college in Crystal Lake with a workforce development program and a child care center. He’s trying to sell voters on his vision to invest in child care, health care, education and other important aspects of everyday life for Americans, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday on Air Force One.Biden toured a metals lab at the community college, where he emphasized the need to invest in research and development to bolster manufacturing jobs.“We’ve got the best folks in the world, we’re just not investing the kind of money we should,” he said.The president also wants to put a renewed focus on the portions of his economic agenda that didn’t make it into the bipartisan infrastructure deal that he backed in June. That package includes hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in roads and bridges, transit systems and broadband, but it constitutes only part of the $4 trillion in spending Biden has proposed in a broader plan to reinvigorate the economy and boost the middle class.On Wednesday, the Democratic president took steps to highlight the rest, including his plans to invest in child care and workforce development programs and provide two years of free community college, universal prekindergarten and paid family and medical leave. He'll make the case that investments in such programs are needed to maintain America's economic growth and competitiveness globally.He’ll also highlight his proposals to establish a clean energy standard and invest in home care for seniors and affordable housing. And he'll speak about his plans to make permanent the expansion in the child tax credit and expanded health care premium subsidies from the COVID-19 aid bill.Democrats plan to include much of this in a bill they hope to pass through a legislative maneuver that would require just a simple majority vote, skirting the 60-vote hurdle in an evenly divided Senate. Biden has said he would prefer that the two bills move through Congress together, and Democrats are hoping to make progress this month on both.The Biden administration promoted its agenda on multiple fronts Wednesday.First lady Jill Biden visited an elementary school in Washington to discuss how the trillions of dollars the president wants Congress to spend on families would pay for more affordable child care, preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, larger salaries for teachers and modern school buildings with safe drinking water, along with more teachers of color and more nurses and counselors to help students with their emotional and other needs.“You and your students will continue to be one of our top priorities, not just in one legislative bill, but in everything we do,” she said during a speech to a virtual meeting of the American Federation of Teachers union.”President Biden was greeted by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot when he landed in Illinois and was met at the community college by Gov. J.B. Pritzker; Illinois' two Democratic senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth; and Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood, who represents the district.Biden won Illinois’ 14th Congressional District by about 2 percentage points in 2020, and Underwood won reelection by less than that. Hers is one of the top-targeted seats in the nation and is emblematic of the kind of district Democrats will need to hold onto in the 2022 midterms if they hope to maintain control of the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-visits-community-college-in-illinois-to-sell-voters-on-investments-in-families-education-101625685379588.html
