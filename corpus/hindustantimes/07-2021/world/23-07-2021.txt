23-07-2021||World||EU okays Moderna Covid jab||Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine could become the second shot okayed for adolescent use in the European Union after regulators on Friday recommended approving it for 12 to 17-year-olds.Use of the vaccine, Spikevax, will be the same in adolescents as in people over 18, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said, adding the shot produced a comparable antibody response to that seen in 18 to 25-year-olds.Vaccinating children has been considered important for reaching herd immunity and in light of the highly contagious Delta variant. Moderna in May said its vaccine was found to be safe and effective in teenagers.The EMA said the two-dose vaccine is given four weeks apart, and its human medicines committee’s recommendation was based on a study of 3,732 participants.WHO asks govts to come together for virus probeThe World Health Organization (WHO) called on Friday for all countries to work together to investigate the origin of the coronavirus that caused Covid-19, a day after China rejected plans for more checks on labs and markets in its territory.The WHO has proposed a follow-up to earlier investigations in China. But Zeng Yixin, vice minister of China’s national health commission, said Beijing won’t accept the latest proposal as it stood.Asked about China’s rejection, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said, “This is not about politics, it’s not about a blame game... Countries have the responsibility to work together and to work with the WHO.”In the UK, Public Health England issued a warning of an increased risk of catching the Delta variant even if someone has had Covid-19 before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-okays-moderna-covid-jab-101627064605488.html

Before InSight’s touchdown on the Martian surface in 2018, Nasa’s study of the Red Planet through the rovers and orbiters was primarily concentrated on its surface. But three research papers based on InSight’s seismometer data have provided much-awaited details on the depth and composition of Mars’ crust, mantle, and core.In the study, the scientists confirmed that Mars’ core, which has a radius of 1,830 kilometres, is molten. They will continue using InSight data to determine whether its inner core is solid like the Earth’s. The crust was thinner than expected and scientists believe that it may have two or even three sub-layers. The crust could be as deep as 20 kilometres with two sub-layers and 23 kilometres if there are three. “This study is a once-in-a-lifetime chance,” Simon Stähler, lead author of the core paper, stated. “It took scientists hundreds of years to measure Earth’s core; after the Apollo missions, it took them 40 years to measure the Moon’s core. InSight took just two years to measure Mars’ core.”InSight’s seismometer has recorded over 700 marsquakes and many of them between 3.0-4.0 magnitude, supporting the idea that the location is seismically active. While Mars has no tectonic plates unlike Earth, it does have volcanically active regions that can shake the surface.“We’d still love to see the big one,” said JPL’s Mark Panning, co-lead author of the paper on the crust. “We have to do lots of careful processing to pull the things we want from this data. Having a bigger event would make all of this easier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-insight-lander-reveals-deep-interior-of-mars-for-first-time-101627063070180.html

The doses will be delivered starting from October this year through April 2022, the statement further said.With this, the total number of doses supplied to the US would reach 500 million, under the existing supply agreement between Pfizer-BioNTech and the US government. This would be enough to fully immunise 250 million people with the vaccine’s two-dose regimen.Of the 200 million new doses, the companies expect to deliver 110 million doses by December 31, 2021 and the other 90 million doses no later than April 30, 2022.Also read | Should you be worried about 'breakthrough' Covid cases? Here's what experts say“As a long-term partner to the US government in the fight against this pandemic, we are proud of the impact of vaccination efforts across the country. Vaccines have been and will remain critical to protecting lives against this devastating disease,” Pfizer chief executive officer Albert Bourla said. “These additional doses will help the US government ensure broad vaccine access into next year,” he added.Further, the US government can also acquire an updated version of the vaccine to be used for inoculation against potential Covid-19 variants and also newer formulations of the dose.“It has been our consistent goal to supply as many doses of our Covid-19 vaccine as possible to people around the world to help bring an end to this pandemic,” said Ugur Sahin, CEO of BioNTech. “We are honored to support the US and more than 100 countries in their continuing vaccination programs,” he added.Earlier on June 10, 2021, the companies said that they would provide 500 million doses of the vaccine to the US government to battle flare-ups of Covid-19 in low and lower middle income countries of the world. They also announced that 200 million doses would be supplied this year while the remaining 300 million doses in the first half of 2022.The additional procurement of vaccines by the US could be used for vaccination of children under 12 years of age, who are not yet eligible to receive a shot, and also for an additional booster shot if data proves them necessary, news agency Bloomberg reported citing a White House official familiar with the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-receive-additional-200-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-from-pfizerbiontech-101627059452323.html
23-07-2021||World||Blinken to visit India on July 28, hold talks with PM, foreign minister||Secretary of state Antony Blinken will visit India for the first time as America’s top diplomat on July 28. Blinken is scheduled to meet his counterpart S Jaishankar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the US state department said in an announcement of the visit on Friday.He will also meet national security adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian ministry of external affairs (MEA) said in a separate announcement of the visit. The MEA said, “Secretary Blinken’s visit is an opportunity to continue the high-level bilateral dialogue and bolster the India-US global strategic partnership. Both sides will review the robust and multifaceted India-US bilateral relations, and potential for consolidating them further.”Blinken last visited India as deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration in December 2015.The state department said Blinken will hold discussions on “a wide range of issues including continued cooperation on Covid-19 response efforts, Indo-Pacific engagement, shared regional security interests, shared democratic values, and addressing the climate crisis”.Afghanistan is likely to be a key topic of discussion as US withdrawal of troops, which will be wrapped soon, could be followed by the Taliban’s return to power. India has watched with concern as the Taliban have rapidly expanded areas under their control, raising fears of the return of their brutal and regressive policies and practices. Jaishankar had underscored New Delhi’s worries during his visit to Washington DC in May.Blinken will be the second member of President Joe Biden’s cabinet to visit India, following defence secretary Lloyd Austin in March, which was a part of the first foreign trips undertaken by senior Biden admin officials. Blinken had then gone to South Korea and Japan, who are treaty allies of the United States.Blinken’s India visit comes after and ahead of high-level interactions between the two sides after Biden took over as president in January.Prime Minister Modi and President Biden spoke on phone and met virtually at the first summit of the Quad leaders, which Biden hosted in March and the Climate Summit that the American leader hosted in April.The two leaders are expected to meet later in the year at an in-person summit of the leaders of the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) involving Australia, Japan, India and the US, which is likely after October, when Japan is scheduled to hold general elections, according to people familiar with preparatory discussions. There was a possibility earlier of holding the meeting at the time of the UN general assembly when leaders were likely to be in the US.The US side is understood to be very keen to hold the summit as a stand-alone in Washington DC, and there is a possibility of Biden hosting the leaders at the presidential retreat outside Washington DC at Camp David in Maryland.A bilateral India-US summit on the sidelines of the Quad summit is also under discussions.Dates are under discussion for the next 2+2 dialogue between the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries. It will be hosted by the US this year; the last one was held in New Delhi last October, with then secretaries of state and defence Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper travelling to India.Blinken will then leave India for Kuwait on July 28 only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-to-visit-india-on-july-28-hold-talks-with-pm-foreign-min-101627052768446.html

The EU drug regulator said that the effects of the Spikevax vaccine were investigated in a study involving 3,732 children aged 12 to 17 years, which produced a comparable antibody response as seen in young adults aged 18 to 25 years.None of 2,163 children administered with the Spikevax vaccine got infected with Covid-19 compared with four of 1,073 children administered placebo. The EMA said that the results allowed the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to conclude that the efficacy of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds is similar to that in adults.The most common side effects of the Spikevax vaccine in children were similar to those in adults, including pain and swelling at the injection site, headache, nausea, vomiting and fever. The EMA said in a statement that these side effects were usually mild to moderate and improved within a few days from the vaccination.Also Read | India has been offered 7.5 million doses of Moderna vaccine through Covax: WHODue to the limited number of participants, the trial could not have detected rare side effects or estimated the risk of known side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle, the EMA added. The agency stressed that the overall safety profile determined in adults, however, was confirmed in the adolescent study, suggesting that the benefits of Spikevax in adolescents outweigh the risks.The vaccine will be administered as two injections in the muscles of the upper arm, four weeks apart.The approval for vaccine use in children comes at a time when low- and lower-middle-income countries are struggling to vaccinate even their frontline workers and high-risk groups. The World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly urged the world to donate Covid-19 vaccines to poorer nations instead of vaccinating their children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ema-approves-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-children-aged-12-to-17-101627047074856.html
23-07-2021||World||‘Will focus on vaccines for all by end of 2022’: UNGA president-elect Abdulla Shahid||President-elect of the UN General Assembly Abdulla Shahid, who is also the Maldives’ foreign minister, said on Friday he will endeavour to bring together Covid-19 vaccine producers and countries to ensure people around the world are vaccinated by the end of 2022. Shahid also emphasised that the UN has a “very clear role” in the situation in Afghanistan and the world community has to unite to assist the peace process in the troubled country. He made the remarks while participating in an interactive session after delivering the annual Sapru House Lecture on the theme “Covid pandemic and need for reformed multilateralism”. Currently on a three-day visit to India to outline the priorities for his tenure as president of the UN General Assembly, Shahid has already come out with a five-point plan that includes reforming the UN and post-pandemic recovery. Talking about his plans to bring together Covid-19 vaccine producers, distributors and countries, he said, “I think this is not a time to [do] finger-pointing, I think this is a time to share, take stock and chart a future course of action. We need to get everyone vaccinated in the world by the end of 2022, at the latest, if we are serious about confronting this pandemic.” Responding to a question on the situation in Afghanistan amid the drawdown of US and NATO forces and an intense campaign by the Taliban to capture territory, Shahid said, “The maintenance of international peace and security is mandated to the Security Council and therefore the UN has a very clear role in what is happening in Afghanistan. Describing the Afghan people as resilient and their leadership as strong, he added, “Their government is a democratic government elected by the people... I think we all, the international community, need to come together and assist the Afghan people in whatever way they so desire so that they could have the way forward that is being charted out by their government and people.” Shahid also spoke of his plans to push forward the process for the UN to adopt a comprehensive convention on terrorism, saying, “Terrorism is a scourge, it has no religion, it has no borders, it has no soul, it is pure evil.” He added that unethical and inhuman beliefs are what result in the promotion of terrorism. “What we require now is for the political leadership of the world to come together. The best message we could send to terrorists now is to come up with the comprehensive convention on terrorism.” Backing India’s long-standing bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council, he said the Maldives was among 10 countries that had sought reforms of this key body as far back as the 1970s. “To say that it is taking a long time is an understatement because perhaps when this letter was signed by the Maldives and submitted, I was only 10 years old,” he said. Contemporary political realities aren’t reflected in the membership of the Security Council and the entire membership of the UN now agrees on the need for institutional reforms, including the inclusion of new permanent members in the council, he said. In his speech, Shahid said the world now has a clearer picture of how quickly the production of vaccines can be scaled up and their effectiveness. “But it is not something to celebrate. We now know that the world’s economy shrank by 4.3% in 2020, wiping out trillions of dollars,” he said. “We know that countries have fallen further into debt. For the first time in 20 years, global poverty is likely to increase significantly, 114 million people lost their jobs in 2020, while many have had their working hours or pays cut, or fallen into economic inactivity – meaning they had to withdraw from the labour force,” he added. Shahid said this is why he chose hope as the central theme of his presidency of the UN General Assembly. “My immediate priority will be recovering from Covid-19. The impacts have been immense, and yet still, this pandemic seems to be far from over,” he said. “New variants are emerging. And we are still unclear about the longer-term health consequences. The United Nations can, and must do more to address this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-focus-on-vaccines-for-all-by-end-of-2022-unga-president-elect-abdulla-shahid-101627047369828.html
23-07-2021||World||New Zealand, Australia travel bubble faced minor snags. Then came the Delta variant||New Zealand has suspended the trans-Tasman travel bubble for at least eight weeks starting Saturday amid worsening coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Australia. Announcing the decision, New Zealand’s Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said it was the right thing to do given the high transmissibility of the Delta variant and multiple community clusters identified in Australia.A travel bubble between New Zealand and Australia was launched last year aimed at boosting international tourism as the two countries had been largely successful in preventing any major outbreak. The travellers on approved flights were exempted from the mandatory 14 days quarantine. Apart from minor snags, the travel bubble was working smoothly until the highly contagious Delta variant, first detected in India, entered Australia.On Thursday, Australia reported 152 new Covid-19 cases and the bulk of them came from New South Wales capital Sydney. Some breakthrough cases have also been reported in Australia as concern around the Delta variant’s immune escape ability grows.The rising number of Covid-19 cases in the largest Australian city has become a “national emergency”, New South Wales leaders said. The fresh outbreak has prompted leaders to call for ramping up the vaccination drive, which has been hampered due to problems with supplies of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and scepticism around the safety of AstraZeneca shots."We have an obligation on behalf of the nation to contain the virus," said New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian. "There is no doubt that the numbers are not going in the right direction."Amid the worrying surge, Australians will no longer be able to enter New Zealand quarantine-free. For the next seven days, New Zealanders from all Australian states and territories, except New South Wales, will be able to return on green flights with a Covid negative report in the pre-departure test. Those who have been to New South Wales will have to go into managed isolation and quarantine for 14 days.“The decision to suspend travel follows updated public health advice from officials on the growing number of cases and locations of interest across Australia in recent days and weeks,” the New Zealand government said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-australia-travel-bubble-faced-minor-snags-then-came-the-delta-variant-101627046173462.html

It comes days after the deaths of nine Chinese nationals in a bomb blast on a bus in Pakistan’s restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.While the Chinese foreign ministry announced the expected arrival of Qureshi on Friday morning, it did not formally confirm Hameed’s visit.The news of Hameed’s arrival in China for “strategic talks” was published in Pakistani media on Friday.The meetings are likely taking place or expected to take place in the southwestern city of Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan province.Last week, the Chinese foreign ministry had said Beijing will dispatch a task force to Pakistan to jointly investigate the blast that killed its nine nationals. Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian had urged the Pakistani government to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and the security of projects.Nine Chinese and three Pakistani nationals were killed, and 39 others injured last week when there was an explosion on a bus in the Upper Kohistan district of Pakistan’s northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.A Chinese state media report said the “…blast took place on a shuttle vehicle of the Dasu Hydropower Project, which a Chinese company is contracted to build, as it headed to the construction site in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”“The visit of high-ranking Pakistani officials holds significance after a tragic incident in Upper Kohistan. Nine Chinese nationals working on Dasu Hydropower Project were killed when a bus transporting them to the construction site met (with) an accident,” Pakistan’s Geo News said in a report on Friday.Islamabad has blamed hostile forces behind the Dasu incident, which according to them, was carried out to create misunderstandings between the two countries, the Geo News report added.THE AFGHAN FACTORThe high-level visit from Pakistan also comes in the backdrop of the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan.In June, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had told Qureshi and Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar during a trilateral meeting that foreign military forces should withdraw in a responsible and orderly manner. “Countries in the region should play a more constructive role in stabilising the situation in Afghanistan,” Wang said at the meeting.Earlier on Friday, the Chinese foreign ministry announced that at the invitation of Wang, Qureshi, besides the foreign ministers of Malta, Finland and Mongolia will visit China from July 22 to 28.In Islamabad, Pakistan foreign office said that during Qureshi’s visit both sides will discuss further deepening of bilateral relations, focus on cooperation as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, defence and security cooperation, Covid-19 vaccines, counter-terrorism, and regional and international issues of mutual interest.“This year, Pakistan and China are celebrating the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. More than 100 celebratory events have been planned of which over 60 events have already been held so far. These celebrations have immensely contributed to injecting a fresh vigour and warmth in the traditional friendship,” the Pakistan foreign office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-of-chinese-nationals-pak-foreign-min-isi-chief-in-china-for-talks-101627046587900.html
23-07-2021||World||Activewear brand Lorna Jane claimed its clothes could prevent Covid spread, fined $3.7 mn||An athleisure clothing chain was fined $3.7 million for falsely claiming that its garment could prevent coronavirus disease (Covid-19) during the peak of the pandemic in Australia. Lorna Jane Pty Ltd, which manufactures and retails women’s activewear, had promoted that its product ‘LJ Shield Activewear’ used a “groundbreaking technology” to eliminate the virus “on contact with the fabric.”In its marketing campaign, the Australian company said that a substance, promoted as ‘Lorna Jane Shield’, would eliminate all viruses including Covid-19 when sprayed on its activewear. It claimed that the substance permanently adheres to the garments, making “transferal of pathogens” to the garments impossible.In December 2020, the Australian competition regulator instituted proceedings against Lorna Jane for alleged false and misleading claims and against the company’s co-founder Lorna Jane Clarkson for allegedly being knowingly concerned in the conduct. A federal court, in its ruling, ordered Lorna Jane to pay $3.7 million for making false and misleading representations to consumers, which a judge called “exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous.”The judge observed that the conduct of the company in this particular case emanated from a ‘high managerial level within the company’ and ‘was directed by Ms Clarkson’. The company admitted that Lorna Jane Clarkson was involved in crafting the words and designing the graphic used in the marketing campaign and also made false statements in an Instagram video regarding activewear.“This was dreadful conduct as it involved making serious claims regarding public health when there was no basis for them,” Rod Sims, chair of the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission, said in a statement.“This type of conduct is particularly harmful where, as here, consumers cannot easily check or monitor the claims made,” he added.Lorna Jane accepted the court's ruling and said the company was itself misled by a supplier."A trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised," said CEO Bill Clarkson in a statement. "They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers."Lorna Jane has 108 stores in Australia as well as a number of international stores, including in the USA and New Zealand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/activewear-brand-lorna-jane-claimed-its-clothes-could-prevent-covid-spread-fined-3-7-mn-101627042046059.html

The company also said that it is helping its customers affected by the ransomware to restore their affected operations.“We can confirm that Kaseya obtained the tool from a third party and have teams actively helping customers affected by the ransomware to restore their environments,” news agency AFP reported citing a statement released by Kaseya Corporation earlier on Thursday. "Kaseya is working with Emsisoft to support our customer engagement efforts, and Emsisoft has confirmed the key is effective at unlocking victims," it further said.Also read | REvil ransomware attack: Experts cast doubts as IT firm Kaseya says 800 to 1,500 customers compromisedHowever, the “third party” from which the tool was obtained to decrypt the hacked data was not mentioned by the company. According to Kevin Collier, a reporter with NBC News, Kaseya got the decryption tool from a “trusted third party” as was confirmed by a company spokesperson. In a tweet regarding the news, Collier further suggested that there were three ways in which Kaseya could have obtained the key - The US government obtained it via diplomatic channels with Russia or Russia asked REvil, the ransomware group behind the attack, to turn over the decryptor or Kaseya had paid the ransom and obtained the key. Emsisoft, a company offering cybersecurity solutions, is also involved along with Kaseya in restoring services for their customers, Collier further said.Earlier on July 2, Kaseya had shut down its servers after a ransomware attack by the notorious REvil gang, based in Russia, affected several of its customers, including a few high-profile customers like Coop, a Swedish supermarket chain. Ransomware attacks are those in which the data of the victim is encrypted by the hacker and a ransom is demanded for restoring the data.Following the attack, hackers demanded $70 million in Bitcoin from Kaseya as ransom. The company then released a statement on July 6, saying that the attack had only limited impact. “The attack had limited impact, with only approximately 50 of the more than 35,000 Kaseya customers being breached,” the statement said. Despite this, several cybersecurity companies and experts had expressed their doubts about the limited impact, suggesting it could take more time to gauge the complete impact of the attack. Meanwhile, Coop had said that it had closed several of its stores because of crippled cash registers due to the attack earlier. It also said that alternate payment methods were being used in stores that remained open.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kaseya-ransomware-attack-it-firm-obtains-decryptor-tool-from-trusted-third-party-nearly-20-days-after-hack-101627040396436.html
23-07-2021||World||Chinese prez visits Tibet for the first time||Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) this week, the first time as the country’s head, beginning his three-day tour at a strategic border city near the Sino-India boundary in Arunachal Pradesh, on Wednesday.“Xi, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited the TAR from Wednesday to Friday for the 70th anniversary of Tibet’s peaceful liberation, the first time in the history of the party and the country,” Xinhua news agency reported. Xi stressed fully implementing the guidelines of the Communist Party of China (CPC) for governing Tibet in a new era and writing a “…new chapter of lasting stability and high-quality development for the plateau region”.The border visit comes in the backdrop of Beijing tightening controls over the remote Himalayan region’s traditional Buddhist culture and sinicising Buddhism with “Chinese socialist characteristics”; the twin approach along with an accelerated drive for economic development.The Sino-India border in Tibet is of obvious strategic significance to both countries especially in the backdrop of the ongoing military standoff in eastern Ladakh area, which on the Chinese side is in the disputed Aksai Chin region.“Xi stressed efforts to strengthen developing border areas, emphasised the four major issues of stability, development, ecology and border-area consolidation, and called for new achievements in protecting the ecology of Qinghai-Tibet plateau and advancing its sustainable development,” Xinhua said.This week’s visit to Tibet was a first for Xi as president and CPC general secretary; As China’s then vice-president, Xi led a delegation to Lhasa on July 18, 2011 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of “the peaceful liberation of Tibet’’.Photos released by Xinhua showed Xi was accompanied by Zhang Youxia, a vice chairperson of China’s Central Military Commission and a senior general in the People’s Liberation Army.It was the first time a Chinese president visited Tibet since 1990 when then leader Jiang Zemin took a tour.Xi’s predecessor, former president Hu Jintao, who was Tibet’s CPC chief during the late 1980s, never visited the region during his 10-year presidential tenure.TAKES STOCK OF KEY PROJECTSDuring his visit, Xi inspected a number of key infrastructure projects including the Sichuan-Tibet railway project and the Lhasa-Nyingchi route, an important rail line under the project, inaugurated last month.On Thursday, Xi took a train to Tibetan capital Lhasa on the Lhasa-Nyingchi route.“…Xi went to Nyingchi railway station, learning about the overall design of the Sichuan-Tibet railway and the operation of the Lhasa-Nyingchi railway section, and then took a train to the regional capital Lhasa. He inspected the construction along the railway during the ride,” Xinhua reported.The route is of strategic significance as it terminates close to the disputed border with India.In Lhasa, Xi visited a monastery and the Potala Palace Square, and “inspected ethnic religion” and Tibetan cultural heritage protection, Xinhua reported.The palace is the traditional home of Tibetan Buddhism’s spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who is in exile in India and has been branded a separatist by Beijing.It was the second time Xi visited a Tibetan area in China in seven weeks.In June, Xi went on a tour to northwest China’s Qinghai province, where he visited the capital city of Xining and the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture between June 7 and 9.It’s an important visit for Xi before the Beidaihe Conclave, an annual meeting of China’s top leaders and experts at a seaside resort near Beijing, which is usually held in August, according to India-based Tibet expert, Claude Arpi.“He visited Tibetan areas twice in less than two months (and both time, one can hear him saying Tashi Delek),” Arpi said, citing official videos showing Xi speaking the Tibetan phrase to greet locals.HYDROPOWER PROJECT ON YARLUNG ZANGBOArpi said Xi went to Nyingchi to show the importance of the new Lhasa-Nyingchi railway and probably the planned mega-hydropower project on the Yarlung Zangbo (Brahmaputra in India) besides sending the message that he cares for the remote border areas of China.“He will be able to report that everything is fine in Tibet (to balance the western propaganda on Xinjiang),” Arpi added.The Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet said that the visit may have been linked to the “…70th anniversary of the controversial 17 Point Agreement, which China falsely claims marks its ‘peaceful liberation of Tibet’, but which the Dalai Lama has renounced as an agreement made under duress”.Xi’s visit to Nyingchi comes a month after China inaugurated its first electric train service in Tibet between capital Lhasa and Nyingchi city, a week before the ruling CPC celebrated its 100th birthday on July 1.The inauguration of the new line marks a critical stage in Beijing’s long-term vision to build infrastructure in TAR and connect the remote border areas and Lhasa to interior China.The terminus of the railway line is likely to be close to the Bayi town area, near the border with India.“China has listed the development of border areas in the next five-year plan, and reducing the gap between western and eastern areas is also an important goal to be achieved marching towards the second centenary goal,” Lou Chunhao from the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told Global Times newspaper on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-prez-visits-tibet-for-the-first-time-101627038307216.html

But the percentage declined with age, and 50% of those over 80 had none.The study by two Hungarian researchers was posted online this week but not yet reviewed by other scientists. Three outside experts said they had no problems with the methodology of the study of the vaccine developed by Sinopharm’s Beijing Institute of Biological Products.“This is very, very worrying that these people, who are high-risk, have a poor antibody response,” said Jin Dong-yan, a Hong Kong University virologist who was not affiliated with the study.Antibody levels are not a direct measure of how protected a person is from Covid-19, but there is growing evidence that they are a good proxy. One expert cautioned that the choice of test kits could have limited the accuracy of the measurements.Still, the study’s findings have value and are the first public, scientific attempt to analyze the effect of the Sinopharm vaccine in the elderly, said Wang Chenguang, a former professor at Peking Union Medical College and an immunology expert.China’s National Health Commission declined to comment on the study, saying it would only respond to studies by governments or major research institutions.This is not the first time questions have been raised about the efficacy of the vaccine, which was given a greenlight by the World Health Organization in May and is being used in more than 50 countries, many of which seized upon it when other vaccines were tough to come by.A spokesperson for the WHO said Wednesday that its experts “are aware of the study and continue to look at all available evidence.” The agency's advisers raised questions months ago about whether it provided protection in people 60 and over, but when it was OK'd a WHO expert said that there was no reason to think it would work differently in the elderly.The vaccine is one of two similar shots developed by Sinopharm. The state-owned Chinese company’s research showed that almost all the participants in final-stage clinical trials were under 60 — and its own researchers said there was insufficient evidence to say whether the vaccines work in the elderly. Overall, the Beijing Institute vaccine was found to be 78% effective.In Hungary, concern about the shots led many to seek out private antibody tests. Eventually the capital city of Budapest offered free testing to elderly residents as part a bid to ratchet up pressure on the government to conduct its own wider survey and provide booster shots to those who need them.After initially rebuffing calls for a government response to efficacy concerns — including from the antibody study’s authors Balazs Sarkadi and Tamas Ferenci — Prime Minster Viktor Orban finally acquiesced last week in the face of growing public anger. He announced that the government would provide its citizens with an optional third shot.His office said, though, that all vaccines authorized by Hungary are effective.The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain both announced in May that they, too, would offer a third dose of Sinopharm amid concerns about an insufficient antibody response. Bahrain recommended that people over 50 and some other vulnerable people receive Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine as their booster regardless of whether they got Sinopharm initially.CNBG, the Sinopharm subsidiary that oversees the Beijing Institute, has said a third dose is not part of the company’s clinical guidance.It’s not clear how many doses of the Beijing Institute Sinopharm vaccine have been exported. Overall, China exported 500 million vaccines doses in the first half of the year, and the company is one of country’s two major Covid vaccine makers, along with privately owned Sinovac.The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization recently ordered 550 million doses from the two companies for the U.N.-backed COVAX program.Both Sinopharm vaccines are also in wide use in China, including in the elderly. The country’s National Health Commission said in April that the shots provide some protection, even though it acknowledged that early stages of clinical trials of Sinopharm’s vaccines and two others found fewer antibodies in people 60 and over.In Budapest, Beata Englohner became concerned for her 76-year-old mother after hearing that people who had been vaccinated with Sinopharm were shown to have no antibodies.Englohner started a Facebook group to press the government to address the issue. She is cautiously optimistic now that Hungary will offer a third dose.“We’re very glad that we achieved our aim and that we were heard,” she said. “Though we’re a bit afraid that we’ll receive what we already got before.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-covid-19-vaccine-sinopharm-less-effective-in-protecting-the-elderly-101627030960133.html
23-07-2021||World||Taliban offers peace deal, in exchange asks for Afghan President to be removed||The Taliban say they don't want to monopolise power, but they insist there won't be peace in Afghanistan until there is a new negotiated government in Kabul and President Ashraf Ghani is removed.In an interview with The Associated Press, Taliban spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, who is also a member of the group's negotiating team, laid out the insurgents' stance on what should come next in a country on the precipice.The Taliban have swiftly captured territory in recent weeks, seized strategic border crossings and are threatening a number of provincial capitals, as the last US and NATO soldiers leave Afghanistan.This week, the top US military officer, Gen. Mark Milley, told a Pentagon press conference that the Taliban have “strategic momentum,” and he did not rule out a complete Taliban takeover. But he said it is not inevitable. “I don't think the end game is yet written,” he said.Memories of the Taliban's last time in power some 20 years ago, when they enforced a harsh brand of Islam that denied girls an education and barred women from work, have stoked fears of their return among many.Afghans who can afford it are applying by the thousands for visas to leave Afghanistan, fearing a violent descent into chaos. The U.S.-NATO withdrawal is more than 95 per cent complete and due to be finished by Aug. 31.Shaheen said the Taliban will lay down their weapons when a negotiated government acceptable to all sides in the conflict is installed in Kabul and Ghani's government is gone.“I want to make it clear that we do not believe in the monopoly of power because any governments who (sought) to monopolise power in Afghanistan in the past, were not successful governments,” said Shaheen, apparently including the Taliban's own five-year rule in that assessment. “So we do not want to repeat that same formula.”But he was also uncompromising on the continued rule of Ghani, calling him a war monger and accusing him of using his Tuesday speech on the Islamic holy day of Eid-al-Adha to promise an offensive against the Taliban.Shaheen dismissed Ghani's right to govern, resurrecting allegations of widespread fraud that surrounded Ghani's 2019 election win. After that vote, both Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah declared themselves president. After a compromise deal, Abdullah is now No 2 in the government and heads the reconciliation council.Ghani has often said he will remain in office until new elections can determine the next government. His critics — including ones outside the Taliban — accuse him of seeking only to keep power, causing splits among government supporters.Last weekend, Abdullah headed a high-level delegation to the Qatari capital Doha for talks with Taliban leaders. It ended with promises of more talks, as well as greater attention to the protection of civilians and infrastructure.Shaheen called the talks a good beginning. But he said the government's repeated demands for a ceasefire while Ghani stayed in power were tantamount to demanding a Taliban surrender.“They don't want reconciliation, but they want surrendering,” he said.Before any ceasefire, there must be an agreement on a new government “acceptable to us and to other Afghans,” he said. Then “there will be no war.”Shaheen said under this new government, women will be allowed to work, go to school, and participate in politics, but will have to wear the hijab, or headscarf. He said women won't be required to have a male relative with them to leave their home, and that Taliban commanders in newly occupied districts have orders that universities, schools and markets operate as before, including with the participation of women and girls.However, there have been repeated reports from captured districts of Taliban imposing harsh restrictions on women, even setting fire to schools. One gruesome video that emerged appeared to show Taliban killing captured commandos in northern Afghanistan.Shaheen said some Taliban commanders had ignored the leadership's orders against repressive and drastic behavior and that several have been put before a Taliban military tribunal and punished, though he did provide specifics. He contended the video was fake, a splicing of separate footage.Shaheen said there are no plans to make a military push on Kabul and that the Taliban have so far “restrained” themselves from taking provincial capitals. But he warned they could, given the weapons and equipment they have acquired in newly captured districts. He contended that the majority of the Taliban's battlefield successes came through negotiations, not fighting.“Those districts which have fallen to us and the military forces who have joined us ... were through mediation of the people, through talks,” he said.“They (did not fall) through fighting ... it would have been very hard for us to take 194 districts in just eight weeks.”The Taliban control about half of Afghanistan's 419 district centers, and while they have yet to capture any of the 34 provincial capitals, they are pressuring about half of them, Milley said. In recent days, the US has carried out airstrikes in support of beleaguered Afghan government troops in the southern city of Kandahar, around which the Taliban have been amassing, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Thursday.The rapid fall of districts and the seemingly disheartened response by Afghan government forces have prompted U.S.-allied warlords to resurrect militias with a violent history. For many Afghans weary of more than four decades of war, that raises fears of a repeat of the brutal civil war in the early 1990s in which those same warlords battled for power.“You know, no one no one wants a civil war, including me,” said Shaheen.Shaheen also repeated Taliban promises aimed at reassuring Afghans who fear the group.Washington has promised to relocate thousands of U.S. military interpreters. Shaheen said they had nothing to fear from the Taliban and denied threatening them. But, he added, if some want to take asylum in the West because Afghanistan's economy is so poor, “that is up to them.”He also denied that the Taliban have threatened journalists and Afghanistan's nascent civil society, which has been targeted by dozens of killings over the past year.The Islamic State group has taken responsibility for some, but the Afghan government has blamed the Taliban for most of the killings while the Taliban in turn accuse the Afghan government of carrying out the killings to defame them. Rarely has the government made arrests into the killings or revealed the findings of its investigations.Shaheen said journalists, including those working for Western media outlets, have nothing to fear from a government that includes the Taliban.“We have not issued letters to journalists (threatening them), especially to those who are working for foreign media outlets. They can continue their work even in the future,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-offers-peace-deal-in-exchange-asks-for-afghan-president-to-be-removed-101627025296218.html
23-07-2021||World||Covid: South Korea to extend social distancing rules in Seoul for 2 more weeks||South Korea, which is currently battling its worst of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, said on Friday it will extend the ongoing social distancing rules imposed in its capital Seoul for two more weeks till August 8. The government, on July 12 imposed the highest level of social distancing restrictions (Level 4) in Seoul and neighbouring areas as the viral disease was spreading at a rapid pace.According to rules, a gathering of three or more people is banned after 6pm, churches and nightclubs are shut, rallies are banned and only 49 people are allowed to attend marriages and funerals. Restaurants and cafes can remain open only till 10pm and sporting events are allowed without any spectators, a report by Xinhua News Agency said on Friday. Companies have been recommended to allow their employees to work from home while students are only allowed to attend online classes, the report added.The above rules were set to end on Sunday, but interior and safety minister Jeon Hae-cheol said on Friday they will be in force for two more weeks. Jeon Hae-cheol added it is inevitable that social gatherings and travel are restricted to suppress a widespread domestic outbreak linked to a variety of sources in daily lives, according to the Associated Press.The government on Friday has also warned South Korea’s main labour federation to cancel a planned rally amid apprehensions that it might become a super spreader event. Over 800 members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) are expected to hold a rally in Wonju, a rural city about 100 kilometres east of Seoul, calling for a hike in wages and better welfare, Reuters reported.“The government will respond sternly according to the law and principle if a banned rally is carried out in violation of anti-epidemic rules,” minister Jeon Hae-cheol said.South Korea on Friday reported 1,630 new Covid-19 cases, which pushed the overall tally to 185,733 of which 2,066 people have succumbed to the viral disease. This is the seventeenth consecutive day that daily infections were above the 1,000-mark. Nearly 70 per cent of the recent cases have been seen in the Seoul area.A major problem which the country is facing to combat the pandemic is a sluggish rate of vaccination. A little over 13 per cent of the total 52 million has been fully vaccinated till now and just over 30 per cent have been administered the first dose.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-south-korea-to-extend-social-distancing-rules-in-seoul-for-2-more-weeks-101627023418948.html
23-07-2021||World||US bombs Taliban camps to help Afghan forces amid troop rollout: Pentagon||The US carried out airstrikes across Afghanistan in the last several days as part of an effort to support the local administration in pushing back the Taliban, news agencies reported on Friday citing officials familiar with the matter in the Pentagon. As many as five Taliban insurgents have died in the strikes, local reports added.With the Taliban increasing their advances in Afghanistan in the wake of the drawdown of American and Nato military forces, the United States has once again come to the aid of the Afghan security forces fighting the insurgents, the Pentagon said. “Without speaking to specifics, I can say that in the last several days, we have acted through airstrikes to support the ANDSF (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) but I won't get into tactical details of those strikes,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters on Thursday at a news conference in Washington.The Pentagon categorically refused to divulge too many details about the airstrikes. The local media in Afghanistan, however, stated that at least five Taliban members were killed in the airstrikes carried out by the US over the past few days. An unnamed American defence official, cited by CNN, said that the US military has so far carried out approximately six or seven strikes in the past 30 days, mostly using drones to launch the strikes.The US airstrikes targeted “captured military equipment that the Taliban [were] able to seize from the ANDSF," the official was quoted as saying.The development comes in the backdrop of the Taliban sweeping across Afghanistan in recent days, pushing back the country's military forces and taking over significant swaths of territory as the US nears the ends of its troop withdrawal.The Taliban are putting pressure on 17 of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capital, said General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Wednesday. Although he admitted that there is a possibility of a "complete Taliban takeover" of the country, General Milley asserted that "the end game is yet to be written".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bombs-taliban-camps-to-help-afghan-forces-amid-troop-rollout-pentagon-101627016726501.html

23-07-2021||World||China's Xi Jinping makes surprise visit to Tibet||Chinese president Xi Jinping has made an unannounced visit to Tibet, according to the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT). Video clips shared on Chinese social media on Thursday show Xi addressing people in the city of Nyingtri (Chinese: Linzhi), stepping out of a shop in the Barkhor area in Lhasa, and giving remarks to the public while facing the "Monument to the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" in front of the Potala Palace, the traditional winter residence of the Dalai Lama.Chinese President Xi Jinping makes an unannounced visit to Tibet. Sources told RFA that movements of Lhasa residents were restricted, and factories were shut down, during his unannounced visit. pic.twitter.com/D2EIWmd3iwChina's president Xi Jinping visited UTsang, Tibet for the first time since he became president in 2013. It is high time for him to understand the true aspiration of Tibetan people and resume the dialogue to resolve the Sino-Tibetan conflict.A recent official notice announcing the closure of the Potala on July 22 indicated a visit by a high-level dignitary, but the fact that Xi was visiting caught many observers off guard. According to sources, the visit may have been linked to the 70th anniversary of the controversial 17 Point Agreement, which China falsely claims marks its "peaceful liberation of Tibet," but which Dalai Lama has renounced as an agreement made under duress.A source told the ICT that Xi first landed at Mainling airport in Nyingtri, in southeast Tibet, on July 20. Xi addressed a public gathering in Nyingtri, stating that 10 years ago when he came as the head of the Chinese government's delegation to mark the 60th anniversary of the 17 Point Agreement, he had gone to Lhasa first. But this time, he said, he came to meet the people in Nyingtri first, telling them that not a single ethnic group should be left behind in the efforts to fully build a modern socialist China.Xi was also seen addressing a gathering in front of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, where he stated that "as long as we follow the Communist Party and as long as we stick to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we will surely realise the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as planned."A source told ICT that Xi may also visit one of the monasteries in Lhasa, possibly Drepung Monastery, during this trip.Three separate sources told ICT that their acquaintances in Lhasa reported unusual activities and monitoring of their movement in the past several days, indicating the visit of an important leader. "People reported receiving calls from security officials checking on their activities for no apparent reason. Roads in several sections of Lhasa were blocked, and the Lhasa City authorities announced the banning of drones and kites in Lhasa from July 21 to August 17," the ITC release said.While heavy security is expected for a visit by Xi anywhere, it is unusual that even Chinese state media did not report about his visit to Nyingtri and Lhasa, even though two days have already passed since his arrival.Xi last visited the Tibet Autonomous Region--which spans about half of Tibet--in 2011 when he was China's vice president. At the same, he visited Lhasa, Nyingtri, and Shigatse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xi-jinping-makes-surprise-visit-to-tibet-101627002070406.html
23-07-2021||World||US sanctions Cuban security minister, special forces unit over protest crackdown||The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on a Cuban security minister and an interior ministry special forces unit for alleged human rights abuses in a crackdown on anti-government protests earlier this month.The move marked the first concrete steps by President Joe Biden's administration to apply pressure on Cuba's Communist government as it faces calls from U.S. lawmakers and the Cuban-American community to show greater support for the biggest protests to hit the island in decades.The speed with which the administration has crafted new sanctions further signals Biden is highly unlikely to soften the U.S. approach to Cuba any time soon after his predecessor, Donald Trump, rolled back a historic Obama-era détente with Havana."This is just the beginning," Biden said in a statement, expressing condemnation for "mass detentions and sham trials.""The United States will continue to sanction individuals responsible for oppression of the Cuban people," he said.Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, in a message on Twitter, rejected the sanctions as "unfounded and slanderous" and urged the United States to apply such measures to its own record of "daily repression and policy brutality."The Treasury Department said the sanctions had been placed on an entire Interior Ministry security unit and on General Alvaro Lopez Miera, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, describing him as leader of an entity "whose members have engaged in serious human rights abuse."Thousands of Cubans staged protests a week ago to demonstrate against an economic crisis that has brought shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. Hundreds of activists were detained.Biden had promised during the 2020 campaign to reverse some of Trump's Cuba policies, but Thursday's announcement suggests little appetite for a return to rapprochement.At the same time, the administration is still seeking ways to ease the humanitarian plight of the Cuban people.The White House said on Tuesday that Biden would form a working group to examine remittances to Cuba in the wake of the protests. The aim is to determine how Cuban-Americans can send money to families on the island while keeping the funds out of the hands of the Cuban government.Trump had imposed tight restrictions on remittances, which are believed to have previously amounted to several billions of dollars annually.The White House, in a statement, cautioned that the remittances issue was complex and "requires a measured and thoughtful approach in coordination with experts."Biden reiterated on Thursday that his administration is looking for ways to help ordinary Cubans regain internet access after Havana restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp."We will work closely with our partners throughout the region, including the Organization of American States, to pressure the regime," Biden said.The Cuban government has blamed the protests mostly on what it calls U.S.-financed "counter-revolutionaries" exploiting economic hardship caused by U.S. sanctions.GLOBAL MAGNITSKY SANCTIONSThe sanctions were imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, used to punish human rights violators with U.S. asset freezes and bans on travel to the United States.But U.S. officials have acknowledged that Cuban officials rarely have U.S. financial dealings and seldom travel to the United States, limiting the practical impact of such measures.The unrest appears to have injected a new sense of urgency into Biden's broad Cuba policy review, which began shortly after he took office in January. Until now, Cuba had not been treated as a top agenda item while the administration dealt with the economic recovery and coronavirus pandemic at home and challenges such as China, Russia and Iran abroad.Cuba, a State Department official told Reuters, is now a “top priority.”Analysts say conciliatory moves are unlikely in the near term. Complicating matters was Biden's poorer-than-expected showing with voters in south Florida’s anti-communist Cuban-American community, which backed Trump’s tough policies toward Havana and Caracas and helped him win the battleground state.Many analysts say Biden may have to tread carefully on Cuba policy ahead of the 2022 congressional elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-cuban-security-minister-special-forces-unit-over-protest-crackdown-101626986998985.html

That could be decided at a later meeting.In small studies, short-term side effects from a third dose of mRNA vaccines - such as those made by BioNTech/Pfizer Inc or Moderna Inc - were about the same as those experienced with the first two doses, the CDC said in its presentation.An estimated 2.7% of U.S. adults live with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC presentation, based on data from 2013. The group includes people living with HIV/AIDS, cancer and people with organ transplants or autoimmune diseases who take drugs to dampen their immune response.Those individuals are at increased risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19.Last week, Israel began administering third doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to immunocompromised people, including those who have had heart, lung, kidney or liver transplants and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.Some experts believe the CDC is nearing a similar recommendation in the United States.The CDC has urged people with weakened immune systems to take precautions even if fully vaccinated against COVID-19.The virus not only poses an extra health risk to these people but because it takes longer for them to clear the virus, scientists believe infections could result in new variants as the pathogen continues to replicate unchecked, which some studies have shown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-advisers-mull-covid-19-boosters-for-immune-compromised-people-101626985526510.html
23-07-2021||World||FBI ignored tips on Brett Kavanaugh sexual misconduct, Senate Democrats charge||Seven Democratic senators on Thursday said that newly released materials show the FBI failed to fully investigate sexual misconduct allegations against U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he was nominated to the court in 2018.The senators, including Sheldon Whitehouse and Chris Coons, said a letter they received from the FBI last month shows the agency gathered over 4,500 tips relating to Kavanaugh without any apparent further action by investigators.According to that June 30 letter, written by FBI Assistant Director Jill Tyson, the most "relevant" of the 4,500 tips were referred to lawyers in President Donald Trump's White House whose handling of them remains unclear.The agency was conducting a background check, not a criminal investigation, so "the authorities, policies, and procedures used to investigate criminal matters did not apply," Tyson's letter said."If the FBI was not authorized to or did not follow up on any of the tips that it received from the tip line, it is difficult to understand the point of having a tip line at all," the Democratic lawmakers said in a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray sent on Wednesday night, which they released to the public on Thursday.Kavanaugh was the second of three jurists Republican Trump appointed to lifetime spots on the top court during his term, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority.His nomination blew up into a personal and political drama when university professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in Washington in 1982. Two other women accused him in the media of sexual misconduct in the 1980s.Kavanaugh fought back against the accusations, denying them in angry and tearful testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that was viewed live on television by around 20 million people.Trump, ceding to a request from Senate Republican leaders, ordered the FBI to conduct a background investigation of Kavanaugh.The FBI completed its probe after speaking with 10 people, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Potentially key witnesses, including Ford and Kavanaugh, were never interviewed as part of the investigation, and Democratic lawmakers have long said the probe was a sham.Democrats have also alleged that the Justice Department, which the FBI is part of, was politicized under Trump and sought to advance the former president's interests.A FBI spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Beth Wilkinson, a lawyer who represented Kavanaugh during his confirmation battle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Ford's lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, said in a statement that the new revelations show the FBI investigation was of limited value."Because the FBI and Trump's White House Counsel hid the ball on this, we do not know how many of those 4,500 tips were consequential, how many of those tips supported Dr. Ford's testimony, or how many showed that Kavanaugh perjured himself during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee," the lawyers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-ignored-tips-on-brett-kavanaugh-sexual-misconduct-senate-democrats-charge-101626983071758.html
23-07-2021||World||As Taliban advances, Afghan military overhauls war strategy to limit losses||Reeling from a surge in battlefield losses, Afghanistan's military is overhauling its war strategy against the Taliban to concentrate forces around the most critical areas like Kabul and other cities, border crossings and vital infrastructure, Afghan and U.S. officials say.The politically perilous strategy will inevitably cede territory to Taliban insurgents. But officials say it appears to be a militarily necessity as over-stretched Afghan troops try to prevent the loss of provincial capitals, which could deeply fracture the country.The consolidation of forces, which has been publicly acknowledged but not reported in such detail before, coincides with the U.S. military withdrawal ahead of a formal end to the military mission on Aug. 31, on orders from President Joe Biden.Taliban insurgents are gaining control of more and more territory, which the Pentagon estimated on Wednesday now extends to over half of half Afghanistan's district centers. The Taliban are also putting pressure on the outskirts of half of the provincial capitals, trying to isolate them.U.S. intelligence assessments have warned that the Afghan government could fall in as little as six months, U.S. officials told Reuters.One Afghan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the "reorientation" of troops would help Kabul hold strategic territory and defend infrastructure, including a dam built with India's assistance, and major highways.But consolidating troops also means leaving other areas unguarded, a hard sell to Afghan communities or ethnic groups who will feel they are being abandoned to the Taliban."How do you communicate this to a public that has been jittery - and understandably so - over the past few weeks in which the Taliban have been taking over districts?" the Afghan official asked."Because a major part of this reorientation would entail, at least in the short term, the Taliban filling in the vacuum that we're leaving behind."U.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the strategy would involve "giving up district centers" to protect larger population centers, like the capital Kabul. He said the Taliban appeared to have "strategic momentum.""There's a possibility of a complete Taliban takeover or a possibility of any number of other scenarios," Milley told a news conference on Wednesday, adding: "I don't think the endgame is yet written."U.S. Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in Afghanistan and support to Afghan troops, said after being briefed on the plan this month the Afghans knew they had to pick their battles."You can't defend everything. If you defend everywhere, you defend nowhere. So I think the Afghans realize they need to consolidate," McKenzie said, without offering details.He noted years-old U.S. concerns about how Afghan forces were manning checkpoints, including in remote or hostile areas that are particularly vulnerable or serve little strategic value."So, I think now they're now in the process of recognizing you got to pull back, you got to consolidate, you got to defend those areas that are absolutely critical," McKenzie said.The Afghan ministry of defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Taliban's swift territorial gains are rattling Afghans just as the United States withdraws from a war that succeeded in punishing al Qaeda following its Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington but failed to deliver anything close to peace for Afghanistan.Biden has promised to provide financial assistance to Afghan forces and to redouble diplomatic efforts to revive stalled peace talks.But the Taliban have not responded to calls from 15 diplomatic missions and the NATO representative in Afghanistan on Monday to halt their military offensives. The insurgents and the Afghan government also failed to agree on a ceasefire at talks in Doha for this week's Eid holidays.In the past, the Taliban have called short ceasefires for Eid, saying they wanted to let Afghans spend them in peace.U.S. military officials believe the Taliban are seeking to end the war with a battlefield victory, instead of at the negotiating table.'NOT SUSTAINABLE'For years, the U.S. military has been trying to get Afghan troops off of far-flung checkpoints - static positions that can easily be over-run by Taliban forces."Maintaining this spread out, every district is sacred mindset is simply only going to lead to more losses," said Jason Campbell, a former Pentagon official now at RAND Corporation."It's just not sustainable."The troop reorganization will require, in some cases, building new fortifications and creating new combinations of forces, the Afghan official said.But it will also demand that Afghans shift their thinking about how much they can do to respond to Taliban attacks and skirmishes, as their Air Force gets stretched and U.S. support wanes.Equally tricky for Kabul is explaining battlefield strategy in a way that doesn't offend any of Afghanistan's ethnic groups, which include Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks. Not all areas will receive the same level of protection.More than a quarter-million Afghans have been forced from their homes this year, according to the United Nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-taliban-advances-afghan-military-overhauls-war-strategy-to-limit-losses-101626982453303.html
23-07-2021||World||In a first, Chimpanzees spotted killing gorillas in the wild||Lethal attacks by Chimpanzees on gorillas in the wild have been observed for the first time, a team of researchers has said. The chimpanzees formed coalitions and attacked the gorillas at Loango National Park in Gabon in two encounters that lasted 52 and 79 minutes, according to the study, making it the first documented lethal coalitionary attacks by chimpanzees on another hominid species."At first, we only noticed screams of chimpanzees and thought we were observing a typical encounter between individuals of neighboring chimpanzee communities. But then, we heard chest beats, a display characteristic for gorillas, and realized that the chimpanzees had encountered a group of five gorillas," Lara M. Southern, the lead author of the study, said in a press release.Two silverbacks and adult females defended the attack and were able to escape but two gorilla infants were separated and killed by the chimpanzees. While intraspecies violence is a relatively common phenomenon in mammals, interspecies violence has mainly been investigated in the context of predation, according to the study.The authors suggested several explanations for the interspecies violence observed for the first time between chimpanzees and gorillas. Tobias Deschner, one of the co-authors, said that the increased competition among chimpanzees, gorillas and forest elephants over sharing of food resources could be the reason behind the lethal interaction. They said a scarcity of fruit in tropical forests in Gabon may have led to increased food competition."We are only at the beginning to understand the effects of competition on interactions between the two great ape species in Loango," says Simone Pika, another co-author. "Our study shows that there is still a lot to explore and discover about our closest living relatives, and that Loango National Park with its unique mosaic habitat is a unique place to do so."The study conducted by the researchers from Osnabrück University and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, has been published in the journal Nature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-chimpanzees-spotted-killing-gorillas-in-the-wild-101626980495004.html
23-07-2021||World||Taliban takeover not a foregone conclusion: Milley||The top US military leader on Wednesday expressed doubts if a Taliban victory is imminent in Afghanistan, contrary to a reported intelligence assessment.“There are a range of possible outcomes in Afghanistan,” General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said at a Pentagon news conference with secretary of defence Lloyd Austin. “A negative outcome, a Taliban automatic military takeover, is not a foregone conclusion,” he said.“The Afghan security forces have the capacity to sufficiently fight and defend their country, and we will continue to support them where necessary in accordance with the guidance from the president and the secretary of defence,” Milley said.Asked why the Taliban with 75,000 military personnel appear to be winning against the Afghan military of 300,000 with 20 years of US training and support, Milley said “warfare is not just about numbers” but also about “will and leadership” to fight and prevail.Milley said roughly 212 district centres are under Taliban control. “That’s half of the 419 in all. And the Taliban haven’t captured yet any of the 34 provincial capitals. Although the Taliban are putting pressure on the outskirts of probably about half of them - 17 of them, in fact - and what they’re trying to do is isolate the major population centres,” Milley said.US launches airstrikes to support Afghan forcesThe US military launched airstrikes this week in support of Afghan forces fighting Taliban, including in the strategically important province of Kandahar, officials said on Thursday.The US has a variety of combat aircraft based in West Asia within range of Afghanistan. Asked by a reporter about news reports of a Navy FA-18 airstrike in the Kandahar area, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said, “In the last several days, we have acted, through airstrikes, to support the ANDSF,” using an acronym for the Afghan national defence and security forces. “But I won’t get into technical details of those strikes,” Kirby said.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-takeover-not-a-foregone-conclusion-milley-101626979624538.html

NSO chief executive Shalev Hulio told Army Radio on Thursday that he would “be very pleased if there were an investigation, so that we’d be able to clear our name”. He also alleged there was an effort “to smear all the Israeli cyber industry”.NSO has said it exports to 45 countries, with approval from the Israeli government. Hulio said the company could not disclose the details of its contracts due to “issues of confidentiality”, but said he would offer full transparency to any government seeking more details.Macron holds emergency meeting on cybersecurityFrench President Emmanuel Macron held an emergency cybersecurity meeting on Thursday to weigh possible government action after reports that his cellphone and those of government ministers may have been targeted by spyware.Morocco files libel suit against Amnesty, NGOMorocco has filed defamation claims against Amnesty International and a French NGO who claim its intelligence services used the Pegasus mobile phone spyware against dozens of French journalists, lawyers for the government said.
