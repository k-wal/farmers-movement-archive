Citizen Lab’s own research has “independently arrived at a number of the same key findings as Amnesty International’s analysis”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-lab-says-amnesty-s-technique-in-digging-up-pegasus-hack-is-sound-101626718709780.html
19-07-2021||World||US, allies accuse China of Microsoft Exchange hack||The United States and its Nato, EU and Five Eyes allies on Monday jointly accused the Chinese government of using “criminal contract hackers” to carry out the hacking of Microsoft Exchange’s mail servers earlier this year that impacted tens of thousands of entities around the world.The White House has called the move “unprecedented”. This is the first instance of the Nato, a military alliance of 30 nations, condemning China for cyberattacks. The collection of countries in this effort is the largest to jointly denounce aggressive cyber operations by China. The EU has 27 members, and the Five Eyes is an intelligence sharing pact of the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.It could not be immediately ascertained if India, which was also impacted by the Microsoft hacking, was invited to join or chose not to. A senior Biden administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said “we’re expecting additional countries in the coming weeks”.The United States and its allies are “exposing the PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) use of criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally, including for their own personal profit”, the White House said in a statement on Monday.It added that the US and its allies are “attributing with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors” of China’s ministry of state security, which is the country’s civilian intelligence agency, “conducted cyber espionage operations utilising the zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server”, which was disclosed by the company in March. These were vulnerabilities in is Exchange Server email and calendar software. While they had been around for 10 years, Chinese hackers had been exploiting them since at least January.The US and its allies did not announce retaliatory measures of the kind used against Russia, such as sanctions. But while not ruling out further action against China, the senior Biden administration official said, “We really focused initially in bringing other countries along with us. And this is really an unprecedented group of allies and partners holding China accountable.”The official underlined “it’s the first time that Nato has condemned PRC’s cyber activities”.The US justice department has announced criminal charges against four MSS hackers addressing “activities concerning a multi-year campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors, including maritime, aviation, defence, education, and healthcare in a least a dozen countries”. They refer specifically also to how the MSS hackers stole Ebola virus vaccine research and “demonstrate that the PRC’s theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, and confidential business information extends to critical public health information”.Separately, the US National Security Agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency of the department of homeland security, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a cybersecurity advisory of techniques that Chinese hackers used to target US and allied networks, including those used when targeting the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities.The US believes Chinese hackers are generally more closely tied to the Chinese government than the Russians are to theirs. On the Russian side, the US administration official said, “we sometimes see individuals moonlighting. And we see, you know, some connections between Russian intelligence services and individuals. But this kind of... use of criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally is distinct”.The Chinese hackers’ entire range of activities - cyber-enabled extortion and crypto-jacking - are intended, the official said, “for financial gain of PRC government-affiliated cyber operators”. The official added that the MSS “uses criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally, including for their own personal profit”.The US is aware of instances in which PRC government-affiliated cyber operators have carried out ransomware operations against private companies and millions of dollars of ransom were demanded. No details were shared about these companies, which included an American firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-allies-accuse-china-of-microsoft-exchange-hack-101626717749621.html
19-07-2021||World||Joe Biden urges Americans to get vaccinated for the economy||US President Joe Biden urged Americans on Monday to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, insisting that the economy is entirely dependent on getting the pandemic under control. "So please, please get vaccinated. Get vaccinated now."The vaccination drive in the US started to lag as the country is confronted with an ever-growing surplus of coronavirus vaccine and looming expiration dates while countries in the developing world are in dire need of more vaccine doses to counter a rise in infections.The US had been inoculating 870,000 individuals every day at the beginning of June, marking a sharp decline from the 3.3 million a day on average vaccinations it did in mid-April, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.States have tried to deal with vaccine hesitancy through million-dollar prizes, hunting rifles, marijuana, and free beer but states like Oklahoma, Tennessee, and North Carolina are showing signs of reducing vaccine demands. Oklahoma has not asked for new doses from the federal government for more than a month. Tennessee and North Carolina both have vaccinated less than half of their population, reported Associated Press.Biden had set a goal to administer at least one dose of the vaccine to 70% of the adults in the country by July 4, but it remained unfulfilled. The President had accused social media giants of peddling vaccine misinformation and “killing people” by allowing the posts to circulate. Facebook fired back after Biden’s remarks on Friday, declaring that the accusation was “not supported by facts”. “Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed,” the company’s vice president of integrity, Guy Rosen, said in a blog post.The President attempted to smooth things over on Monday, asking the social media giant to not take things personally and to do something about the vaccine misinformation available on its site. “My hope is, that Facebook instead of taking it personally that somehow I’m saying Facebook is killing people, that they would do something about the misinformation,” Biden said during a press briefing. “The outrageous misinformation about the vaccine, that’s what I meant.” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-urges-americans-to-get-vaccinated-for-the-economy-101626715472792.html
19-07-2021||World||US won't compel journalists to reveal sources: Officials||The US government pledged Monday to steer clear of legal orders that force journalists to reveal their sources, with only rare exceptions, reversing course after revelations of secret efforts to obtain information from the media.A statement from the agency said it would no longer use the "compulsory legal process" including subpoenas or warrants to obtain records or identify sources from journalists involved in newsgathering activities.The new policy comes following revelations that former president Donald Trump's Justice Department secretly obtained phone records of journalists investigating his administration, inducing from CNN, the Washington Post and New York Times.The statement said the policy shift was made "because a free and independent press is vital to the functioning of our democracy."It said the new policy applies to reporters, publishers, third-party service providers and others involved in newsgathering, and to physical or digital documents as well as phone records.Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the new policy in a memo and called for "a review process to further explain, develop and codify the policy."Monday's announcement comes after news that the Trump administration sought records of journalists investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election, while obtaining "gag orders" to keep that effort secret.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last month that the use of such orders in leak investigations "is not consistent with the president's policy direction."The Garland memo said exceptions to the policy would be made if the journalist were the subject of an investigation, or was suspected of being a foreign agent or member of a terrorist group, or in cases of "imminent" risk of death or bodily harm.While the cases involving the Trump administration have drawn scrutiny recently, the policy change addresses a longstanding concern on press freedom and follows several cases where journalists have been threatened with jail for refusing to reveal sources."The attorney general has taken a necessary and momentous step to protect press freedom at a critical time," said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press."This historic new policy will ensure that journalists can do their job of informing the public without fear of federal government intrusion into their relationships with confidential sources."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-won-t-compel-journalists-to-reveal-sources-officials-101626712070812.html

"There has been a delay in arrival of INS Airawat reaching Tanjung Priok, Indonesia, carrying 300 oxygen concentrators & 100 MT of Liquid Medical Oxygen from India. Will keep you posted for further developments,” he said.“India stands with its partners in the fight against Covid," the minister added.Update: There has been a delay in arrival of INS Airawat reaching Tanjung Priok, Indonesia, carrying 300 oxygen concentrators & 100 MT of Liquid Medical Oxygen from India. Will keep you posted for further developments.India stands with its partners in the fight against Covid.Indonesia, which had provided oxygen support to India even two months ago when the latter was reeling under an intense second wave of the virus, is grappling with a serious shortage of oxygen supply at the moment. The world’s fourth-most populated country recorded 34,257 new cases of Covid-19 and 1,338 deaths in the last 24 hours, reported ANI.The Indonesian government has been reaching out to China, Australia and Singapore seeking help to address their oxygen crisis. It had sent around 3,400 oxygen cylinders and concentrators to India in May.Also Read: Indonesia tops Brazil in reporting highest daily Covid-19 deathsAccording to a Reuters report, the Indonesian government plans to set up nearly 8,000 new hospital beds and adopt newer measures to boost the number of health workers and oxygen supplies. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted the country’s poor and on Saturday, Luhut Pandjaitan, the minister leading the fight against the pandemic, apologised for the same saying "it (government policy) is not optimal".The health ministry’s vaccination spokesperson, Siti Nadia Tarmizi, said the inoculation drive against the virus remained focussed on Java and Bali as it awaited an increase in production capacity of ready-to-use doses.Indonesia has distributed 73.6 million doses of vaccine across the archipelago. Jakarta has fully vaccinated 24 per cent of its 8.3 million people and southeast Sulawesi has administered doses to 6 per cent of its two million. A majority of the inoculations has been done with Sinovac shots sent by China. The country also has supplies of AstraZeneca, Sinopharm and Moderna vaccines, which are meant to be given to medical workers as booster shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ins-airavat-carrying-covid-aid-to-indonesia-delayed-tweets-jaishankar-101626708745525.html

She was abducted while riding a rented vehicle and was held for several hours before being released. She was found near F-9 Park area of the capital with torture marks on her body.Pakistan's Foreign Office in an overnight statement said the reported abduction and assault of the daughter of Afghanistan’s ambassador is being investigated and followed-up at the highest level on the instructions of Prime Minister Khan.Pakistan termed as "unfortunate and regrettable" Afghanistan's decision to recall its ambassador and other senior diplomats from Islamabad, and urged Kabul to reconsider the move.Meanwhile, Pakistan also called back its ambassador to Afghanistan for "consultations" on the alleged abduction and release of the Afghan envoy’s daughter in Islamabad, according to the Foreign Office.Ambassador Mansoor Ahmad Khan arrived here on Sunday to meet Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood.Mahmood on Monday met the Afghan envoy and highlighted all the steps taken by the government and re-assured him of full cooperation.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid told Geo TV on Sunday that the entire episode of abduction was the result of an "international racket" to defame Pakistan."She went to Rawalpindi on her own will... we have CCTV footage. This is a conspiracy," he said.In a statement issued on Saturday, Afghanistan demanded Pakistan “to identify and prosecute the perpetrators at the soonest possible time”.The Afghan foreign ministry also said it “expresses its deep concern over the safety and security of diplomats, their families, and staff members of the Afghan political and consular missions in Pakistan”.Pakistan and Afghanistan often trade accusations, with Kabul claiming Islamabad is sending thousands of militants to fight in the war-torn country and providing safe haven for the Taliban. Pakistan, in turn, claims that Afghanistan harbours the anti-Pakistani group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan - the Pakistani Taliban - and also the secessionist Balochistan Liberation Army.Afghanistan has seen an uptick in violence after US President Joe Biden’s announcement of the withdrawal of US and NATO troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paks-qureshi-assures-justice-over-abduction-of-afghan-ambassador-s-daughter-101626696560237.html

As per the team’s findings, 98.8 per cent of the residents that were found Covid-19 positive in February or March 2020 were found with detectable levels of antibodies in November 2020. The team used three assays, tests that detect antibodies that respond to different parts of the virus. “The results showed that while all antibody types showed some decline between May and November, the rate of decay was different depending on the assay,” the Imperial College London said.Also read | Boris Johnson urges caution against Delta variant as he self-isolatesMeanwhile, the antibody levels were found to have increased in some people, suggesting potential cases of re-infection by the virus and providing a boost to the immune system.“We found no evidence that antibody levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections differ significantly, suggesting that the strength of the immune response does not depend on the symptoms and the severity of the infection,” the lead author of the study Dr Ilaria Doreigatti, from the Imperial College London said. “However, our study does show that antibody levels vary, sometimes markedly, depending on the test used. This means that caution is needed when comparing estimates of infection levels in a population obtained in different parts of the world with different tests and at different times” the author further said.The infection status of household members was also analysed to estimate how likely an infected person is to pass on the infection within the household. A probability of about one in four that the virus is transmitted within a household. It also showed that most transmission (79 per cent) is caused by 20 per cent of infections.According to the team, the finding confirms that the majority of infections doesn’t generate further infections and only a minority of the infections caused a large number of infections. It also showed that physical distancing, limiting the number of contacts and wearing face masks continue to remain important measures in reducing the risk of transmission even in highly vaccinated populations.The data also showed that in the absence of case isolation and short lockdowns, manual contact tracing alone would not have been enough to suppress the pandemic, the Imperial College further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-antibodies-last-9-months-after-infection-claims-study-101626699724035.html
19-07-2021||World||Blue Origin all set to soar into space on Tuesday, Bezos asks crew to 'relax'||Blue Origin, the company founded by American businessman Jeff Bezos, is all set for a space mission on Tuesday. The passengers include Bezos, his brother, an 82-year-old aviation pioneer and a teenage tourist.The capsule is entirely automated, unlike Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic rocket plane that required two pilots to get him to space earlier this month.Explained: How to become a space tourist and the costAhead of the ambitious mission, Bezos appeared on CBS’ 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' where he told the fellow travellers to "sit back, relax, look out of the window, just absorb the view outside".The Blue Origin mission is yet another step by a billionaire to open the space frontier for tourists. Though the commercial operations are scheduled to begin from next year, Bezos and Branson want to be the leaders in the field.Blue Origin’s 60-foot (18-metre) New Shepard rocket will accelerate toward space at three times the speed of sound, or Mach 3, before separating from the capsule and returning for an upright landing. It will cross the Karman Line, 100 kilometres above, from where the limit of the space starts. The line has been set by an international aeronautics body as defining the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space.The passengers will experience three to four minutes of weightlessness, before their capsule parachutes onto the desert just 10 minutes after lift-off.Ariane Cornell, director of astronaut sales at Blue Origin, said that the crew members will "experience the flight of a lifetime".Blue Origin's training programme, according to the company, includes safety briefings, a simulation of the spaceflight, a review of the rocket and its operations, and instruction on how to float around the craft's cabin after the capsule sheds Earth's gravity.Another billionaire businessman Elon Musk is also eyeing the space tourism sector, pledging to go even higher in September, sending an all-civilian crew for a several-day orbital flight aboard its Crew Dragon capsule.US space agency NASA and the American Air Force define an astronaut as anyone who has flown higher than 50 miles (80 km).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blue-origin-all-set-to-soar-into-space-on-tuesday-bezos-asks-crew-to-relax-101626698754208.html
19-07-2021||World||Thailand switching to Chinese vaccines due to lack of AstraZeneca supplies||Thailand plans to use more Chinese-made vaccines to fill the gap in supply from AstraZeneca Plc, with the country kicking off a world-first mixed dose regime amid an unprecedented flareup in its Covid outbreak.Thai health officials began administering Astra vaccine on Monday as the second shot to recipients of Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s first jab to boost the defense against the more contagious delta variant that’s seen driving daily caseload to as high as 20,000 by next month. Under the revised vaccine regime, Thailand will use five million Sinovac shots per month, according to Opas Karnkawinpong, director-general of the Department of Disease Control.Thailand is chasing additional vaccine deals, after Astra, which was seen as the primary supplier for its national rollout, conveyed its inability to meet targets set by the government, citing the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker’s export commitments. The government is also working to procure more shots from manufacturers such as Pfizer Inc., according to Opas.Authorities are trying to ramp up vaccinations to reduce hospitalization and death rates as the surge of new infections overwhelms the nation’s public health system. The country reported 11,784 new cases on Monday, the highest single-day increase since the pandemic began, even as the country’s hotspots entered the second week of the most stringent containment measures in more than a year.Thailand’s latest vaccine strategy is a departure from its original plan of solely relying on Astra vaccine, which is being locally produced by Siam Bioscience Ltd., to administer 10 million shots per month. With two-thirds of local Astra output slated for exports, Thailand is expected to receive only about five million doses per month, forcing officials to find ways to bolster its supplies, including discussions of limiting exports.“The government has been working on assumptions based on the best case scenario and underestimated the situation. They didn’t have plans to reduce any risks or anticipate any uncertainties,” said Wiroj Lakkhanaadisorn, a lawmaker from the opposition Move Forward party. “Deaths and economic losses could have been avoided with better planning and management.”Officials had earlier limited the use of Sinovac shots to its health-care and front-line workers, but later expanded it for regions with outbreaks or with plans to reopen for tourists. To date the country has administered 14.2 million doses, enough to cover about 10% of its population. Of the total doses, Sinovac made up 53%, followed by AstraZeneca at 44% and Sinopharm at 3%, according to Health Ministry data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-switching-to-chinese-vaccines-due-to-lack-of-astrazeneca-supplies-101626686560374.html

The Chinese vessel eventually moved away from the area, the statement said.The foreign vessel sent a radio message identifying itself as “Chinese Navy Warship 189” and asked the Philippine ship tailing it to keep distance, the Coast Guard said.The two nations’ vessels have been locked in a standoff in the South China Sea for months, after hundreds of Chinese ships swarmed disputed territory earlier this year. The Philippines has repeatedly protested the ships’ presence and has been backed by the US, while Beijing has said its actions were normal and legitimate.Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing Monday in Beijing that he was unaware of the matter and directed questions to other authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-challenges-chinese-warship-in-south-china-sea-101626687631055.html

Under a long-standing practice, Jews are allowed to visit — but not pray -- at the site, which they revere as the Temple Mount and which Muslims hold sacred as the home of the Al Aqsa Mosque.Palestinians and the site’s Islamic authorities fear that Israel is slowly trying to take control of the area and have complained in the past that Jews continued to pray at the site. Friction remains high there after unrest helped spark the 11-day Israel-Hamas war in May.Despite Bennett's phrasing, the status quo holds, according to an official in the prime minister's office who was not authorized to speak publicly and demanded anonymity.The clarification came after a tense day in which hundreds of Jewish pilgrims visited the compound under heavy police guard to mark Tisha B'Av, a day of mourning and repentance when Jews reflect on the destruction of the First and Second Temples. The hilltop compound, they believe, is where the biblical Temples once stood and is the holiest site in Judaism.Muslims revere the site as the Noble Sanctuary, home to the Al Aqsa Mosque and the third-holiest site in Islam. Earlier Sunday, Muslim worshippers briefly clashed with Israeli security forces at the flashpoint shrine.No injuries were reported, but the incident again raised tensions. It came just days before Muslims celebrate the festival of Eid al-Adha, or Feast of the Sacrifice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-change-to-ban-on-jewish-prayer-at-mosque-says-new-israeli-prime-minister-101626691984824.html

This is the right moment. But we’ve got to do it cautiously. We’ve got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there. Cases are rising, we can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant,” he saidThe UK government has decided to implement the final step from their four-step roadmap to end lockdown, Covid restrictions have now been replaced with guidelines urging citizens to deploy personal judgement and responsibility on face masks in indoor settings and caution in large gatherings.“We’re doing a big opening up, and that’s quite right. If we don’t do it now we’ll be opening up in the autumn and winter months when the virus has the advantage of the cold weather. We’ll lose the precious firebreak we get with the school holidays,” Johnson said in a video posted on Twitter on Sunday.Also Read: UK lifts Covid-19 restrictions amid anxiety over fresh surge“So please, please, please be cautious. Go forward into the next step with all the right prudence and respect for other people and the risks that the disease continues to present,” he added.Johnson will be self-isolating till July 26 as vaccinated individuals who come in contact with Covid-positive ones have to undergo a 10-day quarantine. Johnson and his minister Rishi Sunak had earlier announced that they will be taking part in a pilot project that will allow them to continue working from Downing Street despite being contacted by the National Health Service (NHS) Test and Trace system to self-isolate following Javid’s positive Covid-19 test. However, he announced on Sunday’s video that the project was scrapped. “We did look briefly at the idea of us taking part in the pilot scheme, which allows people to test daily, but I think it’s far more important that everybody sticks to the same rules and that’s why I’m going to be self-isolating until Monday 26th July,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-urges-caution-against-delta-variant-as-he-selfisolates-101626691927813.html

19-07-2021||World||Pilgrims ascend Mount Arafat near Mecca in high point of pandemic-era hajj||Muslim pilgrims ascended Saudi Arabia's Mount Arafat on Monday in the high point of this year's hajj, being held in downsized form and under coronavirus restrictions for the second year running.Just 60,000 people, all citizens or residents of Saudi Arabia, have been selected to take part in this year's hajj, with foreign pilgrims again barred.The mask-clad faithful, who had spent the night in camps in the Valley of Mina, converged on Mount Arafat where it is believed the Prophet Mohammed delivered his final sermon, for the most important of the hajj rituals.Worshippers will assemble on the 70-metre (230-foot) high hill and its surrounding plain for hours of prayers and Koran recitals to atone for their sins, staying there until the evening.After sunset they head to Muzdalifah, halfway between Arafat and Mina, where they will sleep under the stars before performing the symbolic "stoning of the devil".The scene was dramatically different to past pilgrimages, which have drawn up to 2.5 million people, and this year the mountain was free of the huge crowds that descend on it in normal years.Privileged fewBeing one of the lucky few "gives you a feeling that our God is forgiving and has chosen us to be in this place," said Selma Mohamed Hegazi, a 45-year-old Egyptian. "God willing, our prayers will be accepted."My whole body is shivering," she told AFP as she stood among the other emotional pilgrims, wearing the ihram, the traditional seamless white garment worn during the hajj.Worshippers described a sense of tranquility descending on the mountain, also known as the "Mount of Mercy"."To be one of only 60,000 doing hajj ....I feel like I am part of a (privileged) group that was able to reach this place," said Baref Siraj, a 58-year-old Saudi national.The hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam and a must for able-bodied Muslims with the means to travel at least once in their lifetime, is usually one of the world's largest religious gatherings.Hosting the hajj is a matter of prestige for Saudi rulers, for whom the custodianship of Islam's holiest sites is their most powerful source of political legitimacy.But barring overseas pilgrims has caused deep disappointment among Muslims worldwide, who typically save for years to take part.Participants were chosen from more than 558,000 applicants through an online vetting system, with the event confined to fully vaccinated adults aged 18-65 with no chronic illnesses.Safety firstAuthorities are seeking to repeat last year's successful event which took place on the smallest scale in modern history with just 10,000 participants, but which saw no virus outbreak.Saudi health authorities said Sunday that not a single Covid case had been reported amongst the pilgrims this year.The kingdom has so far recorded more than 509,000 coronavirus infections, including over 8,000 deaths. Some 20 million vaccine doses have been administered in the country of over 34 million people.The hajj, which typically packs large crowds into congested religious sites, could have been a super-spreader event for the virus.But Saudi Arabia has said it is deploying the "highest levels of health precautions" in light of the pandemic and the emergence of new variants.Pilgrims are being divided into groups of just 20 to restrict potential exposure, and a "smart hajj card" has been introduced to allow contact-free access to camps, hotels and the buses to ferry pilgrims around religious sites.Black-and-white robots have been deployed to dispense bottles of sacred water from the Zamzam spring in Mecca's Grand Mosque, built around the Kaaba, the black cubic structure towards which Muslims around the world pray.Ibrahim Siam, a 64-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who comes from Dammam in the east of the country, said that high-tech procedures introduced to manage the hajj "have made things a lot easier."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilgrims-ascend-mount-arafat-near-mecca-in-high-point-of-pandemic-era-hajj-101626679704652.html

At such a time, following Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance has become even more important.The video shows the passengers, almost all of whom can be seen wearing masks, expressing disapproval of the maskless young man boarding the carriage. At the beginning of the video, a passenger can be seen stopping the man from going further into the train. Soon after, two women push him towards the door as commotion unfolds inside the carriage.Although the maskless man shows some resistance, he is eventually forced to leave the train after passengers continue to push him and point towards the door. Interestingly, the video shows that when the man is kicked out of the train, he goes to one corner near a bench, and continues to wait for the next train without wearing a mask.Notably, the Spanish government lifted the mandate to wear masks outdoors from June 26 onwards. The country followed the decision by France, which also ended the compulsory wearing of masks outdoors due to falling Covid-19 infection rates, Reuters reported.However, as per El Pais report, the governments’ guidelines approve going maskless in outdoor spaces only if a safe distance of 1.5 metres can be maintained. Individuals are required to carry masks, and wear them if there is a crowd. The rules also mandate wearing a face mask when on public transportation such as buses, underground metro, and trains, among others. Individuals can only remain unmasked if they’re able to maintain the 1.5 metres safe distance or travelling alone on a private vehicle.The video on Twitter has already got more than 260,000 views. Netizens were divided between their opinions on the incident. Under the comments section, while some supported the passengers, others criticised the way the man was treated by them.🚨🇪🇸 | NEW: Passengers throw a guy off a train in Spain for not wearing a mask pic.twitter.com/CQNPidJHxkSpain’s coronavirus situation has been worrying lately with the European nation’s 14-day cumulative contagion rate rising to 537 cases per 100,000 inhabitants on July 16, Reuters reported citing the country's health ministry data.Spain has been seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases since June-end, with the latest 14-day contagion rate being the highest since February this year.According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, the number of Covid-19 patients has almost doubled in the span of 14 days.

19-07-2021||World||Norovirus outbreak in UK: All you need to know about the infection||The United Kingdom, which has relaxed the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) restrictions, is now reporting an outbreak of norovirus. Public Health England (PHE) recently issued a warning after finding a jump in norovirus cases during a routine surveillance.In the five weeks since the end of May, 154 cases of norovirus have been recorded in England, according to PHE. The health body said that this is is a three-fold increase in cases over the same time period during the previous five years.And in a more worrying development, the PHE reported increase in norovirus cases in educational settings, particularly in nursery and childcare facilities.What is norovirus?According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), norovirus is a very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea. The PHE calls it a "winter vomiting bug".According to CDC, people with norovirus illness can shed billions of virus particles. And only a few of them can make other people sick.How can someone contract norovirus?This increase in cases of norovirus can be a reason of concern for England as well as the world which is already grappling with the spread of Covid-19.According to CDC, a person can contract norovirus by coming in direct contact of an infected person, consuming contaminated food or water and touching contaminated surfaces and then putting your unwashed hands in your mouth.So, the spread is very similar to the way other viruses enter the human body.What are the symptoms of norovirus?The CDC has listed following symptoms of norovirus: diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain. It can cause inflammation of stomach or intestines - called acute gastroenteritis.Other symptoms include fever, headache and body aches.Most people develop the symptoms within 12 to 48 hours of contracting the norovirus, and they can last upto 1 to 3 days.Can someone contract norovirus many times?Yes, says the CDC because there are many different types of noroviruses. And infection with one type of norovirus may not protect you against other types, the health body further said.Though there is a possibility to develop immunity against certain types of norovirus, experts are not yet able to determine how long that immunity lasts.How can the spread of norovirus be stopped?By practicing proper hand hygiene - a method which is very similar to stopping the spread of Covid-19. The health experts say it is essential to wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers, before eating, preparing, or handling food, and before giving yourself or someone else medicine.The experts say that norovirus can stay in human faeces and vomit for two weeks or more, even after a person starts feeling better. Alcohol-based sanitisers are recommended.Treatment for norovirusWell, there is no specific medicine. Experts suggest drinking plenty of liquids to replace fluid lost from vomiting and diarrhea. This will help prevent dehydration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norovirus-outbreak-in-uk-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-infection-101626675876464.html

"One year and a half has passed, but there is no prospect of the trial being held."The two men, who had faced up to three years in prison, pleaded guilty and made a tearful apology to the court last month, saying they regretted their role in smuggling Ghosn out of Japan hidden in a box aboard a private jet from the Kansai airport at the end of 2019.Prosecutors said the Taylors received $1.3 million for their services and another $500,000 for legal fees.Ghosn remains a fugitive in his childhood home of Lebanon, which doesn't have an extradition treaty with Japan.In Japan, he faces charges he understated his compensation in Nissan's financial statements by 9.3 billion yen ($85 million) over a decade and enriched himself at his employer's expense through payments to car dealerships in the Middle East.Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive charged with helping Ghosn hide his compensation, is also on trial in Tokyo. Both Ghosn and Kelly deny the charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-father-son-duo-jailed-for-helping-former-nissan-boss-carlos-ghosn-flee-japan-101626673703363.html
19-07-2021||World||To tackle income inequality, China teaches billionaires lesson in generosity||Billionaires in China are being forced to find their philanthropic spirit as the Chinese government attempts to bridge the gap between the rich and poor, multiple media outlets, including Al-Jazeera, have reported. According to a 2021 Hurun Global Rich List data, China has over 1,058 billionaires, more than any country on the planet including the United States. With the rapid rise in the ultra-wealthy people in the country, income disparity has also seen a jump, triggering the communist government to force billionaires to make donations for various causes.In June, the founder of food delivery giant Meituan, Wang Xing donated shares worth about $2.27 billion to his personal charity to promote scientific research and education. In March, the founder of e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, Colin Huang, announced he was stepping down as chairman after last year giving away 2.37% of his shares, worth $1.85 billion for education.He Xiangjian of the Midea home appliances empire and Xu Jiayin of the Evergrande real estate empire have also donated roughly $975 mill and $370m respectively to poverty alleviation, medical care and cultural programmes. In May, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming gave around $77 million for education to his hometown of Longyan in Fujian province.The government in China has a firm grip on the political economy of the country and the recent rise in economic inequality has alarmed the government that it could threaten the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. The move to force billionaires to make such gestures also comes as the Chinese government has brought companies under the scrutiny of its anti-trust regulator.According to Min Zhou, director of the Asia Pacific Center at the University of California, Western-style philanthropy first took root in China a decade ago. In 2010, American billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates visited China for charitable activities. During the trip they praised the move by the Chinese government, Zhou also informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/to-tackle-income-inequality-china-teaches-billionaires-lesson-in-generosity-101626667866110.html
19-07-2021||World||UK lifts Covid-19 restrictions amid anxiety over fresh surge||The British government on Monday went ahead with the reopening plan and lifted all pandemic restrictions, including mandatory wearing of face masks, even as Covid-19 cases grew exponentially amid concerns of a possible third wave worldwide.From midnight 2300 GMT Sunday (local time), nightclubs, cinemas and other indoor venues in England are allowed to run at full capacity, while legal mandates covering the wearing of masks and working from home have been scrapped. Residents of the UK, who have been fully vaccinated, returning from "amber list" destinations in Europe will no longer have to quarantine.The move to reopen the country aims to revive the economy battered by its deepest recession in 300 years. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended the decision saying, "If we don't do it now, then we'll be opening up in the autumn, the winter months when the virus has the advantage of the cold weather."In a video message for the nation, Johnson also said that "If we don't do it now, we've got to ask ourselves, when will we ever do it? So this is the right moment, but we've got to do it cautiously."Over the last few weeks, Britain has been facing a new wave of infections as the daily number topped 50,000. The surge has been mostly led by the Delta variant of the coronavirus. With this, hospitals in the UK are also facing rising admissions as they jumped to the highest since late March, multiple news agencies reported. However, hospitalisations have been at a slower pace than new infections.While many have dubbed this as "Freedom Day," epidemiologists and other critics have expressed grave concerns and say the move is coming too soon. Medics also warned that even if Britain is suffering far fewer deaths than in previous waves, such a caseload would still put severe pressure on the National Health Service (NHS) and risks seeding new variants, according to an AFP report.Bloomberg cited a poll for YouGov Plc saying that 60 per cent of British residents are feeling increasingly nervous about the lifting of the restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lifts-covid-19-restrictions-amid-anxiety-over-fresh-surge-101626661154510.html
19-07-2021||World||Taliban leadership says ready for a political solution in Afghanistan||The Taliban's supreme leader said Sunday he "strenuously favours" a political settlement to the conflict in Afghanistan, even as the hardline Islamist movement pushes a sweeping offensive across the nation.Hibatullah Akhundzada's announcement came as representatives of the insurgents and the Afghan government sat down for a new round of talks in Qatar, stirring dim hopes for a revival of long-stalled peace talks."In spite of the military gains and advances, the Islamic Emirate strenuously favours a political settlement in the country," Akhundzada said in a statement ahead of next week's Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha."Every opportunity for the establishment of an Islamic system, peace and security that presents itself will be made use of by the Islamic Emirate," he added."We fully assure neighbouring, regional and world countries that Afghanistan will not permit anyone to pose a security threat to any other country using our soil."For months, the two sides have been meeting intermittently in the Qatari capital, but have achieved little if any notable success. The discussions appear to have lost momentum as the militants made enormous gains on the battlefield.The head of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah said the two sides were to meet on Sunday evening, but ducked journalists' questions about a possible joint statement.There were no signs of an imminent breakthrough.'Resolve it ourselves' Taliban leader Akhundzada said his group remained committed to forging a solution to end the war, but slammed the group's opponents for "wasting time"."Our message remains that instead of relying on foreigners, let us resolve our issues among ourselves and rescue our homeland from the prevailing crisis," he added.The insurgents capitalised on the last stages of the withdrawal of US and other foreign troops from Afghanistan to launch a series of lightning offensives across the country.The group is now believed to control roughly half of the nation's 400 districts, several important border crossings, and has laid siege to a string of vital provincial capitals.A spokesman for the Afghan security forces said that pro-government fighters had conducted 244 operations, killing 967 "enemy" fighters -- including key commanders."We have recaptured 24 districts so far, our goal is to retake all the territories... We are ready to defend our country," Ajmal Omar Shinwari told reporters.The Taliban have long appeared to be united, operating under an effective chain of command and carrying out complex military campaigns despite perennial rumours of splits within their leadership.But questions remain over how much control the Taliban's leaders have over commanders on the ground, and whether they will be able to convince them to abide by a potential agreement if signed.Despite coming days ahead of the Eid holiday, the leader's statement notably made no mention of a formal call for a ceasefire.Over the years, the Taliban have announced a series of short truces during Islamic holidays, initially spurring hopes for a larger reduction of violence.However the group has been criticised for using the temporary ceasefires to resupply and reinforce their fighters, allowing them to launch withering onslaughts on Afghanistan's security forces once the truce expires.Temporary ceasefiresIn another sign of the threats facing the Afghan government, on Sunday it said it was recalling its ambassador to Islamabad and all senior diplomats over "security threats".The top envoy's daughter was briefly kidnapped in the Pakistani capital this week.Islamabad has touted a conference of regional leaders to address the violence after the Eid al-Adha holiday, due to start Monday.Many in Afghanistan are planning for a subdued Eid festival."This year we will not be slaughtering" sheep or goats, as per tradition, said Abdullah, a resident of Jalalabad in Afghanistan's east."It's because the situation of our country is not good. The fighting is ongoing. We are concerned," he added."People are poor and most of them are worried about the increase in violence."The US-led military coalition has been on the ground in Afghanistan for nearly two decades following an invasion launched in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks.Fears are growing that Afghan forces will be overwhelmed without vital coalition air support, allowing for a complete Taliban military takeover or the start of a multi-sided civil war in a country awash with weapons following nearly four decades of fighting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-leadership-says-ready-for-a-political-solution-in-afghanistan-101626660650352.html
