Xi’s comments come on the eve of China’s army day and are a reiteration of what was decided during the plenary session of the CPC in October 2020.Xi while addressing a group study session of the CPC Political Bureau on Saturday asked the army to build the determination to work hard and achieve the goal set for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) which celebrates its 100 years in 2027. He said that the goal is in alignment with national strength and it fulfils the future national defence needs of China.Xi heads the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) which is the overall high command of the Chinese military. He also emphasised on holding military exercises in real battle conditions to win wars and rapid modernisation of the PLA.The Chinese president punished over 50 top generals besides a host of mid-rung officials as it held a massive anti-corruption drive after coming to power. On Saturday, he extended regards to officers, soldiers and civilian personnel of the PLA and the People's Armed Police Force. This meeting comes ahead of the 94th anniversary of the PLA on Sunday.Xi also highlighted during the meeting that these goals set by him are necessary to ‘build a modern socialist country’.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-demands-rapid-modernisation-of-pla-ahead-of-china-s-army-day-101627752943558.html

Below a certain reading, they need to be hospitalised.The NHS, the UK state-funded health service, supplies them to those with virus symptoms, aged over 65 or clinically vulnerable.The NHS said in a statement that "there have been reports that pulse oximeters can be less accurate for people with darker skin because they may show higher readings of the oxygen level in the blood".The devices, clipped on to a finger, work by shining a light through a person's skin to measure the level of oxygen in the blood.Updated guidance for virus sufferers on the main NHS website now warns: "There have been some reports they may be less accurate if you have brown or black skin."They may show readings higher than the level of oxygen in your blood."But the important thing is to check regularly whether to see if they are going down, it adds.Habib Naqvi, director of the NHS Race and Health Observatory, said the issue affected "black (and) Asian diverse communities".Members of ethnic minorities, particularly Black Africans and Bangladeshi, have suffered the highest death rates from the virus in Britain.The death toll from Covid in the United Kingdom stood at 129,583 Saturday, one of the highest in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pulse-oximeters-to-monitor-covid-work-less-well-for-darker-skin-uk-warns-101627752992737.html
31-07-2021||World||Millions of Americans at risk of eviction as Covid-19 cases spike||Millions of Americans face could find themselves homeless starting Sunday as a nationwide ban on evictions expires, against a backdrop of surging coronavirus cases and political fingerpointing.With billions in government funds meant to help renters still untapped, President Joe Biden this week urged Congress to extend the 11-month-old moratorium, after a recent Supreme Court ruling meant the White House could not do so.But Republicans balked at Democratic efforts to extend the eviction ban through mid October, and the House of Representatives adjourned for its summer vacation Friday without renewing it.Several left-wing Democrats spent the night outside the Capitol in protest -- calling out their colleagues over the failure to act."We slept at the Capitol last night to ask them to come back and do their jobs. Today's their last chance," tweeted Congresswoman Cori Bush, who has herself experienced homelessness and was joined by fellow progressives Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley.With the clock ticking down to Sunday, the country was braced for a heartbreaking spectacle -- families with their belongings at the curbside wondering where to go.One of those at risk is Terriana Clark, who was living out of a car with her husband and two stepchildren for much of last year, before finding a teaching job and an apartment in Harvey, Louisiana.Jobless again and struggling to pay rent after a bout of illness, the 27-year-old told The New Orleans Advocate she applied to a local assistance program four months ago, but is still waiting for help."If it comes, it comes. If it don't, it don't," she told the paper. "It's going to be too late for a lot of people. A lot of people are going to be outside."Up north in Michigan, Mary Hunt, who makes minimum wage driving a medical taxi, likewise fell behind on her rent on a mobile home because she got sick with Covid.She was served with eviction papers, and frets over what she will do with her stuff and her five cats and one dog."How do I choose which cats to keep? It's not going to happen. I'm not going to leave any of them behind," Hunt told National Public Radio this week."If I lose this house, then they go in the car with me. And people can think I'm a crackpot, but I'm not giving up my family," Hunt said.- Covid hot spots -Unlike other pandemic-related aid that was distributed from Washington, such as stimulus checks, it was states, counties and cities that were responsible for building programs from the ground up to dole out assistance earmarked for renters.The Treasury Department said that as of June, only $3 billion in aid had reached households out of the $25 billion sent to states and localities in early February, less than three weeks after Biden took office.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ordered the eviction moratorium in September 2020, as the world's largest economy lost over 20 million jobs amid the pandemic shutdowns. The CDC feared homelessness would boost coronavirus infections.Although more than half of those jobs were since recovered, many families still have not caught up on missed rent payments.The Census Bureau's latest Household Pulse survey showed that of 51 million renters surveyed, 7.4 million were behind on rent and nearly half of those said they risked being evicted in the next two months.Nearly 80 percent of households that are behind on their rent as of early July lived in Covid hot spots, according to a study by the Jain Family Institute."Putting people out on the street is probably not going to have good effects on community transmission rates," the institute's housing policy researcher Paul Williams told CBS MoneyWatch.- 'No excuse' - Immediately after taking over, the Biden administration had eased paperwork and eligibility requirements for an emergency rental assistance program, but it has stressed that management remains in the hands of state and local officials."There can be no excuse for any state or locality not accelerating funds to landlords and tenants that have been hurt during this pandemic," Biden warned Friday.The CDC eviction moratorium and other protections prevented an estimated 2.2 million eviction filings since March 2020, said Peter Hepburn, a research fellow at the Eviction Lab at Princeton University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-of-americans-at-risk-of-eviction-as-covid-19-cases-spike-101627752934993.html

When and how to watch||The Perseids are set to provide one of the most impressive skywatching opportunities in mid-August when the meteor shower will light up our night skies. First spotted by Nasa’s meteor-tracking cameras this year on July 26, the Perseids will peak on August 11, giving the best chance to witness one of the biggest meteor showers of the year.Every year, the Earth passes near the path of the comet Swift-Tuttle which orbits between the Sun and beyond the orbit of Pluto. The fragments left behind by the comet show up as meteor showers in the sky. These meteor showers are called the Perseids because they appear to hail from a point that lies in the constellation Perseus.Also Read | 'Mail from Mars’ brings new images of the Red Planet. Seen viral pics yet?When and how to watch the Perseids?In the United States, the peak viewing hours will be from midnight to dawn of August 12. Nasa said in a blog post that people in the Northern Hemisphere living far away from light pollution may spot more than 40 Perseids an hour. Those in the city may see only a few every hour. The intervening night of Aug 12 will also be a great opportunity to witness the meteor shower.To watch the Perseids, people should avoid bright lights and give time to their eyes to adjust to the dark, said Nasa.The meteor shower will appear as quick, small streaks of light and those unable to see it with their naked eyes can tune in to Nasa’s live streaming on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The live stream will start at 10pm CDT (8.30am IST) and end at 5am CDT (3.30pm IST) overnight August 11-12. If skies are cloudy, Nasa will try live streaming, hosted by the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, at the same time on August 12-13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/perseids-meteor-shower-to-light-up-night-skies-in-august-when-and-how-to-watch-101627752262464.html

Rainbow baby is a term used to describe a child born after a miscarriage, still birth or the death of an infant.The 33-year-old environmental campaigner and former Conservative Party communications director said she wanted to share the news about her miscarriage to help others.“Fertility issues can be really hard for many people, particularly when on platforms like Instagram it can look like everything is only ever going well,’’ she said. “I found it a real comfort to hear from people who had also experienced loss so I hope that in some very small way sharing this might help others too.”The Johnsons married in May of this year in a private Catholic ceremony at Westminster Cathedral in London. Their first child, Wilfred, was born in April 2020.The prime minister had four children with his second wife, Marina Wheeler, and has fathered at least one child outside of his marriages.The baby will be the fourth born to a sitting British prime minister this century.

After an original Delta cluster was detected in Nanjing city, the outbreak has now spread to 14 provinces, with Fujian province and the megacity of Chongqing reporting cases on Saturday."The main strain circulating at present is the Delta variant... which poses an even greater challenge to virus prevention and control work," said Mi Feng, spokesperson for China's National Health Commission.The outbreak in Nanjing city has caused concerns because nine cleaners, who tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), were working at the international airport busy handling hundreds of summer tourists. He Qinghua, a senior official with the National Health Commission, told reporters that the Delta variant outbreak may continue to spread to more regions.“The Nanjing outbreak has spread to other regions within and outside Jiangsu Province. There is a risk that it will continue to spread to more regions," he was quoted as saying by the state-run Global Times.In the early days of the pandemic, China was largely successful in containing the Covid-19 outbreak within its borders after the virus spread out of Wuhan. But the fast-spreading Delta variant, first detected in India, has jeopardised the virus response. For the first time in nearly 6 months, Beijing has reported Covid-19 cases in the last few days.Reports suggest that authorities have ordered mass testing in and around the areas where the Delta variaoutbreak has been reported. Zhangjiajie, a popular tourist destination in the northwest of China's Hunan province, has ordered over 11,000 tourists to take three nucleic acid tests before leaving the city, reported state-run news agency Xinhua.China is reported to have administered 1.63 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines, the highest in the world. But the efficacy of the Chinese vaccines, especially against the Delta variant, has been a matter of concern. Several countries, including Indonesia, administering China-made vaccines have reported more breakthrough cases than those administering other vaccines.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-likely-to-spread-to-more-regions-warns-china-official-as-14-provinces-report-cases-101627747142068.html

His previous stints in the government include a term as senior counsel at the justice department’s national security division, Obama administration’s special envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), special envoy for strategic counterterrorism communications, and deputy associate in the White House counsel.The White House said in the announcement that as special envoy, Hussain has worked with multilateral organisations such as the OIC and UN, foreign governments, and civil society organisations to expand partnerships on a whole range of issues, from education to international security to science and technology.Hussain also “spearheaded efforts on countering anti-semitism and protecting religious minorities in Muslim-majority countries”.Hussain earned a J.D. from Yale Law School, and master’s degrees in public administration at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. He has also taught at Georgetown’s school of foreign service.President Biden has nominated and appointed more than 60 Indian-Americans to senior positions in his administration, from Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, to Vinay Reddy, who heads the president’s team of speechwriters, to Kiran Ahuja to head the office of personnel to Vanita Gupta, number three at the justice department.Biden also named Khizr Khan, a Pakistani-descent American, to the US commission on international religious freedom, a body which has been extremely critical of India, lately on the Citizenship Amendment Act, and has called for the administration to declare India a country of particular concern.Khan and his wife Ghazela Khan, parents of a US army officer who was killed in the Iraq War, had become instant stars of Democratic convention in 2016 after they challenged then Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to read the American constitution.Khan immigrated to the United States from Pakistan in 1980, and went to Harvard Law School for his LL.M degree. The White House said he is licensed to practice law before the Supreme Court of the United States, various Federal District Courts, and Washington, DC and New York State courts.Syed Afzal Ali, president of advocacy group Indian-American Muslim Council, welcomed Hussain and Khan’s appointment, saying their deep experience in “advocating for rights of minorities will further bolster religious freedom for all people, especially in India, where Muslims and Christians are facing continuous persecution due to their faith”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-names-indian-american-to-head-religious-freedom-office-101627743917318.html

Several top UK health officials have urged expectant mothers to get vaccinated against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as soon as possible. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, chief midwifery officer for England, asked GPs and midwives to encourage pregnant women to “protect themselves and their babies” by getting jabbed.“I cannot emphasise more strongly how important it is for pregnant women to get vaccinated in order to protect both them and their baby," said Marian Knight, Professor at the University of Oxford and chief investigator of a research paper studying the impact of variants on the severity of maternal infection.10 things to know about the impact of Delta variant on pregnant women:1. The health officials have pointed to new data showing more than 99% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with symptomatic infection were unvaccinated.2. The study conducted by University of Oxford researchers using data from the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) suggested the severity of pregnant women’s illness appears to have become worse with the Delta variant.3. Out of 3371 pregnant women admitted to hospital with symptomatic Covid-19, 24% of women admitted in the first wave had the moderate or severe disease as against 36% hospitalised with the Alpha variant and 45% with the Delta variant.4. About one in 10 pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms required intensive care.5. One in five pregnant women hospitalised with symptomatic Covid-19 gave birth prematurely6. According to the vaccination data collected since February 1, 2021, only four of 742 women admitted to the hospital have received a single dose of vaccine and none have received both recommended doses.7. Pregnant women hospitalised with symptomatic Covid-19 during the virus wave driven by the Alpha variant were more likely to require respiratory support and be admitted to intensive care, compared to women admitted in the first wave, the study said.8. Those admitted during the Delta surge had a further increased risk of pneumonia compared to those admitted in the Alpha period.9. Covid-19 cases during Alpha and Delta dominant periods were associated with more severe infection and worse pregnancy outcomes10. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) have also recommended vaccination for pregnant women or those considering pregnancy, citing consistent evidence that pregnant women with Covid-19 are more likely to be admitted to an ICU than non-pregnant women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worse-impact-of-delta-variant-on-pregnant-women-health-experts-10-points-101627742500185.html

The police said that the judge, Wendelle Coq-Thelot, had met some Columbian mercenaries accused of killing Moise, reported news agency Reuters.Moise, who took the office a year after he was elected in 2016, had been claiming that his presidential term should end in 2022, a stance backed by the US, the UN and the Organization of American States. However, the Opposition wanted Moise to step down in February citing a constitutional provision that sets the clock when a president is elected, not when he takes office. Coq-Thelot was ousted in February along with two other judges after Moise alleged a coup was being planned against him. Earlier this week, Haitian police issued an arrest warrant against the former Supreme Court judge. Also Read | Mystery swirls around Haiti president Jovenel Moise's murderInspector General Marie Michelle Verrier, the spokesperson for the National Police of Haiti, told reporters that Colombian mercenaries and Haitian-Americans arrested in Moise's murder case have indicated they met Coq-Thelot twice at her home."These people gave to (police) details of documents signed during the meetings at Mrs. Coq's home," said Verrier.The spokesperson said that the police have raided the former judge's main home and other residences in the countryside but her whereabouts remain unknown. A wanted poster for Coq-Thelot has also been launched, according to Reuters.While Haitian police have arrested several suspected members of the "hit squad" made up of Colombians and Americans in connection with Moise's assassination, they are yet to identify the masterminds and the motive behind the killing.Colombian defence minister Diego Molano had said that at least six suspected mercenaries appear to be former Columbian soldiers. Colombian President Ivan Duque had assured interim Haitian Prime Minister Claude Joseph of his country's "collaboration in advancing the investigation."(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-supreme-court-judge-suspect-in-haiti-president-jovenel-moise-s-killing-say-police-101627732857954.html

The US recorded the highest new Covid-19 cases worldwide over the past week as the Delta variant of coronavirus, first detected in India, is wreaking havoc across the globe.Dr Peter Hotez, co-director for the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, told CNN that the US will witness “big, steep acceleration” in infections among unvaccinated individuals. “As bad as things are right now in the South, they are about to get worse for lots of unvaccinated individuals," he said.Hotez also sounded alarm bells about the rise in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in southern states. Data from the US department of health and human services (HHS) shows a sharp rise in children hospitalised from Covid-19 after July 14. Experts say the surge is likely due to the July 4 federal holiday.“The vulnerability I'm sounding the alarm about is in the South. In Louisiana, the variant is accelerating, kids showing up in pediatric ICUs. You've only got 17% of adolescents vaccinated, no mask mandates,” warned Hotez as schools are about to open.On Friday, the US reported nearly 100,000 new infections, of which southern states contributed the most. Authorities in Florida and Georgia have been urging the residents to get vaccinated as the Southeastern states have reported a worrying surge in Covid-19 cases. While cases in Florida jumped by 50% over the last week, the infection rate in Georgia more than tripled over the last two weeks."Unfortunately, we can expect Covid numbers to keep growing. People who are unvaccinated or skip their second dose of vaccine are targets for infection," Georgia health commissioner Kathleen E. Toomey was quoted by CNN as saying.Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has changed its mask guidance for fully vaccinated people, marking a reversal in policy. US President Joe Biden said “in all possibility” new restrictions would be imposed in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-surge-among-unvaccinated-will-worsen-warn-experts-amid-record-us-cases-101627731293403.html

All you need to know||As the world reported a 21% rise in deaths related to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases over the past week, the US travel restrictions on India, the UK, EU member states, and other countries severely impacted by the pandemic are not going to ease anytime soon. Not only has the United States indicated to maintain its existing entry restrictions due to a surge in Delta variant cases, but it also issued new advisories this week for some popular destinations in the world.The US state department asked citizens to not travel to Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, Kyrgyzstan, and the Central African Republic after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised its risk assessment level for these countries to ‘Level 4’, the highest on travel alert. The department has changed the advisory for Israel, The West Bank and Gaza to ‘Reconsider Travel’.Entry restrictionsIn April, US President Joe Biden issued a proclamation suspending entry of nonimmigrants who were present in India during the 14‑day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States as the country was witnessing a deadly second Covid wave driven by the Delta variant.Similar proclamations have been issued over time to suspend entry of nonimmigrants travelling from China, Iran, the UK, Ireland, Brazil, South Africa, and EU member states.Also Read | These countries have extended travel ban on IndiaOn Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the US will maintain existing travel restrictions “at this point” due to the Delta variant spread around the world.While the Biden administration has been under pressure from the travel industry to lift restrictions, Psaki said that the travel policies are going to be guided by the CDC and health experts."It would be actually surprising and odd if our health and medical experts were not having ... an active discussion about how to ... best protect the American people," she added.The surge in Delta cases threatening to derail the Biden administration’s Covid-19 response prompted the CDC to change the mask guidance for fully vaccinated people. Biden said “in all probability” new restrictions would be imposed in the US to contain the infections. These latest developments mean tourists from India and other countries facing restrictions may have to wait a bit longer than earlier expected to enter the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-long-india-uk-eu-travellers-have-to-wait-to-enter-us-all-you-need-to-know-101627725463346.html

Musk slammed the tech giant's app store fees, calling them a “global tax on the internet”."Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right," Musk said in a tweet.Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right.The issue came to focus after Epic Games, the maker of 'Fortnite', alleged that the iPhone maker has abused its dominance in the market for mobile apps. It even filed a lawsuit against Apple last year.Epic broke Apple's rules when it introduced its own in-app payment system in 'Fortnite' to circumvent Apple's commissions. The tech giant subsequently removed the game from its app store.Apple has so far not responded to the development, but the company has defended its app store practices both in court and to lawmakers in hearings."Actually, I like & use Apple products. They are just obviously overcharging with App Store. I mean 30% fees for doing almost zero incremental work is completely unreasonable. Epic wouldn’t bother processing their own payments if App Store fees were fair," he further said on Twitter."Normally, competitive pressure would force Apple to lower fees, but Apple & Android have a duopoly on phones. When interface familiarity is taken into account, it’s basically a monopoly," the Tesla CEO said while replying to a user on Twitter.In a subsequent tweet, Musk said that the effective 30 per cent sales tax Apple charges is hidden from users or there would be an outcry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/epic-is-right-elon-musk-slams-apple-s-app-store-fees-101627711846203.html
31-07-2021||World||Canada could be on cusp of fourth wave of Covid-19: Health authorities||Canadian health authorities have warned the country could be on the cusp of a fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, driven by the Delta variant.Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said that their latest modelling, which was released on Friday, “suggests that we are the start of a Delta-driven fourth wave”.Canada recorded 462 new cases of Covid-19 infections on Friday, an increase of over two-third over the numbers recorded two weeks earlier.Tam cautioned that the country was in a “precarious period”, having to maintain the fine balance between vaccination levels and reopening.Overall, 81% of the eligible population in the country has received one dose of a vaccine, while 66% are fully jabbed. But the more transmissible Delta variant means that those numbers may have to climb further to avoid the fourth wave. Cumulative cases could reach 1,441,610 on August 8, from the current 1,430,046, according to the modelling. The modelling document stated Delta is the “most transmissible variant to date” and Canada has recorded a five-fold increase in proportion of Delta cases in June.It also stated that the majority of Delta cases in Canada were in unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people and two vaccine doses were “needed for strong protection against variants of concern”.That is also borne out by the infection trend data: 89.7% of new cases were reported in the unvaccinated population, just 0.5% in those fully vaccinated, and 4.6% in those partially vaccinated, and 5.3% in those not yet protected, meaning they had yet to complete 14 days since getting inoculated. Similarly, those unvaccinated accounted for 84.9% of hospitalisations as against just 0.7% for the fully vaccinated.With several provinces shedding Covid-19 restrictions, there is concern reopening too hastily could result in a sharp spike by September, precipitating the fourth wave. The document noted, “The longer term forecast predicts stronger resurgence if community-wide contact rates increase too quickly, highlighting the need for ongoing caution.”In recent weeks, Delta has displaced Alpha as the principal variant of concern causing new cases. According to official data, for the week ending July 4, Delta accounted for 76.5% of variant-driven cases, a figure that has been rising gradually.The document released on Friday also underscored the reality related to the Delta variant, that there was reduced effectiveness against symptomatic infection after one dose, though there was only a “small reduction” after both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-could-be-on-cusp-of-fourth-wave-of-covid-19-health-authorities-101627710855191.html

Victims also granted conspirators access to the victims’ bank accounts and to the victims’ computers, permitting the conspirators to further enrich themselves by fraudulent appropriation and taking of the money and property of the victims,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-truck-driver-jailed-in-us-for-money-laundering-firearms-offences-101627699473307.html

The European Space Agency (ESA) posted from its official handle a photo of the Eutelsat Quantum satellite lifting off and said that it is the "first commercial fully flexible software-defined satellite in the world".The satellite was placed in orbit some 36 minutes after the launch."Eutelsat Quantum, developed under an ESA partnership project with satellite operator Eutelsat and prime manufacturer Airbus, is the first commercial fully flexible software-defined satellite in the world," the space agency said in an official release. "Because it can be reprogrammed in orbit, it can respond to changing demands for data transmission and secure communications during its 15-year lifetime. Its beams can be redirected to move in almost real-time to provide information to passengers onboard moving ships or planes."#EutelsatQuantum, the first commercial fully flexible software-defined satellite in the world, was launched this evening, 30 July 2021 👉 https://t.co/pawRsN5Juk pic.twitter.com/WwC5lcBRZdWhat is a fully re-programmable satellite?Unlike conventional models that are designed and "hard-wired" on Earth and cannot be repurposed once in orbit, the Eutelsat Quantum allows users to tailor the communications to their needs -- almost in real-time.Because it can be reprogrammed while orbiting in a fixed position 35,000 kilometers (22,000 miles) above the Earth, the Quantum can respond to changing demands for data transmission and secure communications during its 15-year lifetime, according to the European Space Agency.Eutelsat Quantum: 8 communication beams to provide mobile coverageThe 3.5-tonne Quantum model has eight communications beams, each of which can be modified to change its area of coverage and also the power of the telecommunications signal it emits.Using software made available to the customer, these changes can be made "in a matter of minutes", according to Eutelsat.This means the satellite can be used to provide mobile coverage for moving objects such as aircraft or oceangoing vessels or to provide coverage after a natural disaster or for one-off events.Satellite to monitor 'malicious intent'And at a time of growing concern over digital security -- as well as the possible weaponising of space -- Quantum is able to pinpoint the origin of signals emitted with or without malicious intent and take action to remedy the interference.The Quantum will cover a large geographical area from West Africa to Asia for a period of 15 years.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-first-commercial-fully-re-programmable-satellite-lifts-off-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-101627694453032.html

31-07-2021||World||WHO urges action to suppress Covid-19 before deadlier variants emerge||The Delta variant of Covid-19 is a warning to the world to suppress the virus quickly before it mutates again into something even worse, the WHO said Friday.The highly-transmissible variant, first detected in India, has now surfaced in 132 countries and territories, the World Health Organization said."Delta is a warning: it's a warning that the virus is evolving but it is also a call to action that we need to move now before more dangerous variants emerge," the WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added: "So far, four variants of concern have emerged -- and there will be more as long as the virus continues to spread."Tedros said that on average, infections increased by 80 percent over the past four weeks in five of the six WHO regions.Though Delta has shaken many countries, Ryan said proven measures to bring transmission under control still worked -- notably physical distancing, wearing masks, hand hygiene and avoiding long periods indoors in poorly ventilated, busy places."They are stopping the Delta strain, especially when you add in vaccination," he said."The virus has got fitter, the virus has got faster. The game plan still works, but we need to implement and execute our game plan much more efficiently and much more effectively then we've ever done before."- Price of vaccine inequity -The UN health agency has consistently called for vaccines to be distributed evenly around the world and has branded the drastic imbalance a "moral outrage".More than four billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have now been administered globally, according to an AFP count.In countries categorised as high income by the World Bank, 98 doses per 100 people have been injected.That figure drops to 1.6 per 100 in the 29 lowest-income countries.If the four billion doses had been administered equally to people aged over 60, "we basically could have gotten two doses into everybody at highest risk of severe consequences when we got to a strain like Delta", said Bruce Aylward, the WHO's frontman on the Covax scheme which aims to get donor-funded jabs to poorer countries.Instead, those nations, "in the face of the Delta variant -- they're going to pay a very, very different price as a result".- 'No magical solutions' -The WHO wants every country to have vaccinated at least 10 percent of its population by the end of September; at least 40 percent by the end of this year, and 70 percent by the middle of 2022."We are a long way off achieving those targets," Tedros lamented.He said that just over half of the 194 WHO member states have fully vaccinated 10 percent of their population; less than a quarter have vaccinated 40 percent; and only three countries have vaccinated 70 percent.Meanwhile the WHO says Burundi, Eritrea and North Korea are the only remaining member states yet to start Covid-19 vaccination campaigns.The novel coronavirus has killed at least 4.2 million people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, while nearly 196.6 million cases have been registered, according to tallies from official sources compiled by AFP.Tedros said that on current rates of infection, the 200 million known infections mark will be surpassed within the next two weeks, although the true figure will be much higher."There are no magical solutions," said Ryan. "The only magic dust we have is vaccination. The problem is we're not sprinkling that evenly around the world and we are working against ourselves."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-urges-action-to-suppress-covid-19-before-deadlier-variants-emerge-101627690529098.html
31-07-2021||World||Joe Biden says US to see new Covid-19 restrictions 'in all probability'||US President Joe Biden said on Friday "in all probability" new guidelines or restrictions would be imposed in the United States in response to a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.Asked if Americans should expect new recommendations from health authorities or new restrictive measures, the president responded, "in all probability," before leaving the White House by helicopter for the weekend.He did not specify what steps could be taken.US federal authorities, local officials and businesses have boosted health protocols in recent days in the face of surging cases spurred by the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.Biden added, however, that the country had had "a good day" on Thursday in terms of vaccinations."Almost a million people got vaccinated," he said, as his administration works to revive a sluggish inoculation campaign."I am hopeful people are beginning to realize how essential it is."US health authorities this week recommended that even vaccinated Americans again wear masks indoors in areas with high infection rates.The federal government has also tightened health regulations for its millions of employees, who must now either be vaccinated or wear masks and be tested regularly, even in areas with low case numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-us-to-see-new-covid-19-restrictions-in-all-probability-101627689624583.html
31-07-2021||World||UN warns hunger is expected to rise in 23 global hotspots||Hunger is expected to rise in 23 global hotspots in the next three months with the highest alerts for “catastrophic" situations in Ethiopia’s embattled Tigray region, southern Madagascar, Yemen, South Sudan and northern Nigeria, two U.N. agencies warned Friday.The Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Program said in a new report on “Hunger Hotspots” between August and November that “acute food insecurity is likely to further deteriorate.”They put Ethiopia at the top of the list, saying the number of people facing starvation and death is expected to rise to 401,000 -- the highest number since the 2011 famine in Somalia -- if humanitarian aid isn’t provided quickly.In southern Madagascar, which has been hit by the worst drought in the past 40 years, pests affecting staple crops, and rising food prices -- 14,000 people are expected to be pushed into “catastrophic” acute food insecurity marked by starvation and death by September. And that number is expected to double by the end of the year with 28,000 people needing urgent help, the two agencies said.In a report in May, 16 organizations including FAO and WFP said at least 155 million people faced acute hunger in 2020, including 133,000 who needed urgent food to prevent widespread death from starvation, a 20 million increase from 2019.“Acute hunger is increasing not only in scale but also severity,” FAO and WFP said in Friday’s report. “Overall, over 41 million people worldwide are now at risk of falling into famine or famine-like conditions, unless they receive immediate life and livelihood-saving assistance.”The two Rome-based agencies called for urgent humanitarian action to save lives in the 23 hotspots, saying help is especially critical in the five highest alert places to prevent famine and death.“These deteriorating trends are mostly driven by conflict dynamics, as well as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,” they said. “These include food price spikes, movement restrictions that limit market and pastoralists activities alike, rising inflation, decreased purchasing power, and an early and prolonged lean season” for crops.FAO and WFP said South Sudan, Yemen and Nigeria remain at the highest alert level, joined for the first time by Ethiopia because of Tigray and southern Madagascar.In South Sudan, they said, “famine was most likely happening in parts of Pibor county between October and November 2020, and was expected to continue in the absence of sustained and timely humanitarian assistance” while two other areas remain at risk of famine.“In Yemen, the risk of more people facing famine-like conditions may have been contained, but gains remain extremely fragile,” the U.N. agencies said. “In Nigeria, populations in conflict-affected areas in the northeast may be at risk of reaching catastrophic food insecurity levels.”Nine other countries also have high numbers of people facing “critical food insecurity” coupled with worsening drivers of hunger -- Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Colombia, Congo, Haiti, Honduras, Sudan and Syria, the report said.Six countries have been added to the hotspot list since the agencies’ March report -- Chad, Colombia, North Korea, Myanmar, Kenya and Nicaragua, it said. Three other countries also facing acute food insecurity are Somalia, Guatemala and Niger, while Venezuela wasn’t included due to lack of recent data, it said.In Afghanistan, FAO and WFP said 3.5 million people are expected to face the second-highest level of food insecurity, characterized by acute malnutrition and deaths, from June to November. They said the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces as early as August could lead to escalating violence, additional displaced people and difficulties in distributing humanitarian assistance.In reclusive North Korea, which is under tough U.N. sanctions, the agencies said “concerns are mounting over the food security situation ... due to strained access and the potential impact of trade limitations, which may lead to food gaps.” While data is “extremely limited,” they said recent figures from the country’s Central Bureau o Stations and an FAO analysis “highlight a worrying cereal deficit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-hunger-is-expected-to-rise-in-23-global-hotspots-101627689285109.html
31-07-2021||World||Israel launches Covid booster shot campaign||Israel launched a campaign on Friday to give the over-60s coronavirus booster shots, at a time when the rest of the world is still struggling to complete the standard course. Kicking off the campaign, Israel’s President Isaac Herzog, 60, received a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine at a hospital in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv.An Israeli epidemiologist of Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, Hagai Levine, acknowledged his country was going it alone with third shots. “This decision is based on experts’ opinion, on logic but not on solid scientific evidence, but that is okay,” Levine told AFP.About 55% of Israel’s nine million population has been double vaccinated, most with the Pfizer-BioNTech jab.Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced the start of the booster campaign for over 60s on Thursday, as concern mounts over the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus.“Israel is a pioneer in going ahead with third doses for people of the age of 60 and above,” said the 49-year-old premier who accompanied Herzog to the hospital for the jab.“The fight against the Covid pandemic is a global fight. The only way we can defeat Covid is together,” he said.In the US, President Joe Biden stopped short of a vaccination mandate for federal workers but has asked all four million US federal workers and on-site contractors to attest to their vaccination status and those who do not declare they are fully vaccinated must wear masks and be tested.Japan expands Covid-19 emergency as cases surgeJapan expanded a coronavirus state of emergency to four more areas in addition to Tokyo on Friday following record spikes in infections as the capital hosts the Olympics.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared an emergency in Saitama, Kanagawa and Chiba, near Tokyo, as well as in the western city of Osaka, effective Monday until August 31. However, Suga said that the surge in infections is unrelated to the ongoing Olympics.Hundreds of thousands of people have been locked down in China’s Jiangsu province, while 41,000 came under stay-at-home orders in Beijing’s Changping district to curb a virus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-launches-covid-booster-shot-campaign-101627678755774.html

Those with relatives here can join them if they choose to, officials have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-group-of-evacuated-afghan-interpreters-arrives-in-us-101627659971947.html
31-07-2021||World||NSO blocks several govt clients amid snooping row, says report||Israeli cyber-security firm NSO Group, at the centre of a global controversy over misuse of its Pegasus spyware to hack phones of journalists and politicians, has temporarily blocked several government clients from using its technology, according to a media report.An unidentified employee of NSO told America’s National Public Radio (NPR) on Thursday that the government clients were blocked as the company investigates the possible misuse of its technology. The employee didn’t identify the governments or give more details.The move came a day after Israeli authorities conducted an inspection of NSO Group’s office followings reports by an international consortium of journalists about the misuse of the Pegasus spyware around the world.“There is an investigation into some clients. Some of those clients have been temporarily suspended,” said the employee, who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity because company policy states NSO will no longer respond to media inquiries on the issue.Also Watch | Cong protests against Kejriwal’s ‘Covid failure’; questions stand on Pegasus rowThe employee did not name or quantify the government agencies or their countries that NSO suspended from using its spyware, saying Israeli defence regulations prohibit the firm from identifying its clients.NSO’s internal investigation checked some phone numbers of people that the firm’s clients reportedly marked as potential targets. “Almost everything we checked, we found no connection to Pegasus,” the employee said, declining to elaborate on potential misuse that NSO may have uncovered.The Israeli defence ministry’s official Twitter account tweeted about the inspection of NSO’s office at Herzliya near Tel Aviv on Wednesday, saying representatives from several bodies went to the firm to examine the allegations made against the company.Israeli news website Calcalist, which first reported the inspection, described it as a “raid”. NSO Group, which has denied allegations of unauthorised surveillance of mobile phones using its spyware, confirmed the inspection in a statement and said it is “working in full transparency with the Israeli authorities”.An international media consortium last week began publishing reports based on what is believed to be a leaked list of 50,000 phone numbers worldwide that were targeted by NSO’s customers for surveillance. Evidence of the Pegasus spyware was found on 37 of 67 phones examined by forensic experts, including 10 in India. The Indian government has neither confirmed nor denied that it used Pegasus, a military-grade spyware sold only to governments. It has repeatedly ruled out any illegal surveillance in India.Ministers, politicians, journalists, businesspeople, and civil society activists were among those allegedly targeted in the country. NSO says its software is sold only to government customers after vetting by Israeli authorities.The Israel government has faced pressure because it regulates the sale of all spyware technology to other countries.According to NPR, NSO says it has 60 customers in 40 countries, all of them intelligence agencies, law enforcement bodies and militaries. NSO also says that in recent years, before the media reports on the Pegasus spyware, it blocked its software from five governmental agencies, including two in the past year, after finding evidence of misuse.The Washington Post reported the clients suspended include Saudi Arabia, Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and some public agencies in Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-nso-group-blocks-government-clients-from-using-spyware-101627622888189.html
