Jim Banks, picked by McCarthy to be the top Republican on the panel, or Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan. Both are close allies of former President Donald Trump, whose supporters laid siege to the Capitol that day.In the hours after the insurrection, both Banks and Jordan voted to overturn Joe Biden's presidential victory. Pelosi said she had spoken with McCarthy and told him that she would reject the two names.“With respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these members, I must reject the recommendations of Representatives Banks and Jordan to the Select Committee," Pelosi said.McCarthy said in a statement that Pelosi’s move will damage the institution of Congress.“Unless Speaker Pelosi reverses course and seats all five Republican nominees, Republicans will not be party to their sham process and will instead pursue our own investigation of the facts," McCarthy said.The speaker’s decision is certain to further inflame tension between the two parties over the insurrection and the House panel that almost all Republicans opposed. Most in the GOP have remained loyal to Trump despite the violent insurrection of his supporters that sent many of them running for their lives. McCarthy had wouldn’t say for weeks whether Republicans would even participate in the probe, but on Monday, he sent the five names to Pelosi.Pelosi said in the statement that she had accepted McCarthy’s three other picks — Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis, North Dakota Rep. Kelly Armstrong and Texas Rep. Troy Nehls. But McCarthy said that all or none would participate.Like Jordan and Banks, Nehls voted to overturn Biden’s victory. Armstrong and Davis voted to certify the election.McCarthy’s picks came after all but two Republicans opposed the creation of the 13-person select committee in a House vote last month, with most in the GOP arguing that the majority-Democratic panel would conduct a partisan probe. House Democrats originally attempted to create an evenly split, independent commission to investigate the insurrection, but that effort fell short when it was blocked by Senate Republicans.Banks recently traveled with Trump to the U.S.-Mexico border and to visit him at his New Jersey golf course. In a statement after McCarthy tapped him for the panel, he sharply criticized the Democrats who had set it up.“Make no mistake, Nancy Pelosi created this committee solely to malign conservatives and to justify the Left’s authoritarian agenda,” Banks said.Jordan, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, was one of Trump’s most vocal defenders during his two impeachments and last month likened the new investigation to “impeachment three.” Trump was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate both times.The chairman of the panel, Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, has said that the committee will have a quorum to conduct business whether GOP members are present or not.Pelosi named eight members of the panel earlier this month — seven Democrats and Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who has strongly criticized Trump and has been the most outspoken member of her caucus against the insurrection. Cheney, who was demoted from GOP leadership in May over her comments, was one of the two Republicans who voted in favor of forming the committee, along with Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger.The panel will hold its first hearing next week, with at least four rank-and-file police officers who battled rioters that day testifying about their experiences. Dozens of police officers were injured as the crowd pushed past them and broke into the Capitol building.Seven people died during and after the rioting, including a woman who was shot by police as she tried to break into the House chamber and three other Trump supporters who suffered medical emergencies. Two police officers died by suicide in the days that followed, and a third officer, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters. A medical examiner determined he died of natural causes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pelosi-block-trump-allies-from-jan-6-panel-gop-may-boycott-101626889888851.html

Clubhouse previously required either an invite from an existing user to join the platform or the users had to request to join a waitlist. The platform witnessed explosive growth in the initial days of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic but now faces competition from social media networks, especially from Twitter Spaces.“Twelve never-boring months later, we’re thrilled to share that Clubhouse is now out of beta, open to everyone, and ready to begin its next chapter. This means we have removed our waitlist system so that anyone can join,” Clubhouse said in a blog post.The company said the earlier limitation was aimed at being able to grow in a “measured way” and keeping things from “breaking” as the platform scaled, adding that they always wanted to be open. The app was initially available only for iOS and in mid-May this year, Clubhouse was launched on Android.Also Read | Facebook rolls out live audio, podcasts in US in a challenge to ClubhouseClubhouse said it had added 10 million people since its Android launch and the team has gone from 8 people to 58."We know there will be many more ups and downs as we scale, and competition from the large networks will be fierce. But we believe the future is created by optimists -- and we're excited to keep working to build a different kind of social network," the company added.Last week, Clubhouse introduced the 'Backchannel' feature which allows users to send direct messages on the platform. The company said around 90 million direct messages were sent since the launch of Backchannel. Apart from messaging friends on the platform, the feature is aimed at helping speakers coordinate with co-hosts or exchange questions from the audience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/live-audio-app-clubhouse-no-longer-invite-only-as-competition-with-twitter-grows-101626888316184.html

To serve the worshippers is a very noble and honourable task," said Mona, who declined to give her family name.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has pushed through social and economic reforms as part of plans to modernise the conservative Muslim kingdom and attract foreign investment under a diversification drive.Under his reform plan, known as Vision 2030, the crown prince lifted a driving ban on women, allowed adult women to travel without permission from guardians and granted them more control over family matters.But the reform plan has been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, including on women's rights activists.Saudi Arabia has restricted the haj to its own citizens and residents for the second year in a row, barring millions of other pilgrims from abroad in response to the coronavirus pandemic.Samar, another soldier watching pilgrims near the Kaaba, a cube-shaped structure that Muslims believe was built by Abraham, said she was encouraged by her family to join the military, after psychology studies."This is a huge accomplishment for us and it is the biggest pride to be in the service of religion, the country and the guests of God, the most merciful," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-the-first-time-saudi-women-stand-guard-in-mecca-during-haj-101626883624928.html

The United States closed land borders for all non-essential travel at the start of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in March 2020 and continued extending it on a monthly basis. It has been extended for another 30 days even as they have allowed Canadians to fly in.The extension came days after Canada announced its decision to allow fully vaccinated visitors from the US starting August 9. According to Reuters report, the Biden administration is yet to decide whether only fully-vaccinated individuals would be allowed whenever the land borders get opened up for non-essential travel. On the other hand, Canada has announced that only fully vaccinated American citizens and permanent residents currently residing in the US will be allowed from August 9.Also Read | Canada extends ban on passenger flights from India till Aug 21 over Covid-19The White House is reportedly planning a new round of high-level meetings to discuss the travel restrictions amid pressure from businesses in Canada and the US to open the land borders, as per Reuters. The airline and tourism industry has suffered a huge loss during the pandemic due to restrictions on non-essential travel.The reopening of businesses and easing travel restrictions in the US have been made possible due to the high vaccination rate but the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant combined with vaccine hesitancy in many communities have threatened the gains. The Delta variant, first identified in India, accounts for about 83% of Covid-19 cases in the United States, health officials said on Tuesday. During a Senate hearing, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said that deaths from the infection averaged 239 per day over the past week, nearly 48% higher than the previous week.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-land-borders-with-canada-mexico-to-remain-closed-until-august-21-101626877992948.html
21-07-2021||World||Covid Delta variant now in 124 countries, to dominate within months, says WHO||The highly contagious Delta variant of Sars-Cov-2 has been identified in 124 countries and is expected to become the dominant strain worldwide within months, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. The rapid transmission of the 'variant of concern' first detected in India appears to be driven by multiple factors, including relaxation of social distancing measures and inequitable vaccine distribution around the world, the WHO said.“It is expected that it will rapidly outcompete other variants and become the dominant circulating lineage over the coming months,” the UN health agency said in its weekly epidemiological update.The Delta variant is wreaking havoc across the globe and now accounts for more than 75% of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in several countries including India, Bangladesh, Australia, South Africa, Britain, Singapore, Indonesia, Russia, and China among others, as per the report. The US health officials said on Tuesday that the variant of concern accounts for about 83% of cases in the United States, threatening the gains made through the massive vaccination drive.Also Read | Covid-19: Delta variant now accounts for 83% of US Cases, informs CDCOver the past week, Indonesia reported the highest number of new Covid-19 cases, followed by Britain, Brazil, India, and the US. Despite a worrying rise in coronavirus cases per capita, the UK has removed virtually all restrictions, prompting experts to warn the country about the impending threat.The WHO report said growing evidence supports the Delta variant’s increased transmissibility but the exact mechanism for it remains unclear. Citing a study from China, the UN health agency said that the time interval from the exposure to the first positive PCR result may be shorter for the Delta variant as compared to non-variants of concern. The study also suggested that the Delta variant may be able to replicate faster and be more infectious during the early stages of infection.“The evolution of transmission patterns as the pandemic continues will likely be influenced by the impact of the Covid-19 vaccination campaigns and by the emergence of more transmissible variants, or variants with properties of immune escape,” the WHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-delta-variant-now-in-124-countries-to-dominate-within-months-says-who-101626873949180.html
21-07-2021||World||US deputy state secretary to visit China as tensions soar||Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will travel to China this weekend on a visit that comes as tensions between Washington and Beijing soar on multiple fronts, the State Department said Wednesday.Sherman will meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and others in the northeastern city of Tianjin on Sunday as part of her current trip to Asia, which also is taking her to Japan, South Korea and Mongolia.Sherman will be the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit China since President Joe Biden took office, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan met Wang and veteran Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi in Anchorage, Alaska, in March for what proved to be a contentious first exchange. John Kerry, the Biden administration’s special climate envoy, traveled to Shanghai for meetings with his Chinese counterpart in April, but Sherman now outranks him.Sherman’s visit to China follows a significant deterioration in already badly strained U.S.-China ties in just the past two weeks, and there had been questions about why the trip was not announced at the same time as the rest of her travel to the region.Senior U.S. officials would not confirm suggestions that the Chinese had initially offered only lower-level officials for Sherman to meet. But they said the Biden administration would not have agreed to the visit unless they were assured Sherman would be able to see top-ranking officials in person. The officials were not authorized to preview the trip publicly ahead of Wednesday's formal announcement and spoke on the condition of anonymity.The State Department said the administration was “exploring opportunities” to engage face to face with Chinese officials at senior levels.“These discussions are part of ongoing U.S. efforts to hold candid exchanges with PRC officials to advance U.S. interests and values and to responsibly manage the relationship,” the department said in a statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “The Deputy Secretary will discuss areas where we have serious concerns about PRC actions, as well as areas where our interests align.”The officials said Sherman’s agenda would be wide-ranging and cover areas of contention as well as a smaller set of areas of convergence, such as a mutual desire to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table for nuclear talks. But they allowed that the differences are vast and stark and likely to occupy most of the discussion.On Monday, the administration accused China of being behind a massive hack of Microsoft Exchange email server software and indicted four Chinese nationals on charges they tried to steal U.S. trade secrets, technology and disease research.Last week, the U.S. issued separate stark warnings against transactions with entities that operate in China’s western Xinjiang region, where China is accused of repressing Uyghur Muslims and other minorities. The administration also advised American firms of the deteriorating investment and commercial environment in Hong Kong, where China has been cracking down on democratic freedoms it had pledged to respect in the former British colony.At the same time, the administration reaffirmed a Trump-era policy shift that rejects nearly all of China’s significant maritime claims in the South China Sea and reminded Beijing that any military move against the Philippines in disputed areas would trigger a response under a U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty.U.S.-China relations have also been aggravated by China’s increasing threats toward Taiwan and its policies in Tibet.Those issues, all carried over from the Trump administration, came on top of persistent tensions over China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in the city of Wuhan, and concerns about predatory Chinese investment in the developing world and its attempts to gain supremacy in the global high-tech telecommunications sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-deputy-state-secretary-to-visit-china-as-tensions-soar-101626870620728.html
21-07-2021||World||Why Unesco stripped English city of Liverpool of its world heritage status?||The UN’s cultural agency on Wednesday voted to remove Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City from the world heritage list, nine years after it was moved to the ‘in danger’ list. The committee cited the “irreversible loss of attributes conveying the outstanding universal value of the property” as a reason for the removal of the site from the world heritage list.“Any deletion from the World Heritage List is a loss to the international community and to the internationally shared values and commitments under the World Heritage Convention,” Unesco said in a statement.The six areas in the historic centre and docklands of the maritime mercantile City of Liverpool were included on the World Heritage List in 2004. The areas of the heritage site were the world’s major trading centres in the 18th and 19th centuries, a testimony to the development of maritime mercantile culture. The modern dock technology, transport systems and port management were the significant features of the maritime city.Also Read | Unesco recommends Great Barrier Reef be listed 'in danger', Australia hints China’s handReason for removalIn 2012, however, the World Heritage Committee sounded alarm bells over the proposed construction of Liverpool Waters, a massive redevelopment of the historic docklands north of the city centre. While moving it to the list of world heritage in danger, the committee warned that the redevelopment project would “alter the skyline and profile of the site.”“The project has since gone ahead along with other developments both inside the site and in its buffer zone. The Committee considers that these constructions are detrimental to the site’s authenticity and integrity,” Unesco said after Liverpool’s removal from the world heritage site.Liverpool mayor Joanne Anderson expressed disappointment over the World Heritage Committee’s decision taken during its 44th session in Fuzhou. Anderson said she is concerned by the decision which comes a “decade after Unesco last visited the city to see it with their own eyes.”“We will be working with Government to examine whether we can appeal but, whatever happens, Liverpool will always be a World Heritage city. We have a stunning waterfront and incredible built heritage that is the envy of other cities,” she added.Liverpool has become the third property to lose its world heritage status after Dresden in Germany and the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in Oman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-english-city-of-liverpool-stripped-of-its-world-heritage-status-by-unesco-101626869911463.html

Donning a blue suit and a cowboy hat, Bezos addressed a conference after his brief trip into space, during which he thanked the workers of Amazon for "paying" for his trip. However, the well-intended gratitude has failed to resonate with critics who have accused the billionaire of being "tone-deaf".“I want to thank every Amazon employee, and every Amazon customer because you guys paid for all this,” the 57-year-old Bezos said during a news conference, after becoming the second billionaire in just over a week to ride in his own spacecraft. The statement immediately stirred a backlash on the internet as people pointed out reports claiming inhumane working conditions and lack of breaks that Amazon workers are forced to work under.Former secretary of labour and a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, Robert Reich wrote that Bezos has crushed unionising attempts for decades. "Amazon workers don’t need Bezos to thank them. They need him to stop union-busting — and pay them what they deserve," Reich said on Twitter.Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also criticised Bezos saying, "Yes, Amazon workers did pay for this - with lower wages, union busting, a frenzied and inhumane workplace, and delivery drivers not having health insurance during a pandemic." She also added, "Amazon customers are paying for it with Amazon abusing their market power to hurt small business.""Jeff Bezos forgot to thank all the hardworking Americans who actually paid taxes to keep this country running while he and Amazon paid nothing," wrote US Senator Elizabeth Warren on the micro-blogging site."It's time for Jeff Bezos to take care of business right here on Earth and pay his fair share in taxes," she also said.Meanwhile, Representative Earl Blumenauer, who is on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, proposed legislation that would tax space travel for non-scientific research purposes. "Space exploration isn’t a tax-free holiday for the wealthy," said, adding, "We pay taxes on plane tickets. Billionaires flying into space—producing no scientific value—should do the same."Bezos stepped down as the chief executive officer (CEO) of e-commerce giant Amazon earlier this month to focus on side projects including his space exploration company Blue Origin. However, time and time again he has faced increasing activism within his own workforce for gruelling working hours.Several Amazon workers have also spoken about the lack of break times and how the company puts too much reliance on rigid productivity metrics and has unsafe working conditions. Earlier this year, an effort to unionise workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama failed. The workers have alleged that Amazon broke the law with some of its anti-union activity before and during the warehouse voting.Meanwhile, Bezos has said that he financed the rocket company by selling $1 billion in Amazon stock each year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-thanks-amazon-workers-for-paying-for-his-space-trip-sparks-backlash-on-social-media-101626855592800.html

Pakistan Telecommunications Authority on Wednesday notified about the blocking under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016. This is reportedly the fourth time that the app was shown the door in the country. All the earlier bans were reversed when the app promised to moderate its content.In October 2020, the app was banned for the first time in Pakistan after the authorities received complaints of indecent and immoral content. The ban was lifted within 10 days following TikTok's assurance of taking action against inappropriate content.The Peshawar high court had imposed a ban on Tiktok in March which was lifted in April. In Jule, the Sindh high court asked the telecommunication authority to block TikTok as it was spreading immorality and obscenity. This order was also lifted after three days.TikTok is very popular in Pakistan, though the anti-TikTok sentiment is also very strong. The app, which is banned in neighbouring India, has been downloaded almost 39 million times in Pakistan.The ban order passed by the Singh high court was in response to a petition filed by a resident of Punjab province, who alleged that TikTok was promoting crime as people were using weapons and drugs in the videos.Between January and March, TikTok removed 6,495,992 videos making it the second market to get the most videos removed after the USA, where 8,540,088 videos were removed, TikTok said. Pakistan-made videos were also banned, a spokesperson told Dawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-bans-tiktok-for-4th-time-for-inappropriate-content-101626853759583.html
21-07-2021||World||Tom Barrack, Donald Trump’s close friend and political ally, arrested||Federal authorities in the US on Tuesday arrested Tom Barrack, a long-time close friend and political ally of former president Donald Trump, for allegedly acting on behalf of a foreign government, the UAE, without registering as a foreign agent.Barrack, 74, was charged with obstruction of justice for lying to federal agents in an interview in 2019 about his association with the foreign government. Matthew Grimes, an associate of Barrack, was also arrested. A third person, UAE citizen Rashid Sultan Rashid Al Malik Alshahhi, is at large. All three were charged with seven counts of crime in an indictment unsealed in a New York City federal court. The arrests took place in California.Barrack was a lead speaker at the Republican convention in 2016 at which Trump was nominated as the party’s nominee, and after election served as chairman of Trump’s inauguration committee.Barrack joins a growing number of people from Trump’s orbit to face legal troubles, ranging from indictment to arrest to sentencing. The most recent case was that of Allen Weisselberg, former Trump Organization chief financial officer, who was arrested and charged with participating in a “sweeping and audacious” tax fraud scheme.The former US president himself is facing two criminal investigations. In New York, he is being investigated for allegedly manipulating the value of his company’s assets to seek loans or cut tax liabilities. In Georgia, he is being probed for alleged attempts to influence the 2020 presidential election.Announcing the arrests and indictments, assistant attorney general Lesko said, “The defendants repeatedly capitalised on Barrack’s friendships and access to a candidate who was eventually elected president, high-ranking campaign and government officials, and the American media to advance the policy goals of a foreign government without disclosing their true allegiances.”The indictment details some of the work that Barrack did to benefit his UAE employers. In May 2016, Barack, who was advising Trump’s campaign, had inserted a favourable mention of the UAE in the candidate’s speech on his energy policy. After Trump was elected, Barrack allegedly continued advocating for the UAE, and with more influence. The indictment alleges he pushed the candidacy of an individual favoured by the UAE as ambassador to that country. “In May 2017, Barrack agreed to provide Alshahhi with non-public information about the views and reactions of senior United States government officials following a White House meeting between senior US officials and senior UAE officials,” said the office of the US attorney for the eastern district of New York in a statement. The 45-page indictment gives specific and granular details of his actions.Matt Herrington, a lawyer for Barrack, said his client “made himself voluntarily available to investigators from the outset. He is not guilty and will be pleading not guilty today”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tom-barrack-donald-trump-s-close-friend-and-political-ally-arrested-101626850719531.html

At least 12 people have also lost their lives, according to a report by the Bloomberg news agency.Zhengzhou reportedly saw a record 457.5 millimetres (18 inches) of rainfall in the 24 hours through 5 pm on Tuesday. Due to the heavy rains and flooding, inbound flights have been suspended in the city, while rescue operations are underway to evacuate locals to the safe area.Several parts of the city also saw loss of power, while roads submerged in the rainwater. Chinese President Xi Jinping declared the deadly flooding "extremely severe", state media reported."Some reservoirs had their dams burst... causing serious injury, loss of life and property damage. The flood control situation is extremely severe," Xi was quoted as saying, adding events were at a "critical stage".The Chinese president has also asked officials to step up disaster relief measures.The iPhone cityHenan's Zhengzhou city is known to house the largest iPhone-making plant in the world. It is owned by Taiwan's Hon Hai precision Industry Co. The massive flooding has hit the city just as the company is preparing to ramp up production ahead of Apple's launch event for the latest devices.According to reports, the factory can produce 5,00,000 iPhones a day and is known as "iPhone City" by locals.The company is now monitoring the situation, a representative was quoted saying by Bloomberg.The Henan flooding has also worried the authorities as the province is the second-largest food supplier in China. It accounts for about a quarter of the country’s wheat harvest and is a major centre for frozen food production. It is also a key hub for coal and metals.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dam-burst-18-inches-of-rain-in-24-hours-how-china-s-iphone-city-was-flooded-101626848689450.html

Authorities have issued the highest warning levels for the province as the situation is expected to worsen. The municipal meteorological bureaus of Henan province as well as Zhengzhou have raised the emergency response for the disaster to level I.Zhengzhou, which has a population of more than 12 million, saw a record-high hourly precipitation of 201.9 mm from 4pm to 5pm on Tuesday, according to the Henan provincial meteorological centre. “As of 7am on July 21, almost 200,000 people were evacuated in an emergency and 36,000 city residents were affected by the disaster,” the city authorities said.Images shared on social media showed passengers dealing with the rising water levels inside a train carriage. Rescue and relief authorities had to cut open the roof of the carriage to pull out people to safety, news agency AFP reported.The heavy downpour in Zhengzhou has also led to severe waterlogging in several areas. More than 80 bus lines have been suspended and more than 100 have been temporarily detoured. The subway service has also been temporarily shut.The level of rainfall in the city witnessed over the three days was one seen only “once in a thousand years”, local media cited meteorologists as saying, according to Reuters. The city’s Guojiazui reservoir has also been breached.State media further reported that Zhengzhou’s transportation system continues to remain paralysed and schools and hospitals in the city have also been cut off due to severe waterlogging.Since Tuesday, several kindergarten children have been trapped in their schools while a large hospital in the city, which has more than 7,000 beds, has no power and all back up supplies are exhausted, according to the People’s Daily. The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou had been rushing to find transportation to shift about 600 critically ill patients, the People’s Daily added.On the other hand, roads in a dozen populous cities of the Henan province are also flooded. Images and videos shared on social media showed people wading across the streets amid the high current of water. Henan is a major logistics hub in central China and is also home to several cultural sites.Chinese President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, has described the flooding menace in Henan province as extremely severe, adding flood prevention efforts have become difficult. “Some rivers have exceeded monitoring levels, some dams have broken down, while some railway services have stopped and flights cancelled, causing heavy casualties and property losses,” Jinping said on Wednesday.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-killed-200-000-evacuated-as-incessant-rainfall-batters-central-china-city-101626843767054.html

Maryam Sharif has recently targeted Imran Khan's kids "being raised in the lap of the Jews" referring to the PM's former wife Jemima Goldsmith.Reacting to the attack, Jemima took to Twitter and wrote that this was the reason she had left Pakistan in 2004. "I left Pakistan in 2004 after a decade of antisemitic attacks by the media & politicians (& weekly death threats & protests outside my house). But still it continues," Jemima wrote on Twitter.Imran Khan's election symbol should be 'thief', says Pakistan leader Maryam NawazI have absolutely no interest in you, your sons or your personal lives because I have better things to do and say but if your ex drags in families of others out of spite, others will have nastier things to say. You have only your ex to blame. https://t.co/DxoUqwjoTnMaryam Nawaz Sharif replied to her and said she can only blame her ex, referring to Imran Khan. "I have absolutely no interest in you, your sons or your personal lives because I have better things to do and say but if your ex drags in families of others out of spite, others will have nastier things to say. You have only your ex to blame."In a recent speech, Imran Khan referred to Nawaz Sharif attending his grandson Junaid Safdar's polo match in the United Kingdom in 2029 and said, "The poor should go to jail and the powerful get NROs (National Reconciliation Ordinance) and go park themselves abroad and watch their grandson’s polo match.""You need a lot of money to keep a horse and play polo. So tell us where this dear grandson got this money from. It's your [the people's] money!" Imran Khan said, as quoted by the Dawn."I didn’t want to bring children into it, but the way you’re talking, you’re going to get a befitting reply..He’s Nawaz Sharif’s grandson, not Goldsmith’s.

The latest figure is up from 50% from the first week of July.In a testimony before the Senate Health Committee, Walesnky also said that areas of the country with limited vaccination coverage are allowing the spread of the highly transmissible variant, which was first identified in India. "Each death is tragic and even more heartbreaking when we know that the majority of these deaths can be prevented with a simple, safe, available vaccine," Walensky said as per a Bloomberg report.The top federal medical official also said that the best way to prevent the spread of Covid-19 variants is "to prevent the spread of disease, and vaccination is the most powerful tool we have."She also told the senators that the "overwhelming majority" of Covid-19 deaths are occurring in the unvaccinated population. Earlier as well, Walensky had stressed on the need for maximum people to be vaccinated, warning that this "becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.""We are seeing outbreaks of cases in parts of the country that have low vaccination coverage because unvaccinated people are at risk. Communities that are fully vaccinated are generally faring well," she had said last week.The US has inoculated less than half of the population so far, while states that have the lowest rate of vaccination are seeing a surge in cases amid the threat of a third wave looming over the country. States that have the lowest rate of vaccination are Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi.Over the last few weeks, the national vaccination campaign chalked out by the Biden administration has slowed down significantly. The US is administering 5,21,000 doses daily, an 85 per cent decrease from a peak in April when 3.38 million doses were administered every day.The country has a total caseload of 34,173,020 and as many as 609,521 people have succumbed to the viral disease that first originated in China in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-now-accounts-for-83-of-us-cases-informs-cdc-101626835351988.html
21-07-2021||World||Eid al-Adha in pandemic's shadow: How the world is celebrating Bakrid||Muslims around the world were observing Tuesday yet another major Islamic holiday in the shadow of the pandemic and amid growing concerns about the highly infectious delta variant of the coronavirus.Eid al-Adha, or the “Feast of Sacrifice,” is typically marked by communal prayers, large social gatherings, slaughtering of livestock and distributing meat to the needy. This year, the holiday comes as many countries battle the delta variant first identified in India, prompting some to impose new restrictions or appeal for people to avoid congregating and follow safety protocols.The pandemic has already taken a toll for the second year on a sacred mainstay of Islam, the hajj, whose last days coincide with Eid al-Adha. Once drawing some 2.5 million Muslims from across the globe to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the pilgrimage has been dramatically scaled back due to the virus.This year's hajj has been limited to 60,000 vaccinated Saudi citizens or residents of Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, pilgrims wearing masks and maintaining social distancing performed the symbolic stoning of the devil in the valley area of Mina — using sterilized pebbles they received ahead of time.“This is (a) very, very, very big moment for us, for me especially,” said pilgrim Arya Widyawan Yanto, an Indonesian living in Saudi Arabia. He added that he was happy he had the chance to perform the pilgrimage. “Everything was conducted under very strict precautions.”Yanto said he hoped for the pandemic to end and for all Muslims to be able to perform the pilgrimage in a safe way.Indonesia marked a grim Eid al-Adha amid a devastating new wave of coronavirus cases in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation. Vice President Ma’ruf Amin, also an influential Islamic cleric, appealed to people to perform holiday prayers at home with their families.“Don’t do crowds,” Amin said in televised remarks ahead of the start of the holiday. “Protecting oneself from the Covid-19 pandemic is obligatory.”The surge in new cases is believed to have been fueled by travel during another holiday — the Eid al-Fitr festival in May — and by the rapid spread of the delta variant.In Malaysia, measures have been tightened after a sharp spike in infections, despite a national lockdown since June 1. People are banned from traveling back to their hometowns or crossing districts to celebrate. House visits and customary trips to graveyards are also banned.Healthy worshippers are allowed to gather for prayers in mosques, with strict social distancing and no physical contact. Ritual animal sacrifice is limited to mosques and other approved areas.Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah has urged Malaysians not to “repeat irresponsible behavior,” adding that travel and celebrations during Eid al-Fitr and another festival on the island of Borneo led to new clusters of cases.“Let us not in the excitement of celebrating the Feast of Sacrifice cause us all to perish because of Covid-19,” he said in a statement.Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin urged Muslims to stay home. “I appeal to you all to be patient and abide by the rules because your sacrifice is a great jihad in Allah’s sight and in our effort to save lives,” he said in a televised speech on the eve of the festival.The World Health Organization has reported that globally, Covid-19 cases and deaths had climbed after periods of decline, with the reversal spurred in part by the delta variant.Lockdowns will severely curtail Eid al-Adha festivities in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia’s two largest cities.Sydney resident Jihad Dib, a New South Wales state government lawmaker, said the city’s Muslims were sad but understood why they would be confined to their homes with no visitors allowed.“It’s going to be the first Eid in my life I don’t hug and kiss my mum and dad,” Dib told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.Iran on Monday imposed a week-long lockdown on the capital, Tehran, and the surrounding region as the country struggles with another surge in the coronavirus pandemic, state media reported. The lockdown begins Tuesday.Not everyone is imposing new restrictions. In Bangladesh, authorities have allowed an eight-day pause in the country’s strict lockdown for the holiday that health experts say could be dangerous.British Muslims were celebrating in the wake of coronavirus restrictions being lifted in England this week, but against the backdrop of surging infections that are forecast to increase even further as the country opens up.“Eid is about sacrifice, and Muslims, just like everyone else, have had to make huge sacrifices over the past 18 months, staying apart when normally you would come together,” said Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who recently tested positive for Covid-19. “There are brighter days ahead,” he said in a video message.Eid al-Adha recalls the Quranic tale of Prophet Ibrahim’s test of faith and his willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of submission to God.In Egypt, Essam Shaban traveled to the southern province of Sohag to spend Eid al-Adha with his family. He said ahead of the start of the holiday that he planned to pray at a mosque there on Tuesday while taking precautions such as bringing his own prayer rug and wearing a mask.“We want this Eid to pass by peacefully without any infections,” he said. “We must follow instructions.”Shaban looked forward to pitching in with his brothers to buy a buffalo for slaughtering, going door-to-door to give some of the meat to the poor, and to the traditional festive meal later in the day with his extended family.“It’s usually boisterous with laughter and bickering with the kids,” he said. “It’s great.”But others will be without loved ones.In India, where Eid al-Adha starts Wednesday, Tahir Qureshi would always go with his father for prayers and then to visit family and friends. His father died in June after contracting the virus during a surge that devastated the country, and the thought of having to spend the holiday without him is heartbreaking.“It will be difficult without him,” he said.India's Muslim scholars have been urging people to exercise restraint and adhere to health protocols. Some states have restricted large gatherings and are asking people to observe the holiday at home.Meanwhile, the pandemic’s economic fallout, which threw millions of Indians into financial hardship, has many saying they cannot afford to buy sacrificial livestock.In Indian-controlled Kashmir, a disputed, Muslim-majority region, businessman Ghulam Hassan Wani is among those cutting back.“I used to sacrifice three or four sheep, but this year we can hardly afford one,” Wani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eid-al-adha-2021-in-pandemic-s-shadow-how-is-the-world-celebrating-bakrid-101626834096290.html
21-07-2021||World||Pollution alert in NY as Canada wildfire plunges air quality; AQI above 150||New York on Tuesday issued an air quality advisory after the city was covered in a grey smoky haze due to the raging wildfires burning in the western United States and Canada. New York state's environmental protection services issued the air quality advisory as fine particle matter is expected to rise above 35 micrograms per cubic meter of air, multiple news agencies reported.As per the report by news agency AFP, it is not uncommon for smoke from fires in the west of the country to reach the New York area. However, they usually remain high enough to not affect air quality. This time, the smoke was lower than usual, it reported quoting an expert.On Tuesday, the air quality index (AQI) for fine particulate matter reached 170 in New York. This is considered harmful even for healthy individuals and nine times above exposure recommendations of the World Health Organization. In the Philadelphia state, the AQI hit 172.Other northeastern cities, including Boston and Hartford, Connecticut, also had readings above 150.Every year in summer, the western part of the United States is hit with large wildfires mainly due to the rise in heat levels caused by climate change. This year as well several large fires have ravaged the region, notably in California, Nevada and Oregon.According to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) in the US, more than 80 large active wildfires have charred almost 1.3 million acres (526,090 hectares) of drought-parched vegetation in recent weeks in 13 western states.Several hundred additional fires are burning in western and central parts of Canada. This includes 86 fires classified as out of control on Tuesday in British Columbia alone, leading officials there to declare a state of emergency.In the Ontario province, more than 2,000 people have been evacuated in recent days as the experts have mulled that these wildfires may spread further.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pollution-alert-in-ny-as-canada-wildfire-plunges-air-quality-aqi-above-150-101626831351479.html
21-07-2021||World||Harvey Weinstein brought to California to face further rape charges||New York prison officials have handed convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein over to California to face additional sexual assault charges, ending the former movie mogul's lengthy fight to delay his extradition.Weinstein, 69, was booked into a downtown Los Angeles jail Tuesday afternoon, records showed. He could be arraigned on 11 sexual assault counts, including four counts of rape, as early as Wednesday morning, according to his LA attorney, Mark Werksman. The district attorney's office had no immediate comment.Weinstein's lawyers had been trying to negotiate to stop the transfer, but it had been expected to happen soon, his spokesperson Juda Engelmayer said."We will be fighting so that Harvey can receive his needed medical care and of course, so that he can be treated fairly," Engelmayer said. "Due process, presumption of innocence and a fair trial are all still his right."A New York judge in June approved Weinstein's extradition to California, denying his lawyers' request to keep him at a state prison near Buffalo, where he is serving a 23-year sentence for a rape conviction last year, until the start of jury selection in the Los Angeles case.Weinstein's lawyer, Norman Effman, argued he should remain in the New York facility's hospital-like maximum-security setting while receiving treatment for health problems including loss of eyesight.Weinstein's time in custody in California will count toward his New York sentence, officials said.Weinstein was charged in January 2020 with 11 sexual assault counts in California involving five women, stemming from allegations in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills from 2004 to 2013. The charges include rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual battery by restraint and sexual penetration by use of force.Weinstein maintains his innocence and contends that any sexual activity was consensual.The California charges were announced shortly before Weinstein's conviction in New York City on charges that he raped an aspiring actress in 2013 in a Manhattan hotel room and forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment.He is appealing that conviction.A lawyer for one of Weinstein's accusers applauded Tuesday's transfer, which was repeatedly delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as legal arguments over paperwork and his medical needs."The opportunity to hold Weinstein accountable for his actions in California gives voice to the survivors including my client, Jane Doe 4," attorney Elizabeth Fegan said in a statement. "They deserve to be heard and to have Weinstein answer for his actions. Our hope is that a guilty verdict in California will ensure that Harvey Weinstein will spend the rest of his life behind bars – securing justice for women everywhere."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harvey-weinstein-brought-to-california-to-face-further-rape-charges-101626830439085.html

21-07-2021||World||Rockets hit Kabul while Ghani holds Eid prayers||At least three rockets hit near the presidential palace on Tuesday shortly before Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was to give an address to mark the major Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.There were no injuries and the rockets landed outside the heavily fortified palace grounds, said Mirwais Stanikzai, spokesman for the interior minister.The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack on its Amaq news channel.Police quickly fanned out across the area. One car parked on a nearby street was completely destroyed. The police said it was used as launching pad for the rockets.The palace is in the middle of a so-called green zone that is fortified with giant cement blast walls and barbed wire, and streets near the palace have long been closed off.The barrage came as the US and Nato complete their final withdrawal from Afghanistan. Many Afghans are worried whether their country will fall deeper into chaos and violence as foreign forces withdraw and the Taliban gain more territory on the ground.“This Eid has been named after Afghan forces to honour their sacrifices and courage, especially in the last three months,” Ghani said in his address to the nation following morning prayers for Eid al-Adha. “The Taliban have no intention and willingness for peace. We have proven that we have the intention, the willingness and have sacrificed for peace.”However, Afghan forces have complained about being left without reinforcements and supplies, often running low on food as the Taliban advanced. In many instances, Afghan troops surrendered rather than fight.Washington’s watchdog monitoring US spending in Afghanistan reported that troops are deeply demoralised and corruption is rampant. After their pullout, the US and Nato are committed to spending $4 billion annually on Afghan forces until 2024, the majority of that money coming from Washington.Ghani said he deplored his government’s decision to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners to get peace talks started last year as a “big mistake” that only strengthened the insurgents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rockets-hit-kabul-while-ghani-holds-eid-prayers-101626812104515.html
