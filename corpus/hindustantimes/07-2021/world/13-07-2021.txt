It marks the fall of Bastille, a military fortress and prison, on July 14, 1789, when an angry mob stormed into it, signalling the beginning of the French Revolution.Here is everything you need to know about Bastille Day and why is it celebrated:1. On Wednesday (July 14, 2021), France will celebrate its national day, also known as Bastille Day. In French it is called la Fête nationale or le 14 juillet.2. The Bastille was initially built as a fortress guarding the eastern entrance of the city of Paris during the 1300s. It was later used as a French state prison and a place of detention for important persons during the 17th and the 18th centuries, the online English encyclopedia Britannica says.3. It was stormed by an angry mob of revolutionists on July 14, 1789, who then released the seven prisoners being detained at the site. It is largely considered the signal to the French Revolution.4. Last year, the celebrations were largely muted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, online news website France 24 had reported. The celebrations witnessed only half the participants than usual and the number of spectators was reduced too. The fireworks display also took place without the public.5. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished French President Emmanuel Macron last year during the occasion. “Felicitations to my dear friend @EmmanuelMacron and the friendly people of France on the occasion of Bastille Day! We are committed to further strengthening India's important strategic partnership with France, and expanding our cooperation,” Modi tweeted last year.6. In 2016, the day marked an occasion of great sorrow for the French following a truck attack in the city of Nice, in which 86 people were killed. Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, a 31-year-old Tunisian man, carried out the attack, for which the Islamic State later claimed responsibility, the BBC reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-bastille-day-and-why-is-it-celebrated-all-you-need-to-know-101626198294780.html

It was formed in 1982 to frame and coordinate national policy on combating substance-use disorders, including the response to an opioid crisis.“President Biden’s nomination of Dr. Rahul Gupta to be the first physician ever to lead the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy is another historic step in the administration’s efforts to turn the tide of our nation’s addiction and overdose epidemic,” the White House said in a statement to The Washington Post, which first reported the move on Tuesday. Gupta’s appointment will have to be confirmed by the Senate.Gupta will join a growing pantheon of Indian-Americans in the Biden administration that includes vice-president Kamala Harris, surgeon general Vivek Murthy, director of the office of personnel Kiran Ahuja, head of Biden’s team of speechwriters Vinay Reddy, associate attorney general Vanita Gupta, and senior adviser Neera Tanden.Politically, Gupta is an ally of Democratic senator from West Virginia Joe Manchin, who has emerged as a key US Congress figure over the passage of - or holding up - the president’s legislative agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-set-to-name-indian-american-rahul-gupta-as-drug-czar-101626196554985.html

The officials also told Reuters that it was not immediately clear whether the personnel have left Haiti.Haitian authorities have said that a hit squad of 28 men, including 26 Colombians and two US citizens, killed Jovenel Moise in his home last week. His wife was also injured in the attack.On Monday, the US said it was helping investigate Jovenel Moise's assassination and did not rule out sending troops at Haiti's request. "At the request of the Haitian government, the Department of Justice, along with its US government partners, is assisting the Haitian National Police in the investigation," the department said in a statement. "An initial assessment has been conducted in Haiti by senior US officials. The department will continue to support the Haitian government in its review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this heinous attack," the department said adding that it would also investigate if any US laws had been broken.Also read | Haiti tells US, UN to send troops as fears of instability growTwo Haitian-American men, Joseph Vincent, 55, and James Solages, 35, were arrested last week by Haitian authorities and charged with joining 26 Colombians in the fatal attack on Jovenel Moise.One of the Haitian-American men arrested on suspicion of taking part in the assassination of Haiti's president last week had been an informant to the US Drug Enforcement Administration, a DEA official told Reuters on condition of anonymity on Monday.

The government also launched an investigation.The prime minister called the catastrophe “a deep wound in the consciousness of all Iraqis.”In the holy city of Najaf, the dead were laid to rest. Mourning families stood over coffins in the mosque to say one last prayer.Their tears were tinged with anger, with some saying the disaster could have been prevented. They blamed both the provincial government and the central government in Baghdad.Ahmed Resan, who witnessed the blaze, said it began with smoke. “But everyone ran away — the workers and even the police. A few minutes later there was an explosion,” he said. He said firefighters arrived an hour later.“The whole state system has collapsed, and who paid the price? The people inside here. These people have paid the price,” Haidar al-Askari seethed at the scene.Overnight, firefighters and rescuers — many holding flashlights and using blankets to extinguish small fires — searched through the ward in the darkness. As dawn broke, bodies covered with sheets could be seen laid out on the ground outside the hospital.Ali Khalid, 20, a volunteer who dashed to the scene, said he found the bodies of two young girls locked in embrace.“How terrified they must have been, they died hugging each other,” he said.Distraught relatives searched the burned-out ruins as well amid charred blankets and belongings.Officials at one point said the fire was caused by a short circuit but gave no details. Another official said the blaze erupted when an oxygen cylinder exploded. The officials were not authorized to talk to the news media and spoke on condition of anonymity.The ward, opened three months ago, contained 70 beds in three large halls. Maj. Gen. Khalid Bohan, head of Iraq’s civil defense, said the building was constructed from cheap, flammable materials.In April, at least 82 people died at Ibn al-Khateeb hospital in Baghdad when an oxygen tank exploded. Iraq’s health minister resigned over the disaster.Doctors have decried lax safety at Iraq's hospitals, especially around oxygen cylinders, and have described the institutions as ticking bombs.Iraq is in the midst of another severe Covid-19 surge. New cases per day peaked last week at 9,000. Iraq’s war-crippled health system has struggled to contain the virus. The country has recorded over 17,000 deaths and 1.4 million confirmed cases.Fear and widespread mistrust of the public health sector have kept many from seeking hospital care.Ali Abbas Salman, who rushed to evacuate his Covid-19-stricken father from after the fire broke out, swore he wouldn't take the older man back to a hospital.“He wants me to take him home. He said, `It’s better to die of coronavirus than being burned alive,'” Salman said.The disaster is likely to stoke public discontent toward Iraq’s political establishment ahead of October elections, said Marsin Alshammary, an Iraq specialist at the Brookings Institution. Nasiriyah has been at the heart of past revolutions in Iraq.“Given this entire atmosphere built around the city," she said, “you can imagine that something as tragic as this event, where people who were already vulnerable were killed in a needless accident, will create more public anger.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-at-covid-19-ward-in-iraq-death-toll-climbs-to-92-several-others-injured-101626192411987.html
13-07-2021||World||Facial recognition tech rolled out to fight Covid-19 in China's Ruili city||Facial recognition tech linked to personal health codes has been rolled out in a Chinese city bordering Myanmar as authorities seek to squash a coronavirus outbreak.China is one of the world's most surveilled countries, with the government rushing to install more than 200 million CCTV cameras to "cover all public spaces" in the past five years.Surveillance has been widely used to combat Covid-19 in China, which was the first country to adopt a QR code system to log test results and track contacts.But this is the first publicly reported instance of facial recognition being used to track a person's movements and health status as they enter and exit residential areas, supermarkets, transport hubs and other public places."Everyone who comes in and out needs to have their (health) code and face scanned to pass," officials in Ruili, in Yunnan province, told reporters on Saturday.Ruili discovered 155 cases over the past week in one of the worst virus flareups in recent months to hit China, according to data published Tuesday."Security tools such as facial recognition cameras, smart door locks and road barriers (run by police or community volunteers) have been put in place in key areas," local authorities said in a statement.The scanners can also check the temperatures of individuals, China National Radio reported.There are no details on how long the database will hold records or whether officials will shut down the system, which is monitored by the city's pandemic prevention taskforce, once the outbreak is contained.Privacy concernsRuili, a city of more than 210,000 people, is a major crossing point from Muse in neighbouring Myanmar, which has seen escalating unrest since a February 1 coup, raising fears that people will flood across the Chinese border to escape the violence.Nearly half of the new cases reported in the past week were Myanmar nationals, according to the Yunnan Provincial Health Commission, although it was not clear how they entered the city.China has adopted a zero-risk approach to coronavirus clusters.It has largely curbed the spread of the disease since it first emerged in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, with tough border controls, mass testing, lockdowns and tie-ups with big tech for tracking.But the slew of new health monitoring apps has also raised privacy concerns.A widely used app tracking travel history and virus tests developed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba shared data with the police, according to a New York Times investigation in January.At the height of the pandemic, police in major cities wore helmets equipped with facial recognition and infrared cameras that gauged pedestrians' temperature.Rights groups have criticised China's omnipresent surveillance net, saying it is used to silence dissent and target minority ethnic groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facial-recognition-tech-rolled-out-to-fight-covid-19-in-china-s-ruili-city-101626187724353.html
13-07-2021||World||Taliban say do not want to fight inside Afghanistan's cities||The Taliban do not want to battle government forces inside Afghanistan's cities and would rather see them surrender, a senior insurgent leader said Tuesday, as the militants also warned Turkey against extending its troop presence.The hardline Islamist group has swept through much of the north as foreign troops complete their withdrawal, and the government now holds little more than a constellation of provincial capitals that must largely be resupplied by air.On Tuesday, the head of a Taliban commission that oversees government forces who surrender urged residents of Afghanistan's cities to reach out to them."Now that the fighting from mountains and deserts has reached the doors of the cities, Mujahiddin (Taliban) don't want fighting inside the city," Amir Khan Muttaqi said in a message tweeted by a Taliban spokesman."It is better... to use any possible channel to get in touch with our invitation and guidance commission," he said, adding this would "prevent their cities from getting damaged".The strategy is one well-worn by the Taliban -- particularly during their first rise to power in the 1990s -- cutting off towns and district centres and getting elders to negotiate a surrender.Hours after Muttaqi's message, a rush hour blast in the centre of the Afghan capital killed four civilians and wounded five others, police said."The explosion occurred in the centre of Kabul," police spokesman Ferdaws Faramurz told reporters, without specifying what caused it.Muttaqi's comments came as the defence ministry said Afghan forces had cleared Qala-i-Naw city after days of fighting.The Badghis province capital saw sustained street fighting last week in the first assault by the Taliban on a major urban centre since foreign troops commenced their final withdrawal in May.The call also came the same day as a video emerged that CNN said it had verified showing a group of Afghan commandos being gunned down by the Taliban in June after surrendering.Turkey warningIn a separate statement Tuesday, the Taliban said Turkey's decision to provide security to Kabul airport when US-led forces leave was "reprehensible"."We consider stay of foreign forces in our homeland by any country under whatever pretext as occupation," the group said, days after Ankara agreed with Washington to provide security for Kabul airport.As foreign forces wind up their withdrawal -- due to be completed by August 31 -- the situation on the ground is changing rapidly.The top US general in Afghanistan relinquished his command Monday at a ceremony in the capital, the latest symbolic gesture bringing America's longest war nearer to an end.The pace of the pullout -- and multiple offensives launched by the Taliban -- have raised fears that Afghanistan's security forces could be swiftly overwhelmed, particularly without vital US air support.Around 650 American service members are expected to remain in Kabul, guarding Washington's sprawling diplomatic compound.But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday he had agreed with the United States on the "scope" of how to secure Kabul airport.Peace talks between the insurgents and the government supposedly taking place in Doha have largely fizzled out, and the Taliban now appear set on a complete military victory.But claims by the hardline group to control 85 percent of the country are impossible to verify independently -- and strongly disputed by the government.The insurgents have tried to capture cities in the past, but so far have failed to keep them.They briefly held the northern city of Kunduz in 2015 and 2016 but were pushed out by government forces.In 2018, insurgents seized Ghazni for a few days, torching its main bazaar and killing scores of civilians.In the latest fighting, local officials said the Taliban had captured two districts in the largely Shiite Hazara province of Bamiyan.During their repressive rule two decades ago, the insurgents drew international outrage by blowing up giant centuries-old statues of Buddha in Bamiyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-say-do-not-want-to-fight-inside-afghanistan-s-cities-101626186955082.html
13-07-2021||World||After brief delay, Sher Bahadur Deuba takes oath as Nepal’s PM for fifth time||Nepal Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba on Tuesday took oath as prime minister for the fifth time hours after he refused swear in seeking a correction in his appointment letter that did not mention the constitutional clause under which he was appointed, multiple news agencies reportedThe scheduled ceremony was 6 pm local time (17:45 IST), but was delayed after Deuba refused to take oath as the new prime minister as he reportedly sought correction in his appointment letter that did not mention the constitutional clause under which he was appointed.Deuba was appointed by President Bidya Devi Bhandari in accordance with Article 76(5) of the Constitution, according to reports, a day after the country’s Supreme Court overturned former PM KP Sharma Oli’s May 21 decision to dissolve the House of Representatives. Oli resigned from the post of Nepal's caretaker prime minister earlier in the day. “Will abide by the Supreme Court orders,” Oli said as he sent his resignation letter.The five-member constitutional bench, led by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana, said that Oli’s claim to the post of prime minister was unconstitutional.According to local media reports, Bhandari failed to disclose the article under which Deuba is being made the prime minister in the notice, issued earlier in the day.Following this, Deuba reportedly wrote to the president that he will not take the oath until the error is rectified.The swearing-in ceremony was scheduled to be held at 6 pm local time (17:45 IST).In the past, Deuba had served as the prime minister of the country four times -- June 2017–February 2018, June 2004–February 2005, July 2001–October 2002 and September 1995–March 1997.With Deuba's appointment today, he would have 30 days to seek vote of confidence and prove majority to survive as prime minister for the remaining term of Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepals-newly-appointed-pm-sher-bahadur-deuba-refuses-to-take-oath-demands-correction-in-appointment-letter-101626185026637.html
13-07-2021||World||WTO should temporarily waive IP rights on Covid-19 vaccines: Study||A recent study published in an international journal has suggested that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) temporarily waive an agreement that protects intellectual property rights held by pharma companies producing vaccines against the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. The study, published in the Journal of Media Ethics, said the move would help more firms manufacture the vaccines and help fight the pandemic that has claimed thousands of lives across the world and is continuing to wreak havoc.According to a report in Mirage News, the lead author of the study Nancy Jecker said a waiver is the best way to expedite distribution of vaccines in low- and middle-income nations where the inoculation drive has been very slow due to hoarding by richer nations. “Over 100 Nobel laureates and 75 former heads of state, as well as President Biden, have expressed support for a waiver. Opponents seem not to be defending intellectual property protections on ethical grounds but in the interest of profits,” the professor of bioethics and humanities at the University of Washington School of Medicine was quoted as saying in the report.She argued that while the IP waiver “isn’t a silver bullet,” it is one of many steps that health-minded organisations should take to protect the world from COVID-19 as well as from future pandemic that may hit the world.Meanwhile, nine Democratic US lawmakers have urged Germany to drop its "blockade" of a waiver of IP rights under global trade rules and asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to meet with them during her visit to Washington. According to a report in Reuters, the lawmakers said they were troubled that Germany was leading EU opposition to a proposed waiver being discussed at the WTO."The United States and almost every other WTO member seeks to enact a COVID emergency temporary TRIPS waiver as quickly as possible," they wrote in a letter to German Ambassador Emily Haber, adding that production of COVID-19 vaccines must be increased to save millions of lives.The German embassy had no immediate comment. The Joe Biden administration says the waiver will help boost global production of coronavirus vaccines. German officials and pharmaceutical companies have argued that the firms have invested their own funds to develop vaccines and that waiving their IP rights would undermine such work in the future.Merkel will meet with Biden at the White House on Thursday for a wide-ranging discussion that will touch on the global response to the pandemic and the proposed waiver of IP rights, a senior administration official said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wto-should-temporarily-waive-ip-rights-on-covid-19-vaccines-study-101626181794216.html

Referring to the natural calamity as 'nuisance floods', the study said the events would become more frequent and erratic and the US coastline will majorly face the brunt of it.Regarding the impact of the Moon on flooding on Earth, the study's lead author Phil Thompson, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii, said that the 'wobble' in the Moon's orbit takes 18.6 years to complete. Here’s all we need to know about the Moon’s wobble:- While the ‘wobble’ has always been there, what makes it dangerous is that it will combine with the rising sea levels due to the planet's warming, said Thompson.- This cycle is expected to occur in mid-2030s, and coupled with the rising sea level, could lead to more such devastating floods.- According to the Nasa’s website, when the Moon makes its elliptical orbit, its velocity varies and alters causing our perspective of the "light side" to appear at slightly different angles. This is what it calls the Moon’s wobble or that is how it appears to our eyes.- Nasa says that while a casual glance skyward would not reveal this, when a full month of lunar views gets compressed into 12 seconds, it is impossible to miss.- During half of the Moon’s orbit of 18.6 years, the Earth's regular tides are suppressed -- high tides are lower than normal and low tides higher than normal. In the other half, the effect is reversed, which is called the tide-amplifying phase of the Moon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-says-moon-s-wobble-will-cause-devastating-floods-here-s-what-it-means-101626173608614.html
13-07-2021||World||US FDA warns of rare immunological disorder from J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine||The US drug regulator has warned of an “increased risk” of an immunological disorder among those administered Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose Covid-19 vaccine, known as Janssen, which has had an episodic roll-out in America marked by major manufacturing glitches and suspended use.Separately, top US health officials also said they would like to see more data before agreeing to Pfizer’s recent assertion that a booster dose of their vaccine might be needed. They had an hour-long meeting with the company’s experts, who cited an Israeli study in support of their recommendation. Israel began administering a booster - third dose - of the Pfizer vaccine to heart-transplant patients and those with compromised immune systems.Though experts asserted that the benefits of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine outweigh the risk of the disorder, regulators in India would take note of the US warning as the company prepares to launch its single-dose shot there after a general waiver granted by the government from bridging clinical trials.The US Food and Drug Agency (FDA) said in a warning that “reports of adverse events following use of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine under emergency-use authorisation suggest an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination”.Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder in which the body’s immune system turns upon the network of nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. Its effect can range from mild and brief weakness to devastating paralysis, preventing the person from breathing without help. Most people are known to recover completely, but some may experience lasting weakness.The New York Times reported that people familiar with the FDA’s decision said although chances of developing the disorder are low, they are still three to five times higher than the average population of the United States.About 100 cases of GBS have been detected among the recipients of the J&J vaccine. Of them, 95 were serious enough to require hospitalisation, the FDA said. There was one death.While acknowledging the findings, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement, “Rare cases of the neurological disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome, have been reported following vaccination with the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Most occurred within 42 days after vaccination. While the chance of having this occur is very low, Johnson & Johnson has updated its Covid-19 vaccine.”Bloomberg News has reported that regulators in Europe have also recommended a similar warning that AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine - which retails in India as Covidshield - could lead to an increased risk of GBS.The FDA cleared the J&J vaccine in April after a pause triggered by reports of six cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot among those administered the shot. “During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and the CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts,” the FDA had said then. “The teams at the FDA and the CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)”.In May, a plant manufacturing the J&J vaccine mixed up ingredients contaminating 15 million doses that were eventually dumped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-warns-of-rare-immunological-disorder-from-j-j-s-covid-19-vaccine-101626173633407.html
13-07-2021||World||Sher Bahadur Deuba becomes Nepal prime minister as KP Oli resigns||Sher Bahadur Deuba was appointed as the next prime minister of Nepal on Tuesday. Deuba's appointment came a day after the country’s Supreme Court approved his claim to the premiership, replacing incumbent KP Sharma Oli.Deuba was appointed by President Bidya Devi Bhandari in accordance with Article 76(5) of the Constitution, according to the reports. The swearing-in ceremony is reportedly scheduled for 6 pm. According to the constitutional provision, Deuba, the Nepalese Congress chief, will be given 30 days to prove to his majority in the House to survive as prime minister for the remaining term of Parliament. Deuba runs short of a majority as a rival faction of CPN-UML separated itself from the alliance formed to fight against caretaker PM Oli.Meanwhile, Oli put in his papers and said his party will abide by the Supreme Court orders.This is the fifth time that the 74-year-old Deuba will be holding the post of prime minister in Nepal. He had been at the helm from June 2017–February 2018, June 2004–February 2005, July 2001–October 2002 and September 1995–March 1997.On Monday, the Supreme Court overturned Oli’s May 21 decision to dissolve theHouse of Representatives and ordered the appointment of Deuba as prime minister. The five-member Constitutional bench, led by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana, said Oli’s claim to the post of prime minister was unconstitutional.In its order, the bench said President Bhandari’s decision to reject Deuba’s claim to form a new government was unconstitutional.Reinstating the House yet again (the court had restored the House earlier on February 23 after Oli dissolved it on December 20), the bench ordered for arrangements to be made to hold the House meeting by 5pm on July 18.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sher-bahadur-deuba-becomes-nepal-prime-minister-as-kp-oli-resigns-101626172285487.html

The decision is partly aimed at fulfilling the shortfall caused by the inability of Indian Covid manufacturers to meet that supply due to domestic demand during this summer’s devastating second wave of the pandemic.The Canadian decision to provide AZ vaccines to Covax has, however, been criticised in political circles at home as safety concerns have led to the jab’s use being curtailed in the country.Procured by Canada with an advance purchase agreement, 17.7 million AZ doses will be sent directly to the Covax global Covid vaccine distribution facility. Karina Gould, international development minister, and Anita Anand, public services and procurement minister, made the announcement on Monday. The vaccine doses will be “managed by the newly-funded Covax mechanism,” according to a statement issued by Global Affairs Canada.Anand said, “With nearly 55 million doses in Canada and millions more arriving weekly, we continue to ensure that the needs of Canadians for Covid-19 vaccines are met. In addition, as we are now able to donate excess vaccines, the contribution to Covax of close to 18 million doses will help to meet international needs and end this pandemic.”Gould told CBC News that shipments will start in a few weeks’ time and indicated that it was an attempt to replace the shortfall caused by Indian manufacturers being unable to meet external demand. She said, “One of the reasons Covax has been struggling is because AstraZeneca is one of the vaccines being manufactured in India and is being used widely within India right now.”The decision to donate AZ doses came in for criticism, as opposition MP Garnett Genius said the Canadian government shouldn’t be exporting vaccines that “it does not recommend for Canadians”, according to CBC News.Canadian health authorities have consistently weaned people away from the AZ vaccine and have called mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna as the “preferred” shots. Health Canada, however, has continued to underscore that AZ is a safe vaccine and Gould countered criticism by pointing out that it was “still a vaccine of choice”, a “good vaccine” and “one that is in high demand around the world”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-to-donate-18-million-surplus-az-vaccine-doses-to-covax-101626167153156.html
13-07-2021||World||China begins construction of world’s 1st commercial small modular reactor||China has officially begun the construction of the world’s first commercial modular small reactor ‘Linglong One’ at the Changjiang Nuclear Power Plant in the country’s Hainan Province, the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) said on Tuesday.According to a Reuters report, the CNNC had initially planned to begin the construction of the first phase of Linglong One project in 2017, but faced regulatory hurdles.The multipurpose small modular reactor (SMR) Linglong One – also called the ACP100 — was the first such SMR which was given green signal by the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2016. The ACP100 comes with a generation capacity of 125,000 kilowatt hours, and once completed, it can climb up to 1 billion kilowatt hours, thereby catering to more than 500,000 households in China, Global Times reported.The update on LingLong One comes as an icing atop a cake following the CNNC’s larger third-generation ‘Hualong One’ reactors that have a generation capacity of 1,170 megawatts. Notably, China is planning to rapidly roll out these reactors at home as well as abroad, Reuters reported.What sets small reactor technology apart?To start with, SMRs are cost-friendly and faster to construct as opposed to the traditional reactors. It can even be deployed at remote areas, for instance, on aircrafts and ships. Equipped with the ‘modular’ feature, as the Reuters report suggests, SMRs can easily be shipped by container from the factory and are relatively faster to be installed on any suggested spot.Furthermore, according to the Global Times report, SMRs come with the characteristics of high safety, and miniaturisation. Besides, application of SMRs can significantly cut down the consumption of fossil fuel energy in China and instead promote energy conservation and carbon emission reduction, the CNNC stated, as per the Reuters report.Small reactors have lately become a tool for China to provide urban heating in the north and also operate desalination facilities along the country’s coastal line, the Reuters report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-begins-construction-of-world-s-1st-commercial-small-modular-reactor-101626162330312.html

Later, the Upendra Yadav-led faction of the Janata Samajwadi Party will join the government, news agency PTI reported, citing a party leader.Sher Bahadur Deuba was named as the Prime Minister of Nepal a day ago after the country's Supreme Court reinstated the dissolved House of Representatives for the second time in five months and asked President Bidya Devi Bhandari to ensure that the NC leader is appointed as the PM within two days.Deuba will succeed KP Sharma Oli amid a political crisis that has plagued Nepal’s administrative machinery for months.The new Prime Minister of Nepal will keep his cabinet small, PTI reported, citing CPN-Maoist Centre leader Ganesh Shah. However, it is not yet certain if the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) will join the Deuba government since the Madhav Kumar Nepal faction of the party had earlier severed its ties with the opposition.Deuba is required to seek a majority vote of confidence from the Parliament within 30 days of his appointment as the prime minister of Nepal, as per the constitutional provisions, to survive in his post for the remaining term of the 275-member House.On the other hand, Nepal's incumbent prime minister KP Sharma Oli referred to the top court's move to reinstate the dissolved House of Representatives as "unconstitutional". A large number of Oli's supporters gathered at the supreme court premises on Monday evening and shouted slogans against the verdict which made Deuba the new prime minister of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sher-bahadur-deuba-nepal-s-prime-minister-elect-to-keep-cabinet-small-report-101626159298570.html

Sorry for the inconvenience".According to CNN, the employees were not happy with the working conditions, and had flagged the issue to the management but nothing was done.Manager Rachael Flores told CNN that the air conditioning system in the kitchen is broken due to which the employees had to face extremely high temperatures. Flores said she had to spend some time in the hospital getting fluids after getting dehydrated.The manager also said that the restaurant was short-staffed and she was working for 50 to 60 hours a week.There were nine employees in the Nebraska outlet and all of them resigned at the same time in protest, CNN reported.The public sign, which was put up on Saturday, soon went viral on social media, prompting the top management of Burger King to get in touch with Flores. The sign was changed after a few hours to “Now hiring. Flexible schedules.”Flores was told to turn in her keys and Burger King fired her, according to reports.Burger King later released a statement acknowledging that the work experience was not in line with the company's brand values. "Our franchisee is looking into this situation to ensure this doesn’t happen in the future," according to the statement carried by several US news media outlets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/staff-members-of-burger-king-outlet-in-us-resign-with-we-all-quit-public-sign-101626152984978.html

Google CEO Sundar Pichai shares tip||As data protection emerges as one of the burning issues of the digital space, so has the search for one-stop privacy solutions. Sundar Pichai, the Indian-born CEO of tech giant Google LLC, shared a few of his tips in this regard to help users arrive at their privacy needs. In an interview with the BBC on Monday, Pichai talked about his password habits, digital authentication on applications, the threat of internet-based surveillance, and more.When asked about the frequency with which he changed his passwords, Pichai said that he did not change them often. Instead, he encouraged users to adopt the "two-factor authentication" system, which is far safer and more reliable than constantly changing passwords. The multiple protection will ensure that a one-off attempt to scramble the password is not successful while hacking into the system.Google CEO Sundar Pichai was also asked about his thoughts on increased surveillance policies in countries and "different internets", which means different laws about online content and the definition of what is “offensive”."A free and open internet is a tremendous force for good and we take it for granted a bit," he said.Noting that each country is undergoing a "debate" on what constitutes free speech, Pichai added, "In some ways, I think we pull back from the bigger picture (which is that) many countries around the world are restricting the flow of information and drawing much more rigid boundaries."During the exclusive interview to the BBC at the Google headquarters at Silicon Valley in California, Sundar Pichai was also asked about his Indian roots.In response to the question, the Tamil Nadu-born CEO of both Google and its parent company Alphabet said that although he is an American citizen, India remains rooted "deeply" within him. "It is a big part of who I am," said Sundar Pichai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-to-keep-your-data-safe-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-shares-tip-101626150773695.html
13-07-2021||World||Canada stands by decision to mix and match Covid-19 vaccines despite WHO warning||Canadian health officials have defended their decision to allow the mixing and matching of Covid-19 vaccine doses after a top World Health Organization (WHO) official criticised the practice and called it a “dangerous trend”.The WHO’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Monday, “There are people who are thinking about mixing and matching [Covid-19 vaccines]. We receive a lot of queries from people who say they have taken one [dose] and are planning to take another one. It’s a little bit of a dangerous trend here. We are in a data-free, evidence-free zone as far as mix and match [is concerned].”Swaminathan clarified her remarks in a tweet, saying, “Individuals should not decide for themselves, public health agencies can, based on available data. Data from mix and match studies of different vaccines are awaited - immunogenicity and safety both need to be evaluated.”But Canada’s health officials stood by the decision to offer second doses that are different from the first. In an emailed response to queries from HT, a spokesperson for Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada referred to the National Advisory Committee on Immunisation’s (NACI) June 1 on “the interchangeability of authorised Covid-19 vaccines”. “The NACI reviewed all available evidence from ongoing studies monitoring the mixing of Covid-19 vaccines. The NACI also considered the risk of Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) associated with Covid-19 viral vector vaccines, Canada’s current and projected mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) vaccine supply and principles of ethical decision-making. Updated recommendations were based on the current evidence and the NACI’s expert opinion,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson also said evidence was generated from three studies: the CoM-Cov randomised clinical trial in the UK, the CombiVacS trial in Spain, and an observational study of 326 healthcare workers. “Current evidence suggests a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine followed by a second dose of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech was used in the studies) had a good safety profile,” the statement sent to HT said.“Evidence on immune responses produced from mixing Covid-19 vaccines was available from the CombiVacS trial in Spain. Current evidence suggests a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine followed by a second dose of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech was used in studies) can boost the immune response at shorter (4-week) and longer (8- to 12- week) intervals,” it added.“Vaccine interchangeability is not a new concept. Similar vaccines from different manufacturers are used when vaccine supply or public health programmes change. Different vaccine products have been used to complete a vaccine series for influenza, Hepatitis A and others,” it noted.Canada is among a handful of nations where Covid-19 vaccine interchangeability is permitted. That isn’t the case in neighbouring United States.According to an analysis by the agency Canadian Press, as of July 7, at least 1.3 million Canadians opted for a second dose that was different from the first. Among those who went for it is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who received the AstraZeneca vaccine as his first jab and followed it up with a Moderna mRNA vaccine shot earlier this month.Canadian guidelines permit not just mixing and matching of the viral vector vaccines like AZ with mRNA jabs, but also between the mRNA varieties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-stands-by-decision-to-mix-and-match-covid-19-vaccines-despite-who-warning-101626152271960.html

He warned that the variant, now in over 104 countries, is expected to soon be the dominant Covid-19 strain circulating globally.Addressing a press briefing on Monday, Tedros said that last week marked the fourth consecutive week of increasing cases of Covid-19 globally, adding that with concern that after 10 weeks of declines, deaths are increasing again. “The Delta variant is ripping around the world at a scorching pace, driving a new spike in cases and death,” Tedros said, according to news agency PTI.“Delta is now in more than 104 countries and we expect it to soon be the dominant Covid-19 strain circulating worldwide,” he said, adding that the world is watching in real-time as the Covid-19 virus continues to change and become more transmissible.“My message today is that we are experiencing a worsening public health emergency that further threatens lives, livelihoods and a sound global economic recovery. It is definitely worse in places that have very few vaccines, but the pandemic is not over anywhere,” he said. Tedros underscored that the world should battle together to put out this Covid-19 pandemic inferno everywhere.Noting that as the Delta variant spreads, the WHO chief said “We are in the midst of a growing two-track pandemic where the haves and have-nots within and between countries are increasingly divergent.”"In places with high vaccination coverage, Delta, first detected in India, is spreading quickly, especially infecting unprotected and vulnerable people and steadily putting pressure back on health systems. In countries with low vaccine coverage, the situation is particularly bad, he warned.Tedros stressed that Delta and other highly transmissible variants are driving catastrophic waves of case which are translating into high numbers of hospitalisations and death. “Even countries that successfully managed to ward off the early waves of the virus, through public health measures alone, are now in the midst of devastating outbreaks," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-expected-to-be-dominant-covid-19-strain-globally-says-who-chief-101626147042896.html
13-07-2021||World||10 dead in South Africa riots over jailing of ex-leader Jacob Zuma||Rioting triggered by the imprisonment of former South African President Jacob Zuma escalated Monday as shopping malls in Johannesburg were looted, major roads were blocked by burning tires and the police and military struggled to contain the violence.President Cyril Ramaphosa, in a somber address broadcast to the nation Monday night, vowed that the police and army would restore order, and he appealed to all South Africans to work together for peace.The unrest started last week in KwaZulu-Natal province after Zuma was imprisoned for contempt of court. What began as fairly small-scale blocking of roads in Zuma's home area intensified and spread to Gauteng, South Africa's most populous province, including Johannesburg, the country's largest city.The South African National Defence Force has been deployed to help the police.At least 10 people have been killed and more than 490 arrested “in acts of public violence rarely seen in the history of our democracy,” Ramaphosa said.Without once mentioning Zuma, Ramaphosa said that the “violence may indeed have its roots in the pronouncements and activities of individuals with a political purpose, and in expressions of frustration and anger ... However, what we are witnessing now are opportunistic acts of criminality, with groups of people instigating chaos merely as a cover for looting and theft.”He said the root cause of the rioting is South Africa's high rate of poverty and unemployment.“This moment has thrown into stark relief what we already knew: that the level of unemployment, poverty and inequality in our society is unsustainable,” Ramaphosa said. “We cannot expect a lasting and durable peace if we do not create jobs and build a more just and equitable society in which all South Africans can participate freely and equally.”He urged all South Africans to refrain from violence.“Together, we will defeat those who seek to destabilize our country," he said. “We will stand as one people, united against violence, unanimous in our commitment to peace and to the rule of law.”Earlier Monday, the looting of retail centers broke out in several of the poorer areas of Johannesburg, including Benmore, Jeppestown, Vosloorus, and Soweto, where the Jabulani and Dobsonville malls were hit.Retail stores in Alexandra, east of Johannesburg, were also affected, and journalists covering the riots for the public South African Broadcasting Corporation and news channel Newzroom Afrika were robbed of their equipment.Several malls, car dealerships and retail centers in more affluent areas of Johannesburg, including Rosebank and Kempton Park in eastern Johannesburg, closed early even though they were not directly threatened.In KwaZulu-Natal, people took appliances, including microwave ovens, television sets and clothing from stores in the Mariannhill and Umlazi areas.The violence began last week when Zuma began serving a 15-month sentence for contempt of court. He defied a court order to testify before a state-backed inquiry probing allegations of corruption during his term as president from 2009 to 2018.The Constitutional Court, the country’s highest court, began hearing Zuma's appeal on Monday.Police were investigating the deaths — four in Gauteng and two in KwaZulu-Natal, said police Col. Brenda Muridili. The police and national security forces expanded their presence in both provinces to help quell the violence, authorities said.Police have warned that anyone using social media to encourage rioting may be arrested and prosecuted.The way the political protest against Zuma's incarceration turned into wider rioting and looting highlights South Africa's widespread poverty, unemployment and economic disparity, analysts said.Many rioters were just poor, said Susan Booysen, director for research at the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection.“It is such a mixed bag because some other people are just taking advantage so they can grab things they could not have before," Booysen said.“There is poverty and inequality. We also know that some are criminals looking to benefit. Often legitimate protests are exploited for that purpose,” she said.Ralph Mathekga, a researcher at the University of the Western Cape, agreed that the political demonstration had been overtaken.“South Africa is a very complex nation, and (when) there is protest action, there is no doubt that those will be used opportunistically by criminal elements," Mathekga told the News24 website.“We have to recognize the socio-economic situation of the country. Almost the majority of the country is unemployed,” Mathekga said. "Protest action in South Africa, without some form of criminality, is very rare.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-dead-in-south-africa-riots-over-jailing-of-ex-leader-jacob-zuma-101626139482785.html
13-07-2021||World||Sher Bahadur Deuba to take oath as new Nepal PM today||Nepal Supreme Court on Monday reinstated the dissolved lower house of Parliament and issued a mandamus ordering the appointment of Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba as Prime Minister within two days.Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba is set to succeed KP Sharma Oli as Prime Minister of Nepal on Tuesday.Deuba will take oath as second Premier of the Himalayan Nation after the apex Court reinstated the dissolved lower house and issued a mandamus naming the opposition leader as the successor."Tomorrow (July 13), as per the verdict of the Supreme Court honorable Sher Bahadur Deuba will form a new cabinet for which we would start consultations and discussions. This would be alliance government and we will be holding a discussion about further ways to make it more effective and working addressing concerns of the public that would cover the issues about Covid-19 management, vaccines, corruptions and others," Baburam Bhattarai, former Prime Minister and one of the leaders of opposition alliance told reporters on Monday evening.A meeting was held in the capital this afternoon, senior leaders of NC, CPN (Maoist Center), UpendraYadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP), and Madhav Nepal-led faction of the UML.The meeting focused on discussing their future course of action including the formation of a new cabinet. As per leaders, further discussion about division of ministerial portfolios would be decided through a meeting to be held on Tuesday morning.Although the apex court's order has paved the way for Deuba to become a new prime minister, for now, Deuba will have to secure majority votes in the parliament to survive as prime minister for the remaining term of parliament.Deuba runs short of a majority as a rival faction of CPN-UML backs offAfter months of intraparty rift, the rival faction of ruling CPN-UML under the leadership of Madhav Kumar Nepal has separated itself out from the alliance formed to fight against caretaker PM Oli.The two factions in the UML (one led by Oli and other by Nepal) on Sunday evening have reached a 10-point agreement to bury their hatchet. After Monday's verdict, Nepal faction has announced to unify with the party ending earlier formed alliance."This alliance reached to this point, it has completed one phase; now a totally new sphere has formed in front of us. In the present scenario we cannot stay on this alliance for any longer, our presence and support for this alliance would not remain the same. Question over role of CPN-UML in national politics of Nepal still prevails, so at first we will unify the party and then the role about our party in upcoming days would be decided through the meetings of concerned committees of party which also would determine whether to support new government or not," Raghuji Panta, leader representing the rival faction of CPN-UML which had signed for Deuba in court documents told reporters after today's meetingWith the break off of the rival faction of CPN-UML, the largest seat holder in parliament, the fate of the vote of confidence for to-be-appointed Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba remains uncertain. Deuba will have to secure the vote of confidence in parliament within a month after his appointment as the new prime minister.A total of 146 members of the House of Representatives (HoR) reached out to Supreme Court with a writ petition to demand the restoration of house and appoint Sher Bahadur Deuba, as next Prime Minister on May 24.The petitions at that time included a total of 61 members of the House of Representatives from the Nepali Congress, 49 from the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), 23 from the Madhav Nepal faction of CPN-UML, 12 from UpendraYadav-BaburamBhattarai of JanataSamajbadi Party and one from Rashtriya Janamorcha Nepal.While claiming the Prime Ministership back in May, Deuba had presented signatures of 149 lawmakers to prove that he commanded majority to lead a new government. Now Deuba falls short of 23 votes which he earlier use to have from Madhav Nepal led faction of CPN-UML.Court has also overturned provision of "whip" imposed on parliamentariansThe Apex Court which on Monday reinstated the May dissolved House of Representatives also has removed the provision of "whip" (directive issued from a political party to ensure attendance and voting in debates) on parliamentarians."The provisions of Article 76 (5) of the constitution which has been misused by President and Prime Minister regarding the formation of the new government has ended with this verdict. A clear interpretation over issue has been given which now states that the formation of a government under Article 76 (5) is always dependent on members of the House of Representatives. At the time of voting over motion of confidence, the parliamentarians now would not be abided by the 'whip' meaning they can decide over the candidate on their own when it comes to choosing a Prime Minister when Article 76 (5) is activated," Om Prakash Aryal, one of the advocate who took part in the discussions held in court told ANI.Nepal President Bidhya Devi Bhandari had refused to allow Deuba to form a new government as per Article 76 (5) and dissolution of the House.With Oli failing to secure vote of confidence on May 10, Bhandari on May 13 had appointed Oli prime ministerunder Article 76 (3) of the constitution as the leader of the party with the highest number of members in the House.A week after his appointment, Oli on May 20 in a sudden move recommended that the President invoke Article 76 (5) to choose a new prime minister. It's the President who initiates Article 76 (5) when a prime minister appointed under Article 76 (3) fails the trust vote. Oli, however, neither sought the trust vote nor resigned, thereby creating a situation in which a prime minister was asking the President to appoint a prime minister.Oli supporters to continue protest against verdictSoon after the verdict of Supreme Court to reinstate the lower house, overturning decision of President Bidhya Devi Bhandari to dissolve the parliament in recommendation of KP Sharma Oli protests has erupted in Nepali capital against it.Apex Court not only has reinstated the house but also passed a mandamus in the name of the Office of President to appoint Deuba as new prime minister of the country by Tuesday. Separately, the supreme judicial body also has ordered summon for fresh session of House of Representatives at 5 PM on July 18.Dissatisfied with the court's mandamus, protesting leaders have termed it as an attempt by the judicial body to exercise more power."Supreme Court is now trying to exercise rights of executive, legislature, that of President, constitutional bodies," Mahesh Basnet, Senior Leader of Youth Association Nepal, student wing of CPN-UML claimed while addressing a protest march.The apex court had on February 23 reinstated dissolved parliament on December 20, 2020. President Bidhya Devi Bhandari on May 22 this year again had dissolved the parliament on recommendation of the cabinet.Following the dissolution, more than two dozen writ petitions were filed seeking the restoration of the House and issuing an order that Deuba be appointed as the new Prime Minister.Though Monday's verdict has paved way for Deuba to become the next Prime Minister, failure to garner a vote of confidence would further plunge the Himalayan Nation into a political crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sher-bahadur-deuba-to-take-oath-as-new-nepal-pm-today-101626138483317.html
13-07-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccination mandatory for health care workers, say France, Greece||French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday ordered all French health care workers to get virus vaccine shots by Sept. 15 and urged all of his compatriots to get vaccinated as soon as possible, to fight resurgent infections that are threatening the country’s economic recovery.In a televised address, Macron also mandated special Covid-19 passes for anyone who wants to go to a restaurant, shopping mall or hospital or get on a train or plane. To get a pass, people must have proof they’re fully vaccinated, or recently recovered from the virus, or have taken a fresh negative virus test.The delta variant is driving France’s virus infections back up again, just as the country kicked off summer vacation season after a long-awaited reopening. Some 40% of France’s population is fully inoculated.“Get vaccinated!" was the president's overall message. He even tweeted a GIF of himself repeating the phrase.“The country is facing a strong resumption of the epidemic touching all our territory,” Macron said, speaking against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower. Warning of a new wave of potential hospitalizations in August, he said, “The equation is simple. The more we vaccinate, the less space we leave this virus to circulate.”But he stopped short of any new lockdown measures, saying “We have to learn to live with the virus.”Macron said the government would declare a medical state of emergency again starting Tuesday, which allows authorities more freedom to impose virus restrictions.Most European governments have shied away from mandating vaccinations. But after tens of thousands of people with the virus died in French nursing home s, Macron said vaccination is essential for all workers in health care facilities or nursing homes, and all workers or volunteers who care for the elderly or ailing at home. Those who don’t get vaccinated by Sept. 15 will face potential sanctions or fines, he said.Greece announced Monday that health care workers will be suspended if they refuse to get vaccinated. Italy made the coronavirus vaccination obligatory for health care workers and pharmacists, and those who opt out risk suspension from their jobs or a salary cut.In Denmark, restaurants and public events require a digital pass showing you’ve been fully vaccinated or have a recent negative test. Some German states require the same for restaurants, though suggestions of making vaccines obligatory have prompted widespread unease.In France, vaccines are widely available for anyone 12 and over. But interest has ebbed in recent weeks because of vaccine hesitancy, a sense that the virus is no longer a threat, and because some people put off their shots until after their summer vacation. Demand started rising again over the weekend as people braced for Macron’s announcements.Macron also declared Monday that France will start charging money for some virus tests, which up to now have all been free for anyone on French territory.Meanwhile, French restaurants and bars are thriving again, the Tour de France cycling race is drawing tightly packed crowds across the country, and Hollywood stars are posing arm-in-arm and mask-free on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival. Cheek kisses are making a comeback.After staying shuttered for nine months since the pandemic began, Paris restaurant owners expressed worry about the challenges of enforcing the new requirements.“Our job used to be to make sure that our guests had a great time while they were with us. Now, we spend our time reprimanding them. We weren’t trained for this,” said the manager of the Parisian restaurant Bancs Public, Louis le Mahieu. He said he would observe any new health rules, but warned the new measures would likely incur new costs and lower returns.For Gauthier Max, whose bar Mama Kin was slapped with a nine-day closure for violating Covid-19 measures, restaurants and bars are no longer places of leisure but have become spaces of constraints and restrictions.“We’ve effectively become policemen,” he told The Associated Press.France’s virus infections started rising again two weeks ago. The number of people in French hospitals and intensive care units has been declining for weeks, but doctors predict it too will rise when the increase in delta variant infections hits vulnerable populations, as it has in Britain and Spain.Meanwhile, Macron also met with car industry figures Monday as he tried to combine his virus warnings with a message of hope for one of the world’s biggest economies.

But now, a new study has linked extreme weather events with Earth's neighbour, the moon.The study has been conducted by American space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), which says that a 'wobble' in Moon's orbit combined with rising sea levels due to climate change will lead to devastating floods on Earth.The study was published in the journal Nature Climate Change on June 21.Called 'nuisance floods', these currently occur in coastal areas when the tide reaches about 2 feet above the daily average high tide. These events are much more problematic for businesses because they inundate the streets and homes, affecting everyday life.These nuisance floods will become more frequent and irregular by mid-2030s, according to Nasa study. A majority of US coastline will see three to four times increase in high tides for at least a decade, according to the study.It has also warned that these floods won't be spread out evenly through the year, and expected to cluster together over the span of just a few months.“Low-lying areas near sea level are increasingly at risk and suffering due to the increased flooding, and it will only get worse,” said Nasa administrator Bill Nelson. “The combination of the Moon’s gravitational pull, rising sea levels, and climate change will continue to exacerbate coastal flooding on our coastlines and across the world."Explaining the impact of the Moon on the flooding on Earth, the study's lead author Phil Thompson, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii, said that the wobble in the Moon's orbit takes 18.6 years to complete. While the wobble has always been there, what makes it dangerous is that it will combine with the rising sea levels due to the planet's warming, said Thompson.In half of these 18.6 years, the Earth's regular tides are suppressed: high tides are lower than normal and low tides higher than normal. In the other half, the effect is reversed, which is called the tide-amplifying phase of the Moon. The next time this cycle is expected in 2030s, which will severely affect the normal life, especially in coastal areas, according to Thompson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-study-predicts-record-flooding-in-2030s-due-to-moon-s-wobble-101626134826127.html

So it’s a big part of who I am,” Pichai, 49, said, when asked about his roots.“I view it [artificial intelligence] as the most profound technology that humanity will ever develop and work on. You know, if you think about fire or electricity or the internet, it's like that. But I think even more profound," said Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet.When asked about whether the Chinese model of the internet based on surveillance is in the ascendant, Pichai said the free and open internet "is being attacked". While he didn't refer to China directly, he said: "None of our major products and services are available in China."On the controversial issue of tax, he said: “We are one of the world’s largest taxpayers, if you look at on an average over the last decade, we have paid over 20 per cent in taxes.“We do pay the majority of our share of taxes in the US, where we originate and where our products are developed. I think there are good conversations and we support the global OECD conversations figuring out what is the right way to allocate taxes, this is beyond a single company to solve,” he said.He was also asked about his own personal tech habits and encouraged everyone to adopt “two-factor authentication” when it comes to passwords to ensure multiple protections and admitted he is constantly changing his phone to test out new technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-is-deeply-within-me-a-big-part-of-who-i-am-says-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-101626134473544.html

Those immediately eligible for a third shot include people who have had heart, lung and kidney transplants as well as some cancer patients.China’s two major Covid-19 vaccine makers have signed agreements to provide up to 550 million doses to Covax, a UN-backed distribution plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-focus-on-covid-jabs-for-all-first-boosters-later-101626128316363.html
13-07-2021||World||At least 44 killed, 67 injured in coronavirus hospital fire in Iraq||At least 44 people were killed and over 67 injured in a fire likely caused by an oxygen tank explosion at a coronavirus hospital in Iraq's southern city of Nassiriya, health officials and police said on Monday.As rescuers combed the smoke-charred building in search of more bodies, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi held urgent meetings with senior ministers and ordered the suspension and arrest of health and civil defense managers in Nassiriya, his office said in a statement.The manager of the hospital was also suspended and ordered to be arrested, the statement added.Already decimated by war and sanctions, Iraq's healthcare system has struggled to cope with the coronavirus crisis, which has killed 17,592 people and infected more than 1.4 million."Health crews carried charred bodies out of the burning hospital while many patients were coughing from the rising smoke," a Reuters reporter at the site of the fire said.Health officials at Nassiriya said search operations at the al-Hussain coronavirus hospital were continuing after the fire was brought under control, but thick smoke was making it difficult to enter some of the burnt wards."Raging fires have trapped many patients inside the coronavirus ward and rescue teams are struggling to reach them," a health worker told Reuters before entering the burning building.Initial police reports suggested that an oxygen tank explosion inside the hospital's COVID-19 wards was the likely cause of the fire, a policeman at the scene of the fire said."I heard a big explosion inside the coronavirus wards and then fire had erupted very quickly," said Ali Muhsin, a hospital guard who was helping carrying wounded patients away from fires.In April, a fire caused by an oxygen tank explosion at a COVID-19 hospital in Baghdad killed at least 82 people and injured 110 others.Health sources said earlier the death toll from Monday's fire could rise as many patients were still missing. Two health workers were among the dead, they said.Angry relatives gathered in front of the hospital and clashed with police, setting fire to two police vehicles, a Reuters witness said.Weary of political violence, Iraqis also suffer frequent accidents due to under-investment, corruption and wrecked infrastructure. During the coronavirus crisis, hospitals have struggled with an influx of patients and short supplies."Corrupt officials must be held accountable for the fire and killing innocent patients. Where is my father's body," said one young man as he searched among charred bodies wrapped in blankets in the hospital's yard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-20-killed-five-injured-in-coronavirus-hospital-fire-in-iraq-101626122749837.html
13-07-2021||World||US officials flag "small" reaction risk with J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine||Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine may pose a “small possible risk” of a rare but potentially dangerous neurological reaction, U.S. health officials said Monday.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement it has received reports of 100 people who got the shot developing Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune system disorder that can cause muscle weakness and occasionally paralysis.That number represents a tiny fraction of the nearly 13 million Americans who have received the one-dose vaccine. Most cases of the side effect were reported in men — many 50 years old and up — and usually about two weeks after vaccination.The CDC said it would ask its panel of outside vaccine experts to review the issue at an upcoming meeting. J&J didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The government said the vaccines most used in the U.S., made by Pfizer and Moderna, show no risk of the disorder after more than 320 million doses have been administered.Guillain-Barre syndrome occurs when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks some of its nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis that typically is temporary. An estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop the syndrome each year, according to the CDC.Vaccines historically provide broad protection with little risk but come with occasional side effects just like other drugs and medical therapies. The three Covid-19 vaccines used in the U.S. were each tested in tens of thousands of people, but even such huge studies can’t rule out extremely rare side effects.The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration have been monitoring side effect reports submitted by physicians, drugmakers and patients to a federal vaccine safety database.Guillain-Barre can be triggered by a number of infections, including flu, cytomegalovirus and Zika virus. But there have been rare cases in which people develop the disorder days or weeks after receiving certain vaccines.J&J’s vaccine was highly anticipated because of its one-and-done formulation and easy-to-ship refrigeration. But early on, it was linked to another rare risk, of blood clots, and the company hasn’t been able to produce as much as expected because of problems at a Baltimore factory that helps make the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-flag-small-reaction-risk-with-j-j-s-covid-19-vaccine-101626117813717.html
