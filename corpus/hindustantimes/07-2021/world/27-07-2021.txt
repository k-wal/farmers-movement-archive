But it did not rule on the larger issue of whether a business can invoke religious objections to refuse service to LGBTQ people.The Scottsdale, Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom also represented Phillips. Founded in 1994 by Christian leaders concerned about religious freedom, the group said it would appeal Monday's ruling.“The government should never force creative professionals to promote a message or cause with which they disagree. That is quintessential free speech and artistic freedom,” the group’s senior counsel, John Bursch, said in a statement.Lambda Legal, a group that fights for the civil rights of LGBTQ people, had submitted a brief supporting the Colorado law.“This really isn’t about cake or websites or flowers,” Lambda Legal senior counsel Jennifer C. Pizer said in a statement. “It’s about protecting LGBTQ people and their families from being subjected to slammed doors, service refusals and public humiliation in countless places — from fertility clinics to funeral homes and everywhere in between.”In arguments before the three-judge panel in November, Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich asked what Smith would do if she was approached by a straight wedding planner asking her to create four heterosexual wedding sites and one for a same-sex wedding. Kristen Waggoner, a lawyer for the alliance, said Smith would not take that job.Colorado Solicitor General Eric Olson questioned whether Smith should even be allowed to challenge the law since she had not started offering wedding websites yet.But if she did, Olson said, her argument would mean she would refuse to create a website for a hypothetical same-sex couple named Alex and Taylor but agree to make the same one for an opposite-sex couple with the same names. He said that would be discrimination under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.In the case of Phillips, who owns Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Olson said the Supreme Court could not agree on whether cakes are a form of expression. However, he said a subjective decision about whether a company’s service amounted to speech was not a workable way of determining discrimination.Judge Mark Beck Briscoe wrote in Monday's majority opinion that “we must also consider the grave harms caused when public accommodations discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation. Combatting such discrimination is, like individual autonomy, ‘essential’ to our democratic ideals.”In his dissent, Tymkovich wrote that “this case illustrates exactly why we have a First Amendment. Properly applied, the Constitution protects Ms. Smith from the government telling her what to say or do.”In 2019, a divided three-judge panel of the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of two Christian filmmakers who said they should not have to make videos celebrating same-sex marriage under Minnesota’s anti-discrimination law because the videos are a form of speech protected by the First Amendment.The court reinstated a lawsuit brought by Carl and Angel Larsen of Telescope Media Group in St. Cloud. They also are being represented by Alliance Defending Freedom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-designer-who-won-t-make-same-sex-wedding-websites-loses-case-101627406535499.html
27-07-2021||World||Facebook to restrict ad targeting of under-18s||Facebook Inc will stop allowing advertisers to target people under 18 on its platforms based on their interests or their activity on other sites, it said on Tuesday in a slew of announcements about young users.The change means advertisers will soon be able to target under-18s only by age, gender or location on Facebook, its Messenger service and its photo-sharing platform Instagram. In a blog post, Instagram said it was making the change because it agreed with youth advocates that young people might not be equipped to make decisions about targeting.A Facebook spokesman said there would be no changes to the user data the company collects.Instagram users under 16 years old will also start to be defaulted into having a private account when they join the platform, the company said, in an effort to stop unwanted contact from adults. They will still be given the option, however, to switch to a public account and current users can keep their account public.Facebook's approach to younger users has been in the spotlight after U.S. lawmakers and attorneys general slammed its leaked plans to launch a version of Instagram for children under 13. Earlier this year, a group of more than 40 state attorneys general wrote to CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking him to ditch the idea.The company said on Tuesday it was working on an "Instagram experience for tweens." It has said the idea of a youth-focused app is to provide parents greater transparency and controls on what younger children who want to access Instagram are doing.Several major social media companies have also rolled out versions of their apps for younger audiences, from Facebook's Messenger Kids to Alphabet Inc-owned YouTube Kids.Proponents argue that children are already on a platform and so a family-friendly version provides a safer environment, but critics say Facebook should not be trying to hook young kids on its services due to risks to their development, mental health and privacy.Age verification of children is an issue on many social media sites, which prohibit kids under 13 but often fail to identify and remove underage users. In a separate blog on Tuesday, Facebook's head of youth products, Pavni Diwanji, said it was using artificial intelligence to improve this verification and remove underage accounts.Instagram also said it was making it harder in several countries for adults who have shown potentially suspicious behavior - such as recently being reported by a young user - to find young people's accounts, either through searching user names or having the accounts suggested to them. It said it would prevent such adults from seeing comments from young people on others' posts and that the adults would not be able to leave comments on the posts of young people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-restrict-ad-targeting-of-under18s-101627406266202.html
27-07-2021||World||Antibodies from Sinovac's Covid shot fade after 6 months, booster helps: Study||Antibodies triggered by Sinovac Biotech's COVID-19 vaccine declined below a key threshold from around six months after a second dose for most recipients, but a third shot had a strong booster effect, a lab study showed.Chinese researchers reported the findings from a study of blood samples from healthy adults aged between 18-59 in a paper published on Sunday, which has not been peer reviewed.Among participants who received two doses, two or four weeks apart, only 16.9% and 35.2% respectively still had neutralising antibodies above what researchers regard as a detectable threshold level six months after the second shot, the paper said.Those readings were based on data from two cohorts involving more than 50 participants each, while the study gave third doses of the vaccine or placebo to a total of 540 participants.Researchers said it was unclear how the decrease in antibodies would affect the shot's effectiveness, since scientists have yet to figure out precisely the threshold of antibody levels for a vaccine to be able to prevent the disease.Apart from durable antibodies, other components in humans immune systems such as T cells and B cell memory elicited by the vaccine may also contribute to protection, researchers involved in the study said, although the study did not provide data on those factors."In the short-to-medium term, ensuring more people complete the current two-dose schedule of CoronaVac (Sinovac's vaccine) should be the priority," the paper said.Participants in some cohorts who received a third dose of the Sinovac shot about six months after the second showed around a 3-5 fold increase in antibody levels after a further 28 days, compared with the levels seen four weeks after the second shot.As of end-June, Sinovac has delivered more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine, a major vaccination tool in China, Brazil, Indonesia and Chile.Other COVID-19 vaccine makers are seeking to get authorisation for booster shots. Pfizer and partner BioNTech said earlier this month they had planned to ask U.S. and European regulators within weeks to authorise a booster dose of its COVID-19 vaccine, based on evidence of greater risk of infection six months after inoculation and the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.Siti Nadia Tarmizi, a senior health ministry official in Indonesia, told Reuters on Tuesday that clinical data from the country showed the reduced antibody level is still enough to provide protection, without providing details.She said the immunisation advisory board recommends a booster vaccination 12 months after the second dose.Indonesia has started giving booster shots produced by Moderna to medical workers this month, including those who had received Sinovac doses.Philippines' Health Secretary Francisco Duque said on Tuesday there is no recommendation yet from the country's vaccine expert panel on giving a booster shot but experts are discussing the possibility.Turkey has already started offering a third dose from either Sinovac or Pfizer to some people who have got Sinovac shots.The research paper on Sinovac's vaccine said that the study did not test the antibodies' effect against more transmissible variants, and that further research was needed to assess antibody duration after a third shot.The study was conducted by researchers at disease control authorities in Jiangsu province, Sinovac, and other Chinese institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antibodies-from-sinovac-s-covid-shot-fade-after-6-months-booster-helps-study-101627401377606.html

The indifference shown to my colleagues is disgraceful," Fanone fumed, slamming his fist on the table.The attack on the US Capitol followed a speech by Donald Trump as Capitol police scrambled to protect lawmakers busy counting electoral college votes to certify Joe Biden as the winner of 2020 presidential elections. The US House of Representatives, where Democrats had the majority, impeached Trump on the charge of inciting violence in the Capitol but the Republican leader was acquitted in an evenly-split Senate for the second time since conviction required a two-thirds vote.The House panel investigating the attack comprises seven Democrats and two Republicans who had voted for Trump’s second impeachment. GOP leader Kevin McCarthy refused to seat Republican members on the committee after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi vetoed his two choices citing “integrity” of the probe.On Tuesday, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Trump critic, asked four officers appearing for the hearing whether the Capitol attack felt like “old history” to them. "Sometimes I get, you know, we hear out there it's time to move on, right? It's been six whole months, time to move on. Does this feel like old history and time to move on, and just say yes or no," the Illinois Republican asked.“No,” responded all four officers."There can be no moving on without accountability. There can be no healing until we make sure this can't happen again," DC police officer Daniel Hodges said.Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell told the House panel that Trump’s remarks about the “loving” crowd outside US Capitol are “insulting”, adding that Trump himself “helped to create this monstrosity.” "To me, it is insulting, it is demoralizing because everything that we did was to prevent everyone in the capitol from getting hurt," the officer said, responding to a question from Wyoming Republican Representative Liz Cheney.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/went-to-hell-and-back-us-officers-slam-trump-allies-for-downplaying-jan-6-riots-101627404693006.html
27-07-2021||World||US calls India ‘leading global power’ and Indo-Pacific ‘front and centre’||As Antony Blinken reached New Delhi on Tuesday evening on his maiden visit to India as US secretary of state, the state department reiterated America’s support for the country’s “emergence as a leading global power and a vital partner” in the Indo-Pacific region.Blinken is scheduled to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday and external affairs minister S Jaishankar, the US state department said. The Indian side had earlier also lined up a meeting with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.“The United States and India have a strong strategic partnership founded on shared values and a commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” the state department said in a statement. “The US supports India’s emergence as a leading global power and vital partner in efforts to ensure that the Indo-Pacific is a region of peace, stability, and growing prosperity and economic inclusion.”The statement went on to describe the Indo-Pacific as “front and centre” and recalled a Quad leaders’ summit in March that US President Joe Biden had hosted with the three prime ministers - Modi, Australia’s Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga. They had announced a joint Covid-19 vaccine initiative and cooperation on critical technologies, counterterrorism and infrastructure.The US state department listed out the entire expanse of ongoing cooperation between the two countries - diplomatic, economic and security issues, defence, non-proliferation, regional cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, shared democratic values, counterterrorism, the climate crisis, health, energy, trade and investment, peacekeeping, the environment, education, science and technology, agriculture, space, and oceans.On the defence front, cooperation between the two countries is reaching “new heights, including through information sharing, liaison officers, increasingly complex exercises” and the signing of agreements. As of 2020, the US had authorised $20 billion in defence-related sales to India.The statement laid out in details the work the two countries are doing in healthcare, including US assistance to India to fight the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, amounting to $200 million. Also, an estimated $400 million more was chipped in by individuals and private sector companies.The climate crisis has been another area of intense focus, the statement said, recalling US special envoy John Kerry’s visit to India in April and a climate summit that President Biden had hosted in April, which was attended by Modi and 39 other world leaders.The two countries are looking forward to launching the new Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation Dialogue under the Agenda 2030 Partnership, which will be led by Kerry. And they are also eyeing a re-launch of the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership, which is to be led by US secretary of energy Jennifer Granholm later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-india-leading-global-power-and-indo-pacific-front-and-centre-101627404800174.html

Health authorities recorded 357 Covid-19 fatalities on Tuesday, bringing the total death toll to 89,479 – the highest in the Middle East.The alarming spread of the variant prompted new anti-virus restrictions last week. The government ordered the closure of state offices, public places and non-essential businesses in the capital of Tehran. But as with previous government measures, the lockdown looked little like a lockdown. Tehran's malls and markets were busy as usual and workers crowded offices and metro stations.Iranian authorities have avoided imposing heavy-handed rules on a population that can little afford to bear them. The country, which has suffered the worst virus outbreak in the region, is reeling from a series of crises – tough US sanctions, global isolation, a heat wave, the worst blackouts in recent memory and ongoing protests over water shortage in the southwest.Now, health officials warn that hospitals in the capital are overwhelmed with breathless Covid patients too numerous to handle. Fewer than 3 per cent of Iranians have been fully vaccinated in the sanctions-hit country. Many front-line medical workers have been vaccinated with Iran's locally produced shots or the Chinese state-backed Sinopharm vaccine that may be less effective than other inoculations.Iranian government announced that its homemade vaccine provides 85 per cent protection from the coronavirus, without disclosing data or details. Iran also imports Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, as well as the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot through the United Nations-backed COVAX program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-reports-34-900-new-covid-19-cases-in-record-single-day-spike-101627398440863.html
27-07-2021||World||US CDC to unveil new mask guidance for fully vaccinated people amid Delta surge: Report||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is expected to announce revised guidance on face masks for fully vaccinated individuals amid rising cases of highly transmissible Delta variant of coronavirus, according to news agency Reuters.The United States has been witnessing a resurgence of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates. But the breakthrough Covid-19 cases and uncertainty over Delta variant’s ability to escape vaccine-induced immunity has caused concerns for authorities relying on vaccination to reopen economies.The fear of a possible setback to the US' Covid-19 response has reportedly prompted the CDC to reconsider its face mask guidance. The US health agency is expected to recommend fully vaccinated individuals to wear masks in certain circumstances, but the specifics are not clear, reported Reuters citing people familiar with the development.The CDC has reportedly planned a media briefing at 3pm (12.30am IST) to unveil the recommendation.In May, the CDC announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks indoors or outdoors, “except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance.” The recommendation was followed by a change in rules by US states and businesses, aimed at boosting the economy. But the Delta variant, first detected in India, has threatened the gains.Nearly half of the US population has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 but vaccine hesitancy has slowed down the vaccination rate which was once the highest in the world. US President Joe Biden has repeatedly been urging his countrymen to get vaccinated. Biden and CDC director Rochelle Walensky have said Covid-19 is now a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” since they make up the vast majority of infections and hospitalisations.“Folks the Delta variant is no joke. Please protect yourself and your loved ones – get vaccinated,” the US president tweeted on Saturday.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-to-unveil-new-mask-guidance-for-fully-vaccinated-amid-delta-surge-report-101627399978987.html
27-07-2021||World||Myanmar military acts 'flatly unacceptable': Pentagon chief||U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin decried the actions of Myanmar's military rulers on Tuesday and urged a regional bloc to keep demanding an end to the violence.Myanmar, also called Burma, has been wracked by violence by its security forces against people protesting against the military’s seizure of power in February.Austin applauded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations for its efforts to solve the crisis, including a consensus reached with Myanmar’s military leader in April.The five-point document calls for an immediate end to violence and the start of a dialogue among contending parties, with a special ASEAN envoy mediating in the talks. However, a special envoy still hasn’t been appointed.“The Myanmar military’s refusal to respect the inalienable rights of the Burmese people and to defend their basic well-being is flatly unacceptable,” Austin said in a lecture in Singapore.“A military exists to serve its people, not the other way around. And so we call on the Myanmar military to adhere to the ASEAN five-point consensus and to forge a lasting peace," he added.“ASEAN obviously plays a key role, or can play a key role. We certainly will continue to encourage ASEAN to continue to work this issue,” Austin said.He said the US will work with partners in the region to urge Myanmar’s military to “move in the right direction” and release civilians it has imprisoned.Austin, who is on a tour of Southeast Asia, met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday. He also met Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen to reaffirm the countries’ longstanding ties, according to a joint statement.The retired four-star Army general hopes to strengthen relationships with other Southeast Asian allies in the coming days, and will visit Vietnam and the Philippines amid tensions in the disputed South China Sea, which is largely claimed by China.“As Prime Minister Lee has counseled, we are not asking countries in the region to choose between the United States and China,” Austin said."In fact, many of our partnerships in the region are older than the People’s Republic of China itself. That’s why we are expanding our important work with countries throughout the Indo-Pacific and with ASEAN itself, a critical body that brings the region closer together, offering everyone a voice, building deeper habits of cooperation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-chief-myanmar-military-acts-flatly-unacceptable-101627396008008.html
27-07-2021||World||Popular Chinese app WeChat suspends new registrations||Tech giant Tencent Holdings’ WeChat, China’s most popular messaging app, said it was suspending registration of new users in mainland China until early August as it was undergoing a technical upgrade.The development comes amid a widening crackdown by Chinese regulators on technology and private tutoring companies.In a social media post, WeChat, known as Weixin in China, said the suspension was related to an upgrade of security technology “according to relevant laws and regulations”.“During this time, registration of new Weixin personal and official accounts has been temporarily suspended. Registration services will be restored after the upgrade is complete, which is expected in early August,” it said.It did not elaborate on either the upgrade or what the laws or regulations were.Tencent’s stocks in Hong Kong went down by nearly 9% on Tuesday, its worst day in a decade, reports said.Recently, cab-hailing giant Didi suspended registration of new users after several departments of the Chinese government launched an investigation into alleged misuse of private data.Earlier, ecommerce giant Alibaba faced investigations for alleged monopolistic behaviour.WeChat is the latest in that fast-growing list.The app says it has around 1.2 billion users worldwide with the majority of users on the Chinese mainland.Hundreds of millions of people in China use the app to message friends, make payments, book taxis, and share highlights of their lives under a category of update called “moments”.Since its launch about a decade ago, the app has come to occupy a central place in the social media lives of Chinese citizens not only in China, but among the diaspora in the world.Its use became even more widespread through the launch of mini-programmes that allow users to carry out a wide range of functions such as paying utility bills.A mini-programme in the app played a key role in implementing China’s Covid-19 control protocols. “Over 800 million people have used the Health Code Mini Programme for checking their health status as they enter public places, while some 550 million said they have used another digital travel card in the programme that provides an overview of their itinerary in the past two weeks,” state-run China Daily wrote in an article on WeChat earlier this year.In January this year, reports said WeChat’s brand value increased 25% to $67.9 billion.Beijing-based tech consultant Zhou Zhanggui told Reuters that investors were over-reacting to the “rectification” of Chinese tech companies.“The suspension of new user registrations on WeChat has no substantial impact on Tencent in the short term,” Zhou said.WeChat was one of the 59 Chinese apps banned by India in June 2020, because as per India’s information technology ministry, they were “engaged in activities prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/popular-chinese-app-wechat-suspends-new-registrations-101627396031181.html
27-07-2021||World||'This can't go on': UN calls for Covid-closed schools to reopen ASAP||Schools closed due to the coronavirus pandemic must reopen as soon as possible, the United Nations insisted Tuesday, estimating that the education of more than 600 million children was at stake."This cannot go on," James Elder, spokesman for the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), told reporters in Geneva.While acknowledging the difficult choices that governments have to make when facing the Covid-19 crisis and the possible spread of the disease, "schools should be the last to close and the first to reopen," he said, calling it a "terrible mistake" to reopen bars and pubs before schools."Reopening schools cannot wait for all teachers and students to be vaccinated," he added, calling on governments to protect their education budgets despite the economic hardship caused by the pandemic.While children in the northern hemisphere are on their summer holidays, in eastern and southern Africa, an estimated 40 percent of school-age children are currently out of school.Across that region, schools are being closed due to Covid-19 surges, with more than 32 million children estimated to be out of school due to pandemic-related closures or having failed to return after their classrooms reopened.That comes on top of the estimated 37 million children who were out of school before Covid-19 struck.In nearly half the countries in Asia and the Pacific, schools have been closed for more than 200 days during the pandemic.In South America and the Caribbean, there are 18 countries and territories where schools are either closed or partially closed, Elder said.Around the world, "education, safety, friends and food have been replaced by anxiety, violence, and teenage pregnancy", he said.Citing Uganda, he said that between March 2020 and June 2021, there was a more than 20 percent increase in pregnancy among 10 to 24-year-olds.Remote learning remains out of reach for a third of pupils around the world, UNICEF said.In southeast Asia and the Pacific, 80 million children had no access to remote learning while their school was closed.Schools in Uganda were closed for 306 days with only 0.3 percent of households having an internet connection.According to a World Bank study, the pandemic will cost this generation of students $10 trillion in lost income, Elder said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-can-t-go-on-un-calls-for-covid-closed-schools-to-reopen-asap-101627393113643.html
27-07-2021||World||Thousands of foreigners leave Indonesia amid Covid-19 crisis||Thousands of foreigners have left Indonesia in recent weeks, airport records released Tuesday showed, apparently spurred by a brutal pandemic wave and a general shortage of vaccines, which have gone to high-priority groups first.Indonesia now has the most confirmed daily cases in Asia, as infections and deaths have surged over the past month and India’s massive outbreak has waned. Infections peaked in mid-July, with the highest daily average reported at more than 50,000 new cases each day. Until mid-June, daily cases had been running at about 8,000.Since early this month, nearly 19,000 foreign nationals have left through Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in the capital, Jakarta.The exodus increased significantly in the past three days alone, accounting for nearly half of all individual departures this month, said Sam Fernando, who heads the immigration authority at the airport.Japan's ambassador to Indonesia, Kenji Kanasugi, said the difficulty of getting vaccines for foreign nationals has prompted some Japanese citizens to get vaccinated in their home country.“Amid a pandemic situation that is very difficult for all of us, some Japanese citizens in Indonesia will temporarily return to Japan,” Kanasugi said on Instagram earlier this month.Japanese and Chinese nationals made up the largest share of departures, with 2,962 and 2,219 individuals respectively, followed by 1,616 South Korean citizens. Airport figures also showed departures by 1,425 Americans, as well as 842 French, 705 Russian, 700 British, 615 German and 546 Saudi Arabian citizens.Initially, only representatives of foreign countries and international nonprofit organizations were eligible for the government's free vaccine program. The program was expanded last month to include those aged 60 and older, as well as teachers and education staff.Still, television reports showed foreigners complaining about the difficulties they've faced getting vaccinated.Wiku Adisasmito, a spokesman for the National Covid-19 Task Force, said Tuesday that limited vaccine supply remains a challenge. He expressed hope that 45 million more doses set to arrive in August would improve the situation.Indonesia, home to 270 million people, had secured at least 151.8 million vaccine doses by late July. The vast majority of doses — 126.5 million — are from the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac.Indonesia's confirmed daily death toll surpassed 2,000 for the first time on Tuesday, hitting 2,069. The Health Ministry reported 45,203 new confirmed cases as the health system struggles to cope, and even patients fortunate enough to get a hospital bed are not guaranteed oxygen.Several countries have announced new bans or restrictions on travelers from Indonesia, including neighboring Singapore and the Philippines.Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Taiwan and Hong Kong are among the nations and territories that have placed Indonesia on their travel ban list.Overall, Indonesia has reported more than 3.2 million cases and 86,835 fatalities. Those figures are widely believed to be a vast undercount due to low testing and poor tracing measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-foreigners-leave-indonesia-amid-covid-19-crisis-101627392237127.html
27-07-2021||World||Pentagon chief reprimanded China, promises larger role in Asia||Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sought to reassure the Asia-Pacific that the US was committed to engagement in the region, while vowing to challenge what he called China’s aggression.“We will not flinch when our interests are threatened,” Austin said in a speech Tuesday in Singapore. “Yet we do not seek confrontation.”Austin’s remarks focused on US ties with Association of Southeast Asian Nations, including the millions of vaccines that Washington has donated to the region. But he also stressed that the US and its partners faced a common challenge in China.The former US Army general told the event hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies that Washington would work “with partners to deter coercion and aggression across the spectrum of conflict,” including Chinese maritime claims in regional waters and assertive military actions.“Unfortunately, Beijing’s unwillingness to resolve disputes peacefully and respect the rule of law isn’t just occurring on the water,” Austin said. “We have also seen aggression against India, destabilizing military activity and other forms of coercion against the people of Taiwan, and genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.”Austin’s trip, his second to the region as secretary, comes at a time of mounting US-China tensions and as countries across Southeast Asia struggle with a surge in coronavirus cases. Diplomats from Washington and Beijing held contentious meetings in the Chinese port city of Tianjin on Monday, where America’s No. 2 diplomat Wendy Sherman and Foreign Minister Wang Yi both aired a series of grievances.The Pentagon chief’s visit coincides with the US military drawdowns in Afghanistan and Iraq, a move that will allow Washington to shift more of its focus to the Western Pacific. That strategic shift will be part of talks during US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to Asia this week. The top American diplomat will travel to New Delhi to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday before flying to Kuwait.Austin was greeted by Singaporean Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen after he arrived and reviewed soldiers in dress uniform. The two men discussed “the regional security environment and agreed on the importance of sustaining a rules-based order,” according to a joint statement.He later met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who said in a Facebook post they “had a good discussion on regional and international developments, as well as defense cooperation.” Austin is scheduled to deliver a speech later in the day about the value America places on its regional partners before traveling to meet his counterparts in Vietnam and the Philippines.US, China Leave Room to Talk After Contentious MeetingsIn his speech, Austin said the US would help the region “build back better” after Covid-19 by helping fight the pandemic, invest in defense capabilities that can help states deter threats. But even as he referred to the “specter of coercion from rising powers,” he reaffirmed that American didn’t want a military clash with China.“I am committed to pursuing a constructive, stable relationship with China, including stronger crisis communications with the People’s Liberation Army,” he said. “Big powers need to model transparency and communication. And we hope that we can work together with Beijing on common challenges, especially the threat of climate change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-chief-reprimanded-china-promises-larger-role-in-asia-101627387010283.html

Its report has upgraded projections for advanced economies and downgraded them for emerging and developing economies such as India.“Growth prospects in India have been downgraded following the severe second Covid wave during March-May and expected slow recovery in confidence from that setback,” said the IMF’s July World Economic Outlook update.From 12.5% growth that the IMF had projected for 2021 in a report in April – just as India was beginning to feel the brunt of the second wave - it slashed the estimate by three percentage points to 9.5% in the July update. As the same time, the IMF upgraded the projection for 2022 by 1.6 percentage point from 6.9% to 8.5%.India is not the only economy hit hard by the second wave. The IMF reported “similar dynamics” for Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam - “where recent infection waves are causing a drag on activity”.The IMF warned in the report that steady economic recovery around the world will continue to be impeded by “renewed waves”, citing India as an example.On the subject of global recovery, the report said, “Vaccine access has emerged as the principal fault line along which the global recovery splits into two blocs: those that can look forward to further normalisation of activity later this year (almost all advanced economies) and those that will still face resurgent infections and rising Covid death tolls.”It added, “The recovery, however, is not assured even in countries where infections are currently very low so long as the virus circulates elsewhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-downgrades-india-s-growth-projection-due-to-second-wave-of-covid-19-pandemic-101627392310973.html

Xi, who is also General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, met top officials of the Tibet Military Command and reviewed development projects in the region.In an interview to Fox News, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes said: "Just last week, you had Xi Jinping, the Chinese dictator, on the border with India, in Tibet, claiming victory. This was the first time in 30 years, I believe, that a Chinese dictator had been to Tibet, and also threatening India, over a billion people also a nuclear power; threatening India that he's going to build a big water project, possibly cut off water to India."During his visit to Nyingchi, Xi visited the Nyang River Bridge to inspect the ecological preservation in the basin of the Brahmaputra river, which is called Yarlung Zangbo in Tibetan language.China this year approved plans to build a huge dam over the Brahmaputra river during the current 14th Five-Year Plan, which raised concerns in the riparian states of India and Bangladesh.“So, no matter what you plug into the propaganda machine, you can build all the narratives you want here in Washington, D.C., but then there's reality. The reality is that the Chinese are on the march, and the (President Joe) Biden administration is letting them do whatever they want," Nunes said.A senior Republican in the House of Representatives representing the 42nd Congressional district of California, Nunes was the chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee from 2015 to 2019.Xi’s visit to Tibet took place amidst the current India-China military tensions in eastern Ladakh.India and China have been locked in a military standoff at multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh since early May last year.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, which is firmly rejected by India. The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC).China is accused of suppressing cultural and religious freedom in Tibet. China has rejected the accusations.Since becoming President in 2013, Xi has pursued a firm policy of stepping up security control of Tibet. Beijing has been cracking down on Buddhist monks and followers of the Dalai Lama, who despite his exile remains a widely admired spiritual leader in the remote Himalayan region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-prez-xi-jinping-s-tibet-visit-tibet-a-threat-to-india-us-congressman-101627391186963.html

The researchers said that those at moderate risk were four times more likely to have Covid-19 and five times more likely to die following confirmed infection than the low-risk group.  “In spite of the shielding strategy , high-risk individuals were at increased risk of death. Furthermore , to be effective as a population strategy , shielding criteria would have needed to be widely expanded to include other criteria , such as the elderly ,” the study said.  During the early pandemic days , many Western countries used shielding , or extended self-isolation , to protect people presumed to be at high risk from Covid-19 and reduce strain on health infrastructure. The study , led by the University of Glasgow , investigated the effectiveness of the shielding strategy by comparing Covid-19 outcomes among shielded and unshielded individuals in the West of Scotland.  The researchers looked at data between March and May 2020 from 1.3 million patients registered with GP practices in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC). About 2.03% of the registered patients were advised to shield while nearly 27% were classified as a moderate risk due to health conditions such as diabetes. Among the shielded group , 299 (1.1%) confirmed infections and 140 deaths (0.51%) were reported.  The findings suggest that the strategy may not have been as effective at protecting those at the highest risk from infection and death as hoped. Professor Jill Pell , director of the University of Glasgow’s Institute of Health and Wellbeing and co-author of the study , said in a statement that shielding should be used alongside other population-wide measures such as physical distancing , face coverings and hand hygiene to protect high-risk individuals.  “Our study also showed that shielding may be of limited value in reducing burden on health services because , in spite of the shielding strategy , high risk individuals were at increased risk of death ,” she added.  The study titled ‘Comparison of COVID-19 outcomes among shielded and non-shielded populations’ has been published in Scientific Reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shielding-not-effective-as-hoped-people-eight-times-more-likely-to-get-covid-19-study-101627386021037.html

We will work together to ensure stability in both our regions," he said.He also stressed upon expanding bilateral coordination in the areas of technology and the environment.The Saudi minister said his country values the contributions made by the Pakistani community in the economy of the Kingdom and in the talks with his counterpart they discussed more opportunities for Pakistanis in Saudi Arabia.On his part, Qureshi said the talks primarily focused on promoting bilateral trade and investment.He said good progress was made to activate the SP-SCC, including appointment of focal persons in the countries to oversee progress.Qureshi said there are immense opportunities for Saudi Arabia for investment in SEZs under the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, while “our skilled, semi-skilled workforce and professionals can also make significant contributions to the Saudi vision 2030.”He said Pakistan wanted to expand relations with Saudi Arabia in the areas of culture, information, media, entertainment and sports. They also discussed cooperation in the area of climate change.Qureshi also thanked Saudi Arabia for supporting Pakistan in the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and playing its part in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-saudi-to-work-together-to-ensure-regional-stability-boost-economic-ties-101627382593009.html

He breathed his last in a hospital in Guangdong's Huizhou city, Radio Free Asia reported.His friend Li Xuewen told RFA that the poet had posted a suicide note online before taking his own life."After he had posted his suicide note online, he turned off his phone," Li Xuewen said. "He took the pesticide, and was taken to hospital after that."The note suggested that Li had found the increased surveillance under the tenure of ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Xi Jinping unbearable.There has been less and less room for freedom of public expression since Xi Jinping took power, the letter said.Li himself had been made a "ministry-level" stability maintenance target during the 2019 National People's Congress (NPC) meetings in Beijing.According to RFA, Li's phone was monitored and he had to report to the state security police if he wanted to make a trip out of town, the letter said.Li had also suffered a stroke in March 2021, after which his mobility had been greatly affected, it said."He was forced to use a wheelchair after the stroke, and suffered from paralysis in his right arm," Li Xuewen told RFA. "It really did a lot of damage ... he wasn't able to write properly.""But he learned pretty quickly how to type with his left hand and carried on writing articles."The letter said Li had made repeated requests for the authorities to call off their surveillance teams, but to no avail.The local state security police had replied that the decision wasn't theirs to make, and that they would convey his request higher up the chain of command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-poet-committed-suicide-under-unbearable-surveillance-by-the-ccp-101627377117767.html

It has increased adaptability, can spread faster, has higher virus load, treatment time is longer, and it is easier to contract a severe form of the illness.First detected among the city’s airport workers, the new outbreak has triggered two rounds of citywide nucleic acid testing of Nanjing’s nine million residents.Health authorities are carrying out a second round of mass testing and placed tens of thousands of people under lockdown.At least five Chinese provinces and nine cities have reported cases related to the Nanjing outbreak.Following more than 30 cases on two consecutive days, the city, China’s former capital with over nine million residents, has pushed up epidemic risk levels, designating four areas as high-risk zones and 25 areas as medium-risk zones.Nanjing has suspended movie theatres, gymnasiums, indoor swimming pools, bars, bathing venues, “mahjong” halls, chess and card rooms, and other public places.Residents have been told to stay at home and to go out only if it’s essential, the authorities said on Tuesday.Strict restrictions on the number of people entering at the same time have been put in place at pharmacies, wholesale markets, shopping malls and supermarkets.Entrances of non-residents including delivery personnel have been restricted at all residential communities.The city has suspended the operation of eight long-distance bus stations, as well as bus tour services, while the airport has been closed.“Some 19 bus lines that had routes travelling to adjacent areas were limited within the city, and taxis are required not to leave the city,” a state media report said.Meanwhile, more than 560 million Chinese citizens, or 40% of the population, received both doses of a two-shot Covid-19 vaccine by June 30, Gao Fu, director-general of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said on Tuesday.“Now, we have started our mass inoculation programme for the latter half of the year,” Gao was quoted by official media as saying at a conference.As of July 22, China had administered over 1.5 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines, according to the national health commission.“To tackle new variants of the coronavirus, sharing Covid-19 vaccines should be a part of the solution so that all countries can have access to them and inoculate their population, allowing us to stem the global transmission of the disease,” Gao said, adding that if the world doesn’t adequately share vaccines, then the virus will continue to take hold globally.As of June 12, China has supplied 500 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines and concentrates to more than 100 countries and international organisations, accounting for one sixth of the global output.As of Monday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China stood at 92,676, and the death toll was 4,636..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-nanjing-with-9mn-people-sealed-off-as-delta-variant-of-covid-spreads-101627383549743.html

Ferguson, who influenced the governments’ response around the world with his initial Covid-19 modelling, told the BBC that though the UK is not “completely out of the woods”, the reduced risk of hospitalisations and deaths due to vaccines has “fundamentally changed” the equation."The effect of vaccines has been huge in reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death and I think, I'm positive that by late September, October time we will be looking back at most of the pandemic," Ferguson said.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to remove almost all restrictions from July 19 was severely criticised by health experts as the country was witnessing a worrying surge driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. Despite criticism, the UK government followed up on the plan but continued to emphasise the importance of social distancing measures and wearing face masks.While the impact of the removal of Covid restrictions is yet to be seen, Johnson is betting on the high rates of vaccination to boost one of Europe's largest economies. The daily new Covid-19 cases have fallen continuously for the last six days, with 24,950 new cases reported on Monday.The recent spike in Covid-19 cases didn’t lead to a vast increase in deaths even as hospitalisation from the virus has been on a rise. In a letter to Johnson, cabinet ministers and the NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, the NHS Providers group said the hospitals are as stretched now as they were at the height of the second wave in January.Ferguson said by October, Britain will “still have Covid with us, we will still have people dying from Covid, but we’ll have put the bulk of the pandemic behind us,” adding that there is going to be “remaining uncertainty” until autumn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-of-covid-19-pandemic-might-be-near-in-uk-says-epidemiologist-neil-ferguson-101627382219488.html

While the TTP has “distinctive anti-Pakistan objectives”, it also supports the Taliban militants inside Afghanistan against Afghan Forces, according to the report prepared by the UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team.The TTP is said to be traditionally located in the eastern districts of Nangarhar Province, near the border with Pakistan. A reunification of TTP and certain splinter groups, including Shehryar Mehsud group, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), and Hizb-ul-Ahrar took place from December 2019 to August 2020 while Al-Qaeda was reportedly involved in the moderation between these groups, the report said.“The return of splinter groups to the TTP fold has increased its strength, of which current Member State estimates range between 2,500 and 6,000 armed fighters, with one Member State assessing that the upper range is more accurate,” the report says.Also Read | Afghan forces retake key district in northern province of Balkh from TalibanCiting information from the Member States and other interlocutors, the UN report said that the Taliban’s approach towards foreign terrorists has not been consistent. The Taliban’s effort to suppress such outfits has been “more pronounced in cases of foreign terrorist fighters with suspected leanings” Islamic State and TTP.“Attempted enforcement has reportedly led to clashes (some fatal) between the Taliban and TTP over operational restrictions placed on the latter,” the report states.Despite the Taliban’s repeated denial of any presence of foreign terrorists in Afghanistan, the report noted that fighters from various countries and militant groups continue to operate in the country and most are reported to be, at minimum, “tolerated or protected by the Taliban.” The foreign terrorists mainly comprise fighters from “Central Asia, the North Caucasus region of the Russian Federation, Pakistan and the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of China, among others."“Although the majority are affiliated foremost with the Taliban, many also support [Al-Qaeda]. Others are allied with ISIL or have ISIL sympathies,” the report adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6000-pak-s-ttp-terrorists-still-in-afghanistan-support-taliban-against-afghan-forces-un-report-101627377968187.html

Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday that if labs are to be investigated, the World Health Organization (WHO) officials should go to Fort Detrick."If labs are to be investigated, then the WHO experts should go to Fort Detrick. The US should act transparently & responsibly as soon as possible and invite WHO experts for an inquiry into the Fort Detrick lab. Only in this way can truth be revealed to the world," Zhao said on Twitter.If labs are to be investigated, then the WHO experts should go to Fort Detrick. The US should act transparently & responsibly as soon as possible and invite WHO experts for an inquiry into the Fort Detrick lab. Only in this way can truth be revealed to the world.The tweet was in response to calls for a second round of investigation in Covid-19 origin. Fort Detrick is a military base located in Frederick, Maryland.The WHO said earlier this month that a second stage of the international probe should include audits of Chinese labs, amid increasing pressure from the US for an investigation into Wuhan Institute of Virology.The proposal outlined by WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus included "audits of relevant laboratories and research institutions operating in the area of the initial human cases identified in December 2019".Reacting to it, China's vice health minister Zeng Yixin said that he was "extremely surprised" by the plan, which he said showed "disrespect for common sense and arrogance towards science".Beijing has repeatedly insisted that a leak from one of its laboratories would have been "extremely unlikely", citing the conclusion reached by a joint WHO-Chinese mission to Wuhan in January. The WHO has accused China of not sharing the important raw data during the first phase of the investigation.The theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese laboratory has gained momentum in the last few months.Earlier, Chinese tabloid Global Times said it had collected five million signatures from the country's internet users on a petition to investigate the US lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-go-to-fort-detrick-lab-in-us-china-tells-who-101627367256859.html

Modi had said that India has been committed to sharing its expertise and resources with the global community in combating the pandemic.The Covid-19 resolution, adopted by the Security Council in February this year, calls for the strengthening of national and multilateral approaches and international cooperation, such as the COVAX facility, to facilitate equitable and affordable access to Covid-19 vaccines in armed conflict situations, post-conflict situations and complex humanitarian emergencies.It also stressed the need to develop international partnerships particularly to scale-up manufacturing and distribution capabilities, in recognition of differing national contexts, and noted the need to maintain incentives for the development of new health products.The resolution recognised the role of extensive immunisation against Covid-19 as a global public good for health.Permanent Representative of France to the UN Nicolas de Riviere tweeted that one year after the adoption of Resolution 2532, the Security Council met on the Covid-19 situation. Resolution 2532, adopted by the Security Council in July 2020, had expressed grave concern about the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world, especially in countries ravaged by armed conflicts, or in post-conflict situations, or affected by humanitarian crises and had demanded a “general and immediate cessation of hostilities in all situations on its agenda.”“Despite some progress, it is far from satisfactory. We must continue to focus our efforts on a cessation of hostilities, a humanitarian pause & equitable access to vaccines,” the French envoy said.The overall global Covid-19 caseload has topped 194 million, while the deaths have surged to more than 4.16 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University.

The two leaders agreed to restore mutual trust as soon as possible.At 10 am Monday, the two sides reopened hotlines that had been silent for more than a year, South Korea said. The move came on the 68th anniversary of the armistice agreement that ended fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War.The lines allowed for constant communication between the two sides since the start of the war but were cut off in June 2020 during one of the worst flareups in years between the Koreas. That dispute culminated later that month in Kim’s regime blowing up a liaison office on the northern side of the border.The communications channels were established in 2018 after North Korean leader Kim and Moon held summits over the course of five months between April and September. North Korea accused South Korea of violating the agreement by allowing the launches of balloon carrying anti-Pyongyang messages as a justification for cutting off communication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-koreas-exchange-letters-agree-to-rebuild-ties-in-a-historic-move-101627351840333.html

27-07-2021||World||Germany to warn of future floods with phone alerts||Germany will issue mobile phone alerts in the future to inform citizens of impending dangers, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said on Monday after deadly floods prompted a rethink of the country's warning systems."Not everyone has always been enthusiastic about the idea in recent months. But I've decided that we're going to do it... There is no reasonable argument against it," Seehofer said in parliament.At least 180 people died when severe floods pummelled western Germany over two days in mid-July, raising questions about whether enough was done to warn residents ahead of time.Some 70 people are still missing after torrents of water ripped through entire towns and villages, destroying bridges, roads, railways and swathes of housing.Government spokeswoman Martina Fietz last week said the country's weather warning system and mobile phone app Nina had "worked" but admitted that "our experiences with this disaster show that we need to do more and better".Armin Schuster, president of the German civil protection agency (BBK), called for sirens to be reinstated in more areas.He also said the agency was considering introducing mobile phone alerts, but "a number of issues" would need to be talked through first, including the costs and data protection concerns.The alerts would be sent using a technology known as cell broadcast, which enables local authorities to send messages to multiple mobile phone users in a particular area at the same time.The alerts are similar to SMS messages, but can be sent and received anonymously and have the advantage of still working when networks are overloaded.The technology is not widely used in Europe, but is common in the US and Japan.Seehofer on Monday called for a mix of analogue and digital warnings. "The warning app is of no use if you are asleep at night and don't hear it. The siren, in turn, is of no use on its own because it doesn't tell people: What should they do?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-warn-of-future-floods-with-phone-alerts-101627350021507.html
27-07-2021||World||Jeff Bezos offers NASA a $2 billion discount for Blue Origin Moon lander||Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos wrote an open letter to NASA on Monday offering a $2 billion discount to allow his company to build a Moon lander.The human landing system (HLS) contract, worth $2.9 billion, was awarded to rival SpaceX in April, but Blue Origin and a third company Dynetics filed protests that are currently awaiting adjudication by the US Government Accountability Office.The United States is seeking to return to the Moon by 2024 under the Artemis program, using the lessons learned to prepare for a crewed Mars mission in the 2030s.In his letter to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Bezos said the offer would "bridge the funding shortfall" that led to the space agency picking just one contractor, instead of two which would then compete with each other.He added "this offer is not a deferral, but is an outright permanent waiver."Since losing the award, Blue Origin has been frantically lobbying to have the decision reversed, leading the Senate to pass a bill agreeing to add $10 billion to the human lander system.But the legislation is still being debated in the House, and has been branded a "Bezos Bailout" by critics.Bezos wrote that an advantage of Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander was its use of liquid hydrogen for fuel, which can be mined from lunar ice in line with NASA's plans to use the Moon to refuel rockets for operations deeper into the solar system.He added that the company would test its lander in orbit around the Earth at its own cost."We stand ready to help NASA moderate its technical risks and solve its budgetary constraints and put the Artemis Program back on a more competitive, credible, and sustainable path," Bezos concluded.It is unclear whether Bezos' last-minute intervention will sway the outcome of the award.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-offers-nasa-a-2-billion-discount-for-blue-origin-moon-lander-101627349146095.html
27-07-2021||World||US combat mission in Iraq to conclude by 2021 end, says Joe Biden||President Joe Biden said Monday the US combat mission in Iraq will conclude by the end of the year, an announcement that reflects the reality on the ground more than a major shift in US policy.Even before Biden took office, the main US focus has been assisting Iraqi forces, not fighting on their behalf. And Biden did not say if he planned to reduce the number of troops in Iraq, now about 2,500.The announcement comes on the heels of Biden's decision to withdraw fully from Afghanistan nearly 20 years after the US launched that war in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Together, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have heavily taxed the US military and kept it from devoting more attention to a rising China, which the Biden administration calls the biggest long-term security challenge.Also watch, First Afghanistan, now Iraq: How Joe Biden is ending America's post-9/11 warsFor years, US troops have played support roles in Iraq and in neighboring Syria, which was the origin of the Islamic State group that swept across the border in 2014 and captured large swaths of Iraqi territory, prompting the US to send troops back to Iraq that year.Speaking to reporters during an Oval Office session with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, Biden said his administration remained committed to a partnership with Iraq — a relationship that has been increasingly complicated by Iranian-backed Iraqi militia groups.The militias want all US troops out of Iraq immediately and have periodically attacked bases that house American troops.Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America, said US troops will remain at risk.“Regardless of whether their deployment is called a combat mission, US troops will remain under regular attack as long as they remain in Iraq,” Caldwell said in a statement.“An American military presence in Iraq is not necessary for our safety and only risks the loss of more American life.”Biden said the US military will continue to assist Iraq in its fight against the Islamic State group, or ISIS. A joint US-Iraq statement said the security relationship will be focused on training, advising and intelligence-sharing."Our shared fight against ISIS is critical for the stability of the region and our counterterrorism operation will continue, even as we shift to this new phase we're going to be talking about,” Biden said.The shift from a US combat role to one focused on training and advising the Iraqi security forces was announced in April, when a joint US-Iraqi statement said this transition allowed for the removal from Iraq of any remaining US combat forces on a timetable to be determined later.It did not specify what combat functions the US was engaged in then, nor did Biden get into such specifics on Monday.“We're not going to be, by the end of the year, in a combat mission,” he said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki declined to say how many troops would remain in Iraq by year's end."The numbers will be driven by what is needed for the mission over time, so it is more about moving to a more advising and training capacity from what we have had over the last several years,” she said.The US troop presence has stood at about 2,500 since late last year when then-President Donald Trump ordered a reduction from 3,000.The Iraqi government in 2017 declared victory over the Islamic State group, which is now a shell of its former self. Still, it has shown it can carry out high-casualty attacks. Last week, the group claimed responsibility for a roadside bombing that killed at least 30 people and wounded dozens in a busy suburban Baghdad market.In his remarks alongside Biden, al-Kadhimi thanked the United States for its support.Back home, al-Kadhimi faces no shortage of problems. Iranian-backed militias operating inside Iraq have stepped up attacks against US forces in recent months, and a series of devastating hospital fires that left dozens of people dead and soaring coronavirus infections have added fresh layers of frustration for the nation.For al-Kadhimi, the ability to offer the Iraqi public a date for the end of the US combat presence could be a feather in his cap before elections scheduled for October.Biden administration officials say al-Kadhimi also deserves credit for improving Iraq's standing in the Mideast. Last month, King Abdullah II of Jordan and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi visited Baghdad for joint meetings — the first time an Egyptian president has made an official visit since the 1990s, when ties were severed after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.The Iraqi prime minister made clear before his trip to Washington that he believes it's time for the US to wind that mission down.“There is no need for any foreign combat forces on Iraqi soil,” al-Kadhimi told The Associated Press last weekend.The US mission of training and advising Iraqi forces has its most recent origins in President Barack Obama's decision in 2014 to send troops back to Iraq.The move was made in response to the Islamic State group's takeover of large portions of western and northern Iraq and a collapse of Iraqi security forces that appeared to threaten Baghdad. Obama had fully withdrawn US forces from Iraq in 2011, eight years after the US invasion.Pentagon officials for years have tried to balance what they see as a necessary military presence to support the Iraqi government's fight against IS with domestic political sensitivities in Iraq to a foreign troop presence.The vulnerability of US troops was demonstrated most dramatically in January 2020 when Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on al-Asad air base in western Iraq. No Americans were killed, but dozens suffered traumatic brain injury from the blasts.That attack came shortly after a US drone strike killed Iranian military commander Qassim Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad International Airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-combat-mission-in-iraq-to-conclude-by-2021-end-says-joe-biden-101627345399836.html

27-07-2021||World||Nearly 200 govts open climate talks||Nearly 200 nations started online negotiations on Monday to validate a UN science report that will anchor autumn summits charged with preventing climate catastrophe on a planetary scale.Record-smashing heatwaves, floods and drought across three continents in recent weeks, all amplified by global warming, make the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment more than timely.“It’s going to be a wake-up call, there’s no doubt about that,” said Richard Black, founder and senior associate of the London-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.The report, he noted, comes only weeks ahead of a UN General Assembly, a G20 summit, and the 197-nation COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.Scientists have calculated that greenhouse gas emissions must decline 50% by 2030, and be phased out entirely by 2050 to stay within range of 1.5°C.UN chief warns of hungerUN secretary-general Antonio Guterres on Monday warned that the climate crisis and conflicts are both a consequence and a driver of poverty, income inequality and food prices. Guterres was addressing a meeting in Rome.Focus on heatwavesHeatwaves that obliterate temperature records as in western Canada last month and Siberia last year are caused by the rapid pace, rather than the amount, of global warming, experts said.

27-07-2021||World||Protests over Covid jolt Tunisia, Prez sacks PM||Fierce street clashes erupted on Monday outside Tunisia’s parliament, a day after President Kais Saied ousted the prime minister and suspended the legislature, plunging the country into a crisis.Saied sacked Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi and ordered the parliament closed for 30 days, a move that the biggest political party Ennahdha decried as a “coup”, following a day of angry protests against the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.Soldiers on Monday blockaded the assembly in Tunis while, outside, the president’s supporters hurled stones and insults at backers of Ennahdha.People in Tunisia have lately been protesting over the country’s slow response to the Covid-19 crisis as coronavirus deaths have surged to one of the world’s highest per capita rates.France brings law making Covid passes mandatoryFrance’s parliament approved a law on Monday requiring Covid-19 passes for all restaurants and domestic travel, and it also mandated vaccinations for all health workers. Both measures have prompted protests and political tensions. President Emmanuel Macron said they are needed to protect vulnerable populations and hospitals as infections rebound.The law requires all workers in the healthcare sector to start getting vaccinated by September 15 or risk suspension. It also requires a “health pass” to enter all restaurants, trains, planes and some other public venues.World leaders can attend UNGA summit in personThe United Nations has decided to let world leaders attend their annual gathering at the UN General Assembly in September in person - or deliver pre-recorded speeches if Covid restrictions prevent them from travelling.

27-07-2021||World||US secretary of state Antony Blinken begins his two-day India visit today||The situation in Afghanistan and a coordinated Covid-19 response will be key issues on the agenda for US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s engagements with Indian interlocutors during his two-day visit beginning on Tuesday.The Indian side has also indicated that it is prepared to engage with the US on issues such as human rights and democracy, which American officials have said Blinken intends to raise during his maiden visit to New Delhi after assuming office earlier this year.Blinken is the third high-ranking official of the Biden administration to travel to India after defence secretary Lloyd Austin in March and special envoy for climate change John Kerry in April. He will meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday before travelling to Kuwait on the next leg of his tour.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Monday that the security situation in Afghanistan will be a key issue during Blinken’s visit as the Indian side believes US support for Afghan forces over the next few months will be crucial for retaining the gains made under the democratic system in Kabul over the past 20 years.The Taliban stepped up its campaign to capture territory across Afghanistan once the US made it clear that it intended to complete the drawdown of its troops by next month. The US is keen on some sort of power-sharing arrangement in Kabul after facing criticism from some quarters for the nature of its withdrawal.The Indian side, on the other hand, is expected to raise the implications of the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan and the need for sustained pressure on Pakistan over terror financing and terrorist sanctuaries, the people cited above said.A coordinated Covid-19 response, including open and consistent supply chains for materials and items required for producing vaccines, will figure in the discussions in line with India’s plans to ramp up production for both domestic vaccination and subsequent global supplies, the people said.Further engagements under the rubric of the Indo-Pacific, including a possible meeting of Quad foreign ministers, an in-person Quad Summit and the Quad vaccine partnership, and bilateral contacts such as the 2+2 meeting of defence and foreign ministers are also expected to figure in the discussions.Blinken’s visit is an opportunity to “continue the high-level bilateral dialogue and bolster the India-US global strategic partnership”, the external affairs ministry said last week while announcing the visit. “Both sides will review the robust and multifaceted India-US bilateral relations, and potential for consolidating them further,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-secretary-of-state-blinken-to-visit-india-on-tuesday-afghanistan-covid-19-response-on-agenda-101627319920214.html
