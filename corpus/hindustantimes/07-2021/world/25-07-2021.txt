Adam Kinzinger, to a special committee investigating the Capitol riot and pledged that the Democratic-majority panel will “get to the truth.” Kinzinger said he “humbly accepted” the appointment even as his party's leadership is boycotting the inquiry.Also Read | Pelosi blocks Trump allies from Jan 6 panel, GOP may boycottWith the committee set to hold its first meeting, hearing from police officers who battled the rioters, Pelosi said it was imperative to learn what happened on Jan. 6, when insurrectionists disrupted the congressional certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory, and why the violent siege took place. That mission, she said, must be pursued in a bipartisan manner to ensure “such an attack can never happen again.”Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, will bring "great patriotism to the committee’s mission: to find the facts and protect our Democracy,” she said in a statement.He joins Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, as the two committee's Republicans, both selected by the leader of the opposition party. Kinzinger and Cheney were among the 10 House Republicans to vote for Trump’s second impeachment. They were the only two Republicans who voted last month to form the special committee.Also Read | Pelosi names Republican Liz Cheney, a Trump critic, to panel probing Jan 6 riot“For months, lies and conspiracy theories have been spread, threatening our self-governance,” Kinzinger said in a statement. “For months, I have said that the American people deserve transparency and truth on how and why thousands showed up to attack our democracy.”“I will work diligently to ensure we get to the truth and hold those responsible for the attack fully accountable," he said.House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has said the GOP will not participate after Pelosi, D-Calif., refused to accept two of the members he picked.McCarthy, R-Calif., has said the committee was a “sham process” and withdrew his five members when Pelosi rejected two of them, Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio. Both voted on Jan. 6 against certifying Biden’s election victory over Trump and both are outspoken allies of the former president.Kinzinger and Cheney have faulted Trump as a factor in spurring the insurrection with his persistently false claims that the 2020 election was “stolen” due to voting fraud.In recent weeks, Kinzinger has suggested he would be open to serving on the committee, despite threats from McCarthy that Republicans who accept a spot could be stripped of their regular committee assignments as retaliation for participating.“It's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That’s why she’s picked the group that she’s already picked,” Banks said on “Fox News Sunday.” He said that “anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will be stuck to her -- her narrative, to her point of view. There won’t be another side.”The House voted in May to create an independent investigation that would have been evenly split between the parties, but Senate Republicans blocked that approach. Pelosi said the new panel was being created only because a bipartisan commission was no longer an option.Currently Cheney sits on the committee along with seven Democrats — ensuring they have a quorum to proceed, whether other Republicans participate or not.Pelosi expressed confidence that the committee’s work will be seen as bipartisan and credible even with McCarthy’s effort to boycott the panel.“We have to, again, ignore the antics of those who do not want to find the truth,” she said. “We will find the truth. That truth will have the confidence of the American people because it will be done patriotically and not in a partisan way.”Seven people died during and after the rioting, including a woman who was shot by police as she tried to break into the House chamber and three other Trump supporters who suffered medical emergencies. Two police officers died by suicide in the days that followed, and a third officer, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters. A medical examiner determined he died of natural causes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pelosi-names-second-trump-critic-from-gop-on-panel-probing-jan-6-violence-at-us-capitol-101627233491376.html

However, on Friday it reimposed a “stricter” 14-day nationwide shutdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.Health Minister Zahid Maleque said that everyone should abide by the restrictions during the ongoing lockdown to reduce fresh cases, The Daily Star newspaper reported."We do not want the number of patients to increase. To reduce the number of patients, we have to reduce the infection," Maleque said after visiting the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) Convention Centre here.Expressing concern over the increasing infection rate in many cities across the country, he warned, “If the infection continues to increase like this, there will be no place left in hospitals.”"If the coronavirus situation is not brought under control, it will harm the country's economy, which we do not want. Therefore, there is no alternative to following the health safety rules," the health minister said.The BSMMU field hospital with 1,000 beds, including 200 intensive care units and high dependency units, will start operation from next Saturday, said the report.On Saturday, India sent a consignment of 200 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen on an Oxygen Express train to Bangladesh.Giving details about the Covid-19 cases in Bangladesh, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) said on Sunday that 228 people died from the contagion in the past 24 hours, taking the country’s death toll to 19,274.Dhaka counted 69 deaths, the highest among the eight divisions, followed by Khulna with 50 fatalities.It said that 11,291 new cases were reported during the last 24 hours with an infection rate of 30.04 per cent, taking the national tally to 11,64,635.The government had reimposed the lockdown on Friday and said everyone must stay indoors as offices, courts, garment factories and all other export-oriented industries will remain closed.Junior minister for public administration Farhad Hossain said: "this lockdown will be stricter than the one imposed last time".Army troops, paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh and elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion personnel have joined hands with police in enforcing the shutdown on the streets of the capital Dhaka and other cities and their entry points.The security personnel in uniform have set up makeshift checkpoints to restrict peoples’ movement without emergency needs.The health experts have said the lifting of the ban allowed millions to travel to their home, crowding public buses and ferries and warned it could heighten the toll and infection cases in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-continue-to-rise-hospitals-may-run-out-of-capacity-bangladesh-govt-101627229755126.html

President Joe Biden had set a goal to administer at least one dose of the vaccine to 70% of the adults in the country by July 4, but it remained unfulfilled. Biden urged people to get vaccinated and lashed out at social media companies or allowing vaccine misinformation to remain in circulation.Reports of vaccination rates going up have been emerging from states with a high number of cases, which the White House confirmed on July 22. "In the past week, the five states with the highest case rates — Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri and Nevada — had a higher rate of people getting newly vaccinated compared to the national average," Jeff Zients, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said during a White House briefing.Fauci also praised Republican politicians Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Ron DeSantis of Florida, and the second-ranking House leader, Representative. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, for encouraging their constituents to get vaccinated, these states have been reporting low rates of vaccination since the drive was started. “What I would really like to see is more and more of the leaders in those areas that are not vaccinating to get out and speak out and encourage people to get vaccinated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-anthony-fauci-cautions-us-is-moving-in-the-wrong-direction-urges-unvaccinated-individuals-to-take-the-jab-101627229586868.html
25-07-2021||World||China gets new World Heritage Site with links to Hinduism, Tamil Nadu||As many as 22 sites in the southeastern Chinese city of Quanzhou including a temple with links to Hinduism were included to the Unesco World Heritage List on Sunday.The new listing of “Quanzhou: Emporium of the World in Song-Yuan China” by the world’s top cultural organisation boosts the credentials of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s maritime silk road, the sea route part of the Belt and Road Initiative’ (BRI), which aims to link China with Asia and beyond through infrastructure projects on land and sea.China has been promoting the coastal province Fujian and the city of Quanzhou as an important ancient sea trade zone where multicultural communities including from Tamil Nadu mingled a millennia ago.Xi served as governor of Fujian between 1999 and 2002, and also visited Quanzhou.The listing decision was made on Sunday during the Unesco World Heritage Committee’s 44th online session chaired from Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian, the same province where Quanzhou is located.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Xi had decided to establish “sister-state relations” between Tamil Nadu and Fujian during the latter’s visit to Mamallapuram for the second informal summit in October, 2019 - it was because of Quanzhou’s ancient links with Tamil Nadu.Key sites in the listing include Kaiyuan Temple with Hindu and Buddhist links, Luoyang Bridge, Qingjing Mosque, one of the oldest mosques in China and an archaeological site of an old maritime trade office, said to have been first established in 1087, according to state-run China Daily newspaper.China’s submission document to Unesco applying for Quanzhou’s heritage status, surprisingly, did not specifically mention the city’s ancient links with Tamil Nadu but only mentioned Hinduism.“Historic monuments and sites of ancient Quanzhou (Zayton)” is directly associated with the significant events of (Chinese general) Zheng He’s voyages to the west and tangibly associated with the spread of Islam, Manichaeism, Hinduism, and Nestorianism in the southeast coastal area of China,” the document said.Wang Liming from the Quanzhou Maritime Museum shared more details. “Today, anyone who talks about the relationship between ancient Hinduism and China cannot do without mentioning the city of Quanzhou…Its past prosperity left the city with a great number of precious cultural relics. Among them, the carving art of Hinduism presents people opportunities to understand Hindu scriptures and myths and exhibits the friendly exchanges between Quanzhou and India’s Tamil Nadu which started more than 1,000 years ago,” Wang wrote in a recent article, which she shared with HT on Sunday.“With Quanzhou’s growing popularity globally, people with different religious beliefs from all over the world came to the city. While Christianity, Islam, and Judaism arrived one after another, Hinduism also came with Indian merchants. Followers built magnificent Hindu temples and sacrificial altars in the metropolis,” Wang wrote.The temples, however, have gradually been destroyed.About a specific temple, Wang wrote: “Today, this very temple, which was described as ‘extremely magnificent’ in the local historical annals, has long been destroyed. Although it is impossible to see its original appearance, a large number of exquisite stone carvings have been unearthed in Nanjiaochang, where the temple was probably located. Hindu architectural components have also been found at many locations in the city.”Following Sunday’s listing, China now has 56 Unesco World Heritage sites, one less than Italy with the most such locations globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-gets-new-world-heritage-site-with-links-to-hinduism-tamil-nadu-101627225226902.html

Hundreds of cars washed away in floods have piled up in different parts of the city.

The crisis also increased due to water shortage in the Rawal and Khanpur dams as they touched the dead level causing water shortage in one of major cities of Pakistan, according to a report by Express Tribune.The citizens of Rawalpindi continue to face difficulties as the gap grows between water supply and demand. This has also led to a thriving water tanker business in the city with one tanker selling at PKR 3,000 to PKR 4,000. Out of the 460 tubewells which are functioning under the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), three of them have halted extracting water from 350 feet underground. The pressure of water which was being supplied from the 600 feet deep tubewells has also declined.The report also highlights that the population of 1.6 million people continue to face difficulties as civic bodies are currently supplying 46 million gallons of water daily against the requirement of 59 million due to depleting water level in Rawal and Khanpur Dam. At least 150 tubewells of Rawalpindi Cantonment and Chaklala have started drying up due to depleting groundwater levels. Incessant load shedding has also added to woes as it has stopped tubewells from working to their full capacity.WASA managing director Raja Shaukat Mehmood said that due to the crisis authorities are now understanding that Rawalpindi needs futuristic plans to mitigate its water needs. Mehmood also said that Rawal and Khanpur dams along with the tube wells are not capable of meeting the future water demand of Rawalpindi.Experts warned the Pakistan government earlier that famine-like situations may arise in Pakistan due to water scarcity across the country if the issues remain unresolved.(with inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rawalpindi-faces-acute-water-shortage-amid-scorching-heat-report-101627223327702.html

Don't denigrate people for trying to keep themselves and their families safe," said Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary David Lammy.Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Munira Wilson said Javid's tweet was "outrageous" while thousands remain in hospital with Covid-19."His careless words have insulted every man, woman, and child who has followed the rules and stayed at home to protect others. He owes them all, especially the millions who are shielding, an apology," she said.Hours later, Javid took to Twitter again to issue an apology for the use of the word cower, which means to crouch down in fear. His updated tweet reads: “I've deleted a tweet which used the word ‘cower’. I was expressing gratitude that the vaccines help us fight back as a society, but it was a poor choice of word and I sincerely apologise."“Like many, I have lost loved ones to this awful virus and would never minimise its impact,” he said.The minister, among those in the ruling Conservative Party who have been in favour of easing lockdown restrictions, will return to work as England enters the second week since all legal lockdown restrictions were lifted on July 19.On Saturday, daily coronavirus cases fell in the UK for the fourth day in a row, with 31,795 infections and 86 deaths.

Men were forced to grow beards and wear a cap or turban. Music and other forms of entertainment were banned.Anyone not abiding by this code risked being publicly lashed, beaten or humiliated. Women who disobeyed these rules were sometimes killed, wrote Sher Jan Ahmadzai, in Asia Times.Taliban is re-imposing repressive laws and retrograde policies in areas captured by them, they are imposing laws that defined its 1996-2001 rule when they enforced their version of Islamic Sharia law.During peace negotiations and on visits abroad, the Taliban's leadership has expressed both a belief that women have rights under Islamic laws and a desire to reduce violence in Afghanistan.The group has also pledged to protect such public infrastructure as government buildings, roads and schools, which it has often attacked.But in newly captured areas their policies are more hard-line, says Ahmadzai.According to reports by the Afghan stations Radio Liberty and Radio Salam Watandar, Taliban rulers in Afghanistan's north and northeast have asked families to marry off one girl per family to their fighters; said women should not leave home without a male relative, and ordered men to pray in mosques and grow beards.The Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission, an Afghan government agency, says public infrastructure has been destroyed and social services halted in many Taliban-controlled areas, leaving 13 million people without public services, reported Asia Times.All evidence suggests the Taliban still believe in restoring their old system of the emirate, in which an unelected religious leader, or emir, was the ultimate decision-maker. No one could challenge his verdicts because he was believed to have divine authority from God, says Ahmadzai."The Taliban don't believe in democracy. They just want the collapse of the government so they can reconquer Afghanistan and reimpose their system," Ahmad Rashid, a Pakistani journalist who has covered Afghanistan for 20 years, told Germany's Deutsche Welle newspaper in July 2021.The Taliban's revival of its extremist policies in rural areas has filled many women in the cities with dread."I'm worried that women could return to the dark days of the past when we were just housewives and banned from taking part in society, culture, politics, and even sport. What happens when the Taliban takes over the cities? What will happen to women then?" asked Sanam Sadat, an activist in Faryab's provincial capital, Maimana, which is under government control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-prepares-to-restore-dark-days-in-afghanistan-re-impose-repressive-laws-101627209097919.html
25-07-2021||World||US must treat other countries equally: Chinese FM||China and the international community have the responsibility to teach the US a lesson on how to treat other countries equally, senior diplomat Wang Yi has said ahead of the visit of deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman to China beginning Sunday.State councillor and foreign minister Wang made the remarks at the third round of China-Pakistan foreign ministers’ strategic dialogue with counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi held in Chengdu, southwest China’s Sichuan province on Friday.Wang’s comment, according to Chinese official media, was in response to the US state department spokesperson Ned Price’s statement that Sherman’s discussions in China will be held from a “position of strength”.“The US has always put pressure on others with its self-claimed strengths in a condescending manner,” Wang was quoted as saying in state media. “But I want to tell the US side that there is never a country that is superior to others, and there shouldn’t be one.”If the US still hasn’t learned how to treat other countries equally, then China, together with the international community, has a responsibility to teach the US, Wang said.Sharp focus will be on Sherman’s two-day visit and talks in Tianjin, a port city some 100km from Beijing.This will be the first face-to-face talks between Washington and Beijing in months as the two negotiate acrimonious ties.Ahead of her visit, US officials told reporters in Washington that Sherman will tell China that while Washington welcomes competition, it wants to ensure that ties do not veer into conflict. “She’s going to underscore that we do not want that stiff and sustained competition to veer into conflict,” a Reuters report from Washington quoted a senior US official as saying.“The US wants to ensure that there are guardrails and parameters in place to responsibly manage the relationship,” the official said. “Everyone needs to play by the same rules and on a level playing field.”Sherman’s talks with Chinese officials will take place in the backdrop of tension between the two countries over wide-ranging issues including alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong and US’s ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as interference in its internal matters.Chinese President Xi Jinping had warned US counterpart Joe Biden that confrontation between China and the US will be disastrous for both countries and the world in their first phone call after the latter became president in January.In a statement, the White House had then said the president had “underscored his fundamental concerns about Beijing’s coercive and unfair economic practices, crackdown in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and increasingly assertive actions in the region, including towards Taiwan”.A statement from China carried by the official news agency, Xinhua, quoted Xi as telling Biden that those issues were China’s internal affairs.“The Taiwan question and issues relating to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, etc. are China’s internal affairs and concern China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the US side should respect China’s core interests and act prudently,” Xi told his American counterpart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-must-treat-other-countries-equally-chinese-fm-101627210826123.html

This has been designated as a variant under investigation on Wednesday, The Independent has reported. The variant is known as B.1.621. The authorities have clarified that not much has been known about this variant and there is no evidence to suggest that it might make vaccines less effective or lead to more severe illness so that the new strain does not spread fears among people.The B.1.621 variant of SARS-CoV-2 might be a new variant in the United Kingdom, but this is not new in the world, In January, the variant was first identified in Colombia."Most of the cases have been linked to overseas travel and there is currently no evidence of community transmission in the UK," the Independent reported.The Covid-19 situation in the United Kingdom worsened in the last few weeks which has been attributed to the Delta variant of the virus. Despite the surge in the cases, Covid-19 restrictions were lifted in the UK this week. On Saturday, Britain reported 31,794 coronavirus cases.Reports said the R rate of coronavirus in the UK is around 1.2 and 1.4 which means one infected person can spread the infection to more than one person. The infection rate in private households of England has also been the highest since January.What is the variant under investigation?Before classifying any variant as of interest (variants of interest) and concern (variants of concern), variants are first investigated. As of now, this new strain is being considered as a signal and its risk is being assessed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-variant-found-in-uk-16-cases-detected-so-far-what-we-know-101627210297146.html
25-07-2021||World||UNESCO defers downgrade of Australia's Great Barrier Reef||UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee has deferred its decision to downgrade the status of Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef after the Australian government managed to garner enough international support to get the decision postponed till at least next June.Also Read | UNESCO recommends Great Barrier Reef be listed 'in danger', Australia hints China’s handAddressing a virtual meeting on Friday, Sussan Ley, Australia's minister for environment, had said adding the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem to the list of “in danger” World Heritage sites, before the World Heritage Committee has finalised its own climate change policy, “makes no sense”. Ley said, “We ask for only two things: time for experts to see first-hand our commitment to the reef, and for the final climate policy to provide a consistent framework for addressing the impacts of climate change on all World Heritage properties.”Also Read | Great Barrier Reef downgraded: Other UN World Heritage sites in dangerA full-fledged adoption of the Australian-proposed amendments to the committee’s draft report, at a meeting held in China on Friday, would have postponed any possible downgrading till 2023. However, amendments moved by Norway put the Great Barrier Reef on the committee’s agenda for its next annual meeting, scheduled for June 2022. The proposal to downgrade the Great Barrier Reef’s status as a World Heritage site was moved in June this year. In a draft report, the World Heritage Committee had recommended that the reef’s status be downgraded to “in danger,” citing the damage caused to it due to climate change. However, reacting angrily to the proposed move, Australia had called it “flawed,” also hinting at the “politics behind it.”Once a heritage site is downgraded to “in danger,” it is just one step away from losing all World Heritage standing.Australia was first informed in 2014 that the downgrading of the reef to this listing was being considered, prompting the federal government to respond by developing a long-term initiative called the “Reef 2050 Plan.” However, in 2016, 2017 and 2020, the Great Barrier Reef suffered “significantly” from coral bleaching caused by unusually warm ocean temperatures. Two-thirds of the reef was damaged due to the coral bleaching.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unesco-defers-downgrade-of-australia-s-great-barrier-reef-101627205937728.html

Main opposition Conservatives had won 121 seats – and a larger share of the votes – in the 2019 polls.When Trudeau first became PM in 2015, he had come to power with a majority government, having then secured 184 seats.Canada’s next round of federal elections are scheduled for October 2023.Lately, his administration has been negotiating a wide range of issues in the build-up to a possible snap election this year, some which include his handling of the pandemic, administration of Covid-19 vaccines, economic recovery, recent discoveries of unmarked graves of indigenous children at former church school sites, and deaths from an unprecedented heatwave in western Canada.A new poll from the firm Ipsos, conducted for the outlet Global News, has concluded that “a Liberal majority is now in doubt given tight races in seat-rich provinces and only a six-point lead nationally”.Trudeau, however, is still in prime position to lead the next government, regardless of the number of seats his party wins if there’s a snap election.According to Ipsos, the ruling party has lost 2% support over the last one month, while the Conservatives have gained 4%. Trudeau’s party continues to lead by 36% support against 30% backing for the Conservatives. While 58% of the respondents are “closer to the opinion that it is time for a change in Ottawa”, if the 42% who believe Trudeau deserves re-election vote accordingly, Liberals “would cruise to a majority victory”.Another recent poll, conducted by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute (ARI), noted that the Trudeau administration’s “handling of the pandemic has been a relative strength for the Liberal government over the last year and a half. Now, just one-in-five (19%) identify it as a top issue, down from 45% in March”.According to the ARI survey, issues that are taking over voter consciousness include the climate crisis, economic recovery, size of the deficit, and indigenous issues, with the latter picking up “notable traction in recent months”.The ARI poll also places the two main parties in a “statistical tie”, with the Liberals at 33% and the Conservatives at 31%.A key challenge for Trudeau before he decides to go ahead with snap polls is gauging the mood of the voter base, which as of now seems not to favour federal elections. As much as 37% of the electorate is “upset at the thought of a fall election”, 34% is “unsure about it”, and just 26% is “happy” with the prospect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polls-show-trudeau-won-t-form-majority-govt-if-canada-holds-snap-polls-this-year-101627193184150.html

She developed a fever and cough on June 16 but did not seek medical attention until she was taken to National University Hospital on June 18, where she tested positive for Covid-19 the next day, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement.In a video posted on social media on Saturday, Prime Minister Lee said, “Don’t wait till it’s too late."“Most people your age are already vaccinated, including many of your friends and neighbours. Protect yourself, and your family too,” said the Prime Minister."There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent serious disease when one gets infected," the MOH added.Singapore reported 130 Covid-19 cases on Saturday, 127 of whom were from the community and three were imported (or people who arrived here from abroad).As of Saturday, Singapore has reported a total of 64,057 Covid-19 cases.A 27-year-old Indian national, who works as an engineer at Ecoxplore, and a 32-year-old Indonesian domestic worker are linked to one of the closed clusters, according to a Channel News Asia report.The MOH said the overall number of new cases in the community has increased from 238 in the week before to 1,027 cases in the past week.A total of 490 cases are in hospital, with most well and under observation. Six of the new cases are people above the age of 70 years who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated (first dose of injection) and are at risk of serious illness, the MOH added.Nine people above 60-years-old, who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, have fallen very ill, said the MOH.There are 12 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and one in critical condition in the intensive care unit. None of the 13 cases is fully vaccinated.Meanwhile, a popular Indian restaurant, Samy's Curry at Dempsey, has been shut for two weeks until August 8 for cleaning as it became a cluster of Covid-19 cases."Our epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission at the restaurant," media reports quoted the MOH.All staff at the restaurant have been placed on quarantine. Free Covid-19 tests will also be offered to people who had visited the restaurant between July 19 and 23.The MOH said all visitors to the Dempsey area, where a wide range of eateries and restaurants operate, should monitor their health closely and minimise social interactions as much as possible, for 14 days from their date of visit. They are encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.There are currently 26 active Covid-19 clusters in Singapore, ranging between three and 741 infections, according to the news channel's report.Over the last 28 days, 11 local cases required oxygen supplementation and were admitted to ICU or passed away. Six are unvaccinated, five are partially vaccinated and none was fully vaccinated.Mandatory Covid-19 testing is conducted across apartment blocks where coronavirus-linked cases are detected.This is done to uncover community infection cases, the MOH said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-pm-assures-senior-citizens-of-vaccine-safety-urges-them-to-get-jabbed-101627185129566.html

Alcala was 77 at the time of his death, the authorities confirmed in a statement, adding that he died of natural causes at the San Joaquin Valley Hospital.Alcala, dubbed "The Dating Game Killer", was sentenced to death in 2010 for five slayings in California between 1977 and 1979, including that of a 12-year-old girl. However, authorities suspect that he may have killed as many as 130 people across the country.Alcala's modus operandi was luring women by offering to take their pictures. He later strangled or beat his victims to death after sexually assaulting many of them.“There is murder and rape and then there is the unequivocal carnage of a Rodney Alcala-style murder,” the brother of an 18-year-old victim of the serial killer told the Associated Press, shortly after Alcala was sentenced to death.Investigators say his true victim count may never be known.Alcala received an additional 25 years to life in 2013 after pleading guilty to two homicides in New York. However, he was charged again in 2016 after DNA evidence connected him to the 1977 death of a 28-year-old woman whose remains were found in a remote area of southwest Wyoming.Alcala earned the moniker of "The Dating Game Killer" after appearing in 1978 as "Bachelor No 1" on an episode of "The Dating Game", an American television show where a "bachelorette" would be asked to accompany eligible "bachelors" on a date, with the roles being reversed occasionally.Although Alcala won the contest, the woman playing the bachelorette later decided not to go on a date with him because she found him "disturbing", according to several news reports.Authorities say Alcala continued killing even after he appeared on the television show. He stalked women like prey and took earrings as trophies from some of his victims, prosecutors said while presenting his case at the court.“You're talking about a guy who is hunting through Southern California looking for people to kill because he enjoys it,” Orange County, California, prosecutor Matt Murphy said during his trial. Two of his victims were posed nude after their deaths, one was raped with a claw hammer and all were repeatedly strangled and resuscitated to prolong their agony, prosecutors said.After the sentencing, authorities released more than 100 photos of young women and girls found in Alcala's possession in hopes of linking him to other unsolved murders around the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rodney-alcala-dating-game-killer-dies-in-california-hospital-101627178557236.html

"Now we're not energy independent," Trump said.Earlier this month, the OPEC countries decided to extend the agreement on oil production cuts until the end of 2022. The US does not participate in OPEC talks, but Washington has expressed support for the negotiations.Trump also criticized Biden for allowing the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project to go ahead, and laughed at claims of reported Russian involvement in the Hunter Biden laptop hack. "Russia did it again," Trump told the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit in Phoenix, pointing out that "it's always Russia" because "they are getting rich from China" but not from Russia.Trump also criticized the current administration in Washington for not doing enough to stop the spread of Covid-19 and once again blamed the pandemic on China, saying it should "pay us retribution."The former president reiterated his claim that the presidential elections last year were rigged, saying that the Democrats cheated with "millions of votes" in 2020. Trump called the election a "disgrace" and told the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit that "our nation is being destroyed."The former US president pointed to increasing violence and crime in the US, saying that defunding the police and weakening law enforcement is going to make the situation worse."Hundreds of people are being shot every weekend" in Chicago, Trump said, stressing that the city is "worse than any war zone." He also emphasized that crime rates are at unprecedented high in New York."We're becoming a communist country," Trump emphasized, adding that the current leadership is allowing the US to get "pushed around" by other countries.He said that the current administration is responsible for the influx of immigrants who continue crossing the southern border.Trump also criticized the Green New Deal (GND) on climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-criticises-biden-for-approach-to-energy-covid-internal-security-101627173536308.html

He also authorised the release of $200 million in services and articles from the inventories of US government agencies to meet the same needs.Separately, Pakistan has deployed regular troops at forward positions along the Afghan border due to the fluid security situation in the neighbouring war-torn country in the wake of the withdrawal of foreign troops, a media report said on Saturday.Interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said that Pakistan Army soldiers have replaced the Frontier Constabulary (FC), Levies Force and other militias from the frontline positions, the Dawn newspaper reported.Meanwhile, the embassy of India in Afghanistan on Saturday reiterated the June 29 security advisory for Indian nationals in the country, urging them to exercise the utmost caution with regard to their security.

Attendees carried signs and banners reading "Wake up Australia" and "Drain the Swamp".In France, where police deployed teargas and water cannon against some protesters, an estimated 160,000 took to the streets in nationwide protests against President Emmanuel Macron's health pass that will drastically curtail access to restaurants and public spaces for unvaccinated people.- 'Don't touch our children' -"Freedom, freedom", chanted demonstrators in France, carrying placards denouncing "Macron, Tyrant", "Big Pharma shackles freedom" or saying "No to the pass of shame".The demonstrations highlight the conflict globally between people caught between the advice of the World Health Organization and other public health agencies and the need to earn a living -- or simply to return to a pre-pandemic lifestyle.In Indonesia and the UK, governments have pressed ahead with easing of restrictions even in the face of surging.Meanwhile, around 5,000 people demonstrated in Athens, carrying placards touting slogans such as, "Don't touch our children", according to an AFP journalist at the scene.And in Italy protesters gathered in Rome to demonstrate against a mandatory "green pass" for indoor dining and entertainment.Earlier in Sydney, demonstrators pelted officers with pot plants and bottles of water as they defied a month-long stay-at-home order, a day after authorities suggested the restrictions could remain in place until October.New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was "utterly disgusted" by the protesters whose "selfish actions have compromised the safety of all of us".Police said they issued nearly 100 fines and arrested 57 people.In Melbourne, meanwhile, six people were arrested. police said.- 'Morons' -New South Wales Police Minister David Elliott said a team of detectives would be scouring footage to identify and charge as many people as possible in the coming days."Sydney isn't immune from morons," he said.Sydney, a city of over five million people, is struggling to contain an outbreak of the Delta variant, first identified in India and now spreading globally.After escaping much of the early pandemic unscathed, around half of Australia's 25 million people are now in lockdown across several cities.There is growing anger at the restrictions and the conservative government's failure to provide adequate vaccine supplies.Just 11 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.In France, as elsewhere in Europe, the government is making it harder for reluctant citizens to put off getting the jabs.Legislation now being considered by lawmakers will make vaccinations compulsory for certain professions, while the controversial health pass will severely restrict social life for holdouts from the end of July.There were signs the tougher measures announced on July 13 were having the desired effect: 48 percent of the population were fully vaccinated as of Friday, up eight percentage points from July 10.While more than three-quarters of French people backed Macron's measures, according to a July 13 Elabe poll for BFMTV, a sizeable and vocal minority do not. Elodie, 34, a care assistant at a Strasbourg nursing home, denounced "the blackmail of caregivers who were at the front line" during the first wave and who are now threatened" with "no more pay" and even being fired."They've been lying to us since the beginning," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-restrictions-over-delta-variant-trigger-protests-in-europe-australia-101627152365258.html
