The full set of data collected during these observations include far and extreme ultraviolet auroral emissions which have never been imaged before at Mars,” the Emirates Mars Mission said on June 30.These three images of atomic oxygen emission at a wavelength of 103.4 nm from the planet Mars were obtained by the Emirates Mars Ultraviolet Spectrometer instrument on 22 April, 23 April, and 06 May 2021 respectively. pic.twitter.com/YDFOAOm4etAurora on MarsUnlike on Earth, glows of aurora could be seen not just at the top and bottom but all around the Red Planet. This is largely because the molten iron in Mars' interior cooled and the magnetic field around had died out, according to a report by the New York Times (NYT). However, some parts in the planet’s crust, which hardened billions of years ago when Mars had a magnetic field, preserved some of the magnetism, causing the phenomenon, the NYT further explained.“It will allow new doors of study to be opened when it comes to the Martian atmosphere and how it interacts with the solar activity,” NYT quoted the UAE’s science lead for the first interplanetary mission Hessa al-Matroushi as saying on June 30.While taking pictures of the auroras was not part of the core observations planned for the Hope probe, its high-altitude orbit has enabled it to capture a global view of the night side of Mars too, the NYT further reported.Difference between Earth and MarsOn Earth, the aurora borealis and aurora australis are observed in the northern and southern polar regions respectively. It is caused when solar particles from the sun are deflected around the planet by its magnetic field, generating shimmering, glowing curtains of colour.However, on Mars, it can be observed all around the planet. This is because, the earth’s magnetic field is like one bar magnet, while in Mars “it’s more like you took a bag of magnets and dumped them into the crust of the planet,” Dr Justin Deighan of the University of Colorado’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics explained, the NYT reported.These disjointed magnetic fields act as lenses to direct the particles from the sun across the Martian atmosphere. Auroras are generated when these particles hit atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere, the report further showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uaes-hope-mars-mission-captures-new-photos-of-mars-auroras-shares-images-101625508154120.html

"We will move away from legal restrictions and allow people to make their own informed decisions about how to manage the virus," Reuters quoted Johnson as saying. "We must be honest with ourselves that if we can't reopen our society in the next few weeks when we will be helped by the arrival of summer and by the school holidays, then we must ask ourselves when will we be able to return to normal?" he added.The British government is set to end social and economic restrictions imposed to contain Covid-19 in England in two weeks, as the Prime Minister bets that the vaccination programme, which has weakened the link between infections and hospital admissions, deaths, can avoid the health services from getting overwhelmed by a new wave of the pandemic.Also read: UK must learn to live with Covid, says Johnson ahead of scrapping measuresUnder the new plans, nightclubs will be allowed to reopen without any limits on the capacity of hospitality venues. Social distancing norms will also be scrapped.Johnson also changed the vaccine policy and said that people aged below 40 years would be invited to take their second shot eight weeks after their first dose, rather than 12 weeks. He said this is the best time to ease the Covid curbs and that containment measures will be reimposed if necessary."I didn't want people to feel that this is, as it were, the moment to get demob happy ... it is very far from the end of dealing with this virus," Reuters quoted Johnson as saying, adding that if another variant comes up that doesn't respond to vaccines then necessary steps will be taken.Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer slammed the plan and said that some preventive measures are required to be imposed legally, like wearing os masks in public transport."Simply throwing off all protections when the infection rate is going up is reckless," Starmer said, reported Reuters.The new policy of Johnson's government is only for England, and not for Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.The vaccination programme in Britain has recorded to be strong with 86 per cent of adults vaccinated with the first dose, while 64 per cent have received both the does, as of Monday, Reuters cited government data. Public Health England indicated that the vaccines are highly effective in preventing the Delta variant from causing severe illness, especially after both doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-move-away-from-legal-restrictions-uk-pm-johnson-confirms-ending-covid-measures-101625504567054.html
05-07-2021||World||Eye on India: Chinese prez promotes border commander to rank of general||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday promoted four senior military officers including the commander of People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) western theatre command (WTC) ground forces to the rank of general.The WTC oversees the disputed Sino-India border, and is China’s largest theatre command. Commander of the PLA’s WTC Xu Qiling, 59, was among the four to have been promoted as general, Xinhua news agency reported.He reports to Gen Zhang Xudong, the overall head of the WTC.“Xi Jinping, chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), has promoted four senior military officers to the rank of general, the highest rank for officers in active service in China,” the Xinhua report said.Xi presented certificates of the orders he signed to them at a ceremony held by the CMC in Beijing on Monday.Besides Xu, the other officers promoted were the Commander of PLA’s Southern Theatre Command, Wang Xiubin, Commander of the PLA Army, Liu Zhenli, and the Commander of the PLA Strategic Support Force, Ju Qiansheng.“Xu Qiliang, CMC vice chairman, announced the orders of promotion at the ceremony, which was presided over by CMC vice chairman Zhang Youxia,” the report said.The promotion of Xu as general comes in the backdrop of the ongoing military tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Then a lieutenant general, Xu was appointed as the new commander of PLA’s ground forces in June, 2020, days ahead of the deadly Galwan Valley clash in which both Indian and Chinese soldiers were killed.The new appointment last year had come at a time when Chinese and Indian forces were already locked in a border standoff for weeks.Xu, a former ground force commander of the Eastern Theatre Command, swapped posts with his counterpart He Weidong in the WTC, in-charge of the disputed border areas in the Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous regions.Xu’s promotion comes ahead of the next round of military talks between India and China to resolve the border tension.On June 25, the two sides held the 22nd meeting of the China-India Border Consultation and Coordination Mechanism by video link.Representatives of the two countries’ foreign affairs, defence, immigration and other departments attended.According to statements issued by both sides, they exchanged candid and in-depth views on border issues and bilateral relations. They agreed to consolidate the results of the disengagement of border troops between the two sides and resolve the remaining issues in the western part of the China-India border in accordance with the consensus reached by the foreign ministers of the two countries.“The two sides will continue to work to promote further de-escalation of the situation at the border, avoid the recurrence of the situation on the ground, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas,” the Chinese statement said.The two sides also agreed to continue high-level diplomatic communication, provide further important guidance on the situation at the China-India border, and actively prepare for the 12th round of military-level talks to determine specific time and arrangements through the border hotline as soon as possible.On Monday, Xi also signed an order to confer an honorary counterterrorism title to a special operations squadron of the armed police force in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eye-on-india-chinese-prez-promotes-border-commander-to-rank-of-general-101625505311467.html
05-07-2021||World||Explained: What is conservatorship and why is Britney Spears under one||A Los Angeles court last week denied American pop star Britney Spears’ request to remove her from her father’s conservatorship or guardianship under which she has remained since 2008. The court’s formal ruling, however, is not related to the singer’s plea in court on June 24, calling for an end to the "abusive" conservatorship.The ruling on June 30 was in relation to a request last year by Spears’ lawyers to remove her father Jamie Spears from the conservatorship and add wealth management firm Bessemer Trust to the conservatorship. The judge approved the company to remain in charge alongside Jamie Spears. Bessemer Trust on July 1 asked the court to withdraw from the arrangement after Britney Spears opposed the conservatorship during her testimony earlier, further complicating the case.What is a conservatorship?A conservatorship is usually granted for individuals when they are considered to have a severely diminished mental capacity. The courts intervene in such cases and nominate someone, usually another person from the family, for deciding on financial matters and other major life choices.According to California’s law, for a “person who is unable to provide properly for his or her personal needs for physical health, food, clothing, or shelter” or for someone “substantially unable to manage his or her own financial resources or resist fraud or undue influence,” a conservatorship, also known as guardianship in some other states, is justified, the Associated Press reported.Why is Britney Spears under one?Following her divorce from Kevin Federline in 2007, concerns were raised about Spears’ mental welfare after several incidents. She notably shaved her head and hit a photographer’s car with an umbrella, according to multiple news reports. These along with her erratic behaviours following her divorce led her to lose custody of her two children.She also once refused to surrender her sons in a stand-off that involved the police and in 2008 was admitted to a hospital twice for a temporary psychiatric assessment ruling, according to the BBC.How does Spears’ conservatorship work?Since 2008, she has been under the arrangement wherein Jamie Spears has been responsible for her finances and estate and also for her as a person. In 2019, he stepped down citing health reasons and a care professional named Jodi Montgomery was appointed on a temporary basis.Also, confidential court records obtained by The New York Times (NYT) showed that the star opposed guardianship more frequently than known. “She feels the conservatorship has become an oppressive and controlling tool against her,” a court investigator wrote in a 2016 report according to the NYT. From who she dated to the colour of her kitchen cabinets, aspects of her life were restricted by the arrangement.However, in 2020 a judge named the Bessemer Trust as a co-conservator of her estates while declining to remove Jamie Spears. The conservatorship was extended until September 2021.#FreeBritney campaignMany fans of the singer disagree with the conservatorship agreement since early days and the #FreeBritney campaign obtained a new vigour in 2019 when she visited a mental health care centre citing emotional distress. She had also abruptly cancelled a Las Vegas residency and said that her father’s illness was the reason for her distress. Many people of the #FreeBritney movement also usually protest and demonstrate outside court hearings, according to the BBC.Alongside her fans, many celebrities also came out in support of the singer. Notably, her sister Jamie Lynn Spears on June 29, broke her silence regarding the issue and came out in support of Britney Spears.Britney Spears’ reactionSpears’ request in early 2021 for a hearing to address the court directly about the conservatorship was one of her open reactions to the issue. “I want to end this conservatorship without being evaluated,” BBC quoted Spears as saying during her address. “This conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good. I deserve to have a life,” she said while talking remotely to the court.While Jamie Spears’ lawyer said that he was “sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain,” the judge said that Britney Spears’ lawyer could file a petition to end the guardianship, according to the BBC report.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-is-conservatorship-and-why-is-britney-spears-under-one-101625504376740.html
05-07-2021||World||Surfside building collapse: 3 more bodies recovered as death toll rises to 27, search ops continue||Rescuers searched for victims of a collapsed South Florida condo building through fresh rubble Monday after crews set off a string of explosives that brought down the last of the structure, allowing search efforts to resume.Three more victims were discovered, Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah told family members, raising the death toll to 27 people. More than 115 people remain unaccounted for.The demolition opened up a previously inaccessible area for the search, though the chances of finding any survivors there waned, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said on NBC’s “Today."“We understand that families realize the fact that time has gone by, they realize that the chances are growing all dimmer,” she said. “They are with us, they know what we’ve been doing every step of the way.”Crews could be seen climbing a mound of debris at the site Monday alongside a piece of heavy equipment that was picking up rubble.Crews immediately began clearing some of the new debris after the demolition late Sunday so rescuers could start making their way into parts of the underground garage that is of particular interest. Officials said the search effort resumed before midnight.“As a result of the contractor who brought it down, he did it in such a way that literally we actually were back on the original pile in less than 20 minutes,” Jadallah told family members of those missing, drawing applause in a rare upbeat moment for the twice-daily meetings.Rescuers were hoping to get a clearer picture of voids that may exist in the rubble as they search for those believed to be trapped under the fallen wing of the Champlain Towers South in Surfside that collapsed June 24.No one has been rescued alive since the first hours after the collapse. On Sunday, Miami-Dade police identified David Epstein, 58, as one of the 27 people known to have perished in the fallen tower. His remains were recovered Friday.During the demolition, a loud rat-at-tat of explosions echoed from the structure. Then the building began to fall, one floor after another, cascading into an explosion of dust. Plumes billowed into the air, as crowds watched the scene from afar.Levine Cava told the Associated Press that the demolition went “exactly as planned” around 10:30 p.m. Sunday.“It was picture perfect. Exactly what we were told would happen,” she said in an interview shortly after the demolition.Some residents had pleaded to return to their homes one last time before the demolition to retrieve belongings left in haste, but were denied. Others wondered about the pets left behind, even though officials said they found no signs of animals after making three final sweeps, including the use of drones to peer into the abandoned structure.Levine Cava said teams are working to save any personal items they can. “We have been asking them to go ahead and catalog all of their precious belongings so that as soon as they are recovered, we’ll be able to make a match.”The decision to demolish the remnants of the Surfside building came after concerns mounted that the damaged structure was at risk of falling, endangering the crews below and preventing them from operating in some areas. Parts of the remaining building shifted on Thursday, prompting a 15-hour suspension in the work.Approaching Tropical Storm Elsa had added urgency to the demolition plans with forecasts suggesting the system could bring strong winds. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in Florida because of the storm, making federal aid possible.The latest forecasts have moved the storm westward, mostly sparing South Florida, but the area could still feel effects.Authorities had gone door-to-door to advise nearby residents of the timing of the demolition, and to ask them to keep windows closed. They were told to stay inside until two hours after the blast to avoid the dust raised by the implosion.The method used for Sunday night’s demolition is called “energetic felling,” which uses small detonation devices and relies on the force of gravity. The goal was to bring in the building down in place, containing the collapse to the immediate surroundings.Officials used tarps to visually mark the search area, in case new debris scattered unexpectedly.State officials said they hired the BG Group, a general contractor based in Delray Beach, Florida, to lead the demolition. They did not immediately respond to an inquiry about how the firm was selected, but a contract for the project calls for the state to pay the company $935,000.A spokesperson for the state’s Division of Emergency Management said the company subcontracted with Maryland-based Controlled Demolition Inc., which experts say is among only a handful of companies in the U.S. that demolishes structures using explosives.___Associated Press writers Bobby Caina Calvan in Tallahassee; Sudhin Thanawala in Atlanta, Freida Frisaro in Fort Lauderdale and Ian Mader in Miami contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surfside-building-collapse-3-more-victims-recovered-as-death-toll-rises-to-27-search-continues-for-hundreds-unaccounted-101625496149917.html

They also said that upon receiving the $70 million in Bitcoin, they would post a decryption tool online with which “everyone will be able to recover from attack in less than an hour,” news agency AFP reported, citing the blog. HT has not individually verified the blog post.Allan Liska of the cybersecurity firm said that the message “almost certainly” came from the core leadership of REvil as the affiliate structure of the gang makes it sometimes difficult to identify who communicates from the hackers’ side, according to a Reuters report.Also read | Russian ransomware group strikes again, affects 800 stores in SwedenWhat happened at Kaseya?The network of Kaseya, a Miami-based Information Technology (IT) service provider, was breached by the hackers using which they accessed some of their clients’ clients. This was used to kick-off a chain reaction which then crippled many computers at hundreds of firms worldwide.A company executive also said that they were aware of the demand for ransom without commenting further, Reuters reported without naming the executive.Following the breach, Kaseya, on Sunday, said that the damage has been restricted to “a very small number of customers” using their VSA software in managing the network of computers and other resources such as printers from a single point. Also, it said that their servers were immediately shutdown on detecting the breach on Friday and warned its customers using VSA to do the same “to prevent them from being compromised,” according to news agency AFP. A tool to detect if the customers’ computers have been compromised was also released by the company.Impact of the attackMore than 10 countries have been affected by the attack according to a report by the security researchers at ESET, an internet security company.While much of the impact is yet to be uncovered, Swedish supermarket chain Coop was one of the high-profile customers impacted as a “majority” of their 800 stores still closed three days after the attack, the AFP reported. Kevin Bell, spokesperson for Coop, said that the situation was looking “positive compared to a few days ago” and the hack has paralysed the cash registers at the outlets. Also alternate payment methods have been used largely in those stores that had reopened after the attack, he further said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kaseya-ransomware-attack-hackers-demand-70-million-ransom-to-restore-data-of-affected-companies-shows-report-101625494652764.html

Officials planned to release their names, hoping that perhaps some were away when the disaster struck, since many of the apartments and houses in Atami are second homes or vacation rentals.Initially, 147 people were unreachable, but that number was revised downward after officials confirmed some had safely evacuated or were simply not at home. In addition to the four people found dead, officials said 25 people have been rescued, including three who were injured.The disaster is an added trial as authorities prepare for the Tokyo Olympics, due to start in less than three weeks, while Japan is still in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, with cases steadily climbing in the capital and experts suggesting a need for another state of emergency.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters that rescue workers are doing their utmost “to rescue those who may be buried under the mud and waiting for help as soon as possible." Three coast guard ships, and six military drones were backing up hundreds of troops, firefighters and others toiling in the rain and fog.The landslide occurred Saturday mid-morning after days of heavy rain in Atami, which like many seaside Japanese towns is built into a steep hillside. It tore through the Izusan neighborhood, known for its hot springs, a shrine and shopping streets. The town has a registered population of 36,800 and is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Tokyo.Shizuoka Gov. Heita Kawakatsu, who inspected the area Monday where the mudslide was believed to have started, said rain soaked into the mountainside apparently weakening the ground under a massive pile of soil at a construction site that then slid down the slope.The prefecture is investigating. Media reports said a planned housing development in the area was abandoned after its operator ran into financial problems.Witnesses described a giant roar as a small stream turned into a torrent, and bystanders were heard gasping in horror on cellphone videos taken as it happened.Naoto Date, an actor who was visiting Izusan, was awakened by sirens. His neighborhood is now awash in muddy water with rescuers wading through knee-deep sludge. Just blocks from his home, some houses have been completely washed away, with only their foundations still visible. Mangled traffic signs stick out from the mud. At the seafront, he saw cars floating along with debris from destroyed homes.“I grew up here, and my classmates and friends live here. I’m so sad to see my neighborhood where I used to play with my friends is now destroyed,” Date told The Associated Press by videocall from his home in Atami.While Date's mother, who was staying next door, has moved to a hotel along with other evacuees, the actor said he was staying away from evacuation centers because he is concerned about the coronavirus.The Izusan area is one of 660,000 locations in Japan identified as prone to mudslides by the government, but those designations are not widely publicized and public awareness is low. Early July, near the end of Japan's rainy season, is often a time of deadly flooding and mudslides, and many experts say the rains are worsening due to climate change.With other parts of the country expecting heavy downpours, authorities were urging people near hillsides in areas at risk to use caution. Public broadcaster NHK carried a program Monday about risk factors and warning signs that might precede a landslide.A year ago, flooding and mudslides triggered by heavy rain in Kumamoto and four other prefectures in the Kyushu region in southern Japan left nearly 80 people dead. In July 2018, hillsides in crowded residential areas in Hiroshima collapsed, leaving 20 dead. In 2017, mudslides and flooding in the Kyushu region killed 40.Miyoko Okamoto, an employee at a care home for the elderly, said the mudslide came close to but narrowly missed her house. She and her son ran out of the house, while her husband, a community association leader, escorted neighbors to safer ground.Okamoto said she hasn't been back home since fleeing because she is helping residents at the care home. “We were lucky to have survived, and that's most important," she said.But her neighbor is still looking for his wife. “They are good friends of ours," she said, "and that pains my heart.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-dead-search-on-for-dozens-missing-in-mudslide-at-atami-japan-101625489920590.html

This new measure is meant especially for adolescents and men below the ages of 30, reported Bloomberg.This preventive measure comes after a vaccinated 16-year-old boy suffered a cardiac arrest while lifting weights at a gym. Authorities are investigating to determine if there’s any link between his sudden cardiac arrest and Covid-19 vaccination. Previously, an advisory to avoid exercise in the 12-24 hour period after vaccination was in place.The boy, who was inoculated with his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on June 27, collapsed on July 3 after lifting some very heavy weights, reported Bloomberg. “The preliminary diagnosis of his condition is an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Clinical and laboratory tests are in progress to understand the underlying cause,” the health ministry said in a statement.The expert committee tasked with advising the Singaporean government on vaccination urged for the drive to be continued, insisting that the protective benefits offered by the vaccine outweighs the risk it possesses. A similar stance had been adopted by both Israel and the United States where a few cases of myocarditis had been reported from amongst young male recipients of the Pfizer vaccines. All three countries have been relying on mRNA vaccines for their inoculation program.Health authorities also disclosed to the press that 12 reports of heart problems in vaccinated individuals have cropped up in the island nation, 7 out of these 12 people are males aged 30 years and below. The 16-year old is being kept under observation by the health ministry, which is conducting tests to determine the reason for his collapse. The tests “will include a thorough consideration of whether there was acute severe myocarditis, which is severe inflammation of the heart muscles affecting the heart function, as a possible diagnosis,” the ministry said in an official statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-advises-people-to-avoid-exercising-for-a-week-after-vaccination-101625488534999.html

Kensington Palace said the Duchess "came into contact with someone who has subsequently tested positive".“Her Royal Highness is not experiencing any symptoms, but is following all relevant government guidelines and is self-isolating at home," a Kensington Palace spokesperson said.Kate's last public event was a visit to Wimbledon on Friday in her role as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club and a keen tennis fan. On Friday, she toured the sporting venue to meet staff in the museum, Centre Court kitchen and sitting with former England tennis star Tim Henman to watch Jamie Murray play in the doubles game.She began self-isolating on Friday after being alerted that afternoon that she had come into contact with someone who later tested positive, but it is not known if the NHS app made her aware. The tennis fan is now likely to miss the men's and women's Wimbledon final at the weekend.According to UK media reports, the 39-year-old, who has received both of her Covid vaccine doses, follows the royal household testing regime and takes lateral flow tests twice a week.She had been due to attend a service at St Paul's Cathedral in London to celebrate the 73rd anniversary of the NHS, which will now be attended by Prince William. The couple were also to host a Big Tea event at Buckingham Palace, which William is set to cover solo.Prince William contracted Covid-19 last year in April and was able to carry on with telephone and online engagements while he was treated by royal doctors. His father, the Prince of Wales, also tested positive for Covid-19 around the same time last year with mild symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kate-middleton-quarantines-after-contact-with-covid-positive-at-wimbledon-101625485733541.html

Saravanan said the government is taking the downgrade seriously and has ramped up efforts to battle human trafficking, including increased prosecution for companies involved in forced labor.The US State Department’s annual “Trafficking in Persons” report, released July 2, cited the coronavirus pandemic as contributing to a surge in human slavery between 2020 and 2021.It said Malaysia, which had been on a watchlist for three years, was downgraded to Tier 3 for failing to meet minimal standards for the elimination of trafficking and was not making significant efforts to do. Malaysia joins more than a dozen other countries including China, Russia and North Korea.The downgrade means that without a US presidential waiver, Malaysia could lose some US assistance, although decisions on such penalties will not be made until later this year.Some Malaysian rubber glove makers and palm oil plantations have come under scrutiny over allegations of forced labor. The US has banned products from the world’s largest glove maker, Top Glove, as well as plantation giants FGV Holdings Berhad and Sime Darby Berhad due to allegations of forced labor and other abuses. FGV is partially owned by the government.The US report said Malaysia continued to conflate human trafficking and migrant smuggling, which impeded anti-trafficking law enforcement and victim identification efforts. It said Malaysia failed to adequately address or criminally pursue credible allegations of labor trafficking, including in the rubber manufacturing industry and palm oil sector.The report also said Malaysia pursued cases of forced labor as disparate labor law violations instead of criminal cases of human trafficking or failed to investigate them at all.Saravanan said the government will study costs imposed by recruitment agencies to ensure there are no hidden charges that could lead to worker exploitation and debt bondage. To boost workers’ welfare, he said employers will now have to pay for social security for all domestic helpers.To tackle forced labor, he said the government has set up a mobile application called Working for Workers since May to allow foreign workers to make direct complaints to labor offices. So far, 4,636 complaints have been made, of which 3,502 have been investigated and action taken, he said.Saravanan said the government is working with the International Labor Organization to draw up an action plan to address the issue of forced labor and child labor by the fourth quarter this year.“The ministry will implement various improvements in addition to existing initiatives to address challenges in labor issues,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-pledges-to-tackle-forced-labor-after-us-downgrades-ranking-in-trafficking-in-persons-report-101625486534382.html

Total cases stand at 944,917.Hospitals are overwhelmed with coronavirus patients, particularly in districts bordering India where the Delta variant was first identified. Bangladesh sealed its border with India in April, but trade continues.A surge in cases had prompted the government to order a week of tight controls on Thursday, with army troops patrolling streets.All measures have been extended, the government said in a statement. The shutdown has sparked an exodus of migrant workers from the capital Dhaka to home villages.Factories are allowed to operate observing health protocols while all offices and transportation remain shut expect essential goods carriers and ambulances.Some workers are finding it difficult to survive without any income coming in."During the lockdown, there is no work. If this continues, I don't know how I feed my family," said Mohammad Manik, father of two, who works as a day labourer at a kitchen market in Dhaka."It is not the coronavirus but hunger that will kill us."Bangladesh received 2.5 million doses of Moderna Inc's vaccine from the United States under the COVAX global-sharing scheme over the weekend. It also received two million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine from China.Bangladesh's vaccination drive suffered a blow after India stopped exports of the AstraZeneca shot in response to a record surge in domestic infections, with only 3% its population of 170 million so far receiving the required two doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-extends-all-covid-19-restrictions-to-july-14-as-cases-surge-101625485994674.html

Johnson, who has said Covid-19 is an enemy to be vanquished, is expected to scrap mandatory mask-wearing and social distancing in England in two weeks, despite the surge in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections owing to the highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus.Boris Johnson, in a televised news conference, signaled the replacement of mandatory preventive measures to be transformed into a matter of personal choice after July 19, the date called "freedom day" by Britain's populist press. “As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgment when going about our lives,” AP quoted Johnson as saying.Also read: Covid-19 data looks 'very positive' for lifting lockdown, says UK ministerWhile the message is expected to be welcomed by lockdown-sceptic lawmakers in Boris Johnson's Conservative Party, public health officials and scientists have urged caution against such scrapping of measures. They have said that the scrapping of preventive measures is dangerous.Psychologist Stephen Reicher, a member of the UK government’s scientific advisory committee, said “proportionate mitigations” against the spread of the virus should remain put, as per an AP report. “I think we need very clear messaging and I think in certain spaces — crowded, badly ventilated spaces — masks are crucial mitigation,” Reicher told BBC, as per AP.The government said Boris Johnson will address a news conference on Monday to announce the plans for rules on social distancing, wearing of masks and working from home after July 19, which is the date set for the removal of remaining restrictions on business and daily life.The government said in a statement that Covid-19 would “become a virus that we learn to live with as we already do with flu. This means that hospitalisations, serious illness and deaths from Covid will continue, albeit at a much lower level than before the vaccination program.”The British government, which imposed the longest lockdown in the world, has eased restrictions for England in a gradual manner beginning from the reopening of schools in March. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are following their own process of unlocking.According to public health officials, the vaccination program in Britain has weakened the link between infections and fatalities. To date, 86 per cent of UK adults have received the first dose of the vaccine and 63 per cent of the adults are fully vaccinated.(With inputs from AP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-must-learn-to-live-with-covid-says-johnson-ahead-of-scrapping-preventive-measures-101625479737897.html

Bruni also said that the Pope is to remain in the hospital for about seven more days “barring complications,” AP reported.Earlier on Monday, the Vatican News said that Pope Francis “reacted well” to a surgical operation that he underwent on Sunday evening. He was admitted at the A Gemelli hospital in Rome, usually reserved for popes, for diverticular stenosis of the colon. “Admitted in the afternoon to the A. Gemelli Hospital, the Holy Father underwent surgery in the evening for a diverticular stenosis of the colon,” said Matteo Bruni, director of the Holy Sees Press Office.“The Holy Father reacted well to the surgery done under general anaesthesia and performed by Prof Sergio Alfieri, assisted by Prof Luigi Sofo, Dr Antonio Tortorelli and Dr Roberta Megnhi,” Bruni further said briefing on the Pope’s condition and the medical team that attended to him during the surgery. “Anaesthesia was administered by Prof Massimo Antonelli, Prof Liliana Sollazzi, Dr Roberto De Cicco, and Dr Maurizio Soave. Also present in the operating room were Prof Giovanni Battista Doglietto and Prof Roberto Bernabei,” he added. The Vatican is also expected to update twice a day on the condition of the head of the Catholic church.Also read | Pope meets 'super-hero' Spider-Man at Vatican, gets a maskHowever, there was no further information shared about the duration of the surgery and also on how long the Pope would remain in the hospital. According to a news report by the Associated Press, the recovery from the surgery usually requires several days in the hospital.What is diverticular stenosis ?The diverticular stenosis of the colon, for which the pontiff underwent surgery, is the condition where the colon becomes narrow due to sac-like protrusions emerging from the muscular layer of the colon, according to Reuters. Elderly people are more prone to the condition, which can cause bloating, inflammation and difficulty in bowel movements along with causing pain.Harvard Health calls diverticulosis one of the most common medical conditions in the United States. It names diet, especially the refinement of carbohydrates, as one of the major reasons for the condition.Other health conditionsThe 84-year-old pontiff had a part of his lungs removed after an illness during his young age in his native Argentina, due to which he is sometimes short of breath. The Pope also suffers from Sciatica that causes him pain, radiating from the lower back to the sciatic nerves in the legs. He also receives physiotherapy for the same, which has led to difficulty in walking and forced the Pope to cancel some events at the beginning of this year.In 2014, a year after Francis was elected the Pope, he was forced to cancel many engagements due to what was believed to be a stomach ailment.(With inputs from Vatican News, Associated Press and Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-alert-in-good-condition-after-surgery-to-remain-in-hospital-for-7-days-vatican-101625481293761.html
05-07-2021||World||Luxembourg PM Xavier Bettel hospitalised after testing positive for Covid-19||Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel has been hospitalised and is under observation “as a precautionary measure” after testing positive for Covid-19 a week earlier.A government official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity, said there was no update with new information early Monday after Bettel had been taken in for 24 hours of testing and medical analysis on Sunday.The 48-year-old Bettel announced his positive test just after he had attended an European Union summit with 26 other leaders from the bloc for two days. At first he experienced only mild symptoms. But on Sunday, he had to be hospitalized. Bettel had received one Covid-19 vaccine dose in May and had been scheduled to get his second AstraZeneca shot on July 1.“It was unfortunate that he tested positive just before that,” the official said.EU summit organizers said they were confident that all virus precaution measures had been strictly adhered to during the two-day meeting. So far, no other leader has said he or she tested positive.EU leaders have been grappling with the dangers of transmitting the virus during one of their many meetings for over a year now. Most of their summits have been held through videoconference and only when essential issues were dealt with that needed long in-person negotiations did the leaders convene at EU headquarters.Last summer, a four-day summit on the budget and Covid-19 recovery plans was held at the Europa building, but with maximum social distancing. Many of the toughest negotiating sessions were even held on a sundeck in open air atop the summit building to reduce the risk of transmission even further.The two-day summit that ended 10 days ago dealt with a series of pressing issues, but was highlighted by a tussle between Hungary and most of the other EU nations on LGBT issues. Bettel, who is married to a man, took center stage in defending the rights of LGBT people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/luxembourg-pm-xavier-bettel-hospitalised-after-testing-positive-for-covid19-101625480854031.html

It offers over 20 million rides in China every day.“Investigations concluded the app severely violated relevant laws and regulations while collecting and abusing user data,” the administration was quoted as saying by the news agency Xinhua.“The administration urged the ride-hailing company to take concrete measures to fix the loopholes in accordance with the law and national standards to ensure the safety of user information,” the Xinhua report said.Chinese state media reported that the latest order further underscored “Chinese regulators’ resolve to crack down on illegal activities on online platforms and enhance the protection of data security”.A widespread regulatory squeeze on domestic tech firms, focusing on anti-competitive behaviour and data security began with the scuttling of a $37 billion listing planned by Alibaba affiliate Ant Group late last year.“The company expects that the app’s takedown may have an adverse impact on its revenue in China,” Didi said in a statement.Reckoning the review as a timely move to institute a firewall to ensure data security, which is of significance to national security, Dong Shaopeng from Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China called for delisting of Didi’s newly floated shares.“Ride-hailing firms manage large amounts of data regarding national transport infrastructure, flows of people and vehicles, among other types of information that involve national security,” Dong told the tabloid Global Times.The rise of “data sovereignty” versus the US government’s vigilance against Chinese firms ought to be a wake-up call for national security awareness to be given priority when it comes to fundraising plans in areas that might pose threats to China’s national security, Dong said.Didi’s global annual active users for the one-year period ending March 31 stood at 493 million, according to the company.Founded in 2012, the company offers a range of app-based services across Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa, as well as in Central Asia and Russia, including ride-hailing, taxi-hailing, chauffeur services, hitching services and other forms of shared transport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-puts-brakes-on-didi-app-downloads-over-data-violation-charges-101625473809507.html

And that's the reason why it's all the more sad and all the more tragic why it isn't being completely implemented in this country.”Fauci cited the reasons for opposition to the vaccine by some Americans, whether it's “ideological” or whether some “are just fundamentally anti-vax or anti-science.” He said the country does “have the tools to counter” the pandemic and he's asking people to “put aside all of those differences and realize that the common enemy is the virus.”He noted that the United States is very fortunate that it has enough vaccines to vaccinate essentially everybody in the country. And there are people throughout the world who would do anything to get vaccines.The United States has registered over 605,000 deaths in the Covid-19 pandemic, the highest national toll in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-99-of-covid-19-deaths-in-us-are-unvaccinated-people-fauci-101625470025344.html

The death sentence was declared unconstitutional in South Africa in 1995,” Zuma, 79, said while addressing a press briefing at his homestead in Nkandla. For the past several days, scores of Zuma’s supporters have been camping outside his homestead to express solidarity.During Sunday’s briefing, Zuma repeatedly ignored questions from journalists with regard to reprimanding his supporters who were flouting Covid-19 lockdown rules. They were also seen brandishing weapons and threatened to resort to violence if their beloved leader was jailed.The Constitutional Court on Saturday agreed to hear an application by Zuma to rescind the judgement where the former president cited his age, health condition and other unspecified reasons, PTI further reported. The hearing will now take place on July 12. Earlier, the court on June 29 found Zuma guilty of violating the order to testify before Chief Justice Raymond Zondo.Zuma, meanwhile, said that he was unfairly convicted by the court, adding he feared that the country’s judicial system was being compromised. “I’m very concerned that South Africa is fast sliding back to apartheid-type rule. I am facing a long detention without trial,” Zuma told reporters on Sunday.Jacob Zuma was the fourth democratically elected president of South Africa. He has been facing an enquiry probing wide-ranging allegations of corruption when he was serving in the top governmental post from 2009 to 2018The government estimates show that during his tenure, over 500 billion rand (around $35 billion) were stolen from state officers. Several witnesses who have testified before an inquiry headed by acting Chief Justice Zondo, have placed Jacob Zuma at the centre of the looting spree, according to Bloomberg.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sending-me-to-jail-during-covid-same-as-death-sentence-jacob-zuma-101625465310503.html
05-07-2021||World||Who is Andy Jassy? The man who will take over Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO||On Monday, Andy Jassy, who is serving as the chief of Amazon Web Services (AWS) will take over from Jeff Bezos as the new CEO of the one of the world’s biggest tech giants. Recruited at Amazon way back in 1997, Jassy is known among his colleagues and subordinates as someone who is unassuming and easy to connect, according to a Bloomberg report.At the same time, Jassy has the competitive bone and apprehension of conventional wisdom similar to that of Bezos. He goes hard by Amazon’s corporate religion – put customers first, move fast, and be frugal, the Bloomberg report added.How Jassy is with his colleagues and subordinates?Andy Jassy worked with Bezos and other executives to form Amazon’s guiding principles, and in fact, followed them to the T – thereby paving way to Amazon’s writing and data-driven culture, Bloomberg reported. According to Jassy’s current and former colleagues, during weekly operational and product reviews with the boss, Jassy’s questions often address weak areas in a proposal or projections that presenters didn’t completely thought through.However, the employees said that even while criticising, Jassy never makes any personal attacks, the Bloomberg report added.Jassy enjoys pushing impossible-seeming deadlines, the report stated, but several Amazon employees said that the new CEO often sought to connect with them on a rather personal level by striking up conversations around music, indie movies and sports.As part of Amazon Music’s early days that Jassy was a part of, he would often host silly games that brought out his team’s competitiveness, said Cast who supervised Jassy on the music team. “He’s just very, very competitive,” Cast was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.Furthermore, Jassy is heavily involved in Amazon’s daily operations, which even include editing press releases and marketing materials, assisting in naming products and also giving opinions on setting prices. The Bloomberg report stated that Jassy also monitors Twitter.Some employees have even said, the report added, that winning Jassy’s nod for documents can be a bottleneck and that they spend weeks or months getting them “Andy-ready”.What challenges do Jassy have before him?Andy Jassy, who will be taking over from Bezos, has a worth of roughly $500 million, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. According to the Bloomberg report, Jassy has learnt to take the long view from the outgoing CEO Jeff Bezos. His new role comes amid Amazon facing European inquiries into its usage of stellar data, proposed US legislation that would force the firm to split its logistics wing from its retail website, and a District of Columbia antitrust lawsuit that alleges that the company raised prices on customers.After Jassy takes over, his focus will not only be on adding more loyal Amazon Prime members and to augment the AWS’s share of technology expenditure, but also on how he leads the company through all the inquiries and antitrust lawsuit.How Jassy has responded to issues beyond the Amazon walls?Last December, at an Amazon’s cloud conference, Jassy said that Amazon would do its part in addressing systemic racism in the USA. His statement had come several months after a black Amazon employee sued the company over claims of gender and racial discrimination, Bloomberg reported.“The reality is for the last several hundred years, the way we treated Black people in this country is disgraceful and something that has to change,” he told during the virtual meet, Bloomberg reported.At the event, Jassy spoke about the murder of three Black Americans, and the society in general after his acknowledgement of the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the report further stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-andy-jassy-the-man-who-will-take-over-jeff-bezos-as-amazon-ceo-101625464870150.html

05-07-2021||World||Explosives set off to bring down rest of collapsed condo in Florida; 121 still missing||Demolition crews set off explosives late Sunday to bring down the damaged remaining portion of a collapsed South Florida condo building, a key step to resuming the search for victims as rescuers possibly gain access to new areas of the rubble.A number of explosions could be heard and then the building started to fall, sending up massive plumes of dust into the air in the surrounding neighborhoods.Crews were to begin clearing some of the new debris so rescuers could start making their way into parts of the underground garage that is of particular interest. Once there, they were hoping to get a clearer picture of voids that may exist in the rubble and could possibly harbor survivors.The precarious, still-standing portion of a collapsed structure was rigged with explosive charges and set for demolition, after suspending the search-and-rescue mission.Through the night, rescuers were awaiting the “all-clear” after the demolition so they could dive back into the task of trying to locate any survivors buried under the rubble. Officials had previously said that the search could resume from 15 minutes to an hour after the detonation.“We are standing by. We are ready to go in, no matter the time of night,” Levine Cava told a news conference earlier Sunday night.No one has been rescued alive since the first hours after the June 24 collapse.Rescuers are hoping the demolition will give them access for the first time to parts of the garage area that are a focus of interest. Once a new pathway into the initial rubble is secure, “we will go back to the debris pile, and we’ll begin our search and rescue efforts,” Miami-Dade Fire Chief Albert Cominsky said.The decision to demolish the Surfside building came after concerns mounted that the damaged structure was at risk of falling, endangering the crews below and preventing them from operating in some areas. Parts of the remaining building shifted on Thursday, prompting a 15-hour suspension in the work. An approaching storm added urgency to the concerns.“I truly believe ... that the family members recognize and appreciate that we are proceeding in the best possible fashion to allow us to do the search that we need to do,” Levine Cava said.Jadallah told family members Sunday afternoon that the demolition had been scheduled for between 10 p.m. Sunday and 3 a.m. Monday, barring any last-minute glitch such as someone straying into the restricted zone around the building. Levine Cava later confirmed that time frame.The remaining portion of the building came down around 10:30 p.m.The mayor said residents in the area were told to stay inside until two hours after the blast to avoid the dust raised by the explosion. Local authorities had gone door-to-door to advise them of the timing, and to ask them to keep windows closed.The search at the Surfside building has been suspended since Saturday afternoon so workers could begin the drilling work and lay the explosives. Officials said the suspension was necessary because the drilling could cause the structure to fail.So far, rescuers have recovered the remains of 24 people, with 121 still missing. Many others barely escaped. The Miami-Dade Police Department on Saturday night added Graciela Cattarossi, 48, and Gonzalo Torre, 81, to the list of those confirmed dead.Approaching Tropical Storm Elsa has added urgency to the demolition plans with forecasts suggesting there could be strong winds in the area by Monday. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in Florida because of the storm, making federal aid possible.The latest forecasts have moved the storm westward, mostly sparing South Florida, but National Hurricane Center meteorologist Robert Molleda said the area could still feel effects.“We’re expecting primarily tropical storm force gusts,” Molleda said, referring to gusts above 40 mph (64 kph).The detonation will aim to bring the remaining portion of the building straight down and toward the street side, away from the existing pile of debris, said Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah.The method of demolition is called “energetic felling,” which uses small detonation devices and relies on the force of gravity. Levine Cava said that should bring the building down in place, containing the collapse to the immediate surroundings so as to minimally disturb the existing mound of debris — where scores of people are believed to be trapped.Officials used tarps to visually mark the search area, in case new debris scatters unexpectedly.State officials said they hired the BG Group, a general contractor based in Delray Beach, Florida, to lead the demolition. They did not immediately respond to an inquiry about how the firm was selected, but a contract for the projects calls for the state to pay the company $935,000.A spokesperson for the state’s Division of Emergency Management said the company is subcontracting with Maryland-based Controlled Demolition Inc., which experts say is among only a handful of companies in the U.S. that demolishes structures using explosives. The company was supposed to place explosives on the basement and lobby levels of the still-standing structure, according to the contract for the work.CDI is “probably one of the best” in the industry, said Steve Schwartz, a member of the National Demolition Association’s board of directors. He described the company’s president and owner, Mark Loizeaux, as “cool, calm and collected.”In implosions — using explosives to have a building fall in on itself — the charges are generally set off in rapid succession over a matter of seconds, said Scott Homrich, who heads the National Demolition Association and runs his own demolition company in Detroit, Michigan. Setting the explosives off at intervals serves to break up the building at the same time it’s coming down.Officials acknowledged that the tragedy is continuing to unfold during the July 4th holiday.“This July 4 we’re reminded that patriotism isn’t just about loyalty to country,” said Levine Cava. “It’s about loyalty to one another — to our communities, to those in need whose names or stories we may not know ever, but to whom we are connected by compassion and by resilience.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosives-set-off-to-bring-down-rest-of-collapsed-condo-in-florida-101625456836623.html

The call has been given by Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), which claims that the bill has provisions that target press freedom in the Punjab region.The PFUJ is an umbrella organisation of all journalist unions in the country.As per a statement from PFUJ, all unions of journalists will organise rallies and hoist black flags at press clubs to protest against the bill described as a "brutal" piece of law, local media reported. The unions have also announced a rally outside the governor house in the Punjab.They are demanding the government a rollback of the bill. They have also called upon provincial government (in Balochistan) to take steps against the "undemocratic action".As per local media reports, the amendment bill has a provision of three-month imprisonment or a fine of ₹10,000, or both, for publishing any report on the proceedings or a report of a committee before it was reported to the assembly. While the journalists say that the bill would undermine the freedom of the press, the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government as well as opposition parties supports it.The journalists say that the bill is "fascist tactics" employed by the Balochistan provincial government to prevent the media from covering a press conference of opposition leaders in the city, as per local media reports. "Sledgehammer tactics against the journalists would not be tolerated at any cost," said PFUJ president Shahzada Zulfiqar and secretary-general Nasir Zaidi in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalists-in-pakistan-to-protest-against-law-curbing-press-freedom-in-punjab-101625456172214.html

The mayor and other officials reminded residents of other nearby buildings to remain in their homes from three hours before the demolition window until two hours afterward, and advised them to keep all doors and windows closed because of the potential for heavy dust.Responding to concerns of missing pets, Levine Cava said she had made it “a priority since Day 1 to do absolutely everything possible to search for every animal.”She said Miami-Dade fire rescue team members had conducted three full sweeps of Champlain Towers South, including searching in closets and under beds, but “the latest information we have is that there are no animals remaining in the building.”The search at the Surfside building has been suspended since Saturday afternoon so workers could begin the drilling work and lay the explosives. Jadallah said the suspension was necessary because the drilling could cause the structure to fail, but a family member could be heard calling the delay “devastating.”So far, rescuers have recovered the remains of 24 people, with 121 still missing. Many others barely escaped. The Miami-Dade Police Department on Saturday night added Graciela Cattarossi, 48, and Gonzalo Torre, 81, to the list of those confirmed dead.Approaching Tropical Storm Elsa has added urgency to the demolition plans with forecasts suggesting there could be strong winds in the area by Monday. The latest forecasts have moved the storm westward, mostly sparing South Florida, but National Hurricane Center meteorologist Robert Molleda said the area could still feel effects.“We’re expecting primarily tropical storm force gusts," Molleda said, referring to gusts above 40 mph (64 kph).The detonation will aim to bring the remaining portion of the building straight down and toward the street side, away from the existing pile of debris, Jadallah said.The method of demolition is called “energetic felling,” which uses small detonation devices and relies on the force of gravity. Levine Cava said that should bring the building down in place, containing the collapse to the immediate surroundings.State officials said they hired the BG Group, a general contractor based in Delray Beach, Florida, to lead the demolition. They did not immediately respond to an inquiry about how the firm was selected, but a contract for the projects calls for the state to pay the company $935,000.A spokesperson for the state’s Division of Emergency Management said the company is subcontracting with Maryland-based Controlled Demolition Inc., which experts say is among only a handful of companies in the U.S. that demolishes structures using explosives. The company was supposed to place explosives on the basement and lobby levels of the still-standing structure, according to the contract for the work.CDI is “probably one of the best” in the industry, said Steve Schwartz, a member of the National Demolition Association’s board of directors. He described the company’s president and owner, Mark Loizeaux, as “cool, calm and collected.”In implosions — using explosives to have a building fall in on itself — the charges are generally set off in rapid succession over a matter of seconds, said Scott Homrich, who heads the National Demolition Association and runs his own demolition company in Detroit, Michigan. Setting the explosives off at intervals serves to break up the building at the same time it’s coming down.Officials acknowledged that the tragedy is continuing to unfold during the July 4th holiday.“This July 4 we’re reminded that patriotism isn’t just about loyalty to country," said Levine Cava. "It’s about loyalty to one another — to our communities, to those in need whose names or stories we may not know ever, but to whom we are connected by compassion and by resilience.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-drilling-done-demolition-of-collapsed-condo-set-says-official-101625450268914.html

Hundreds of businesses in the United States were hit on Friday by the unusually sophisticated cyber attack.More details have now emerged about how a Russia-linked gang breached the company whose software was the conduit.The software targeted by the attackers was VSA, which is used by companies that manage technology at smaller businesses.The cybersecurity teams are still working to stem the impact of the attack.Here is how the attack spread:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biggest-ransomware-attack-on-record-targeted-firms-in-17-nations-how-it-spread-101625448173644.html

The operation was carried out by a 10-person medical team.In addition to causing pain, the condition can lead to bloating, inflammation, and difficulty in bowel movement. It tends to affect older people more.The pope appeared to be in fine health several hours earlier when he addressed thousands of people in St. Peter's Square for his Sunday blessing and announced a trip to Slovakia and Budapest for September.The sprawling Catholic-run Gemelli hospital and medical school in the northern part of Rome traditionally treats popes and a part of its 10th floor is permanently reserved for them.As he does every year in July, Francis already had suspended all of his general and private audiences for the month. The surgery appeared to be timed to coincide with a period in which he has only one public commitment - his Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square.Unlike his predecessors, he stays in the Vatican and has never used the sprawling papal summer estate in the Alban Hills south of Rome.Francis is sometimes short of breath because a part of one of his lungs was removed following an illness when he was a young man in his native Argentina.He also suffers from sciatica, which causes pain that radiates from the lower back along the sciatic nerve to the legs.The condition, for which he receives regular physiotherapy, forced him to miss several events at the beginning of this year and has led him on occasions to walk with difficulty.Last year, a bad cold kept him from taking part in a week-long Lenten retreat with senior aides south of Rome.In 2014, a year after he was elected pope, Francis was forced to cancel several engagements because of what was believed to be a stomach ailment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-doing-well-after-intestinal-surgery-says-vatican-101625445479483.html
05-07-2021||World||45 dead in Philippine military plane crash||A Philippines air force troop plane crashed and broke up in flames on a southern island on Sunday, killing at least 45 people after some jumped free, officials said, in the country’s worst military air disaster in nearly 30 years.Pictures from the scene showed flames and smoke pouring from wreckage strewn among coconut palms as men in combat uniform milled around, while a column of thick black smoke rose into the sky.The Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft, carrying troops bound for counter-insurgency operations, crashed with 96 people on board. The plane had attempted to land at Jolo airport, but overshot the runway without touching down. It failed to regain enough power and height and crashed at nearby Patikul.“A number of soldiers were seen jumping out of the aircraft before it hit the ground, sparing them from the explosion caused by the crash,” the joint task force Sulu said.It was not immediately clear how many jumped or whether they had survived.Military chief Cirilito Sobejana said the plane had “missed the runway trying to regain power”. The department of national defence said 45 people had been killed, including three civilians on the ground, while 53 were injured, including four civilians. Five military personnel were still missing.A military spokesman, Colonel Edgard Arevalo, said there was no sign of any attack on the plane, but an investigation had yet to begin as efforts were focused on rescue and treatment.The military command said the soldiers aboard had the rank of private and were being deployed to their battalions. They were flying to the provincial airport of Jolo from Laguindingan, about 460km to the northeast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/45-dead-in-philippine-military-plane-crash-101625422433214.html
