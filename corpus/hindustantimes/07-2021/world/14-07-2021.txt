The police fired tear gas on several occasions as pockets of protesters overturned garbage cans and set a mechanical digger alight. Some protesters away from the skirmishes wore badges saying "No to the health pass".Some critics of Macron's plan - which will require shopping malls, cafes, bars and restaurants to check the health passes of all patrons from August - accuse the president of trampling on freedoms and discriminating against those who do not want the Covid shot."It's totally arbitrary and wholly undemocratic," said one protester who identified himself as Jean-Louis.Macron says the vaccine is the best way to put France back on the path to normalcy and that he is encouraging as many people as possible to get inoculated.There were protests in other cities including Nantes, Marseille and Montpellier.The show of discontent took place on Bastille Day, the anniversary of the 1789 storming of a medieval fortress in Paris which marked the turning point in the French Revolution.Among other proposals in the government's draft bill is the mandatory isolation for 10 days of anyone who tests positive, with police making random checks, French media reported. The prime minister's office did not respond when asked to confirm the detail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-in-france-against-covid-19-health-pass-rules-101626284241272.html
14-07-2021||World||Pak minister opposes proposed restriction on changing religion before 18 years of age||Pakistan’s Minister for Religious Affairs Noorul Haq Qadri on Wednesday opposed a proposed restriction on changing religion before the age of 18 years.Qadri, who is also a member of the Senate Parliamentary committee on minorities’ rights, said the change of religion before 18 years of age is a matter of choice and no restriction can be imposed on it."We do not support a restriction on religious conversion before 18 years of age. There are several examples in Islam of religious conversion before 18 years," he said during a meeting of the committee.He said that the change of religion before 18 is a matter of choice and no restriction can be imposed on it and if someone aged 14 years wished to convert to some other religion, they could not be stopped.But the minister agreed that the issue of marriageable age can be regulated through laws and the Council of Islamic Ideology can be consulted for it.The issue of conversion has been in the limelight for several years due to the recurrence of such cases in the Sindh province which has a sizable Hindu population and from where such cases are frequently reported.Qadri supported the probe into cases of forcible conversion and said that it would be investigated if someone was "forcefully converting others in Sindh".To the question that a certain spiritual leader in Sindh, known as Pir Mian Mithu of Bharchundi Sharif, has been allegedly orchestrating conversion of minor Hindu girls, Qadri said that the pir should be called by the committee and informed that what he was doing was "damaging Islam and Pakistan".To highlight the issue of conversion, minority Senator Danesh Kumar told the committee that a religious leader in the Dalbandin area of Balochistan was incentivising conversion.The Senator claimed that the leader was luring the menial workers like local Sweepers that would not have to sweep after converting to Islam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-minister-opposes-proposed-restriction-on-changing-religion-before-18-years-of-age-101626282847933.html
14-07-2021||World||Facebook rolls out ‘expert’ feature for knowledgeable members of groups||Facebook is rolling out a new feature to let subject matter experts stand out in groups run by millions of admins and moderators around the world. The social media giant on Tuesday announced a new way to spotlight subject matter experts in Facebook groups. The group admins will be able to recognise knowledgeable members in their group by designating them as “group experts.”“Admins now have the ability to select specific members in their communities who stand out, empowering them to play a more meaningful role,” Facebook executive Maria Smith wrote in a blog post.“[A]dmins can collaborate with group experts to host Q&As, share perspectives on a topic and respond to questions,” she added.The group admins can invite any member to take the expert badge but the member will have the option to accept or reject the expert invitation. In case they accept the role, the group experts will receive a badge next to their names in the group, making it “easier for group members to spot informative posts and comments from designated experts.”Facebook has not specified whether there will be any kind of vetting process for appointing experts, indicating that any member of the group can be appointed as a subject matter expert. The new ‘expert’ feature without vetting process has raised concern about possible misuse by groups to further spread misinformation. However, a Facebook spokesperson has said that function was a “limited test” available to select groups initially, BBC reported.Smith said that Facebook is starting the test by giving some people in fitness and gaming the option to identify specific topics they’re knowledgeable about. Facebook group admins can then search for those specific topics, say yoga, and discover relevant people who are not yet members and invite them to join as group experts.“To make it easier for experts to engage with their followers, we’re introducing automatic invites, which allows them to invite their recently engaged Page followers to join groups they’ve created,” wrote Smith, VP of Communities for Facebook App.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-rolls-out-expert-feature-for-knowledgeable-members-of-groups-101626281999319.html

He also listed three reasons, which he called the “perfect storm of factors”, that could potentially cause significant loss of lives in the country in the absence of emergency assistance.“An explosion of Covid cases, including the Delta variant, the collapse of Myanmar’s health care system, and the deep mistrust of the people of Myanmar of anything connected to the military junta, are a perfect storm of factors that could cause a significant loss of life in Myanmar without emergency assistance by the international community,” UN Special Rapporteur in Myanmar Tom Andrews said on Wednesday in a statement by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.Stressing the mistrust of the people in the junta, Andrews said that the international community “must help facilitate a non-junta, non-political body to coordinate a Covid response initiative that includes a vaccination programme that the people of Myanmar will trust.” He also said that the Myanmar military lacks the resources, capabilities and the legitimacy to control the crisis. “The crisis in Myanmar is particularly lethal because of the pervasive mistrust of the military junta,” he added.Also read | Myanmar faces huge spike in daily Covid-19 cases, oxygen supply crisisAndrews said that those willing to help should do so before the country turns into a super spreader of the disease. “Member states, international organisations, regional bodies and non-government organisations that are willing and able to provide much needed aid must do so before untold numbers perish and Myanmar becomes a super spreader of this deadly virus,” he said.He called on the military to account for the $350 million, which Myanmar received as Covid-19 aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) before the military took over power following a coup.Concerns on over-crowded prisonsVulnerable populations, including those in the country’s over-crowded prisons, are at greater risk, Andrews said.“Myanmar’s prison population, including the thousands of political prisoners who have been arbitrarily detained since the coup, are in grave danger. Prisoners, particularly those with underlying conditions could see their detention become a death sentence,” he said.“Myanmar’s neighbours are well placed to help and have a self-interest to do so, but there is no time to waste. Those with influence on junta leaders must immediately seek to secure their cooperation. The UN and others in the international community are positioned to provide immediate assistance to confront this rapidly deteriorating crisis,” he further said.Meanwhile, the Myanmar government on Wednesday said that the country would receive six million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from China by August 2021, news agency AFP reported. The military government has bought four million doses and another two million would be donated by China, AFP said, citing a senior official from the country’s information ministry.On February 1, the military deposed the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar. The leader has since then been detained by the military. Many protests have erupted in the country against the rule of the junta, which have been strictly opposed by the military.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/perfect-storm-of-factors-un-expert-warns-of-deepening-covid-19-crisis-in-myanmar-calls-for-international-help-101626280836081.html
14-07-2021||World||Bush criticises complete pullout of US troops from Afghanistan||Former US president George W Bush has joined the growing chorus of criticism of the complete pullout of troops from Afghanistan ordered by President Joe Biden and publicly called it a mistake that would lead to “unbelievably bad” consequences.Bush had ordered US forces into Afghanistan in search of al-Qaeda perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. They had overthrown the brutal and regressive regime of the Taliban that was sheltering al-Qaeda, and stayed on to fight terrorist groups, many of whom fled to safe havens in adjoining Pakistan.“I think it is, yeah,” Bush said to German broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) when asked if pulling out of Afghanistan completely is a mistake. “Because I think the consequences are going to be unbelievably bad.”Bush has desisted from speaking on politics or policy since leaving office and has focused more on his artwork - he paints - and work with veterans. Former US presidents - with the exception of Donald Trump - tend to retire from public eye altogether and speak out rarely, only when deeply concerned.Criticism of the pullout, which is 95% done, is mounting in the US and abroad as the Taliban make aggressive military gains in Afghanistan foretelling the return of their reprehensible policies such as curbs on women from working or studying enforced by the regime ousted by the US-led international forces in 2001.India has been critical as well and worried, as an important stakeholder, and called the US withdrawal as a “politically expedient” move and called for “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire” with the UN taking the lead role.DW interviewed the former US president in the context of German Chancellor Angela Merkel stepping down after 16 years in office. The two had shared a warm and close relationship, which had reflected in dramatically improved ties from their first meeting in 2006. He speaks warmly of her in the interview.Bush is troubled, however, by the pullout of troops from Afghanistan and the likely fallout, most of it is already playing out. “I’m afraid Afghan women and girls are going to suffer unspeakable harm,” Bush said, speaking feelingly of the work he and the first lady Laura Bush had done with Afghan women and girls. “I spent a lot of time with Afghan women and they’re scared.”The former president also spoke worryingly of Afghan interpreters who worked with US and coalition troops. They face real danger of brutal retaliation from the Taliban. The Biden administration has said it is doing all it can to get them and their families out of the country and eventually to the US. But there are concerns this help may be a bit too late and too little.“I think about all the interpreters and people who helped not only US troops but Nato troops. It seems like they are going to be left behind to be slaughtered by the very brutal people, and it breaks my heart,” said Bush.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bush-criticises-complete-pullout-of-us-troops-from-afghanistan-101626272520219.html
14-07-2021||World||Twitter sees jump in govt demands to remove content of journalists, news outlets: Report||Twitter Inc saw a surge in demands over the course of last year from governments around the world to take down content posted by journalists and news outlets, data to be released by the social media platform for the first time will show.In its transparency report to be published on Wednesday and a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Twitter said verified accounts of 199 journalists and news outlets on its platform globally were subject to 361 legal demands from governments to remove content in the second half of 2020, an increase of 26% from the first half of the year.It declined to elaborate on which countries submitted the demands, or how many of the legal demands pertaining to journalists or news outlets the platform complied with.The new details in Twitter's biannual report on its enforcement of policy rules and the information and removal requests it receives comes as Twitter and other social media companies including Facebook and Alphabet’s YouTube are facing scrutiny from governments around the world over the content allowed on their platforms.On Monday, Cuba began restricting access to Facebook and messaging apps like Telegram amid widespread anti-government protests. Last month, Nigeria banned Twitter's service from the country and ordered television and radio stations not to use the platform to gather information.Twitter said in the report India was now the single largest source of all information requests from governments during the second half of 2020, overtaking the United States, which was second in the volume of requests.The company said globally it received over 14,500 requests for information between July 1 and Dec. 31, and it produced some or all of the information in response to 30% of the requests.Such information requests can include governments or other entities asking for the identities of people tweeting under pseudonyms.Twitter also received more than 38,500 legal demands to take down various content, which was down 9% from the first half of 2020, and said it complied with 29% of the demands.Twitter has been embroiled in several conflicts with countries around the world, most notably India over the government's new rules aimed at regulating content on social media. Last week, the company said it had hired an interim chief compliance officer in India and would appoint other executives in order to comply with the rules.In the updated transparency report, Twitter added that the number of impressions, or views of a tweet, that violated Twitter's rules accounted for less than 0.1% of impressions for all tweets globally in the second half of 2020, the first time the platform has released such data.Like other social media companies, Twitter has struggled to police hate speech, misinformation and other abuses on its service, with Chief Executive Jack Dorsey among the tech leaders who appeared in a hearing before Congress in March on misinformation.Major social media companies were most recently under fire this week over racist abuse on their platforms directed at Black players on the England soccer team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-sees-jump-in-govt-demands-to-remove-content-of-journalists-news-outlets-report-101626269569510.html

Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid on Wednesday said in a statement that the fighters have captured an “important border town called Wesh.”The control of the border crossing between the Pakistani town of Chaman and the Afghan town of Wesh could be the most strategic objective they have captured so far amid rapid gains across the country as US forces pull out from the region. The crossing is the second busiest entry point and the main link between its vast southwest and Pakistani ports.A Pakistani official said the Taliban militants have taken down the Afghan government flag from atop the ‘Friendship Gate’, reported new agency Reuters. While the Afghan government asserted that they were in control of the Spin Boldak border district in Kandahar province, Pakistani officials said the Taliban controlled the Wesh border posts."Wesh, which has great importance in Afghan trade with Pakistan and other countries, has been captured by the Taliban," a Pakistani security official deployed at the border area told Reuters.Also Read | China asks Taliban to make 'clean break' from terrorists, return to mainstreamAmid the Afghan government’s struggle to retain control of its territories, foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) discussed the issue which is said to have major implications for the regional security. During a meeting in Dushanbe, External affairs minister S Jaishankar presented a three-point roadmap for an end state in Afghanistan, including cessation of violence and terrorist attacks against civilians and state representatives.The minister said that the world and the Afghan people want an “independent, neutral, unified, peaceful, democratic and prosperous nation”, adding that the challenge is to act seriously on these beliefs as there are forces at work “with a very different agenda.” He stressed the need to reach an “acceptable compromise” that reflects the Doha process, Moscow format and Istanbul process.Meanwhile, the Taliban have seized other major border crossings, in Herat, Farah and Kunduz provinces in the north and west, threatening regional security. Taking to Twitter, Afghanistan vice president Amrullah Saleh said that the Taliban were forcing members of a small ethnic minority to either convert to Islam or leave their homes in the northern province of Badakhshan. The Taliban’s rapid advances have also caused concern for the rights of women and girls as they were barred from school and most work under the group’s harsh version of Islamic law.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-flag-raised-above-afghanistan-s-border-crossing-with-pakistan-101626266339285.html
14-07-2021||World||Homecoming of Pope Francis after undergoing colon surgery||Pope Francis on Wednesday left the Rome hospital where the head of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics had undergone an operation on his colon on July 4.The 84-year old was whisked away from the Gemelli University Hospital in a car with tinted windows and was later spotted returning to his home within the Vatican's walls.He stopped off on the way at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore for a quick prayer to "express his gratitude for the success of his surgery", Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement.The pope also prayed at the central Rome church for "all the sick, especially all those he had met during his stay in hospital," Bruni said.Francis had been admitted to hospital after suffering from a type of diverticulitis, an inflammation of pockets that develop in the lining of the intestine.The Vatican initially said he would be in hospital for about a week, and the pope led the Angelus prayer from his hospital window on Sunday.On Monday, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said he would stay for a "few more days". It was not immediately clear whether Francis's schedule would immediately return to normal.The pope managed to do some work from hospital, and retained all his powers as pontiff while away.A special chamberlain, known as "the cardinal camerlengo", stood ready to take over in the event of death, as he does at all times, according to the Catholic News Service.'More tired'As if to ward off questions about his stamina, the Vatican announced on the day Francis was admitted to hospital that he would travel to Hungary and Slovakia later this year.He also hopes to attend the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November, according to Scotland's bishops, and there is a reported trip to Greece also being planned.The pontiff, who suffers from sciatica, confessed however after a trip to Iraq earlier this year that travelling made him "a lot more tired" these days.His chronic nerve condition, which he has dubbed "a troublesome guest", causes, back, hip and leg pain and has occasionally forced him to cancel official events.Francis almost died when he was 21 after developing pleurisy -- an inflammation of the tissues that surround the lung -- according to biographer Austen Ivereigh.He had part of one of his lungs removed in October 1957.He has also previously sought support for anxiety, according to Argentinian journalist and doctor, Nelson Castro, but deals with it nowadays by listening to Bach or sipping "mate", a popular Argentinean herbal drink.The pope's abilities to manage stress may be tested later this month when 10 people including a cardinal go on trial at the Vatican for charges including embezzlement.Cardinal Angelo Becciu was not only a high-ranking prelate but was one of Francis's close aides before he was fired last year and stripped of his cardinal rights.Although Francis's predecessor, ex-pope Benedict XVI, officially stepped down due to his advancing age, many speculated whether stress may have played a part, his resignation coming on the back of the so-called Vatileaks scandal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/homecoming-of-pope-francis-after-undergoing-colon-surgery-101626264307914.html

It is a party in the intra-Afghan talks which we believe should be a solution for normalisation and establishment of an inclusive government that should be involving all major ethnic groups," he said replying to a volley of questions.India has huge interest in Afghanistan and it is for New Delhi to decide its extent of involvement in that country, he said.The Russian diplomat said India has been involved in active regional diplomacy on Afghanistan and described it as "very encouraging".India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.Afghanistan witnessed a series of terror attacks in the last few weeks as the US looked to complete the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan by August-end, ending a nearly two-decade of its military presence in the war-ravaged country.The Taliban fighters are rapidly seizing control of a large number of areas in Afghanistan, forcing many countries to scale down their presence there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-active-regional-diplomacy-with-afghanistan-as-very-encouraging-russia-101626257268401.html

"Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation can enrich uranium by 20% and 60% and if one day our reactor needs it, it can enrich uranium to 90% purity," President Hassan Rouhani told a cabinet meeting, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported.The nuclear deal caps the fissile purity to which Tehran can refine uranium at 3.67%, well under the 20% achieved before the agreement and far below the 90% suitable for a nuclear weapon. Iran has long denied any intention of developing nuclear weapons.Iran has been breaching the deal in several ways after the United States withdrew from the agreement in 2018, including by producing 20% and 60% enriched uranium.Rouhani, who will hand over the presidency to hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi on August 5, implicitly criticised Iran's top decision makers for "not allowing" his government to revive the nuclear deal during its term in office."They took away the opportunity to reach an agreement from this government. We are sorry to miss this opportunity," the state news agency IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, not the president, has the last say on all state matters such as nuclear policy.Like Khamenei, Raisi has backed indirect talks between Tehran and Washington, which started on April 9 in Vienna aimed at bringing back the arch foes into full compliance with the accord. Washington quit the deal three years ago, saying it was biased in favour of Iran, and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.The talks in Vienna adjourned on June 20 and no date has been set yet for the next round of the negotiations. Iranian and Western officials have said that significant gaps still remain to be resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-rouhani-iran-can-enrich-uranium-to-90-purity-if-needed-101626262371004.html

The two countries signed the U.S.-brokered normalization agreement on the White House lawn in September, and a flurry of bilateral economic and cooperation deals in the months since.The UAE Embassy is situated in the same tower as Israel's stock exchange in the heart of Tel Aviv's business district. Most countries maintain embassies in Tel Aviv because of Jerusalem's disputed status — one of the thorniest issues in the Mideast conflict. The U.S. moved its embassy to Jerusalem in 2018, and a handful of countries have followed suit.Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it in a move unrecognized by most of the international community. The city is the seat of the Israeli parliament, Supreme Court and many government offices. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem as capital of a future independent state.The UAE's ambassador to Israel, Mohamed Al Khaja, told reporters that the embassy will be “a base for our task to continue to build on our new partnership, to seek dialog, not dispute, to build a new paradigm of peace and to provide a model for a new collaborative approach to conflict resolution in the Middle East.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-officially-launches-embassy-in-israel-101626255906160.html
14-07-2021||World||China asks Taliban to make 'clean break' from terrorists, return to mainstream||After the Taliban spokesperson called Beijing a “welcome friend”, China has asked the Islamist militant group to make a “clean break” from all terrorist forces. China has been wary of Afghanistan becoming a hub for the al-Qaida-backed Uyghur Muslim militant group the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a separatist outfit waging an insurgency in volatile Xinjiang province.During a media briefing at Dushanbe, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Tuesday pitched for restarting intra-Afghan negotiations and prevention of all kinds of terrorist forces gaining ground in the war-torn region. Wang said that the Taliban should make a "clean break" with all terrorist forces and return to the mainstream of Afghan politics.Wang also praised the Afghan government which is fighting the Taliban fighters to defend its territories. The Chinese foreign minister said that the government headed by President Ashraf Ghani has done a lot of work for national unity, social stability and improvement of people's livelihood, which should be justly evaluated.Wang’s statement on the Taliban came ahead of the foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Dushanbe. The issue of Afghanistan dominated the meeting on Wednesday where external affairs minister S Jaishankar joined his counterparts from the SCO states - China, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.“Afghanistan, public health and economic recovery are pressing issues. Combating terrorism and extremism is the key purpose of SCO. Must stop terror financing and deter digital facilitation,” Jaishankar tweeted after addressing the meeting.Last week, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen told Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post that the group would guarantee the safety of Chinese investors and workers, claiming that it controls 85% of Afghan territory. Shaheen also reportedly assured China that it would not host Uyghur militants from the Xinjiang province.“We have been to China many times and we have good relations with them,” SCMP quoted Suhail as saying. "If (the Chinese) have investments, of course, we will ensure their safety.”(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-asks-taliban-to-make-clean-break-from-terrorists-return-to-mainstream-101626254774269.html
14-07-2021||World||Former US President George W Bush says Afghanistan troop pullout is a 'mistake'||Former US president George W. Bush on Wednesday criticised the withdrawal of NATO troops from Afghanistan and said civilians were being left to be "slaughtered" by the Taliban."Afghan women and girls are going to suffer unspeakable harm. This is a mistake... They're just going to be left behind to be slaughtered by these very brutal people, and it breaks my heart," Bush told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.The former Republican president, who sent troops to Afghanistan in autumn 2001 after the September 11 attacks on New York's World Trade Center, said he believed German Chancellor Angela Merkel "feels the same way".Bush said Merkel, who is set to retire from politics later this year after 16 years in power, had brought "class and dignity to a very important position and made very hard decisions".US and NATO forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan in early May and are due to completely pull out by September 11, some 20 years after they arrived in the war-torn country.Most of the 2,500 US and 7,500 NATO troops who were in Afghanistan when US President Joe Biden detailed the final withdrawal in April have now gone, leaving Afghan troops to fight an emboldened Taliban seemingly bent on a military victory.The country is facing a crisis as the insurgents snap up territory across the countryside, stretching government forces and leading to a fresh wave of internally displaced families, complicated by a renewed outbreak of Covid-19.The United Nations said on Sunday the rising conflict is causing "more suffering" across the violence-wracked country as it called for continuous financial aid.Biden has insisted, however, that it is time for US involvement in the war to end and for Afghans to chart their own future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-president-george-w-bush-says-afghanistan-troop-pullout-is-a-mistake-101626253261307.html
14-07-2021||World||China operating military flights from South China Sea bases: Report||As China begins the construction of world’s first commercial small modular reactor (SMR), the country’s military has deployed electronic warning and surveillance aircraft and helicopters on two disputed islands in the South China Sea, the Washington Times reported.Satellite images procured by the publication reveal deployment had begun in May and June of PLA KJ-500 airborne warning and control aircraft to Mischief Reef in the Spratly Island. Moreover, other satellite captures show the stationing of a Y-9 transport aircraft and Z-8 helicopter to Subi Reef in June and this month. Last year, KQ-200 anti-submarine warfare aircraft were deployed on Fiery Cross Reef.The reefs are part of a triangle of South China Sea military bases, which can house all kinds of warplanes and bombers, and even comprise docking facilities capable of handling most Chinese warships, the Washington Times reported.The satellite visuals of the military aircraft were captured by J Michael Dahm, a former Navy intelligence officer, who is currently associated with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory – also known as APL.Speaking to the Washington Times, Dahm said that the most vital change in military posture in 2021 is the “appearance of Chinese special mission aircraft and helicpters at Subi and Mischief Reefs,” indicating that China has commenced routine air operations from its bases.The deployments were found after the publication of a research report, revealing the locations of anti-aircraft, land-attack strike missiles, and anti-ship on three of China’s seven-island reefs – including Mischief and Subi, by Dahm.He added that surveillance aircraft, island-based anti-surface, anti-air missile systems, and strike fighters are expected to be employed to “Cover and defend Chinese naval forces,Strike fighters, surveillance aircraft and island-based anti-surface and anti-air missile systems “will likely be employed to cover and defend Chinese naval forces, giving them the ability to project military power deep into the South China Sea and Southeast Asia,” according to the Washington Times report.Although the Spratly Island is claimed by Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and China, it has largely been dominated by China since 2018. Tensions emerged there this week after a Chinese warship pulled off an unsuccessful attempt – as per the US Navy - to force the guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold to leave the area near the Paracel Islands in South China Sea’s northern tip.The APL report by Dahm pointed out that the island reefs are equipped to render the Chinese Army with “superior battlespace awareness and a decided information advantage in any future military conflict” in the South China Sea, according to the Washington Times report.The APL report further warns that China could deploy anti-ship ballistic missiles to the islands since each of the three airfields is equipped with 24 aircraft hangers for jet fighters.Phillip Orchard, an analyst at Geopolitical Futures, a consulting group, said that the Chinese bases in the South China Sea provide Beijing strategists with key military outposts. However, in an “actual, prolonged conflict with the US and its allies, the tactical value of the Spratlys would rapidly diminish”.This development could trigger a response not just from the US, but also from other East Asian nations who are concerned over China’s expansionist drive. Orchard said that this “show of force” demonstrates that the seven artificial island bases that China has built in the Spratly Island since 2013 can be put to good use in “scenarios short of war,” as per the Washington Times report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-operating-military-flights-from-south-china-sea-bases-report-101626252671446.html
14-07-2021||World||Sputnik V Covid vaccine's single dose triggers strong antibody response: Study||According to a study, a single dose of the Sputnik V vaccine may be enough to evoke strong antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, in already infected people.The new study, published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine, examined whether a single dose of Sputnik V vaccine would achieve greater public health benefit than two doses by allowing protection of a larger population more quickly, reports news agency PTI.Previous studies have found that two doses of Sputnik V, a vector vaccine produced using a combination of two adenoviruses, results in 92 per cent efficacy against Covid-19 infection."Due to limited vaccine supply and uneven vaccine distribution in many regions of the world, health authorities urgently need data on the immune response to vaccines to optimize vaccination strategies," said study senior author Andrea Gamarnik of the Fundacion Instituto Leloir-CONICET in Buenos Aires, Argentina."The peer-reviewed data we present provide information for guiding public health decisions in light of the current global health emergency," Gamarnik added.The researchers noted that the evidence from other vaccines offers support for the one-shot approach. The AstraZeneca vaccine, for example, shows 76 per cent efficacy after a single dose, and the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines may induce sufficient immunity in previously infected individuals after one dose, with no apparent benefit of an additional dose, they said.The researchers compared the effects of one and two shots of Sputnik V on SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in 289 healthcare workers in Argentina. Three weeks after the second dose, all volunteers with no prior infection generated virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.However, even within three weeks of receiving the first dose, 94 per cent of these participants developed IgG antibodies against the virus, and 90 per cent showed evidence of neutralising antibodies, which interfere with the ability of viruses to infect cells.The research further showed that IgG and neutralising antibody levels in previously infected participants were significantly higher after one dose than those in fully vaccinated volunteers with no history of infection.A second dose did not increase the production of neutralising antibodies in previously infected volunteers. "This highlights the robust response to vaccination of previously infected individuals, suggesting that naturally acquired immunity might be enhanced sufficiently by a single dose, in agreement with recent studies using mRNA vaccines," Gamarnik noted.The researchers stated that further studies are needed to evaluate the duration of the immune response and to assess how antibody levels relate to vaccine protection against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sputnik-v-covid-vaccine-s-single-dose-triggers-strong-antibody-response-study-101626246299596.html

14-07-2021||World||Indonesia’s Covid cases surge past India, marking new epicenter||Indonesia surpassed India’s daily Covid-19 case numbers, marking a new Asian virus epicenter as the spread of the highly-contagious delta variant drives up infections in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.The country has seen its daily case count cross 40,000 for two straight days -- including a record high of 47,899 on Tuesday -- up from less than 10,000 a month ago. Officials are concerned that the more transmissible new variant is now spreading outside of the country’s main island, Java, and could exhaust hospital workers and supplies of oxygen and medication.Indonesia’s current numbers are still far from India’s peak of 400,000 daily cases in May. India, with a population roughly five times the size of Indonesia’s 270 million people, saw daily infections drop below 33,000 on Tuesday as its devastating outbreak wanes.Indonesia reported 907 deaths daily on average in the past seven days -- compared to just 181 a month ago -- while India reported an average of 1,072 daily fatalities.Developing countries are struggling to contain the virus -- especially delta’s rapid spread -- even as vaccine rollouts are allowing life to return to normal in countries like the US and UThe outbreak in Indonesia underscores the consequences of an unequal global distribution of vaccines that has seen richer countries gobble up more of the supply, leaving poorer places exposed to outbreaks of variants like delta. World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called the growing divide a “catastrophic moral failure.”Indonesia has administered vaccines to cover just 10% of its population and India 14%, compared to 46% of the European Union’s population and 52% in the U.S., according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker. Lacking enough immunizations, the developing world is bearing the brunt of rising case counts and death tolls, with global fatalities reaching 4 million earlier this month.Covid Deaths Reach 4 Million as India Eclipses U.S., U.K.Indonesia’s country’s positive Covid test rate has reached about 27%, while India’s rate is 2%. Larger numbers indicate a government is only testing the sickest patients, and that there are high levels of undetected infection in the community. Experts say both nations are under-counting cases and deaths by a wide margin given their lack of testing infrastructure.Curbs imposed on Java and tourism spot Bali from July 3-20 haven’t eased people’s movements as much as the government had expected.Residents’ mobility has only eased by 6% to 16% since the restrictions were put in place, whereas authorities had expected a 20% drop, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said in a hearing with lawmakers on Tuesday. The government had earlier said that a 50% reduction in mobility was needed to reduce Covid’s spread.“Our hospitals can’t endure it anymore if we fail to reduce movement by at least 20%,” Sadikin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesias-covid-cases-surge-past-india-marking-new-epicenter-101626239294324.html
14-07-2021||World||India asks Canada to lift ban on direct flights||India has officially asked the Canadian government to lift its ban on direct flights from New Delhi. That prohibition has been in place since April 22 and has been extended twice.The request for early resumption of flights under the air corridor arrangement that came into place last summer was sent by India’s high commission in Ottawa to Global Affairs Canada, Canada’s foreign ministry, in the form of a formal diplomatic communiqué, a note verbale.The current ban will expire on July 21 unless extended for a fourth time by the department of transportation. The original April decision came as India faced a devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and due to fears in Canada over transmission of the Delta variant by air passengers.India’s high commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria, who is visiting Toronto, told the Hindustan Times, “We have pointed out to the Canadian authorities that there is a huge demand and inconvenience to both Indian and Canadian passengers, particularly students. As well, we have pointed out the dramatic recovery in India and the drop in cases.”Bisaria also held meetings with officials from Air India and Air Canada. Before the ban was enforced, the two national carriers were operating almost daily flights between New Delhi and the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver. Both airlines are believed to be keen on resuming services at the earliest.After meeting Air India’s representative in Canada, Bisaria tweeted, “Important to rapidly normalise mobility for economic recovery, for achieving normalcy in business and education.” He also emphasised on “normal mobility” during a meeting with provincial leaders of Ontario, including cabinet minister Victor Fedeli and associate minister Nina Tangri.The communiqué focused on infection rates dropping in India, as the vaccination programme has expanded and positivity rate has gone well below 5%. Comparing the two main hubs for the air corridor, an Indian official said while Delhi now has around 50 new cases each day for a population of nearly 20 million, the province of Ontario, where Toronto is located, accounts for approximately 150 every day at this time. India has said that factual data, along with the inconvenience being caused to Indian and Canadian citizens should be factored in as the Canadian government decides on the ongoing ban.Indian officials have also stressed on the difficulties being faced by students who wish to commence studies in Canada for the semester beginning in September and need to arrive well in time to prepare.The suspension was originally announced on April 22 and was scheduled to last for 30 days. However, it was subsequently imposed for two additional periods of 30 days each, latest of which will expire this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-asks-canada-to-lift-ban-on-direct-flights-101626238017793.html

Talks are currently under way regarding regulatory issues and liability issues, according to people familiar with the matter.President Biden has announced he will donate 80 million doses of Covid-19 from the domestic US stockpile to countries around the world either directly or through the WHO-led Covax programme. America has also placed an order for 500 million Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for distribution around the world.Several countries in India’s neighbourhood have already received these donated US vaccines - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. “Roughly 40 million doses have been delivered worldwide so far,” said Price.Asked if the US was considering lifting travel restrictions on India in view of the improved situation, the state department spokesperson said, “That is something that we are taking a close look at - the US government, I should say, is taking a close look at. There are expert groups that have been formed. And “experts” in this case refer primarily to medical professionals, because for us this is not a decision about politics; this is a decision about public health and the safety of the American people but also the safety of the global travelling public.”In other words, the restrictions will remain in place till these experts deem it otherwise.The White House had announced restrictions on travel from India in April on the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “in light of extraordinarily high Covid-19 caseloads and multiple variants circulating in India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vaccine-shipment-on-hold-as-india-sorts-legal-hurdles-101626236817708.html
14-07-2021||World||Study sheds light on why mosquitoes bite some people more||The rainy season has arrived, which will see a spurt in mosquito bites. The tiny creatures leave a reddish - and sometimes puffy - bump on the skin where they bite. The bump is usually a hard and itchy one.But people always want to know if mosquitoes prefer some of them more than the others. According to scientists, yes. A research published in the Time magazine in 2014 said that people will O blood type have more probability of being bitten by mosquitoes.Dr Jonathan Day, a medical entomologist and mosquito expert at the University of Florida, told Time there’s evidence that O blood type attracts mosquitoes more than others (A or B).Dr Day also said that the human skin keeps secreting various chemicals, including lactic acid which attracts the mosquitoes. And some people produce more of such chemicals, making them easy target for the mosquitoes, said the expert.He also said that mosquitoes use carbon dioxide (CO2) to identify bite target. Dr Day said that all vertebrates produce carbon dioxide which makes it easier for the mosquitoes to target them.He added that pregnant women and obese people, who have a higher resting metabolic rates are more attractive to mosquitoes.Mosquitoes are the carriers of many disease like dengue, chikangunya and malaria. And the spread of the disease increases during the monsoon time. However, much to the relief of general public, they cannot spread the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).According to US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, there is no data to suggest that Covid-19 is spread by either mosquitoes or ticks. It is mainly spread from person to person through droplets people spray when they talk, cough or sneeze. The World Health Organisation has also said that a mosquito bite won’t give you the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-sheds-light-on-why-mosquitoes-bite-some-people-more-101626234746708.html

This is driven by the fast-spreading delta variant, lagging vaccination rates and Fourth of July gatherings, according to news agency Associated Press.Covid-19 infections climbed to an average of about 23,600 a day on Monday, up from 11,300 on June 23, according to Johns Hopkins University data.On 17 of the past 18 days, the seven-day Covid-19 case average was higher than the 14-day average, also suggesting cases have been rising nationally.Even with the latest surge, Covid-19 cases in the US are nowhere near their peak of a quarter-million per day in January.Health authorities in places such as Los Angeles County and St. Louis are requesting even immunised people to resume wearing masks in public.Department officials are also recommending that people who are above 65 years of age and those with chronic underlying conditions stay away from large indoor gatherings because of a 150 per cent rise in hospitalizations over the past three weeks.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly all recent Covid-19 cases and deaths from the disease are among unvaccinated people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-rising-again-in-us-daily-count-doubled-in-3-weeks-101626228984651.html

Addressing the nation, the 69-year old also underlined that despite being “the people’s choice”, he is resigning from the post as the apex court has given an order to appoint Deuba as the prime minister in his place.He said the court’s “misinterpretation” of Article 76 (5) is sure to lead the country toward a party-less system. “It is sure to ignite malpractices and deteriorate discipline. The court has crossed its jurisdiction and decided over political matters,” Oli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deuba-takes-oath-as-nepal-pm-day-after-apex-court-verdict-101626221432522.html

Gen. Mathapelo Peters said in a statement Tuesday night.He said 27 deaths were being investigated in KwaZulu-Natal province and 45 in Gauteng province. In addition to the people crushed, he said police were investigating deaths caused by explosions when people tried to break into ATM machines, as well as other fatalities caused by shootings.The violence broke out after Zuma began serving a 15-month sentence for contempt of court on Thursday. He had refused to comply with a court order to testify at a state-backed inquiry investigating allegations of corruption while he was president from 2009 to 2018.The unrest spiraled into a spree of looting in township areas of the two provinces, although it has not spread to South Africa's other seven provinces, where police are on alert."The criminal element has hijacked this situation,” said Premier David Makhura of Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg.More than half of South Africa's 60 million people are living in poverty, with an unemployment rate of 32%, according to official statistics. The pandemic, with job layoffs and an economic downturn, has increased the hunger and desperation that helped propel the protests triggered by Zuma's arrest into wider rioting.“We understand that those unemployed have inadequate food. We understand that the situation has been made worse by the pandemic,” an emotional Makhura said on the state South African Broadcasting Corp.“But this looting is undermining our businesses here (in Soweto). It is undermining our economy, our community. It is undermining everything.”As he spoke, the broadcast showed police trying to bring order to the Ndofaya shopping mall, where 10 people had been crushed to death in a looting stampede. Gunshots could be heard in the background.Makhura appealed for leaders of political, religious and community organisations to urge people to halt the looting.The deployment of 2,500 soldiers to support the South African police has so far failed to stop the rampant looting, although arrests were being made in some areas in Johannesburg, including Vosloorus in the eastern part of the city.At least 1,234 people were arrested in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, authorities said, but the situation was far from under control.Looting continued Tuesday in shopping malls in Johannesburg township areas, including Jabulani Mall and Dobsonville Mall in Soweto. There also were reports of looting in KwaZulu-Natal.In Daveyton township, east of Johannesburg, more than 100 people, including women, children and older citizens, were arrested for stealing from shops inside the Mayfair Square mall.Some of those arrested were bleeding from shattered glass on floors slippery from spilled milk, liquor, yogurt and cleaning liquids that had been stolen from shops.Running battles carried on as security and the police fired stun grenades and rubber bullets to push back rioters, who were entering the shops by going through delivery entrances, emergency exits and climbing on roofs.By late afternoon the police managed to secure the mall, but rioters remained outside, throwing stones at the police and shouting for the release of those arrested.In Soweto, the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital reported that the number of injured people coming to the emergency ward had tripled from the daily average.The unrest forced the government to close some COVID-19 vaccination centers disrupting urgently needed efforts to inoculate thousands of those aged 50 and older per day.In Johannesburg's Alexandra township the Pan Africa shopping centre continued to be ransacked and was set on fire on Tuesday.The Alex FM radio station which has served the Alexandra community for 27 years was broken into at 2 am Tuesday and thieves stole equipment worth 5 million rand ($350,000), forcing the station off the air, station manager Takalane Nemangowe said."Our on-air presenter and security guards got out safely through the back door," Nemangowe told The Associated Press. “But the looters cleaned out our offices. They took all our broadcasting equipment, computers, laptops, microphones, everything.”Authorities have repeatedly warned people, including Zuma supporters and relatives, against using social media to encourage the riots. Police minister Bheki Cele said Tuesday that about a dozen people have been identified as having instigated the riots.The Constitutional Court, the country's highest court, heard Zuma's application to have his sentence rescinded on Monday. Zuma's lawyer argued that the top court made errors when sentencing Zuma to prison. After 10 hours of testimony, the judges said they would announce their decision at a later date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deaths-climb-to-72-in-south-africa-riots-after-zuma-jailed-101626211378837.html

We will continue to be there to support Cubans in their desire for greater peace, greater stability and greater voice in how things are going.”Canada never broke relations with the Caribbean nation after the revolution that swept Castro to power in 1959 and almost brought the U.S. and Russia to nuclear war in the early 1960s. Before the pandemic shut down travel, Canadian travelers were the biggest source of foreign tourism to the island.Two years ago, Trudeau’s government attempted to use its cordial ties to persuade Cuba to mediate in the political crisis in Venezuela amid Washington’s attempt to oust Nicolas Maduro from power.But the prime minister’s friendly tone toward Cuba has raised eyebrows in the past, and his main political rival seized on his latest comments. “We can’t afford more of Mr. Trudeau’s glowing admiration for dictatorships,” Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole said in a statement that condemned “terrible acts of oppression, murder, and tyranny” by the Cuban regime.When Fidel Castro died in 2016, Trudeau hailed the former Cuban president as a “legendary revolutionary and orator” who “made significant improvements to the education and health care of his island nation.” Though he acknowledged Castro was a “controversial figure,” he made no mention of human rights at the time -- prompting a viral parodies and criticism from Cuban-American senators including Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.Sunday’s protests saw thousands of people fill the streets of Havana, Santiago de Cuba and other cities, decrying rising prices, the lack of basic goods and frequent blackouts. They represent the biggest challenge yet to the leadership of Miguel Diaz-Canel, who took over as president from Fidel’s younger brother, Raul Castro, in 2018 and as head of the all-powerful Communist Party this year.The Cuban government hasn’t said how many people have been detained. But Cuba Decide, a pro-democracy group on the island, said in a tweet Tuesday that more than 150 have been locked up by police and state security.Prior to Trudeau’s remarks, Foreign Minister Marc Garneau’s press secretary declined a request for comment on the protests. A spokeswoman for Global Affairs Canada said later Monday the government was monitoring the situation in Cuba and was concerned by recent events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-treads-lightly-after-cuba-cracks-down-on-street-protests-101626209621984.html

We have not been informed (of his arrival). There have been no arrangements (yet) to receive him (in Antigua). All these are mere speculations about (him) arriving on a private medical jet”.Hurst, however, refused to comment on whether Antiguan government has made a decision on Dominican court order or not yet.Choksi, on a surety of Eastern Caribbean dollars 10,000 ( ₹275,000), has been allowed by Dominica high court to travel to Antigua to get medical treatment till he is fit to travel back. The “illegal entry” proceedings against him have also been adjourned by the court till he is fit to stand trial, the court said in its order on Monday.He is expected to take an air ambulance to Antigua on Wednesday.The court’s order has put Antigua in a spot as Browne has repeatedly said since Choksi went missing on May 23 that his government will not accept the businessman back.People familiar with the developments told HT although Antigua cannot stop his flight to land in its territory considering he is a citizen there, the cabinet led by Browne is likely to discuss the issue on Wednesday.“Dominica still has jurisdiction over him and we have no idea when or if he will actually be repatriated to Antigua. We have not made any decision whether to accept or deny him entry here. Such decisions are taken by the cabinet in consultation with the ministry of legal affairs,” said a senior official in Antigua, requesting anonymity.This officer went on to say that Dominica’s courts have no jurisdiction over Antigua.“I think the courts in Dominica cannot order the authorities of Antigua to do something. But we have not received any communication yet,” the officer added, insisting not to be named.The 62-year-old businessman, wanted in India for cheating Punjab National Bank (PNB) of ₹7,080 crore, has been in the custody of Dominican authorities for illegally entering the island on May 24 and faces charges on this count. He was admitted to the Dominica-China Friendship hospital soon after and has been under treatment since May 31.His lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said on Monday after the ruling – “Dominica courts finally upheld the rule of law and rights of a human to be treated in the medical facilities of his choice. And all attempts by various agencies did not bear fruit. There is solace in saying that all clever foxes end up as fur coats”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/choksis-arrival-a-speculation-says-antigua-101626208449242.html

14-07-2021||World||Gene-editing stops virus transmission within human body||Scientists have used CRISPR gene-editing technology to successfully block the transmission of the Sars-CoV-2 virus in infected human cells, according to research released on Tuesday that could pave the way for Covid-19 treatment.Writing in the journal Nature Communications, researchers in Australia said the tool was effective against viral transmissions in laboratory tests, adding that they were hopeing to begin animal trials soon.CRISPR, which allows scientists to alter DNA sequences and modify gene function, has already shown promise in eliminating the genetic coding that drives the development of cancer among children.The team in Tuesday’s study used an enzyme, CRISPR-Cas13b, that binds to relevant RNA sequences on the coronavirus and degrades the genome it needs to replicate inside human cells. Lead author Sharon Lewin from Australia’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity said the team designed the CRISPR tool to recognise Sars-CoV-2. “Once the virus is recognised, the CRISPR enzyme is activated and chops up the virus,” she said.Face recognition tech fights Covid in ChinaFacial recognition tech linked to personal health codes has been rolled out in the Chinese city of Ruili bordering Myanmar as authorities seek to squash a Covid-19 outbreak.This is the first publicly reported instance in China of facial recognition being used to track a person’s movements and health status as they enter and exit residential areas, supermarkets, transport hubs and other public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/geneediting-stops-virus-transmission-within-human-body-101626205213510.html

14-07-2021||World||GOP state voting restrictions 'un-American,' Biden declares||President Joe Biden declared that preserving voting rights is “a test of our time” Tuesday as Texas Democrats took dramatic action to stymie their state's latest effort in a nationwide Republican push to tighten ballot restrictions.Biden, who has proclaimed protecting ballot access the central cause of his presidency, has faced sharp criticism from allies for not doing more, though political headwinds and stubborn Senate math have greatly limited its ability to act.Speaking at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Biden called the efforts to curtail voting accessibility “un-American” and “un-democratic" and launched a broadside against his predecessor, Donald Trump, who baselessly alleged misconduct in the 2020 election after his defeat. Biden called passage of congressional proposals to override the new state voting restrictions and to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act that were curbed in recent years by the Supreme Court “a national imperative."Biden's remarks came a day after Texas Democrats decamped for Washington in an effort to deny their GOP-controlled Legislature the necessary quorum to pass a bill placing new restrictions on voting in the state.The lawmakers, who arrived in the nation's capital Monday night, said they were prepared to stay in Washington — out of the reach of Texas law enforcement — until a special legislative session concludes early next month. It marks a dramatic new showdown over voting in America.Standing near the steps of the U.S. Capitol for a news conference ahead of a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the Democrats promised to “stay out and kill this bill.”However, state Rep. Chris Turner, the leader of the Texas Legislature’s House Democrats, predicted that their efforts would ultimately be futile unless congressional Democrats take bolder action to overcome a Senate Republican blockade of the sweeping federal voting bill. The legislation, known as the For the People Act, would create national standards for voting that could roll back some of the restrictions that have been approved or are advancing in the Republican-led states, including Texas.“We can’t hold this tide back forever. We’re buying some time. We need Congress and all of our federal leaders to use that time wisely,” Turner said.Several states have enacted new voting restrictions, and others are debating them, as the GOP has seized on Trump’s false claim of massive voter fraud in the 2020 election as a rationale for curtailing ballot access.“No other election has ever been held under such scrutiny, such high standards,” Biden said of the 2020 race.Some GOP-led states have worked to roll back the vote-by-mail expansion that was put in place in the past presidential election due to COVID-19 fears. Others have tried to strengthen voter identification requirements and curtail hours and locations for early voting and ballot drop-offs.Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he would keep calling special sessions through next year if necessary to pass his state's legislation, and raised the possibility of Democrats facing arrest upon returning home.Biden’s speech in Philadelphia, to be delivered at the National Constitution Center, is intended as the opening salvo of a public pressure campaign, White House aides said, even as legislative options to block voting restrictions face significant obstacles.“He’ll lay out the moral case for why denying the right to vote is a form of suppression and a form of silencing,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. “He will redouble his commitment to using every tool at his disposal to continue to fight to protect the fundamental right of Americans to vote against the onslaught of voter suppression laws.”Asked whether Biden thinks the Texas legislators are doing the right thing by leaving the state, White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said “he applauds their courage." She said that in the administration's view, the Texas bill is an “assault on democracy.”Democrats on Capitol Hill have already tried to respond with a sweeping federal voting and elections bill that Senate Republicans have united to block. Most Republicans have similarly dismissed a separate bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore sections of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court has weakened.Those roadblocks have increased focus on Senate filibuster rules, which, if left in place, would seem to provide an insurmountable roadblock, requiring 60 votes in the evenly split, 100-member chamber to even bring up controversial legislation. Republicans have been unanimous in opposition to eliminating the filibuster, and it would take elimination or at least modification for the bills to have a chance of passage.Moderate Democrats including Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona also have so far expressed reluctance to changing the Senate rules.Many Democrats have expressed frustration with the lack of a greater White House push to change the filibuster, with civil rights activists stressing that Biden was elected with broad support from Black people whose votes are often put at risk by voting restrictions. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, a longtime Biden ally, urged this week that the filibuster be modified for voting rights legislation.Biden, himself a veteran of the Senate, has offered some support for filibuster changes. But he has not put his full political weight behind the issue, believing it counterproductive in both the legislative and political fights over voting. He and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is leading the administration’s efforts on voting rights, met last week with some of the civil rights leaders, who made clear that they expected a legislative solution.Harris is to meet with the Texas lawmakers this week, her office said.“Our backs are against the wall. This is the moment. We have no more time,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, after the meeting. “I told the president: We will not be able to litigate our way out of this threat to Black citizenship.”Although not abandoning hope of legislative action, the West Wing has been shifting focus to other measures to protect voting, including legal remedies pursued by the Justice Department and action in individual states, according to officials. There also will be an emphasis on boosting voter turnout, with aides pointing to success Democrats had in getting out votes last year during the height of the pandemic.Officials concede, though, that turning out voters is always harder in a nonpresidential election year. Some frustrated aides, seeing the reality in the Senate, believe too much of a focus has been placed on federal legislative measures and think that civic and business groups can also play a role in fighting the voting restrictions. They note that an outcry in Georgia helped water down some of the GOP’s proposed plans there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gop-state-voting-restrictions-un-american-biden-declares-101626204277173.html
