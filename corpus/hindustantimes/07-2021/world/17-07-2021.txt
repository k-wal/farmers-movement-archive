Belgium’s national crisis centre said the country’s confirmed death toll rose to 27.By Saturday, authorities still feared finding more people dead as the receding floodwaters eased access across much of the affected regions and revealed the extent of the damage.“A lot of people have lost everything they spent their lives building up - their possessions, their home, the roof over their heads,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on a visit to the town of Erftstadt. “It may only be possible to clear up in weeks how much damage needs to be compensated.”Across the border in eastern Belgium, train lines and roads remained blocked in many areas. Southern parts of the Netherlands also have been hit by heavy flooding.In Switzerland, heavy rain has caused several rivers and lakes to burst their banks, with authorities in the city of Lucerne closing several pedestrian bridges over the Reuss river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-flood-death-toll-tops-160-101626545422650.html

The president is not expected to be discharged from the hospital yet," said a medical report released by the private hospital Vila Nova Star.Bolsonaro, 66, complained of having hiccups for more than 10 days and was hospitalized early Wednesday morning at the Armed Forces Hospital in Brasilia.Antonio Macedo, the president's personal gastric surgeon, ordered the transfer to the Vila Nova Star hospital on Wednesday to evaluate whether he needed surgery, which has been ruled out for the moment.Since a stabbing attack in September 2018 during an election rally as a presidential candidate, Bolsonaro has had six surgeries, four of them linked to the wounds he received. Meanwhile, Government Secretary Luiz Eduardo Ramos reported on Twitter, "The president is well, back to work and conversing by videoconference."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-president-s-health-improves-remains-hospitalized-101626541677184.html
17-07-2021||World||'We are overjoyed': Pilgrims arrive in Mecca for second pandemic hajj||Pilgrims began arriving in the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca Saturday for the second downsized hajj staged during the coronavirus pandemic, circling Islam's holiest site in masks and on distanced paths.The kingdom is allowing only 60,000 fully vaccinated residents to take part, seeking to repeat last year's success that saw no virus outbreak during the five-day ritual.This year's hajj, with participants chosen through a lottery, is larger than the pared-down version staged in 2020 but drastically smaller than in normal times, stoking resentment among Muslims abroad who are barred once again.After boarding buses to Mecca's Grand Mosque, pilgrims began performing the "tawaf", the circumambulation of the Kaaba, a large cubic structure draped in golden-embroidered black cloth, towards which Muslims around the world pray.Many carried umbrellas to protect themselves from the scorching summer heat."Every three hours, 6,000 people enter to perform the tawaf of arrival," hajj ministry spokesman Hisham al-Saeed told AFP. "After each group leaves, a sterilisation process is carried out at the sanctuary."- Golden ticket -The hajj, usually one of the world's largest annual religious gatherings with some 2.5 million people taking part in 2019, is one of the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken by all Muslims with the means at least once in their lives.It consists of a series of religious rites, formally starting on Sunday, which are completed over five days in Islam's holiest city and its surroundings in western Saudi Arabia.Among the chosen ones this year was Ameen, a 58-year-old Indian oil contractor based in the eastern city of Dammam, who was picked for the ritual along with his wife and three adult children."We are overjoyed," said Ameen. "So many of our friends and relatives were rejected."Like the other countries of the Gulf, Saudi Arabia is home to significant expatriate populations from South Asia, the Far East, Africa and the Middle East."I feel like I won a lottery," Egyptian pharmacist Mohammed El Eter said after being selected."This is a special, unforgettable moment in one's life. I thank God for granting me this chance, to be accepted among a lot of people who applied," the 31-year-old said.On Sunday the pilgrims will move on to Mina, around five kilometres (three miles) away from the Grand Mosque, ahead of the main rite at Mount Arafat, where it is believed that the Prophet Mohammed delivered his final sermon.- 'Restrict exposure' -Chosen from more than 558,000 applicants through an online vetting system, the event is confined to those who have been fully vaccinated and are aged 18-65 with no chronic illnesses, according to the hajj ministry.The experience for some women in attendance has been boosted by them no longer being required to be under male supervision -- a stipulation dropped over 18 months ago."So many women are also going with me, so I am very proud that we are now independent (and) we don't need any mahram (male guardian)," said pilgrim Bushra Ali Shah, a Pakistani resident of Jeddah.The hajj ministry has said it is working on the "highest levels of health precautions" in light of the pandemic and the emergence of new variants.Pilgrims are being divided into groups of just 20 "to restrict any exposure to only those 20, limiting the spread of infection", ministry undersecretary Mohammad al-Bijawi told official media.Saudi Arabia has so far recorded more than 507,000 coronavirus infections, including over 8,000 deaths.Some 20 million vaccine doses have been administered in the country of over 34 million people.The hajj went ahead last year on the smallest scale in modern history. Authorities initially said only 1,000 pilgrims would be allowed, although local media said up to 10,000 eventually took part.No infections were reported as authorities set up multiple health facilities, mobile clinics and ambulances to cater for the pilgrims, who were taken to the religious sites in small batches.- 'Biggest challenge' -In normal years, the pilgrimage packs large crowds into congested religious sites, but even this year's downscaled events are seen as a potential mechanism for contagion.Worshippers were last year given amenity kits including sterilised pebbles for the "stoning of Satan" ritual, disinfectants, masks, a prayer rug and the ihram, a traditional seamless white hajj garment, made from a bacteria-resistant material.Hosting the hajj is a matter of prestige for Saudi rulers, for whom the custodianship of Islam's holiest sites is their most powerful source of political legitimacy.But barring overseas pilgrims has caused deep disappointment among Muslims worldwide, who typically save for years to take part.The hajj ministry received anguished queries on Twitter from rejected applicants about the tightly-controlled government lottery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-overjoyed-pilgrims-arrive-in-mecca-for-second-pandemic-hajj-101626542994262.html
17-07-2021||World||People with learning disabilities more vulnerable to effects of Covid-19: Report||A study conducted by a team of researchers in the United Kingdom has suggested that people with disabilities, who contract the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), are five times more likely to be hospitalised and eight times more likely to succumb due to Covid-19 than the general population of England. Published in the journal "The BMJ," the study also found that risks were particularly high for people with severe to profound disabilities, Down's syndrome, and cerebral palsy.Also Read | NHS doctor asks not to follow UK health secretary advice on lateral flow tests. Here's whyTo study the effect of Covid-19 on people with disabilities, the team of researchers analysed the data for 14,312,023 adults and 2,627,018 children across both wave of the coronavirus pandemic. While the first wave was registered from March 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020, the second wave was registered from September 1, 2020, till February 8, 2021.The results of the study for the 90,307 adults on the disability register were as follows: 538 (or 0.6%) had a Covid-19 related hospitalisation, there were 222 deaths (0.25%) due to the viral disease and 602 fatalities (0.66%) were not related to the infection.Also Read | Fully vaccinated UK health secretary Sajid Javid tests positive for Covid-19On the other hand, the corresponding numbers for more than 14 million adults not on the disability register were as follows: 29,781 (or 0.20%) had a Covid-19 related hospitalisation, there were 13,737 deaths (0.1%) due to the viral disease and 69,837 fatalities (0.5%) fatalities were not related to it.Next, potentially influencing factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, geographical location were accounted for and it was found that adults who contract coronavirus had a five-fold higher risk of hospitalisation, as well as eight-fold higher risk of deaths than adults not on the disability register.Similar patterns were recorded among children as well though the researchers mentioned that absolute risk of hospitalisation and death were "small."However, the researchers clarified that these were observational findings and, as such, have some limitations, including focusing only on severe Covid-19 outcomes and the inability to identify everyone with a learning disability from medical records alone.Finally, the study concluded that besides vaccination, efforts to protect people with learning disabilities from severe Covid-19 outcomes should continue. It also called for further research on the excess Covid-19 risks on people with Down's Syndrome and cerebral palsy.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-with-learning-disabilities-more-vulnerable-to-effects-of-covid-19-report-101626537945360.html
17-07-2021||World||Austria, US probe reports of 'Havana syndrome' among diplomats, intelligence officials||Austria and the US said Saturday they were investigating reports of US diplomats and other officials in Vienna falling sick with health problems similar to the so-called "Havana syndrome".US senators in May said that the government was investigating an apparent increase in mysterious directed-energy attacks, amid new reports of potentially brain-damaging incidents inside the US.The still unexplained attacks have caused sickness and even brain damage in US diplomats and intelligence officials in Cuba, China, Russia and other countries.Moscow is suspected to be behind them, even if the mechanism for them has yet to be explained. Scientists have theorised that the attacks arise from pulsed microwaves.Since the first attacks were reported in Cuba in 2016, and after that in China, scientists and doctors have debated the causes and effects, without a uniform conclusion.The New Yorker reported on Friday that since Joe Biden took office this year, about two dozen US intelligence officers, diplomats and other government officials in Vienna have reported problems similar to the "Havana syndrome".Austria's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was "working with the US authorities on a joint investigation in accordance with our role as the host state"."We take these reports very seriously.... The safety of the diplomats sent to Austria and their families is our top priority," it said without giving further details.A US State Department spokesperson said they were "vigorously investigating reports of possible unexplained health incidents (UHI) among the US Embassy Vienna community or wherever they are reported".The official added that "any employees who reported a possible UHI received immediate and appropriate attention and care".Among other steps, the US has already set up a team of medical experts that can address these problems globally and is working to "better protect against these events in the future", the official added.Austria hosts a large corps of foreign diplomats working at several Vienna-based UN and other international organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-us-probe-reports-of-havana-syndrome-among-diplomats-intelligence-officials-101626542366480.html

Here's why||A UK doctor said that country’s health secretary Sajid Javid has given incorrect advice about lateral flow tests (LFTs) while announcing his test result for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Javid posted a video message on Twitter, saying he took a lateral flow test as he was feeling “groggy” and was tested positive for the virus.“If like me you might feel a bit groggy or you think you might have come into contact with someone who is positive, please also take a lateral flow test too,” he added.Rachel Clark, an NHS doctor, said that LFTs are for those without symptoms, urging people to not follow Javid’s advice. She also posted a link of NHS guidance on asymptomatic testing and asked the health secretary to delete the video.“Here’s the NHS guidance on LFTs. They’re for asymptomatic testing. If you have symptoms, you need to book a PCR test.@sajidjavid please will you consider deleting this video? It contradicts NHS advice & may well mislead the public,” she wrote.If you feel unwell:Please *don’t* do what Sajid Javid describes here. LFTs are for those without symptoms, as the NHS website clearly states.A negative LFT does *not* rule out Covid.If you have Covid symptoms, book a PCR test & self-isolate until the result is back 🙏 https://t.co/aK9qGDRugyAlso Read | Fully vaccinated UK health secretary Sajid Javid tests positive for Covid-19On Saturday, Britain reported 54,674 new Covid-19 cases, posting a fresh highest daily total in six months, largely driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. But the newly-appointed health secretary has backed Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to remove almost all restrictions from Monday even as scientists and experts have warned against it.After Javid tested positive for Covid-19, Liberal Democrats renewed their call to drop the “reckless” plan of ending lockdown restrictions on Monday. Munira Wilson, health & social care spokesperson for Liberal Democrats, said no one is safe from this deadly virus since Javid was fully vaccinated against Covid-19.“By easing all restrictions with cases surging, they are experimenting with people’s lives. Right now, they are pursuing a strategy of survival of the fittest, where the young and clinically vulnerable will be left defenceless,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nhs-doctor-asks-not-to-follow-uk-health-secretary-advice-on-lateral-flow-tests-101626541219636.html
17-07-2021||World||UN appeals to assist Afghanistan's war crisis with $850 million||The UN humanitarian chief in Afghanistan appealed for USD 850 million Thursday to help the war-torn country cope with the impact of the Taliban offensive, protracted malnutrition for a third of the country, a severe drought, and the return of 627,000 Afghans this year, most of them deported from neighbouring Iran.Ramiz Alakbarov told reporters at UN headquarters after a virtual briefing from the capital of Kabul that at least 18 million Afghans are in need of assistance and the UN plan is to provide help for at least 15.7 million of them.But he said the UN's USD 1.3 billion appeal is only 37 per cent funded -- USD 450 million — with the United States the largest donor. He said the remaining the USD 850 million being sought is desperately needed.As American and NATO troops complete their pullout from Afghanistan after nearly 20 years, the Taliban in recent weeks have gained control of many districts and key border posts with neighbours Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In many instances, Afghan security forces and military have put up little or no resistance after often being left without supplies or reinforcements.Alakbarov said the second drought in three years and the Taliban's offensive have led 270,000 people to flee their homes in rural areas toward urban areas and regional centers, where they need food, water, shelter and sanitation.The UN is also seeing “very intensive movements of population in the areas when the Iranian and Pakistan borders are now largely closed,” with Afghans trying to use paths away from the official crossings to try to leave the country, he said.Alakbarov expressed hope that Afghanistan's neighbours will look at the situation in terms of human rights and their responsibility to protect people from suffering and allow Afghan refugees into their countries.The United Nations registered 627,000 Afghans who have returned from neighboring countries so far this year, he said, and “most of them are from Iran.”Alakbarov reported a significant increase in attacks on humanitarian workers this year. He said 35 humanitarian workers have been killed and 63 injured, which “represents a 30 per cent increase compared to last year.”He also reported threats and interference involving aid staffers, citing 1,095 incidents in the first six months of 2021, compared to 1,100 in all of 2020.He said most difficulties faced by aid workers arise from military activity, including having to deal with mines on roads, being caught in cross-fire, and coming under attack from groups that target female health workers, women who do vaccinations and mine-clearing teams.Alakbarov said that in the current situation, “everything is a challenge" and “Covid-19 hasn't made it easier,” with deaths from the coronavirus doubling in the last 2½ months.While the UN has humanitarian supplies in Afghanistan for needs through August, he said, the closure of border crossings could pose future problems. He added the insuring security at Kabul airport is absolutely imperative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-appeals-to-assist-afghanistan-s-war-crisis-with-850-million-101626540155528.html
17-07-2021||World||'Deeply disappointing': Biden pledges to appeal against DACA ruling||President Joe Biden said Saturday that the Justice Department intends to appeal a federal judge's ruling deeming illegal an Obama-era program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation and he renewed his calls for Congress to create a permanent solution.He said in a statement that Friday's decision was “deeply disappointing,” and although the judge's order did not affect those already covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, it ”relegates hundreds of thousands of young immigrants to an uncertain future.”The program has allowed thousands of young people who were brought illegally into the United States as children, or overstayed visas, to live, work and remain in the country. Many of the recipients, commonly known as “Dreamers,” have now been in the US for a decade or longer.But Texas and eight other states sued to halt DACA, arguing that President Barack Obama lacked the power to create the program because it circumvented Congress.US District Judge Andrew Hanen in Houston agreed, and while his ruling left the program intact for existing recipients, it barred the government from approving any new applications.In his statement, Biden urged Congress to move forward with legislation to permanently protect those covered by the program."Only Congress can ensure a permanent solution by granting a path to citizenship for Dreamers that will provide the certainty and stability that these young people need and deserve,” the president said.“I have repeatedly called on Congress to pass the American Dream and Promise Act, and I now renew that call with the greatest urgency," he said."It is my fervent hope that through reconciliation or other means, Congress will finally provide security to all Dreamers, who have lived too long in fear.”The House approved legislation in March creating a pathway toward citizenship for those impacted, but the measure has stalled in the Senate.Immigration advocates hope to include a provision in sweeping budget legislation Democrats want to pass this year, but it's unclear whether that language will survive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-disappointing-biden-pledges-to-appeal-against-daca-ruling-101626536610594.html

Nasa’s Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard the Aqua satellite captured the progression of the heat dome during an unprecedented heat wave across the southwestern US from July 1 to July 12.In the seven-second clip shared by Nasa, the animation shows surface air temperature anomalies. The hottest areas, which experienced surface air temperatures of more than 5.6 degrees Celsius above average, are shown in pink. Another Nasa instrument, ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), captured ground surface temperature data over California.The image captured by ECOSTRESS shows areas in red that surpassed 30 degrees Celsius on July 8, well above average ground surface temperatures for the area. The next day, Death Valley, a desert valley in Eastern California, recorded a high air temperature of 54.44 degrees Celsius, falling just a few degrees short of the official all-time surface air temperature record of 56.67 degrees Celsius in 1913.Scientists have warned that the unprecedented heat wave is not possible without the impact of climate change. The recent heat wave claimed hundreds of lives in Pacific Northwest and British Columbia.Meanwhile, reports have emerged that another heat wave is building up during the weekend and will reach its peak on Monday. The heat wave will not be as extreme as the earlier one, but it will be unusually hot, according to The Washington Post.The US national weather service has predicted high temperatures throughout the Northern Plains and into parts of northern and central Minnesota.“This heat wave will exacerbate the severe to exceptional drought currently found across the region, which in combination can make for an environment ripe for wildfires to spread uncontrollably,” the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-tracks-soaring-temperatures-amid-reports-of-another-heat-wave-in-us-canada-101626533435943.html

17-07-2021||World||'Hadn’t seen anything like that': Scientists stunned by rare Arctic lightning||Meteorologists were stunned this week when three successive thunderstorms swept across the icy Arctic from Siberia to north of Alaska, unleashing lightning bolts in an unusual phenomenon that scientists say will become less rare with global warming.“Forecasters hadn’t seen anything like that before,” said Ed Plumb, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Fairbanks, speaking about the storms that started on Saturday.Typically, the air over the Arctic Ocean, especially when the water is covered with ice, lacks the convective heat needed to generate lightning storms.But as climate change warms the Arctic faster than the rest of the world, that's changing, scientists say.Episodes of summer lightning within the Arctic Circle have tripled since 2010, a trend directly tied to climate change and increasing loss of sea ice in the far north, scientists reported in a March study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. As sea ice vanishes, more water is able to evaporate, adding moisture to the warming atmosphere.“It’s going to go with the temperatures,” said co-author Robert Holzworth, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle.These electrical storms threaten boreal forests fringing the Arctic, as they spark fires in remote regions already baking under the round-the-clock summer sun. Boreal Siberia in Russia gets more lightning than any other Arctic region, Holzworth said.The paper also documented more frequent lightning over the Arctic’s treeless tundra regions, as well as above the Arctic Ocean and pack ice. In August 2019, lightning even struck within 60 miles (100 kilometers) of the North Pole, the researchers found.In Alaska alone, thunderstorm activity is on track to increase three-fold by the end of the century if current climate trends continue, according to two studies by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, published over the last year in the journal Climate Dynamics.“What used to be very rare is now just rare,” said Rick Thoman, a climate scientist with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. As the parade of Arctic storms this week demonstrated, lightning is already appearing in unexpected places, he said. “I have no memory of three consecutive days of this kind of thing” in the Arctic.With the sharp uptick in lightning, Siberia has seen increasingly ferocious forest fires in recent years. This week, the Russian army deployed water-dropping aircraft to douse flames burning some nearly 2 million acres (800,000 hectares) of forest, while the hardest-hit region of Yakutia has been in a state of emergency for weeks.Meanwhile, mid-June lightning sparked one of the biggest fires this summer in Alaska, scorching more than 18,000 acres of tundra about 125 miles (200 km) north of the Arctic Circle in the Noatak National Preserve in the northwestern corner of the state.Warming in the Arctic is also encouraging the growth of vegetation on northern Alaska's tundra, adding further fuel for fires, scientists said.By the end of the century, twice as much Alaska tundra could burn on a regular basis than was the norm in the past, with fires occurring four times more frequently, according to researchers at the International Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks.On the water, the lightning is an increasing hazard to mariners, and vessel traffic is increasing as sea ice retreats, Holzworth said.People can become lightning rods and usually try to get low for safety. That's tough to do on flat tundra or ocean expanse.“What you really need is to pay better attention to the lightning forecasts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hadnt-seen-anything-like-that-scientists-stunned-by-rare-arctic-lightning-101626524660365.html
17-07-2021||World||Afghanistan says envoy’s daughter kidnapped, tortured in Pakistan||Afghanistan on Saturday demanded full security for its diplomats in Pakistan following the abduction and torture of the daughter of the Afghan ambassador by unidentified persons in Islamabad.The development came against the backdrop of strained ties between the two countries and Afghanistan’s accusation that the Pakistan government isn’t doing enough to nudge the Taliban to join peace talks to find a political settlement.The Afghan foreign ministry summoned Pakistani ambassador Mansoor Ahmad Khan in Kabul to lodge a strong protest over what it described as a “grave incident”. The ministry called on the Pakistan government to take “immediate action to identify and punish the perpetrators of this crime” and ensure the full security of Afghan diplomats and their families in line with international conventions.Pakistan’s Foreign Office described the incident as an act of “man-handling” that occurred while the envoy’s daughter was riding in a rented vehicle on Friday. Islamabad Police have launched an investigation and the security of the Afghan envoy and his family has been beefed up. “Such incidents can and will not be tolerated,” the Foreign Office said.The Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement that Silsila Alikhil, the daughter of Afghan envoy Najibullah Alikhel, was held for several hours by the unidentified persons who kidnapped her.“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan states with deep regret that on July 16, 2021, the daughter of the Afghan ambassador to Islamabad Ms Silsila Alikhil, was abducted for several hours and severely tortured by unknown individuals on her way home,” the statement said.“After being released from the kidnappers’ captivity, Ms Alikhil is under medical care at the hospital,” it said.Reports said the Afghan envoy’s daughter was kidnapped from Blue Area, a commercial district in the heart of Islamabad, at around 1.45 pm Pakistan time. She was freed by her abductors at about 7 pm with her hands and feet tied. Her wrists and ankles were swollen and there were other marks of injuries, the reports said.The Afghan foreign ministry said it “strongly condemns this heinous act and expresses its deep concern over the safety and security of diplomats, their families, and staff members of the Afghan political and consular missions in Pakistan”.Afghanistan called on the Pakistan government to “take immediate necessary actions to ensure full security of the Afghan Embassy and Consulates as well as the immunity of the country’s diplomats and their families in accordance with international treaties and conventions”.The Afghan side also urged the Pakistan government to “identify and prosecute the perpetrators at the soonest possible time”.The development came a day after a terse exchange between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan at a regional conference in Uzbekistan over Pakistan’s support to jihadi fighters in Afghanistan and Islamabad’s failure to deliver on its commitment to get the Taliban to join negotiations aimed at finding a political settlement.Addressing a gathering that included external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and deputy national security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and special representative Zalmay Khalilzad, Ghani said intelligence estimates indicated the “influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters from Pakistan and other places in the last month as well as support from their affiliates and the trans-national organisations” for the Taliban.Ghani also said that contrary to the “repeated assurances by Prime Minister Khan and his generals that Pakistan does not find a Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in Pakistan’s interest and short of use of force, will use its power to influence to make the Taliban negotiate seriously”, organisations supporting the Taliban were celebrating the destruction of assets and capabilities of Afghanistan.He called on Pakistan to “use its influence and leverage for peace and cessation of hostilities”.Khan said he was “disappointed” that Pakistan is being blamed for what is going on in Afghanistan. “We have made every effort short of taking military action against Taliban in Pakistan...to get them on the dialogue table and to have a peaceful settlement there,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-says-envoy-s-daughter-kidnapped-tortured-in-pakistan-101626525016893.html
17-07-2021||World||Russia to unveil new fighter jet at Moscow's air show||Russian aircraft makers say they will present a prospective new fighter jet at a Moscow air show that opens next week.The new warplane hidden under tarpaulin was photographed being towed to a parking spot across an airfield in Zhukovsky, outside Moscow, where the MAKS-2021 International Aviation and Space Salon opens Tuesday. Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to visit the show's opening.Russian media reports said that the new jet has been built by the Sukhoi aircraft maker in a programme of development of a light tactical fighter.Unlike Russia's latest Su-57 two-engine stealth fighter, the new aircraft is smaller and has one engine.The new warplane's name is unknown, and there is no information about its capability and deployment prospects.Rostec, the state corporation that includes Russian aircraft makers, said the "fundamentally new military aircraft” will be unveiled Tuesday at the show. In an apparent bid to raise public interest before the presentation, Rostec published a picture of the new plane covered by tarpaulin with “wanna see me naked?” written under it. It also posted a brief video featuring excited foreign customers and the jet's vague shadow over the water.Following the Rostec announcement, Russian plane spotters rushed to Zhukovsky to take pictures of the new plane — an eerie parallel with Cold War times when Western spies tried to get a glimpse of the latest Soviet warplanes at the tightly-guarded airfield that served as the country's top military aircraft test facility.“Russia is one of the few countries in the world with full-cycle capacities for producing advanced aircraft systems, as well as a recognized trendsetter in the creation of combat aircraft," Rostec said.The Kremlin has made modernization of the country's armed forces a top priority amid a bitter strain in relations with the West, which have sunk to post-Cold War lows after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, accusations of Russian interference in elections, hacking attacks and other irritants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-unveil-new-fighter-jet-at-moscow-s-air-show-101626520551695.html

17-07-2021||World||France to allow travellers vaccinated with Covishield after 'Green Pass' row||France has joined several other European countries to allow international travellers who have been administered Covishield, a version of AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). Many EU member states have started accepting visitors vaccinated with Covishield after global outcry over the fact that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has not recognised the India-made vaccine for the ‘Green Pass’."Because the vaccines are effective against the virus, and in particular its variant Delta, the constraints weighing on travellers benefiting from a complete vaccination schedule with a vaccine recognised by the European Medicines Agency (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Janssen) will be raised from this Saturday, July 17, regardless of the country of origin," French Prime Minister Jean Castex said in a statement.The technical specifications of the ‘Green Pass’ suggests that obligation on the EU member states would be limited to “vaccines that have received EU-wide marketing authorization.” The EMA has approved Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech), Moderna, Vaxzervria (AstraZeneca), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson). But the member states have the option to allow travellers with vaccination certificates other than those approved by the EMA.After the controversy over the EU digital Covid certificate erupted in late June, SII chief Adar Poonawalla said that the company is expecting to receive approval from the EMA within a month. Taking to Twitter, Poonawalla said that he has taken up the issue at the “highest levels” and “hope to resolve this matter soon, both with regulators and at a diplomatic level with countries."Poonawalla had then said that the EMA was “absolutely correct” in asking the SII to apply for approval, adding that the company has already applied for it through AstraZeneca. "We are quite confident that in a month EMA will approve Covishield. There is no reason why not to because it is based on AstraZeneca data and our product is identical to AstraZeneca more or less and it has been approved by WHO, UK MHRA," Poonawalla added.The EMA, however, on Thursday said that it has not received a formal marketing authorisation application from the developer to date. It stressed that the manufacturer needs to submit the application for Covidshield to be evaluated for use in the European Union. The EU health regulator also said that it evaluates vaccines and medicines for their use in the EU and it has no responsibility regarding vaccinations accepted for travel purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-allow-travellers-vaccinated-with-covishield-after-green-pass-row-101626518168431.html
17-07-2021||World||Syrian President Assad takes oath for 4th term after controversial re-election||Syrian President Bashar Assad was sworn in Saturday for a fourth seven-year term in the war-torn country.The May elections were described by the West and Assad's opposition as illegitimate and a sham.The swearing-in ceremony was held at the presidential palace and attended by clergymen, members of parliament, political figures and army officers.In power since 2000, Assad's re-election in a landslide was never in doubt. His new term starts with the country still devastated by 10 years of war and sliding deeper into a worsening economic crisis.The U.N. estimates that more than 80% of Syrians live under the poverty line. The Syrian currency is in a free fall and basic services and resources have become scarce or are offered at exorbitant parallel market prices. Fighting has largely subsided, but parts of Syria remain out of government-control and foreign troops and militias are deployed in different parts of the country.Nearly half of Syria's pre-war population is either displaced or living in neighbouring countries or Europe as refugees. The war has left nearly half a million killed, tens of thousands missing and devastated the infrastructure.The conflict that began in 2011 started after the government cracked down on peaceful protests, turning the opposition against the decades-long rule of the Assad family into an armed rebellion.Assad, targeted by widening sanctions and isolated by the West, is supported by Iran and Russia, who sent in troops and assistance that have propped him up throughout the war.European and U.S. governments blame Assad and his aides for most of the war's atrocities. Assad calls his armed opposition terrorists while U.N.-led talks to end the conflict have lacked any progress.Assad took over in 2000 after the death of his father Hafez, who seized power in 1970 in a bloodless military coup.U.S. and European officials have questioned the legitimacy of the election, saying it violated U.N. resolutions in place to resolve the conflict, lacks any international monitoring and is unrepresentative of all Syrians.Assad garnered 95.1% of the vote in the election, in which officials said turnout was 78.6% of some 18 million registered voters. There were no independent monitors of the one-day vote. Competition was symbolic, with two candidates running against Assad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-president-assad-takes-oath-for-4th-term-after-controversial-reelection-101626516297291.html

Jeremy Hunt, chairman of the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that hospitalisations related to coronavirus are doubling every two weeks and about 10,000 Covid-19 patients could end up in hospital by the end of August, twice the number than last year.“The warning light on the NHS dashboard is not flashing amber, it is flashing red,” he said. “It is a very serious situation.”On Friday, the UK reported more than 51,000 new Covid-19 cases, the highest in six months. The worrying third Covid wave, mainly driven by the Delta variant, has prompted scientists and experts around the world to warn the government against removing all restrictions. More than 1,200 scientists have backed a letter published in The Lancet earlier this month, calling the decision “dangerous and unethical.”Meanwhile, the UK government has shown no sign of backtracking from its decision, even though it has toned down on branding July 19 as the “Freedom Day.” Hunt predicted that the country is “almost certainly” going to witness a record daily peak by September. The current daily record of new Covid cases was reported in early January with nearly 68,000 cases.“If they are still going up as the schools are coming back I think we are going to have to reconsider some very difficult decisions. How we behave over the next few weeks will have a material difference,” he added.Britain has pinned its hopes on high vaccination rates, with more than 52% of the population fully vaccinated and 16% partly vaccinated. But a large population is still vulnerable to the virus, given the reduced efficacy of vaccines, as per various studies, against variants of concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-flashing-red-former-uk-health-secretary-warns-govt-may-have-to-reimpose-lockdown-101626513217551.html

It all started when the buried remains of 215 children were found in Kamloops, British Columbia, on May 28. On June 23, 751 more such unmarked graves were found in Marieval in the province of Saskatchewan, and a week later, 182 were located in Cranbrook, also in British Columbia. The latest discovery was on July 12, as 160 were found at the site of the former Kuper Island Indian Industrial School.The chilling discoveries sparked a rash of incidents of churches across the country being burned down, with Christian groups estimating the number at close to 50. BCCLA board president David Fai said, “Words matter. Context matters… A tweet by our executive director on her personal account failed in that regard… We regret the misunderstanding that was caused by the tweet and apologise for the harm the words caused.”He added that the BCCLA acknowledged the “anger, frustration, and sadness many people feel after the confirmation of over 1,000 unmarked graves of indigenous children at various residential school sites”. He also pointed out that following the controversial tweet, the BCCLA “encountered a wave of hateful commentary, fuelled by the fact that our executive director is a racialised woman leader” and Walia and the staff at the organisation were “exposed to inexcusable racism and misogyny”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/church-attacks-head-of-civil-liberties-group-resigns-after-controversial-tweet-101626500955755.html

The death toll in the incident has now risen to more than 150, news agencies reported, adding that hundreds are still missing and homeless while communications remain cut off in major areas still.Floods swept through the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate as well as parts of Belgium and the Netherlands. After days of heavy rain, 103 people have died in Germany alone, the largest number killed in a natural disaster in the country in almost 60 years. They included 12 residents of a home for disabled people surprised by the floods during the night.Streets and houses were submerged by water in some areas, while cars were left overturned on soaked streets after flood waters passed. Some districts were completely cut off.In Belgium, which has declared a day of mourning on Tuesday, officials said there were at least 20 dead and another 20 missing, with more than 21,000 people left without electricity in one region.Thousands of residents in the north of Limburg province in neighbouring Netherlands were ordered to leave their homes early Friday as floodwaters peaked. Emergency services were on high alert, and authorities were also reinforcing dikes along vulnerable stretches where floodwaters continue to rise.Waters were receding in the southern city of Maastricht, where there was no flooding and in the town of Valkenburg, where damage was widespread, but no one was hurt. In the town of Maaseik, on the Dutch border, the Meuse had risen beyond a retaining wall and was spilling past sandbags placed on top.Floods at the Elbe river in 2002, which at the time were billed by media as "once-in-a-century floods", killed 21 people in eastern Germany and more than 100 across the wider central European region.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floods-in-western-europe-death-toll-nears-130-hundreds-missing-still-101626498717539.html

Doug Ducey issued an emergency declaration earlier Friday for Coconino County, making up to $200,000 available for response to flash flooding in the Flagstaff area. Residents reported streams of water flowing through their yards and on the busiest city streets.The city of Flagstaff and Coconino County opened a joint emergency operations center. Some of the flooding occurred in neighborhoods that sit in the shadow of a mountain that burned in 2019.“Severe post-wildfire flooding is creating dangerous challenges for communities in northern Arizona,” Ducey said Friday. “The flooding is causing road closures, damaging property and putting Arizonans’ safety at risk.”The National Weather Service issued a barrage of weather statements on Friday, warning of flood potential across the state. Many places have received more rain in the past month than in the entire 2020 monsoon season, which ran from mid-June through September, the weather service said.“Torrential rainfall” sent flood waters flowing across State Highway 87 about 70 miles (112 kilometers) southeast of Flagstaff at one point Friday evening between Payson and Pine, the service said. The city of Flagstaff said many sections of its urban trail system were damaged and impassable due to recent flooding.The service also issued a dust warning Friday night on the southwest edge of Phoenix where winds in excess of 40 mph (64 kph) created a wall of dust that reduced visibility to less than a quarter-mile across an area that included parts of U.S. Interstates 10 and 8.At least one death has been attributed to flooding. Grand Canyon National Park on Friday identified a woman who was found in the frigid Colorado River after a flash flood swept through her rafting group's trip.Rebecca Copeland, 29, of Ann Arbor, Michigan was found Thursday near the camp where the group of 30 had set up the night before, park officials said. Much of the group's belongings were washed away after a torrent of water rushed through a slot canyon above them.Park spokeswoman Kaitlyn Thomas said a handful of people were “very seriously bludgeoned by the debris.” A handful of them had to be evacuated by air from the canyon, the park said.A different commercial rafting group found Copeland and another woman who initially was reported missing. Thomas said she didn't know whether that group actively was searching for the missing people at the time.“I am confident that the river community did know something was up but I imagine they were on the lookout," she said.The National Park Service and the Coconino County examiner are investigating the incident, the park said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arizona-hit-by-floods-thrice-governor-declares-emergency-as-flagstaff-inundated-101626497140208.html
17-07-2021||World||World Day for International Justice 2021: Theme, history and significance||World Day for International Justice is observed across the globe on July 17 every year to mark an emerging modern system of justice against international criminal acts. The reason behind observing such an occasion on this date is that the International Criminal Court (ICC) was formally established on July 17, following the adoption of the Rome Statute.The Day of International Criminal Justice is celebrated by honouring individuals working to advocate the fundamental human rights of victims affected by criminal acts. People also come together around the world to host events promoting international criminal justice and support for the ICC.World Day for International Justice: History and backgroundWorld Day for International Justice is marked around the globe on July 17. The date has a special significance. According to the International Criminal Court, it was decided by the Assembly of State Parties to observe July 17 as the Day of International Criminal Justice. The decision was taken at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute held in Uganda's Kampala town back on June 1, 2010.World Day for International Justice: ThemeThis year's theme for the Day of International Criminal Justice is "social justice in the digital economy", a timely topic for a modern age where criminals are increasingly relying on advanced internet-based means instead of traditional criminal tactics.World Day for International Justice: ImportanceTechnological developments over the last decade have helped human beings navigate the Covid-19 landscape. Employees are being able to work from home because of what the UN refers to as “digital labour platforms," providing "income-generating possibilities and advantages from flexible work arrangements."However, there is also the added risk of criminal acts resorting to digital means, even more so when the streets continue to be under strict vigil over pandemic-appropriate behaviour. The real threat may be remote, experts say, exacerbating the need to spread awareness over criminal justice on a digital platform.What is the International Criminal Court?The International Criminal Court, or ICC, investigates and, where warranted, tries individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. As a court of last resort, it seeks to complement, not replace, national courts.The International Criminal Court is governed by the international treaty called the Rome Statute. It is also the world's first permanent international criminal court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-day-for-international-justice-2021-theme-history-and-significance-101626493252467.html

17-07-2021||World||Biden says social media misinformation on Covid taking lives; Facebook hits back||President Joe Biden said Friday that social media misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccinations is "killing people" and the White House said Facebook needs to clean up its act."They're killing people. The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated. And they're killing people," Biden told reporters at the White House, as he left for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David.The White House is turning up the pressure on social media companies to weed out what officials say is widely spread misinformation on coronavirus vaccinations.According to US health officials, a current spike in Covid-19 deaths and illnesses around the country is almost exclusively hitting people who remain unvaccinated."There is a clear message that is coming through: this is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated," Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Rochelle Walensky told reporters on Friday.Many of those refusing vaccinations, despite the ease of availability throughout the United States, have said they do not trust the shots.Skepticism is being fueled both by false posts spread by anti-vaccine activists online and by Republican politicians claiming the vaccinations are part of attempts at government control.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Facebook and others are not doing enough to push back."Everybody has a role to play in making sure there's accurate information," she said.Psaki said the White House was taking a more active approach in calling out what it sees as misinformation but insisted that Facebook in particular should react more quickly in taking down problematic posts.Prolific fake news posters"There's about 12 people who are producing 65 percent of anti-vaccine misinformation on social media platforms. All of them remain active on Facebook, despite some even being banned on other platforms," Psaki said, without identifying those dozen posters.The White House has "proposed that they create a robust enforcement strategy that bridges their properties and provides transparency about the rules," she said.The turning up of the volume against fake news immediately drew accusations from right-wing media that Biden was installing a "Big Brother" type surveillance over citizens' opinions.Facebook, which has contracted an army of independent outside fact checkers, including from AFP, to try and clean up its content, pushed back at the White House claims."We will not be distracted by accusations which aren't supported by the facts," a Facebook spokesperson told AFP."The fact is that more than two billion people have viewed authoritative information about Covid-19 and vaccines on Facebook, which is more than any other place on the internet. More than 3.3 million Americans have also used our vaccine finder tool to find out where and how to get a vaccine. The facts show that Facebook is helping save lives. Period."Earlier, Facebook said it was taking "aggressive action against misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccines to protect public health," and that it had removed "more than 18 million pieces of Covid misinformation," and disabled accounts spreading false information.The CDC reported more than 33,000 new cases in the United States on Thursday, bringing the seven-day average up to 26,306, a 70 percent rise on the week before.The seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 2,790 per day, an increase of 36 percent. And after weeks of declines, the seven-day average of deaths was 211, an increase of 26 percent.The spikes are focused in communities with low vaccination rates and "unvaccinated Americans account for virtually all recent Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths," said Jeff Zients, White House coronavirus response coordinator.The new wave is driven by the Delta variant, which now accounts for more than 80 percent of new cases, according to the covSpectrum tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-covid-misinformation-on-social-media-killing-people-facebook-denies-101626484503172.html
17-07-2021||World||Texas records first case of monkeypox||A rare case of human monkeypox was detected in Texas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday, making it the first case of the virus seen in the state.The viral illness was found in a US resident, who recently traveled from Nigeria to the United States and is currently hospitalized in Dallas."While rare, this case is not a reason for alarm and we do not expect any threat to the general public," Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said. Other than Nigeria, outbreaks have also been reported in central and western African countries since 1970, with a large outbreak in people in the United States in 2003, according to the CDC.CDC said it was working with the airline, state and local health officials to contact passengers and others who may have been in contact with the patient. Monkeypox, which belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox, is a rare but potentially serious viral illness that typically begins with flu-like symptoms and swelling of the lymph nodes, gradually progressing to a widespread rash on the face and body.It can spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. The CDC said since travelers were wearing masks due to COVID-19, the risk of spread of monkeypox via respiratory droplets to others on the planes and in the airports was low.The patient was infected with the strain most commonly found in parts of West Africa, including Nigeria, CDC added.There have been at least six reported monkeypox cases in travelers returning from Nigeria, prior to the current case, including in the United Kingdom, Israel and Singapore, according to the CDC. The latest case was not related to the previous cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-records-first-case-of-monkeypox-101626479845553.html

Twelve of the dead were residents of a home for disabled people in Sinzig to the south of Cologne who were surprised by the flashfloods at night.The death toll is expected to rise further as more houses collapsed, while in Belgium, media said at least 14 had died.Some 114,000 households in Germany were without power on Friday and mobile phone networks had collapsed in some flooded regions, which meant that family and friends were unable to track down their loved ones.In Rhineland-Palatinate, around 1,300 people were reported missing in the Ahrweiler district south of Cologne, the district government said. Further north, in Erftstadt, several houses collapsed on Friday, and authorities feared casualties.Roads around the town were impassable after being washed away by the floods. Rescue crews tried to reach residents by boat and had to communicate via walkie-talkie.The German military has deployed over 700 soldiers to support rescue efforts. Authorities worried that further dams could overflow, spilling uncontrolled floods.The devastation of the floods in western Europe, attributed by meteorologists to a climate crisis driven shift in the atmosphere’s jet stream that has brought in land water that once stayed at sea, could shake up an election that has until now seen little discussion of climate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-sinks-deeper-into-crisis-101626462139964.html
