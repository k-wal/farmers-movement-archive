It said the deal will be singed in a ceremony in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia on Wednesday.The vessel would be also freed Wednesday, it said.The head of Egypt‚Äôs Suez Canal Authority, Lt. Gen. Osama Rabie, said last month the parties had agreed on a compensation amount. But he said it would not be made public as they had signed a non-disclosure agreement until the signing of the final contract.The vessel had run aground in the single-lane stretch of the canal on March 23 before it was extracted six days later after a massive salvage effort by a flotilla of tugboats.Since it was freed, the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned vessel, which carries cargo between Asia and Europe, has been ordered by authorities to remain in a holding lake mid-canal, along with most of its crew, as the two sides negotiated a settlement.The disagreement had centered on the compensation amount the Suez Canal Authority is claiming for the salvage of the vessel.The money would cover the salvage operation, costs of stalled canal traffic, and lost transit fees for the week the Ever Given blocked the canal.At first, the Suez Canal Authority demanded $916 million in compensation, which was later lowered to $550 million.The two sides have traded blame for the vessel‚Äôs grounding, with bad weather, poor decisions on the part of canal authorities, and human and technical error all being thrown out as possible factors.The six-day blockage disrupted global shipping. Hundreds of ships waited in place for the canal to be unblocked, while some ships were forced to take the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa‚Äôs southern tip, requiring additional fuel and other costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-says-deal-reached-to-free-seized-ever-given-vessel-101625419835750.html

In an opinion piece, Kelly Alkhouli, a political consultant for The Jerusalem Post, said it is ironic that Pakistan, which has been repeatedly undermining US strategy in the region, has long been viewed as a key ally in resolving the decades-long intra-Afghanistan conflict.‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs support of jihadi groups stems partly from cynical realism, in order to expand its sphere of influence in Afghanistan and support the Islamist insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir,‚Äù wrote Alkhouli, director of international relations at the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs.Pakistan has long been blamed for providing support to the Taliban and recently, Prime Minister Imran Khan ruled out the possibility of hosting American bases on their soil for military action inside Afghanistan. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Khan argued that Pakistan cannot host American bases as they have ‚Äúalready paid too heavy a price.‚Äù‚ÄúIf Pakistan were to agree to host US bases, from which to bomb Afghanistan, and an Afghan civil war ensued, Pakistan would be targeted for revenge by terrorists again," said Khan.Also Read | Taliban capture key Kandahar district, Afghan forces flee to Tajikistan: ReportBut Pakistan‚Äôs reluctance to blame the Taliban for rising violence is being seen as tacit support to the insurgents. Pakistan foreign minister Mahmood Qureshi said last month that blaming the Taliban for the rise in violence would be an ‚Äúexaggeration‚Äù, suggesting that the Afghan government and the Islamic State should be held responsible for it.Alkhouli opined that the Taliban is an ‚Äúindependent terrorist organization with fickle allegiances‚Äù and Pakistan‚Äôs reduced leverage over the Islamist group with the latter‚Äôs potential victory in Afghanistan has made Islamabad ‚Äúincreasingly wary‚Äù. She warned that the continued violence in Afghanistan will spill over into Pakistan with a mass influx of refugees. She said that the Taliban‚Äôs victory would embolden other Islamist groups in Pakistan and Imran Khan‚Äôs lack of control over security apparatus could lead to a coup.‚ÄúUltimately, Pakistan‚Äôs dangerous gamble has left it in a perilous state, with fewer allies and greater mistrust,‚Äù Alkhouli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-dangerous-gamble-in-afghanistan-has-left-it-in-perilous-state-warns-analyst-101625413448204.html

The date marks the annual celebration of nationhood in the United States. This year marks the 245th anniversary of the freedom of the thirteen American colonies from British colonial rule.All you need to know about the Fourth of July:The day commemorates the passage of the Declaration of Independence by the Continental Congress in 1776, according to Britannica.Also read| US Independence Day: What do fireworks symbolise on the Fourth of July? All you need to knowThe Congress had approved independence from Great Britain on July 2 but the process of revising the Declaration of Independence was completed two days later. The declaration was originally drafted by Thomas Jefferson in consultation with fellow committee members John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and William Livingston, as per the Britannica.The first days of independence during the summer of 1776 in many towns took the form of a mock funeral for King George III, whose "death" symbolized the rebirth of liberty, and the end of monarchy and tyranny, in contrast to the pre-revolutionary years when annual celebrations were held for his birthday.Philadelphia commemorated the first annual independence day on July 4, 1777, while Congress was still busy with the ongoing war, as per The History.In the initial years, Independence Day was celebrated with parades, oratory, and toasting in ceremonies that marked the existence of a new nation. These celebrations played an important role in the development of the federal political system and this provided the informal political parties a venue to tie local and national contests to independence, as per the Britannica report authored by David L. Waldstreicher, History Professor at New York University.The two nascent political parties were holding separate partisan Independence Dat festivals in most larger towns by the mid-1970s. However, with the growth and diversification of American society, according to the report, the commemoration of the day became a patriotic tradition, which many groups not limited to political parties started to claim.Also read: Ahead of US Independence Day, Trump holds 'Save America' rally in FloridaBy the late 19th century, the Fourth of July emerged as a major midsummer holiday involving heavy drinking and an immense display of fireworks.

The group captured the Panjwai district in the southern province of Kandahar just two days after the US-allied forces withdrew from Bagram Air Base near Kabul.Panjwai district has been the Taliban‚Äôs target for a long time, given its proximity to Kandahar city. The fall of the Panjwai district reportedly sent scores of families fleeing from the area as the extremist group aims to impose a harsh version of Islamic sharia law, which it calls ‚Äúgenuine Islamic system‚Äù."The Taliban have captured the district police headquarters and governor's office building," Panjwai district governor Hasti Mohammad said Afghan forces told news agency AFP.Also Read | Women can't leave home alone, men have to grow beard: Taliban rules in captured Afghan districtsThe Taliban insurgents have made massive strides throughout the country after US troops began to pull out following President Joe Biden‚Äôs announcement in April.

04-07-2021||World||'Marriage without strings': Saudi confronts rise of 'misyar'||The Muslim no-strings-attached "misyar" marriage often done in secret is fast pervading Saudi society -- a boon for cash-strapped men unable to afford expensive traditional weddings, but deplored by critics for legitimising promiscuity.The practice, usually a temporary alliance in which the wife waives some conventional marriage rights such as cohabitation and financial support, has been legally permitted in the conservative Muslim kingdom for decades.More than a dozen interviews with matchmakers and misyar couples -- including grooms juggling other conventional marriages -- offer a window into a phenomenon still shrouded in secrecy and shame, despite its proliferation.The testimonies highlight how misyar is seen as a hybrid between marriage and singlehood, benefiting polygamists without the stress of maintaining a second household.Despite its potential for abuse, it also appeals to some women keen to shun patriarchal expectations of traditional marriages, as well as unmarried couples seeking religious cover for sexual relationships, forbidden by Islam outside wedlock."Misyar offers comfort, freedom and companionship that is halal (permitted in Islam)," said a Saudi government employee in his 40s, who has been in such a relationship with a Saudi widow in her 30s for more than two years.He told AFP he had three children from a separate, conventional marriage, and visits his misyar wife in her Riyadh home "whenever" he wants. He did not say what she gained from the secret alliance."My (Saudi) friend has had 11 secret misyar wives. He divorces and marries another, divorces and marries another...," he added, trailing off.- 'No dowry' -Saudis, as well as the kingdom's expat workers, can be seen hunting on dating apps and matrimonial websites for such partners."Misyar is cheaper. There is no dowry, no obligation," a 40-year-old Egyptian pharmacist in Riyadh told AFP.He began searching after sending his wife and five-year-old son back to Cairo at the start of the coronavirus pandemic last year, mainly due to rising living costs and an expat levy introduced by Saudi Arabia in recent years."Being away from my wife is hard," he said, adding he had been searching for misyar through "khatba" matchmakers on Instagram who charge as much as 5,000 riyals ($1,333)."I gave them my preference: weight, size, skin colour... but no match so far."Such marriages are often short-lived, with most ending in divorce from anywhere between 14 and 60 days, the kingdom's Al-Watan newspaper reported in 2018, citing justice ministry sources.It is touted by some women as a fleeting escape from spinsterhood or a chance for a fresh beginning for divorcees and widows, who otherwise struggle to remarry.A close associate of a divorced Syrian woman in Riyadh told AFP she was in a secret misyar relationship because she feared her ex-husband, a Saudi, would legally seek custody of her two children if he discovered that she had remarried.It is impossible to estimate the number of such marriages, many of which are undocumented.Saudi clerics say the practice has proliferated since 1996, when the then grand mufti, the kingdom's highest religious authority, legitimised it with an Islamic edict.But many question the validity of a furtive practice at odds with the main tenets of Islamic marriage, which requires a public declaration.- 'Take him to court' -A prominent Riyadh cleric attributed its proliferation to men unwilling to shoulder the full responsibilities of polygamous marriage, which is permitted in Islam as long as all wives are treated equally.In a 2019 column in the Saudi Gazette daily, columnist Tariq Al-Maeena described misyar as a "license to have multiple partners without much responsibility or expense"."Reports in the Saudi press have spoken of growing concerns over the number of children fathered by Saudi males in their trips abroad, and abandoned for all practical purposes," he wrote.Some women are forced to pursue court cases against Saudi men refusing to accept children born into misyar relationships."A woman contacted me and said: 'I am a misyar wife and my husband does not recognise my child'," the Riyadh cleric told AFP."He says 'the child is not my problem'. I advised her to take him to court and fight for her rights."Still, women are encouraged socially to turn a blind eye to their husband's misyar adventures.Fahad Almuais, a matchmaker who says his clients are mostly "polygamists", spoke of one Saudi government worker who kept his misyar relationship hidden from his first wife.When he began routinely disappearing every weekend, her female neighbour advised the suspicious wife to "stay quiet"."He married misyar so he wouldn't make (your life) a living hell," Almuais told online news portal Thmanyah, quoting the neighbour."Be patient and let him go for the weekend, and the rest of the days he's yours."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/marriage-without-strings-saudi-confronts-rise-of-misyar-101625398199523.html

When asked if he would stop wearing a mask if permitted, Johnson responded in the affirmative, insisting that a lot of people would prefer to do away with the mask order if possible."I will (not wear a mask). I don't particularly want to wear a mask, I don't think a lot of people enjoy doing it, we will be moving into a phase though where these will be matters of personal choice," Johnson told Reuters.As the UK is all set to open up its economy after July 19, pandemic essentials like face masks will be left to the citizens' judgement, and the country will ‚Äúmove away‚Äù from restrictions that have been difficult for its citizens, said housing secretary Robert Jenrick.‚ÄúIt will be a different period where we as private citizens make these judgements rather than the government telling you what to do,‚Äù Jenrick said."It does seem as if we can now move forward and move to a much more permissive regime where we move away from many of those restrictions that have been so difficult for us," he added.Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed on June 28 that most coronavirus restrictions in the UK will come to an end on July 19. Jenrick reiterated Johnson‚Äôs words stating that the data that is all set to decide if final lockdown restrictions in the UK can be lifted on July 19 is looking "very positive", thanks to the success of the vaccination programme. Many in the UK have started to dub July 19 as ‚ÄúFreedom Day‚Äù"The data that we're seeing that the Prime Minister is reviewing at the moment ahead of his decision point on the roadmap looks very positive," Reuters said quoting Jenrick.The British Medical Association (BMA) however suggested that some coronavirus measures like wearing masks and ensuring proper ventilation should be carried on even after July 19. BMA‚Äôs words of caution comes amidst a spike in the daily tally of cases in the UK, which reported 27,125 cases on Friday."This data coupled with some increases in hospitalisation suggests that it would be quite wrong from a public health interest to on July 19 remove all restrictions ... or to give the public the expectation that we will have a pre-Covid society where no one has to take any measures to prevent spread," Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said on Saturday.Johnson had plans to lift restrictions in June but a raging Delta variant caused him to relent. He told reporters last week that vaccination has severed the link between infections and death but cautioned that some restrictions might continue even after July 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/face-masks-to-become-matter-of-personal-choice-in-uk-101625397754244.html

They are also often deployed to deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.The Hercules that crashed Sunday has the same tail number as one acquired from the United States and delivered to the Philippines earlier this year.Senator Richard Gordon said it was the fourth military aircraft accident this year with "mass casualties"."Are we buying defective crafts...

Two of the biggest pyrotechnic shows in the country will blast off over the National Mall in Washington, and over a mile stretch of New York City's East River, separating Manhattan from the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.Some classic July Fourth events such as Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest in Brooklyn's Coney Island remain scaled back to allow for social distancing in recognition of the continued threat of the Covid-19 coronavirus, which has killed more than 600,000 Americans. The more aggressive Delta variant has raised alarms about the potential for another surge among the unvaccinated.Even so, this holiday is a time for Americans to show their patriotism and to celebrate a fresh sense of freedom in a personal sense by mingling with friends once again and enjoying summer's simple pleasures.But this year's July Fourth is not entirely carefree. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned state and local police last week of a heightened threat of violence by domestic extremist groups amid relaxed Covid-19 restrictions and the approaching July Fourth holiday.This weekend is expected to be the busiest July Fourth road travel holiday on record - with an estimated 43.6 million Americans behind the wheel, or 5 percent more than a previous record set in 2019, the American Automobile Association said.Aleksandra Magidoff, a 12-year-old from Brooklyn, is headed to a New Jersey suburb to reconnect with a lifelong friend and her family. They were among the more than 3.5 million people who have moved out of New York, once the U.S. epicenter of Covid-19, since the pandemic started in the spring of 2020."I'm so excited - I can talk to them and celebrate with them and just socialize!" said Magidoff, who was fully vaccinated under the enormous blue whale model at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The girls plan to gorge on "a bunch of hamburgers and hotdogs" before taking in the fireworks show at a New Jersey fairgrounds, she said.Last July Fourth she watched fireworks from her apartment building's rooftop while under pandemic lockdown, allowed to celebrate with only her immediate family.In Washington, President Joe Biden plans a 1,000 person July Fourth celebration on the White House lawn with essential workers and military families.The president hosts the event three days after his visit to Surfside, Florida, to console families whose loved ones were in a condo tower that collapsed on June 24. Several Florida communities have cancelled their July Fourth fireworks out of respect for those impacted by the tragedy, city officials said.Elsewhere in Washington on Sunday, marching bands will return for a traditional parade on Capitol Hill's Barracks Row. As darkness falls, the National Mall is expected to draw big crowds to a 17-minute fireworks display set off from both sides of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool.On New York's East River, 50 pyrotechnicians have spent days loading more than 65,000 shells on five barges to wow audiences watching the spectacular show either in person or on television. The display is presented by Macy's department store.Lighting up the night's sky not only delights crowds but also promises to restore a lifeline this year for the businesses that supply the 16,000 July Fourth fireworks displays that typically occur in cities and towns. Last year, only a "scant few" went on with the show, said Julie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association."Approximately 70 percent are scheduled to return, and many will be bigger and better than pre-pandemic levels," Heckman said.But for some July Fourth will be somber.In addition to the pall cast over the country by the pandemic and the Florida building collapse, the U.S. West faces a heightened risk of wildfires after a scorching heatwave and extremely dry conditions. And nationwide supply chain glitches tied to the pandemic have jacked up prices of everything from household items to fireworks."Approximately 30 percent of the consumer fireworks needed for this Independence Day either didn't make it out of China, are sitting on ocean vessels in the Pacific Ocean waiting to berth at the ports, or they've been sitting at West Coast ports waiting to be put on the rail," Heckman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-year-of-pandemic-cancellations-americans-celebrate-july-4th-with-a-bang-101625393672432.html

It has now come to light that the aircraft, which is now part of the Philippines' worst military air disaster in nearly 30 years, was actually granted by the US government for heavy airlifting purposes.A government website announcement in January, reviewed by news agency Reuters, confirmed that the Lockheed Martin C-130H Hercules transport plane was one of the two aircraft granted by the US government through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The model, a workhorse for armed forces around the world, had first flown in 1988, according to the C-130.net website.Also Read | At least 17 feared dead after military plane crashes in Philippines: ReportThe Lockheed C-130 aircraft, of registration 5125, had only arrived in the Philippines recently. The website even quoted an air force spokesperson as saying the aircraft would provide enhanced capability for heavy airlift missions.This is not the first time that the Philippines armed forces have come under scrutiny for having a patchy record on air safety. A Black Hawk helicopter crashed only last month during a training mission, killing six people.Another C-130 aircraft of the Philippines Air Force had crashed back in 1993, killing 30 people. A 2008 crash by the civilian variant of the Lockheed plane flown by the Philippines Air Force killed 11 people, according to the Aviation Safety Network.However, the worst plane crash in the country's records took place in 2000, when the infamous Boeing 737 -- an aircraft that has come to the news recently for being part of several recent air disasters -- crashed, killing 131 people.The Sunday incident took place shortly before noon at the Bangkal village in the mountainous town of Patikul in the country's Sulu province, military officials said. As many as 40 people have been pulled out from underneath the burning wreckage, the government has said, confirming that the rescue operation is currently ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-plane-involved-in-worst-military-air-disaster-in-30-years-was-given-by-us-report-101625385920199.html

There is a fear that land disasters could occur even when the rain stops," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told ministers at an emergency meeting.NHK said on Sunday that at least seven other landslides had been reported across Japan."Landslides can occur again and again at the same place even if the rain stops. Residents and rescuers should remain on alert," Takeo Moriwaki, professor of geotechnical engineering at Hiroshima Institute of Technology, told AFP.Town disaster spokesman Hara said 387 residents had been evacuated, with survivors in face masks seen reading newspapers with images of the disaster on the front page.Residents in many other cities in Shizuoka have also been ordered to evacuate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rescuers-search-for-survivors-in-landslide-hit-japan-town-101625385153490.html

04-07-2021||World||At least 17 feared dead after C-130 military plane crashes in Philippines: Report||A Philippine C-130 military plane carrying troops on board has crashed in the country's southern region, news agencies reported on Sunday morning, citing military officials familiar with the development. According to the New York Times, the officials said at least 17 people are feared dead in the crash.The aircraft, transporting armed forces from the southern Cagayan de Oro city, crashed after it missed a runway while attempting a landing on the island of Jolo, said the airforce in a statement.Referring to statements issued by Philippine military chief of staff General Cirilito Sobejana, news agencies reported that the crash-landing occurred shortly before noon in Bangkal village in the mountainous town of Patikul in the Sulu province.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unfortunate,‚Äù Sobejana told reporters. ‚ÄúThe plane missed the runway and it was trying to regain power but failed and crashed.‚ÄùAs many as 40 people have been pulled out from underneath the burning wreckage, he said, confirming that the rescue operation is currently ongoing.However, there is no clarity yet on the exact number of passengers in the aircraft. The AFP news agency said the plane had been carrying 85 people, citing the army chief. But a Reuters report, quoting the country's defence minister Delfin Lorenzana, indicated that as many as 92 people -- including three pilots and five other crew members -- may have been on the military plane.A picture published by ABS-CBN News on Twitter showed smoke and flames pouring from the broken fuselage. The post credited Pondohan TV on Facebook for acquiring the photo from witnesses present at the site of the crash.Notably, the central Philippines region had been experiencing heavy rainfall over the week, but it was not immediately clear if the weather in the Sulu region was affected or if the erratic weather was the reason behind the crash.The airport in Sulu‚Äôs main town of Jolo is located a few kilometers from a mountainous area where government forces have been battling the Abu Sayyaf militants in the predominantly Muslim province for decades. Some militants were also said to have aligned themselves with the Islamic State group. The United States and the Philippines have separately blacklisted Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organisation for bombings, ransom kidnappings, and beheadings. It has been considerably weakened by years of government offensives but still remains a threat, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/military-plane-with-over-80-onboard-crashes-in-philippines-rescue-ops-on-101625376847787.html

The requirement of isolating at a government-approved hotel for three days while results of a Covid-19 test on arrival are delivered, will be dropped for fully vaccinated individuals but only for the jabs approved by Health Canada.The new criteria will come into effect at 12.01am (Canada time) on Monday.‚ÄúFully vaccinated travellers allowed to enter Canada may be exempted from federal quarantine and day 8 testing starting July 5. Only vaccines approved by the Government of Canada will be accepted,‚Äù Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada tweeted on Saturday.‚ÄúThese changes are only applicable to fully vaccinated travellers who are currently eligible to enter Canada,‚Äù the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) said.As direct flights from India remain prohibited till July 21, those taking a connecting flight will have to provide the negative result of a valid test taken at the final point of departure to Canada.Health Canada has so far approved the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Astra Zeneca/Covishield, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. While Covishield, the AZ version manufactured by the Serum Institute of India is accepted, neither Covaxin from Bharat Biotech or Sputnik V from the Russian Gamaleya Center are, according to the latest update from Global Affairs Canada‚Äôs Travel section.While the Pennsylvania-based American firm Ocugen has partnered with Bharat Biotech to make Covaxin available in North America, and has entered into discussions with Health Canada for regulatory approval, that vaccine is yet to receive emergency use authorisation.The categories of travellers who will benefit from the new relaxations in rules include citizens, permanent residents, their immediate and extended family members, international students with a valid study permit at a designated learning institution with a Covid-19 readiness plan approved by its province or territory, and some temporary workers with a valid work permit, according to the CBSA.Restrictions will remain in place for those not fully vaccinated or vaccinated with a jab not authorised in Canada. Such travellers will have to complete the three-day quarantine at a hotel while awaiting results of their tests, submit to a second test on day eight of their arrival and complete the full 14-day period of self-isolation. Vaccination status will have to uploaded on the Canadian government‚Äôs ArriveCan app before reaching Canada. The app will be updated with the latest version on July 5 as the reduced public health measures come into effect.Travellers arriving in Canada will still have to provide a negative molecular test result taken within 72 hours prior to departure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-eases-entry-restrictions-from-july-5-101625375281258.html

This comes as part of Beijing's plan to expand its extraterrestrial ambitions.Three spacemen blasted off in June, docking at the Tiangong station where they are to remain for three months in China's longest crewed mission to date. On Sunday morning, two of them exited the core cabin, said state broadcaster CCTV.One of the astronauts - Liu Boming, was transported via mechanical arm to a work site and the other - Tang Hongbo was moved by climbing on the outside of the cabin. Their mission involves elevating the panoramic camera outside the Tianhe core module, as well as verifying the robotic arm's transfer capability.Television footage showed the astronauts preparing for the spacewalk by donning gear and conducting health checks while exercising in the cabin. The astronauts were later shown opening the cabin door and exiting the module, in the first of two spacewalks planned for the mission, both expected to last six or seven hours. The crew underwent more than 6,000 hours of training for preparation.The launch of China's first crewed mission in nearly five years is a matter of huge prestige for the country, as Beijing marks the 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party this month.The Chinese space agency is planning a total of 11 launches by the end of next year, including three more manned missions that will deliver two lab modules to expand the 70-tonne station, along with supplies and crew members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astronauts-at-china-s-new-space-station-conduct-first-spacewalk-101625372998858.html

Here's how others are doing||Several countries in Asia, including India, have been struggling with mounting cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) even as the threat of the Delta variant is looming large over the continent as well as the entire world. The first case of infection from Delta was identified in India and now the Delta Plus variant of coronavirus is ringing alarm bells across Asia. The pace of Covid-19 vaccination, which experts say is one of the measures to tackle the pandemic, has been slow in the whole of Asia. Along with this, the risk of Delta variant is rising in the entire continent including India.World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned that the world is witnessing a very ‚Äúdangerous period‚Äù compounded by the rapid transmission of the Delta variant. The WHO chief said on Friday that the Delta variant has been detected in at least 98 countries and is quickly becoming the dominant strain in many of them. ‚ÄúCompounded by more transmissible variants, like Delta, which is quickly becoming the dominant strain in many countries, we are in a very dangerous period of this pandemic,‚Äù Ghebreyesus said during a press conference.Here are seven Asian countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic:1. India: In terms of Covid-19 cases, India has the most number of infections in Asia and the second-most in the world. So far, a total of 30.5 million people have contracted Covid-19 and more than 400,000 have died. There are currently 485,350 active cases of Covid-19 in the country and 29.6 million people have recovered. The recovery rate in the country has increased to 96.97%. The weekly positivity rate remains below 5 per cent. In terms of vaccination against Covid-19, so far more than 350 million doses have been administered in the country.The first case of the Delta Plus was found in India on June 11 and more than 50 cases of the variant have been reported in the country so far.2. Turkey: Turkey is the second-most affected country after India in Asia. So far, more than 543 million cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the country and 49,829 people have died. At present, there are 80,146 active cases and 530 million people have recovered from Covid-19. So far, 51.2 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been given in Turkey. Turkey banned flights and all direct travel from Bangladesh, Brazil, South Africa, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka recently in view of the danger of the Delta variant.Also read | Delta variant spreads to 98 nations, Europe struggles to ramp up vaccination3. Iran: Iran is battling the deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus in the region and has warned it could be hit by yet another wave of infections. "It is feared that we are on the way to a fifth wave throughout the country," President Hassan Rouhani told a meeting of Iran's anti-virus taskforce. He also warned people to be careful as "the Delta variant has spread" in southern provinces.The country has reported more than 3.2 million cases of Covid-19 and 84,516 people have died. There are currently 246,000 active cases of Covid-19 and more than 2.9 million people have recovered. So far 5.72 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in Iran.Also read | Who are 'highly protected' against Delta variant of Covid? ICMR study reveals4. Indonesia: The Delta variant of the coronavirus is spreading rapidly in Indonesia and the government has imposed a lockdown in many parts of the country till July 20. Indonesia is the fourth country in the continent of Asia, where corona cases have been found the most. Indonesia's tally to date stands at 2.25 million cases and 60,027 deaths -- making it one of Asia's worst-hit nations. Only about five per cent of the country's people have been fully vaccinated with two jabs so far.5. The Philippines: The Philippines government has said that so far no case of the Delta variant has been reported in the country. There are 142 million people who have contracted Covid-19 in the Philippines and 24,973 have died. There are more than 55,000 active cases in the country and 134.4 million people have been cured. So far, 10.7 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the country.

Iraq: A slow pace of vaccination against Covid-19 has compounded the problems of the country, which has reported 1,340,000 people have been infected and of these, 17,256 have died since the start of its outbreak. There are currently 87,377 active cases in Iraq and 1,255,203 people have been cured so far. Only 805,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered in Iraq, which is is less than 2.5% of the 40 million of its population. Cases of the Delta variant are rising in Iraq.7. Pakistan: Pakistan is at number 7 in terms of Covid-19 cases in Asia and 961,085 people have been infected and 22,379 have died. There are currently 32,319 active cases in the country and 906,000 people have recovered from Covid-19. Pakistan has administered 16.3 million vaccine doses. Pakistan has also warned its citizens about the possibility of a fourth wave in view of the Delta variant. The first case of the delta variant was reported in Pakistan on May 28 and in the next week, the country saw more infections in travelers coming from the UAE.

04-07-2021||World||Strained ties with India, other nations lead to dip in China's weapon export: Report||China's rise as a super power has always been under global scrutiny. Many countries in the West, as well as smaller countries, have raised concerns about China's handling of issues. It is involved in a stalemate with the United States, particularly over the origin of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, which has killed hundreds of thousands across the globe.The cautious approach is what has led to various countries going slow with importing the weapons made by China, especially the fighter jets.According to a report in Foreign Policy, and quoted by news agency ANI, after last month's confrontation with the Philippines, where Chinese naval vessels entered Philippine waters without authorisation, few want to partner up with Beijing.China is involved in a border standoff with India in Ladakh, leading to deterioration of bilateral ties, said Foreign Policy. Though it has imported weapons from other countries, India won't consider China for the same, the magazine said. Ditto for Vietnam, with its worsening maritime dispute with China. Malaysia and Indonesia are also too wary of Beijing's ambitions to ever consider acquiring a Chinese fighter, reported Foreign Policy.A report released by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) earlier this year said that India is increasingly becoming self-reliant under its Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, which is showing results.India‚Äôs arms imports fell 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20, the Sipri report said. In the same period, China's exports fell 7.8%.The Foreign Policy article said that snazzy weapons mean a lot less if you don't have friends and this is why the world doesn't want Beijing's fighter jets, according to ANI.China has made great strides in improving its state-owned aerospace technology base, particularly in the military realm. It has made aircraft like J-10, J-10C and FC-31.But between 2000 and 2020, China exported just USD 7.2 billion worth of military aircraft, according to Sipri arms transfers database.The United States stayed safely on top, exporting USD 99.6 billion, and Russia stayed in the second slot at USD 61.5 billion. Even France's aircraft exports doubled China's, at USD 14.7 billion.The only country which is relying on China for weapons is Pakistan. Beijing accounted for 74% of Islamabad‚Äôs military imports during the last five years, up from 61% in 2011-15.The best explanation for this failure is China's foreign policy. The Philippines is a perfect illustration of why China's fighter export ambitions have stalled, the article in the magazine said.According to Foreign Policy, this pattern of failure speaks to more than just a problem with sharp elbows. First, it shows a lack of commercial soft power. Fighter sales often involve a trade relationship, since they tend to include commercial offsets - or economic sweeteners such as market access or technology transfer that are designed to mitigate some of the expense of a weapons package, the Foreign Policy article said.But China's relatively closed economic system means that potential customers with export-oriented economies have little to gain, since China wants to be a globally dominant export manufacturer and certainly doesn't want to increase its intake of imported manufactured goods.It has little interest in preserving the status quo in Asia, few qualms about territorial expansion, and next to no record of supporting allies in times of crisis, said Foreign Policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strained-ties-with-india-other-nations-see-dip-in-china-s-weapon-export-report-101625373178248.html

The World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Saturday the world is currently in a very dangerous period of the pandemic and the delta variant is continuing to evolve and mutate.The WHO, meanwhile, in its Weekly Epidemiological Update published on June 29 said that the recent surge in infections and hospitalisations in countries can be attributed to the delta variant. It (delta variant) is ‚Äúexpected to rapidly outcompete other variants and become the dominant variant over the coming months,‚Äù the WHO report added.In Europe, Portugal, Russia and the United Kingdom (UK) are witnessing a massive spike in daily cases due to the delta variant. The entire continent at present, is struggling to accelerate the vaccination drive and outpace the spread of the variant.While in the United States, the delta variant accounts for over one-fourth of the total active Covid-19 cases in the country. Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said on July 1 the variant has the capability of spreading much more efficiently from person to person.Here are the latest updates:> Delta variant is increasing rapidly in Thailand‚Äôs capital Bangkok and accounts for 70 per cent of the new cases, a study by Chulalongkorn University‚Äôs Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology stated.> Portugal is seeing an extremely high increase in delta variant, which accounted for 4 per cent of cases in May but nearly 56 per cent last month, according to news agency AP. Daily cases jumped by 2,605 on Saturday, the highest single-day spike since mid February. The government is aiming to vaccinate 1.7 more million citizens as new cases are being reported more among the unvaccinated.> Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned on Saturday that the country will be hit by a fifth wave of the pandemic linked to the outbreak of the delta variant. Rouhani urged citizens to be careful as the variant has entered Iran from south and southeast.> The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) said on Saturday the risk of infection from the delta variant is high to very high for those who are partially vaccinated or not vaccinated at all. By the end of August, the variant will account for 90 per cent of infections in 27 nations of the European Union, the ECDC added.> The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said in its study that neutralising antibodies against the delta variant were not found in 58.1 per cent of the serum samples from those administered the first dose of the Covishield vaccine, Hindustan Times reported on Saturday. While after taking both the doses, the antibodies could not be found in 16.1 per cent of the samples(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-spreads-to-98-nations-europe-struggles-to-ramp-up-vaccination-101625369820127.html

Independence Day -- known colloquially as the Fourth of July -- is celebrated in the United States on July 4 annually. It marks the date in 1776 when the Second Continental Congress finally approved the US Declaration of Independence, marking the freedom of the thirteen American colonies from British colonial rule. The day is usually marked with a splendid display of fireworks, as citizens gather across several states to observe a pyrokinetic show in the night sky.Also Read | Fourth of July: With fireworks and parades, US celebrates Independence Day todayTo date, the largest of such displays has taken place in New York City, where more than 22 tons of pyrotechnics were held in the East River in 2009.At first glance, a grand display of fireworks may just seem like just another form of outdoor celebration, but the tradition holds a particular significance in the day's history. It was on July 3, 1776, that John Adams, one of the Founding Fathers of the Nation, wrote to his wife Abigail that July 4 must be celebrated ‚Äúwith Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forevermore.‚Äù Adams had set the tone for the Fourth of July celebrations a day before the US Declaration of Independence was even signed.It wasn't until a year later, however, that the first formal display of fireworks was set off. On July 4, 1777, the night sky in Philadelphia was illuminated with a brilliant display of pyrotechnics, in the spirit of John Adams' words. That same year, fireworks also lit up the sky in Boston. A 13-gunshot salute was held in Bristol, Rhode Island, once in the morning and then again in the evening, setting the tradition for years since.Today, firework displays are held on July 4 in many states during the evening after dark at places such as parks, fairgrounds, or town squares. However, several states have also either banned fireworks or limited the display size out of safety concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-independence-day-what-do-fireworks-symbolise-on-the-fourth-of-july-all-you-need-to-know-101625368233969.html

He criticised New York prosecutors for indicting his company, the Trump Organization, and his longtime financial adviser, Allen Weisselberg, in what he called "prosecutorial misconduct". The event will also feature a grand fireworks display to mark the occasion of the US Independence Day on July 4, news agencies reported.Also Read | Fourth of July: With fireworks and parades, US gears up for Independence Day"They've mobilized every power of government to come after me, my family, my wonderful employees, and my company solely because of politics," Trump told the crowd gathered at the rally.Notably, this is the former president's second "Save America" rally, the earlier being held in Ohio near the end of last month. There, Trump had dissed US president Joe Biden's performance as a "catastrophe" and criticised the current administration for the crime wave in major cities throughout the United States, the migrant crisis at the southern border with Mexico, and a dismal economic situation marred with high inflation.With the July 3 event, Trump repeated his false claim that he lost the 2020 election due to fraud, Reuters reported. He urged his supporters to back his allies in their midterm campaigns as Republicans fight to take back control of Congress from the Democratic Party next year.Donald Trump reportedly plans to appeal to the anti-immigration sentiments running high in Republican party supporters in Florida, who flocked to the rally en masse even before noon on Saturday to hear the ex-president speak. "My father is a border patrol agent," said Phillippe Cruz, a Sarasota resident who turned up at the event, "He has lost many of his co-workers in the fight against the opioid epidemic on our borders." Cruz told a Sputnik correspondent that he fully supports Trump's policies on trying to stop illegal immigrants from "coming in and destroying our country with drugs, and illegal weapons".The correspondent reports that the crowd in Sarasota is, however, diverse and includes people of all ages and nationalities, including a lot of Latin American supporters of Donald Trump. The programme is an all-day event in support of the former president's signature "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) agenda and will celebrate the stated achievements of the Trump administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-us-independence-day-trump-holds-save-america-rally-in-florida-101625365682616.html

This is the second consecutive time that Africa's most industrialised nation has registered record-breaking tally in the third wave of Covid-19.The surge in infection has stretched South Africa's health services to breaking point, with hospitals out of beds and medics to man them, and forced the government to impose partial lockdown restrictions.The number of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in South Africa has surpassed two million-mark, and 61,500 people have died, the national Department of Health said. The government data also showed that 3.3 million people - about 5% of the population - has been vaccinated.More than 1.7 million people have recovered from Covid-19 in South Africa since the start of the outbreak.The low vaccination rate has resulted from a mixture of bad luck and bureaucratic failures. The government had to destroy 2 million contaminated Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses earlier this year, while efforts to replace them have run up against global supply bottlenecks.President Cyril Ramaphosa has criticised what he called global "vaccine apartheid," with rich countries with plentiful vaccine supplies hoarding them while poorer countries wait.To tackle this problem, South Africa on Saturday approved China's Sinovac vaccine against Covid-19, as growing evidence emerges of its effectiveness.The surge in infection in South Africa is driven by the delta variant of the coronavirus. This was indicated by the country's acting health minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane last week.The current resurgence could be worse than the second wave, the minister had said.The South African government is expecting that the peak of the third wave would surpass that of the second wave in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-registers-record-26-000-fresh-covid-19-cases-101625363846926.html
04-07-2021||World||Fourth of July: With fireworks and parades, US celebrates Independence Day today||Independence Day -- known colloquially as the Fourth of July -- is celebrated in the United States on July 4 annually to mark the Declaration of Independence signifying the freedom of the thirteen American colonies from British rule back in the 18th century. On this day, citizens usually take to mark the occasion with a splendid display of fireworks, parades, carnivals, and fairs. However, in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation this year, the social events will remain limited, while authorities have requested Americans to attend a professional firework display in their area for fire safety.Also Read | A musical ode to American IndependenceJuly 4, 2021, will mark the 245th anniversary of the founding of the United States. The Declaration of Independence, a statement explaining the decision of the thirteen colonies of Great Britain to declare themselves independent from colonial rule, was approved by the US Congress on July 4, 1776. However, the actual resolution of independence was passed two days earlier on July 2, when the thirteen colonies were legally separated from Great Britain's rule.Why is July 4 celebrated in the United States?The Fourth of July has been traditionally celebrated in the United States of America as 'Independence Day' since the same date in 1776 -- when the Second Continental Congress finally approved the US Declaration of Independence.The US Founding Fathers -- John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington -- were a group of seven key leaders who led the US war for independence and played a major role in the founding of the nation, uniting the thirteen colonies, on this day. They also built the structural framework of the new government based on classical liberal policies.Also Read | Fourth of July and the historical significance of a fireworks displayJuly 4, the day when the Declaration of Independence was approved, is now marked in the United States as 'Independence Day' with displays of patriotic fervour. Americans take to celebrating the day with joyous displays of fireworks, parades, and picnics. Politicians, too, make it a point to appear in public events on this day and address the nation of issues of patriotism and culture.Fourth of July: The significance of fireworksCuriously, though, even though a grand display of fireworks may just seem like another form of outdoor celebration, the tradition holds a particular significance in the day's history.A day before the US Declaration of Independence was signed, John Adams -- one of the Founding Fathers -- wrote to his wife Abigail that July 4 must be celebrated ‚Äúwith Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forevermore.‚ÄùA year later, on July 4, 1777, the first formal display of fireworks was set off in Philadelphia, illuminating the city. That same year, fireworks also lit up the sky in Boston. A 13-gunshot salute was held in Bristol, Rhode Island, once in the morning and then again in the evening, setting the tradition for years since.Today, firework displays are held on July 4 in many states during the evening after dark at such places as parks, fairgrounds, or town squares. However, several other states have also either banned fireworks or limited the display size out of safety concerns. To date, the largest of such displays has taken place in New York City, where more than 22 tons of pyrotechnics were held in the East River in 2009.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fourth-of-july-with-fireworks-and-parades-us-celebrates-independence-day-today-101625360188534.html

04-07-2021||World||On child soldier report, Turkey accused US of hypocrisy; Pak says 'factual error'||Turkey has accused the United State of "double standards and hypocrisy" after a report released by the state department highlighted Ankara was among 15 countries which use child soldiers. In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry completely rejected the claims.The report from the US state department was released on Friday and Turkey's rejection came later on the same day.Among the other nations mentioned on the list was Pakistan, which has also rejected the reacted strongly to the development. The foreign office said that the inclusion depicted a "factual error and understanding", and urged Washington to review the "baseless assertions" made against the country.Turkey, the first NATO ally to be placed in the list, pointed to American support for Syrian Kurdish militants. It cited a United Nations report that documented child recruitment and exploitation under the umbrella of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).Turkey says Syrian Kurdish militants that provided the backbone of the SDF fighting the Islamic State group were linked to Kurdish fighters who have been waging an insurgency against Turkey for more than three decades and are designated as terrorists. American support for them has been a major irritant in US-Turkish relations.The US move could lead to sanctions on military assistance to countries mentioned in the list. The Child Soldiers Prevention Act (CSPA) list has been coming out since 2010, and had highlighted six governments for the first time. The number has increased to 15 this year - the highest so far.Once a country is placed on the list, it is prohibited in the following US government programmes: International military education and training, foreign military financing, excess defence articles and peacekeeping operations. The CSPA also prohibits the issuance of licences for direct commercial sales of military equipment to such governments.Islamabad has said that no institution was consulted by the US prior to the publication of the report. Local media, carrying the statement of the Pakistan foreign office, reported that no details were provided of the basis on which the conclusion was reached.The foreign office statement emphasised that Pakistan neither supported any non-state armed group nor any entity recruiting or using child soldiers, saying "Pakistan's efforts in fighting non-state armed groups including terrorist entities are well-recognised."It maintained that Pakistan was committed to fighting "this scourge - both at the national and international levels".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-child-soldier-report-turkey-accused-us-of-hypocrisy-pak-says-factual-error-101625356766728.html
