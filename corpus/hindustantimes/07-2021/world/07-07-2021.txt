Trump visited France in 2018 to commemorate 100 years of the first world war, which came to an end in 1918.Details about the conversation were revealed in a book titled ‘Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost’ by Michael Bender of the Wall Street Journal, The Guardian reported. The Guardian also said it had obtained a copy of the book that is yet to be released in stores.According to the report, Kelly, a retired US Marine Corps general, was “stunned” by the former President’s comments. In the book, Bender also wrote that Trump’s comments came during a conversation with Kelly who “reminded the president which countries were on which side during the conflict” and “connected the dots from the first world war to the second world war and all of Hitler’s atrocities,” The Guardian reported. However, HT has not accessed the book.Also read | Trump to sue Twitter, Facebook and Google﻿Also, Bender further wrote that Kelly tried to tell Trump that he was wrong but Trump insisted on German economic recovery during the 1930s under Hitler, The Guardian’s report showed.Meanwhile, Liz Harrington, a spokesperson for Trump, denied the excerpts in Bender’s book. “The report from the Michael Bender book is totally false. President Trump never said this. It was probably made up by an incompetent general who was fired,” she tweeted on Wednesday.‘Crack their skulls’Earlier on June 25, CNN reported citing another controversial excerpt from the book, according to which Trump had made inappropriate comments about protesters against the murder of George Floyd.When police officers used force against the protesters Trump had told his top law and order officials “That’s how you are supposed to handle these people. Crack their skulls !” CNN reported.He also wanted the US military to go and beat the protesters, CNN reported, citing Bender’s book, and had also reportedly said “Just shoot them.”Notably, Trump during the France trip had cancelled his visit to a US military cemetery because it was raining on the day, while many other European leaders attended the memorial events, according to several news reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hitler-did-a-lot-of-good-things-new-book-reveals-stunning-comments-by-former-us-president-donald-trump-101625681315633.html

07-07-2021||World||Fast-track lanes for Covid-19 vaccinated passengers at Heathrow||Heathrow Airport in London is planning to trial fast-track queues for those arriving from some destinations fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as part of plans to facilitate smoother travel.The trial scheme by British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will mean passengers from certain select countries will be able to upload their vaccination status before boarding.It comes as the aviation industry calls for quarantine-free travel to the UK from lower-risk amber list countries and UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to announce such plans later this week."At the moment the main barrier to people who have been doubly vaccinated travelling being allowed to do that, is being able to demonstrate to the government that we can check that they've had the vaccination already,” John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, told the BBC."The trial that we're starting later this week will allow us to demonstrate we can do that safely with 100 per cent checks on double vaccination before people get on the plane," he said.The trial, due to start this weekend, will allow passengers who are fully vaccinated and are travelling on selected flights to Heathrow from Athens, Los Angeles, Montego Bay and New York to show proof of their vaccination status. It will accept internationally recognised vaccination credentials, including the NHS app, CDC card, US state-level digital certification and the EU digital Covid certificate.India currently remains on the red list of high risk countries from where travel remains effectively banned, with compulsory hotel quarantine for returning British residents.People taking part in the Heathrow trial from this weekend will be able to use a dedicated arrivals lane at the UK border. Sean Doyle, British Airways chief executive and chairman, said he was "confident" the trial would be successful."We look forward to providing the data that proves it's simple for fully vaccinated status to be verified and to the government meeting its commitment to get the country moving again," he said.“To reap the benefits of the UK’s world-leading vaccine rollout, the UK government must act now to remove self-isolation for fully vaccinated passengers arriving from ‘amber’ countries, and no later than the domestic reopening on 19 July,” added Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss.July 19 is now set as the timeline for an end to all legal lockdown restrictions in England, with rules on international travel set to be finalised in the coming days.UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid laid out plans in Parliament on Tuesday to end compulsory 10-day self-isolation for people who come in contact with a Covid positive case for those fully vaccinated against coronavirus with both doses of a vaccine.“We can't live in a world where the only thing we are thinking about is Covid and not about all the other health problems, not about our economic problems, or education challenges, and we have to make use of a vaccine that is thankfully working,” he said.On Tuesday, another 28,773 cases and 37 Covid-19 deaths were reported across the UK. According to government estimates, the number of new infections could rise to 100,000 a day as lockdown measures are lifted but it is hoped the vaccinations and better therapeutics will continue to keep a check on the hospitalisation and death figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fasttrack-lanes-for-covid-19-vaccinated-passengers-at-heathrow-101625674789675.html

07-07-2021||World||Iran hosts high-level Afghan peace talks as fighting surges||Iran on Wednesday hosted the first significant talks in months between the Taliban and Afghan government representatives — a previously unannounced meeting that comes as the U.S. completes its withdrawal from Afghanistan and districts increasingly fall to the Taliban across the country.The high-level peace talks between the warring Afghan sides follow months-old discussions in Qatar that have been stalled by a diplomatic stalemate and escalating violence. Even as officials faced each other across the vast tables in Tehran and Iran’s top diplomat pledged to end the crisis, fighting surged in Afghanistan’s western Badghis province.The Taliban political committee, led by chief negotiator Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, flew from Doha to Iran’s capital to meet Afghan government officials, including former Vice President Younus Qanooni and others from the High Council for National Reconciliation.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif greeted the delegates, urging them to “take difficult decisions today for the future of their country," state-run media reported.After the “failure of the U.S. in Afghanistan,” Zarif said, Iran stands “ready to assist the dialogue” and to “resolve the current conflicts in the country."“Returning to the inter-Afghan negotiation table and committing to political solutions is the best choice,” he added.But any solution appeared a long way off Wednesday as the Taliban offensive, which has recently captured many districts in the country’s north, pushed into Badghis province. The insurgents attacked the provincial capital of Qala-e-Naw from several sides, its governor Hasamuddin Shams said, adding that Afghan troops had so far managed to push the Taliban back.From early Wednesday morning, battles raged near the provincial police headquarters and a Qala-e-Naw army base, said Abdul Aziz beg, head of the provincial council in Badghis.The fighting killed at least two civilians and wounded 28 others, including women and children, said Dr. Sanahullah Sabit at the Provincial Badghis Hospital. Medics sent five people in critical condition to a regional hospital in the neighboring Herat province for further treatment, he added.Videos widely circulated on social media appeared to show Taliban fighters speeding into the provincial capital on motorcycles. Other clips show insurgents approaching the city’s prison and releasing inmates. The Associated Press could not independently verify the authenticity of the footage.Fawad Aman, the Afghan defense minister's deputy spokesman, promised security forces would clear the city in the coming hours. The Taliban have not publicly commented on the violence in Qala-e-Naw.The surge in fighting — and the sudden news of peace talks in Tehran — come at a critical time for the war-battered country.After a two-decade-long military campaign, the U.S. military announced on Tuesday that 90% of American troops and equipment had already left the country, with the drawdown set to finish by late August. Last week, U.S. officials definitively vacated the country’s biggest airfield, Bagram Air Base, the epicenter of the war to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America.The Taliban have made relentless territorial wins since April, when President Joe Biden announced that the last 2,500-3,500 U.S. soldiers and 7,000 allied NATO soldiers would depart Afghanistan. With their victories in northern and southern Afghanistan, the Taliban are escalating pressure on provincial cities and gaining control of key transportation routes.Afghanistan’s uncertain path toward peace bears profound consequences for its western neighbor Iran, which the U.N. estimates hosts some 2 million undocumented Afghans. Amid the specter of another civil war, fears have grown in Iran over a new wave of Afghans seeking refuge in the country, which already is struggling to stem worsening poverty under tough U.S. sanctions.Iran and Afghanistan share deep cultural ties and a 945-kilometer-long (587 miles) border. Tehran has historically viewed U.S. military presence in neighboring countries as a threat and pushed for American troop withdrawals from the region.Iran, the Shiite powerhouse of the Middle East, has occasionally in the past hosted the Sunni militant Taliban and Afghan government officials in Tehran for peace talks. In playing host, Iran seeks counterbalance against regional rivals like Saudi Arabia that typically wield greater influence over Sunni groups in the Middle East.The Taliban's recent territorial gains also have fueled national security concerns in Iran.“We do warn the Taliban not to get close to Iranian borders,” said lawmaker Shahriar Heidari, a member of influential parliamentary committee on national security and foreign relations. “This is Iran's red line.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-hosts-high-level-afghan-peace-talks-as-fighting-surges-101625677281445.html

Microsoft released the security update after researchers found a serious vulnerability in Windows, known as PrintNightmare which could allow multiple users to access a printer.In May, researchers at cybersecurity company Sangfor said they had found vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler service. They published a proof-of-concept online but deleted it after realising the mistake. However, the how-to guide for exploiting the vulnerabilities was published on other sites, including developer site GitHub.On Tuesday, Microsoft released an Out-of-Band (OOB) security update for PrintNightmare in a cumulative update release, which means it contains all previous security fixes. The tech giant said that the update fully addresses the public vulnerability, and also includes a new feature that allows customers to implement stronger protections.“We feel that it is important to provide security updates as quickly as possible for systems that we can confidently protect today,” the company said.Also Read | Microsoft joins Apple in exclusive $2 trillion clubBefore the patch update, the printer operators' security group could install both signed and unsigned printer drivers on a printer server. After installing CVE-2021-34527 update, delegated admin groups like printer operators could only be able to install signed printer drivers and administrator credentials will be required to install unsigned printer drivers on a printer server.Here are the two ways to resolve the flaw:After the installation of the 'July 2021 Out-of-band update', all users will either be administrators or non-administrators as delegates will no longer be honoured. Microsoft said that security updates for Windows Server 2016, Windows 10, version 1607, and Windows Server 2012 will be delayed for a short period but are “expected soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-asks-windows-users-to-immediately-install-security-update-for-printnightmare-101625676872300.html

The negative fallout of unrest in Afghanistan includes a rise in terrorism and a fresh influx of Afghan refugees, the report said.Pakistani officials, quoted by the local newspaper, said although Taliban gains were quite rapid in recent weeks, the situation could change if the Afghan security forces show some resistance.In recent weeks, the insurgents have seized nearly a third of Afghanistan’s rural districts and besieged several provincial capitals. Hundreds of Afghan security force members have fled into neighbouring Tajikistan in the face of Taliban advances since the US vacated its main Afghan base as part of a plan to withdraw all foreign troops by September 11.“Therefore, it is too early to predict where things are heading in Afghanistan. The situation at best is volatile and unpredictable,” a Pakistani official said when asked about the chances of Afghanistan slipping into another phase of chaos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-predicts-civil-war-in-afghanistan-will-add-5-lakh-afghan-refugees-101625672154677.html

His original name was Yousuf Khan.Pakistan's top leadership, including President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan, condoled Kumar's death, describing him as "an outstanding actor, a humble man, and a dignified personality".Kumar, India’s enduring film legend through the decades, died at a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday after prolonged illness.In 1998, the Pakistan government honoured Kumar with the 'Nishan-e-Imtiaz' - the country’s highest civilian award.The government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) condoled the demise of the legendary actor, saying he will always be remembered for the love and affection he had for the people of his ancestral home town in the province.The Pakistan government has already declared his native house as a national heritage and completed all formalities to convert it into a museum in his name.Lateef-ur-Rehman, Spokesman of KP Archeology, Sports and Tourism Department, said the provincial government has taken over the possession of Kumar's ancestral house and it would soon be converted into a museum.Kumar visited Peshawar in the early 90's. He was given an unprecedented reception and welcome by the people of Peshawar.The Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, put up a banner offering "special condolences to his bereaved family".Peshawar's leading businessman and ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Senator Mohsin Aziz said Kumar was his uncle in relation and the entire Peshawar city is in a state of mourning due to his demise."I am deeply shocked after hearing that my uncle is no more in this world," said Aziz.Aziz said Kumar left Peshawar in 1935 at the age of 13 for Mumbai and excelled himself in the field of acting."When Dilip uncle visited Peshawar in 1998, he exclusively requested for Peshawari Chappal and Kurta Pajama being his favourite shoe and dress that was provided by his family," Aziz said.Sarfraz, who deals in artificial jewellery business in Mohallah Khudadad close to Kumar’s ancestral property, expressed deep sorrow and grief over the actor's death."We lost a great man. The people of Peshawar will always remember him and his services," he said.Majeed Lala, who also owned a shop, said he was shocked on hearing about Kumar's death.Often known as the Nehruvian hero, he did his first film 'Jwar Bhata' in 1944 and his last 'Qila' in 1998, 54 years later. The five-decade career included 'Mughal-e-Azam', 'Devdas', 'Naya Daur', and 'Ram Aur Shyam', and later, as he graduated to character roles, 'Shakti' and 'Karma'.The actor is survived by his wife Saira Banu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dilip-kumar-s-fans-gather-for-funeral-prayers-at-his-ancestral-house-in-peshawar-101625670383961.html

During a news conference in Geneva, Ryan warned countries with low levels of vaccination coverage against opening up, saying the presence of variants could start filling the hospitals again.“Countries opening up who have very low levels of vaccination coverage in the presence of variants is a real toxic mixture for your hospitals filling up again. And this is something that must absolutely be avoided,” said Ryan.Commenting on Britain’s decision to remove most of the coronavirus-induced restrictions, the senior WHO official said all countries are trying to reach a balance of measures that allow their societies to open up while trying to maintain an element of control over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). He said that the United Kingdom, which has achieved a high rate of vaccination, is “very alert to the threat represented by variants, especially the Delta variant.” Ryan, however, also stressed that countries need to be extremely cautious and have to be ready to step back.Also Read | WHO recommends lifesaving tocilizumab, sarilumab for critically ill Covid-19 patientsAt the press briefing, WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhnom Ghebreyesus reiterated the need to share vaccines with low- and lower-middle-income countries. The WHO chief criticised the decision of some countries with high vaccination coverage to roll out booster shots in the coming months and drop public health social measures. The top WHO official said that variants are winning the race against vaccines because of inequitable vaccine production and distribution."Vaccine nationalism, where a handful of nations have taken the lion’s share, is morally indefensible and an ineffective public health strategy against a respiratory virus that is mutating quickly and becoming increasingly effective at moving from human-to-human," said Ghebreyesus.“It didn’t have to be this way and it doesn’t have to be this way going forward," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/toxic-mixture-who-warns-countries-with-low-vaccination-coverage-against-opening-up-economies-101625672248397.html

The Biden administration has been counting on high vaccination coverage to restore normalcy by relaxing federal guidelines on coronavirus-induced restrictions but the spread of the Delta variant has caused concern to the authorities.The new Covid-19 cases related to Delta variant accounts for more than 51% of Covid-19 infections in the country, as per the CDC. The ‘variant of concern’ B.1.617.2 was first detected in India and now accounts for more than 80% of new infections in several US states, including Missouri, Kansas and Iowa. In western US states like Utah and Colorado, the Delta variant is causing 74.3% of infections.The United States has been administering mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna to reach the so-called herd immunity but vaccine hesitancy has emerged as a major roadblock in achieving the goal. Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned that the Delta variant poses a "significant threat" to unvaccinated people, saying the variant was not only more transmissible, but it can also cause more severe disease."If ever there was a reason to get vaccinated, this is it," Dr Anthony Fauci told CNN on Tuesday.Texas A&M University virologist Benjamin Neuman said mRNA vaccines appear to provide protection against the Delta variant but a large number of unvaccinated individuals in the state remain a concern. The low percentage of vaccination coverage in Texas has made it difficult for experts to predict the threat of the Delta variant.“It really depends on what's out there, and at the moment we’re not sure. At best you might be able to get away with it, at worst it could be really bad. I think we just don’t know,” Neuman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-now-dominant-in-us-makes-up-over-half-of-covid-19-cases-cdc-101625666793485.html

The UN health agency on Tuesday updated its patient care guidelines to include the drugs that are lifesaving in critically ill Covid-19 patients, especially when administered alongside corticosteroids.The drugs were recommended after analysing data from over 10,000 patients enrolled in 27 clinical trials. According to the WHO, patients severely or critically ill with Covid-19 often suffer from an overreaction of the immune system, which can be very harmful to the patient’s health. IL-6 blocking drugs – tocilizumab and sarilumab – act to suppress this overreaction and were in high demand during India’s devastating second wave of Covid-19 which claimed thousands of lives.A study showed that administering interleukin-6 receptor blocker drugs to critically ill patients with Covid-19 reduces the odds of death by 13%, compared to the standard care. The chances of mechanical ventilation required by severe and critical patients were also reduced by 28%. These are the first drugs found to be effective against Covid-19 since corticosteroids were recommended by WHO in September 2020.The WHO urged drug manufacturers to reduce prices of the lifesaving drugs and make supplies available to low- and middle-income countries, especially where the virus is surging. While highlighting the inaccessibility of IL-6 in the majority of the world, WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu said in a statement that the drugs offer hope for patients and families suffering from the impact of severe Covid-19.“The inequitable distribution of vaccines means that people in low- and middle-income countries are most susceptible to severe forms of COVID-19. So, the greatest need for these drugs is in countries that currently have the least access. We must urgently change this,” the WHO chief added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-recommends-lifesaving-tocilizumab-sarilumab-for-critically-ill-covid-19-patients-101625663124372.html

First Lady Martine Moise was also shot and is currently receiving treatment, added Joseph.“The country’s security situation is under the control of the National Police of Haiti and the Armed Forces of Haiti," Joseph stated, adding, “Democracy and the republic will win.”While Joseph said that some of the assailants spoke Spanish, but offered no further explanation on who could be behind the assassination. The interim prime minister said that police have been deployed to the National Palace and the upscale community of Pétionville.Haiti, a Caribbean nation of more than 11 million people, had grown unstable under Moise amid a constitutional crisis. Moise, a former banana exporter, and his supporters had been claiming that his term should end in 2022, five years after he took the office in early 2017. This stance was also backed by the United States, the UN and the Organization of American States.However, the opposition leaders were of the view that Moise should have stepped down in February this year, citing a constitutional provision that starts the clock when a President is elected, not when he takes office. Moise took the office a year after he was elected following a chaotic election that forced the appointment of a provisional President to serve during the year-long gap.Opposition leaders accused Moise of seeking to increase his power as he had been ruling by decree for more than two years after Haiti failed to hold elections. Haiti has also been facing deep economic, political and social woes.The capital of Port-au-Prince has been witnessing a spike in gang violence amid a scarcity of food and fuel. About 60% of Haiti’s population makes less than $2 a day and the region has been trying to recover from the devastation caused by the 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew that struck in 2016.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-president-jovenel-mo-se-assassination-what-do-we-know-so-far-101625658513059.html

According to forecasters, Elsa is now tracking off the Florida west coast where it is expected to make landfall in the morning with threats of storm surge flooding, strong winds, heavy rain and isolated tornadoes.Florida governor Ron DeSantis has been urging the residents to take the warnings seriously as the cyclone is expected to come ashore sometime between 8am and 9am. “We ask that you please take it seriously,” DeSantis said on Tuesday. “This is not a time to joyride because we do have hazardous conditions out there.”Elsa briefly turned into a hurricane on Tuesday evening, causing concern for the state authorities as they were already struggling with the Florida condo collapse disaster, further complicating the search and rescue operation. According to the National Hurricane Center, Elsa’s maximum sustained winds stood at 120kmph early Wednesday when its core was 105km southwest of Tampa."Elsa is forecast to make landfall along the north Florida Gulf Coast by late Wednesday morning and then move across the south-eastern United States through Thursday," the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.Meanwhile, the National Weather Service’s Tampa Bay office has issued a tornado watch for parts of Florida until 8am. Hurricane warnings remain in place even as the system weakened to a tropical storm on Wednesday. More than 12 million people across three states are under a tropical storm warning.Forecasters have predicted that Elsa would slice across inland north Florida as a tropical storm with strong rains and wind before moving on to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia and then heading out in the Atlantic Ocean by Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-us-states-under-tropical-storm-warning-as-elsa-nears-landfall-in-florida-101625653927281.html

The images of a 51-centimetre-tall cow, Rani, has set off a tourist frenzy after local newspapers and television channels threw the spotlight on the tiny bovine. Despite the nationwide lockdown, people are flocking in rickshaws to a farm in Charigram, 30 kilometres southwest of Dhaka, to see Rani."I have never seen anything like this in my life. Never," said Rina Begum, 30, who arrived at Charigram from a neighbouring town.According to news agency AFP, Rani is 66-centimetres-long and weighs only 26 kilograms. MA Hasan Howlader, manager of Shikor Agro farm, where Rani lives, claims that the cow is shorter than Manikyam, a small bovine from Kerala that currently holds the Guinness World Record for the shortest cow. Howlader has been using a tape measure to show dozens of onlookers to claim the record.Rani is a Bhutanese cow, prized for its meat in Bangladesh, and other Bhutanese, or bhuttis, on the Shikor Agro farm are twice Rani's size. The owner said that most of the visitors want to take selfies with Rani and more than 15,000 people have come to see Rani in the past three days alone."Honestly speaking, we are tired," Howlader told AFP.The shortest cow, Manikyam, is a Vechur – a breed well known for producing dwarf cows with a maximum height of 90cm. Manikyam, owned by Ashkay NV, in Kerala, measured 61.1cm from the hoof to the withers when a team from Guinness World Records travelled to Kerala.“It is hot and particularly humid here, and we believe this has an effect on the height of our cattle.

Though it has declined to change its drawdown schedule or slow it down, the US has said politically negotiated settlement is the only way forward in Afghanistan, and not a military solution.State department spokesperson said at a separate briefing that “any Afghan government that comes to power at the barrel of a gun, that comes to power through the use of force, is almost certainly going to lack … critical ingredients” that will be needed - international assistance, international legitimacy and popular support of the Afghan people.The Taliban have sought to assure the world of their commitment to a negotiated settlement but have stalled talks till the US forces are out. The last round that was supposed to take place in Istanbul, Turkey was never held.As an important stakeholder in Afghan peace, India has watched US drawdown with some concern. On a recent US visit, external affairs minister S Jaishankar attributed US drawdown to “political expediency”. And at a UNSC debate, he reiterated India’s call for a “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire” in Afghanistan and for the United Nations to play a leading role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bagram-exit-was-coordinated-with-afghans-us-101625633118528.html

The country could experience a "harsh lean period" as early as next month, the UN body has said. According to the FAO report, as quoted by AFP, North Korea is projected to produce a "near-average level" of 5.6 million tonnes of grain this year, which is around 1.1 million tonnes short of the amount required to feed its entire population. With "commercial imports officially planned at 205,000 tonnes", North Korea will likely face a food shortage of around 860,000 tonnes.Explained: Why Kim Jong Un’s weight issue is a talking point across the world"If this gap is not adequately covered through commercial imports and/or food aid, households could experience a harsh lean period from August to October," it said.What is the present food crisis situation in North Korea?In June, North Korean leader Kim Jon Un formally addressed the food shortage issue of the country and said the situation is now getting tense. Reports said the price of rice skyrocketed in June and corn has been on the rising path since the beginning of 2021. South Korea's Korea Institute of National Unification has said rice price has soared owing to a lack of supply. In 2020, North Korean grain production also fell by an estimate of 5.2 per cent.Several key government officials have been replaced apparently for the mismanagement of the crisis.What led to the food crisisNorth Korea shut its borders since 2020 amid the pandemic, while its own agriculture sector failed because of flood damage. All these, compounded with the ongoing international sanctions on the country, have led to this situation. But the food crisis was not unforeseen as the crunch began from last year itself. According to a report from the US department of agriculture, North Koreans were eating 445 calories less a day than the 2,100-calorie diet recommended by the United Nations.How will North Korea overcome the food crisis?In an article, South China Morning Post has said "emaciated" Kim Jong Un will ride out the famine in North Korea with China's help. Kim's greetings to Xi Jinping on the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the Chinese Communist Party are being interpreted by experts as a message from Kim that North Korea's strong ties with Beijing will help Pyongyang navigate the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harsh-lean-period-kim-jong-un-s-north-korea-to-face-food-shortage-of-860-000-tonnes-this-year-101625630756469.html

At least 60 people were left injured in the disaster, many of who were emergency responders. An 18-year-old volunteer firefighter was killed in the fire. More than 30 people have also been admitted to the hospital.A second explosion at a chemical plant in Bangkok left Thailand rattled on Tuesday, hours after the first blaze was extinguished in firefighting operations lasting well over an entire day. At the end of it, only twisted metal frames and charred remains were what remained of the Ming Dih chemical factory warehouses, reported the Associated Press, adding that the back-to-back explosions powerful enough to blow out the windows and doors of nearby residences.Even while the first blaze was being doused with water and foam to keep the highly flammable chemical styrene monomer from reigniting, a second explosion triggered a new fire on Tuesday afternoon that burned for about an hour, the agency added.Police questioned the factory manager in their investigation of the cause of the explosion, who told them that he and eight staff members were woken from their sleep on the site by a strong chemical smell and fled just before the blast, said Maj. Gen. Chumpol Poompuang, the district's police commander.Authorities ordered a 5-kilometer (3-mile) area around the foam and plastic pellet manufacturing factory, near Bangkok's main airport, evacuated as the factory burned, telling residents to avoid inhaling any fumes and warning that they could cause dizziness and vomiting, and cancer in the long term.(With inputs from AP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-explosion-at-bangkok-chemical-plant-sparks-new-blaze-over-60-injured-101625623469400.html

Severely ill Covid-19 patients experience an immune system overreaction known as a "cytokine storm" that can cause severe organ damage and death, the study noted.Tocilizumab and sarilumab are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition, by inhibiting the effects of interleukin (IL)-6, a type of protein called a cytokine that signals the body to mount an inflammatory response.But previous research on whether IL-6 inhibitors can be useful against severe Covid-19 have variously reported benefit, no effect and harm. This prompted the WHO to coordinate the new study that combined data from 27 randomized trials conducted across 28 countries, the study said.The analysis included information on 10,930 patients, of whom 6,449 were randomly assigned to receive interleukin-6 inhibitors and 4,481 to receive usual care or placebo. Overall, the risk of Covid-19 death within 28 days was 22 per cent compared with an assumed risk of 25 per cent in those receiving only usual care.Outcomes were better when patients also received corticosteroids with the risk of dying 21 per cent compared to 25 per cent for those receiving usual care. This means that for every 100 such patients, four more will survive, the study said.The study also examined the impact of these drugs on whether patients progressed to ventilators or death. Among patients also given corticosteroids, the risk was found to be 26 percent for those receiving IL-6 inhibitors compared with an assumed 33 percent in those receiving usual care. For every 100 such patients, seven more will survive and avoid mechanical ventilation.Tocilizumab and sarilumab which are given by infusion or injection are currently recommended for use along with corticosteroids in severe Covid-19 patients by Britain. The United States also recommends tocilizumab with corticosteroids.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arthritis-drugs-tocilizumab-and-sarilumab-lower-deaths-by-covid-19-says-study-101625623227206.html

More than 182 million Americans have received at least one shot, including nearly 90 per cent of seniors and 70 per cent of adults over the age of 27,” Biden said."By the end of this week, we'll have reached the mark of 160 million fully vaccinated Americans. That's a goal I set in March that I'm thrilled we're going to hit just a few days after July the Fourth. So, we will have 160 million fully vaccinated Americans -- up from roughly three million when we took office five months ago," he said after receiving a briefing from his entire Covid team.Biden said businesses are reopening and projected economic growth is the highest it's been in four decades."The bottom line is: The virus is on the run, and America is coming back. We're coming back together. This is one of the greatest achievements in American history, and you, the American people, made it happen,” he said.At the same time, the president said America's fight against the virus is not over as a large number of people are still unvaccinated because of which their communities are at risk."This is an even bigger concern because of the Delta variant,” he said, adding that the Delta variant is already responsible for half of all cases in many parts of the country.Biden said it's more easily transmissible and potentially more dangerous."It seems to me that it should cause everybody to think twice. And it should cause reconsideration, especially in young people who may have thought that they didn't have to be vaccinated, didn't have to worry about it, or didn't have to do anything about it up to now," he said.The president said the good news is that vaccines are highly effective."Fully vaccinated Americans have a high degree of protection, including against this Delta variant. Study after study after study has shown that, since early May, virtually every Covid-19 hospitalisation and death in the US has been among the unvaccinated," Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-reach-160-million-fully-vaccinated-americans-by-end-of-this-week-biden-101625622975186.html

It announced opening up the field to other players, including Amazon, the biggest cloud computing provider.The move comes after the Bide administration said it would likely parcel out the project to multiple companies, a departure from Trump's policies, who favoured a single provider.Why this is a big deal?Software companies have been trying to persuade the government and businesses that it was safe to shift computing work into their data centers. They have presented various studies to prove the point that cloud computing is safe.Grabbing the contract of US military by meeting all their security requirements will act as a stamp of approval to sway other companies.The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) was part of a broader digital modernisation of the Pentagon aimed at making it more technologically agile.What happened in 2019?Trump awarded the contract to Microsoft despite bids from technology titans like Amazon, IBM and Oracle. The former US President had taken public swipes at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, saying he was reviewing the company's bid after complaints form other players.The contract was put on hold after Amazon filed a lawsuit challenging the decision. The company claimed that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from Amazon.What does the latest decision mean for Microsoft?Experts say the cancellation and new contract could benefit Microsoft because the company has had nearly two years during the legal wrangling to invest in its technology."If there is now another competition, Microsoft is going in from a better position," Mark Moerdler, a senior research analyst at Bernstein, told news agency Reuters.Microsoft, meanwhile, said in a statement that the company was confident it will "continue to be successful as the DoD selects partners for new work". Microsoft could submit a termination bid to recover costs of the scrapped project, Sherman said.Amazon too has welcomed the cancellation of the deal.The Pentagon hopes to have the first awards by April 2022 for its new Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-hits-reset-on-trump-s-10-billion-cloud-deal-all-you-need-to-know-101625621954611.html

It added that cases of lambda variant have been detected in more than 30 countries in the past four weeks."The Lambda strain was reported to have originated from Peru, the country with the highest mortality rate in the world," the Malaysian health ministry tweeted on Monday.It cited a report by the Australian news portal news.com.au saying that the lambda strain had been detected in the United Kingdom too. The researchers are worried that this variant may be "more infectious than the Delta variant", The Star reported.Lambda accounts for nearly 82 per cent of the coronavirus case samples reported during May and June in Peru, Euro News reported citing the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO).In Chile, another South American country, the strain accounts for more than 31 per cent of the samples from May and June, according to Euro News.The World Health Organization (WHO) has already designated lambda as 'variant of interest' due to its elevated presence in South America. The global health body said that lambda shows increased transmission and resistance to antibodies.Meanwhile, Public Health England (PHE) has added lambda to its list of variants under investigation (VUI) due to international expansion and several notable mutations, including L452Q and F490S.Six cases of Lambda have been identified across the country to date, all have been linked to overseas travel, according to PHE.According to UK health officials, there is currently no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective. But PHE said it is carrying out laboratory testing to better understand the impact of mutations on the behaviour of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lambda-variant-of-coronavirus-deadlier-than-delta-malaysian-health-ministry-101625620329562.html

This comes in the wake of Elsa weakening into a tropical storm near Cuba earlier on Tuesday before regaining its hurricane status back ahead of Florida landfall.Hurricane Elsa is headed toward Florida's northern Gulf Coast at incredible speeds of up to 75 mph (121 kmph), the Associated Press reported, citing the National Weather Service. A hurricane alert has been issued for the coastline -- a long stretch between the Egmont Key at the mouth of Tampa Bay and the Steinhatchee River in Florida's Big Bend area.Elsa is projected to make landfall somewhere in between these areas in Florida anytime from 8am and 9am today (US time; here in India the news is likely to be received around the evening).At 5:30am IST on Wednesday, Hurricane Elsa was located about 100 miles south-southwest of Tampa Bay, Florida, according to Accuweather. The region is highly vulnerable to a storm surge, an AP report noted, due to the shallow offshore waters. It is likely that the Tampa Bay area would take a hard hit from the storm overnight, the report quoted Florida governor Ron DeSantis as saying.The storm surge could reach five feet (1.5 meters) over normally dry land in the Tampa Bay area if Elsa passes at high tide, forecasters said. The storm's westward shift spared the lower Florida Keys a direct hit on Tuesday, but the islands were still getting plenty of rain and wind. Tropical storm warnings were posted for the Florida Keys from Craig Key westward to the Dry Tortugas and for the west coast of Florida from Flamingo northward to the Ochlockonee River.(With inputs from Associated Press)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-elsa-turns-into-hurricane-alert-issued-in-florida-101625617493044.html

Mir Asadullah Kohistani, Bagram’s new commander said.U.S. military spokesman Col. Sonny Leggett did not address the specific complaints of many Afghan soldiers who inherited the abandoned airfield, instead referring to a statement last week.The statement said the handover of the many bases had been in the process soon after President Joe Biden’s mid-April announcement that America was withdrawing the last of its forces.Leggett said in the statement that they had coordinated their departures with Afghanistan’s leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-troops-left-bagram-airfield-silently-at-night-101625615041147.html

The CENTCOM said it has officially handed over seven bases to the Afghan security forces and evacuated the equivalent of nearly 1,000 C-17 air freighter loads of equipment from the country, ahead of the September 11 deadline to complete the troop pull-out.On Friday, US forces handed over the sprawling Bagram air base north of Kabul, the main centre of US military operations in the country for most of the past two decades of conflict.Tuesday’s announcement underscored that most of the process of withdrawing US military and civilian personnel ordered by President Joe Biden in April had been completed.At the time of Biden’s order, there were officially 2,500 US troops and 16,000 private contractors in Afghanistan. According to reports there were also some 1,000 US special forces operating in the country at the time who were not included in the official tally.While Biden had set a deadline of September 11, the Pentagon has moved quickly to reduce its presence to a minimum.“We expect it to be completed by the end of August,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday after the Bagram handover. The US is expected to keep a reported 650 or more military personnel in the country to protect the US embassy and diplomats.Time to retake districtsAfghan authorities on Tuesday vowed to retake all the districts lost to the Taliban group and deployed hundreds of commandos to counter the insurgents’ blistering offensive in the north, a day after more than 1,000 government troops fled into neighbouring Tajikistan.“There is war, there is pressure. Sometimes things are working our way. Sometimes they don’t, but we will continue to defend the Afghan people,” the country’s national security adviser Hamdullah Mohib told reporters. “We have plans to retake the districts.”Troops and pro-government militiamen were deployed in the northern provinces of Takhar and Badakshan. Afghan defence officials have said they intend to focus on securing major cities, roads and border towns in the face of the Taliban onslaught.Afghan ambassador Farid Mamundzay, meanwhile, briefed India’s foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Tuesday on the evolving security situation in Afghanistan in the face of escalating violence and the withdrawal of US troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-closing-in-on-total-pullout-101625614449645.html
