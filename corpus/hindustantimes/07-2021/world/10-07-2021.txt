In the final communique after meeting in Venice, the finance ministers and central bankers of G20 nations, however, underlined that the global outlook has further improved since their meeting in April, mainly due to the rollout of vaccines and continued policy support.“We reaffirm our resolve to use all available policy tools for as long as required to address the adverse consequences of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), especially on the most impacted, such as women, youth and informal and low-skilled workers,” the statement read.US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said the G20 meetings were further confirmation that the world is ready to end the global race to the bottom on corporate taxation, adding that there's broad consensus on a global minimum tax of at least 15%. Citing the backing of 131 nations on the global minimum tax, Yellen said that the world should now move quickly to finalise the deal.“In addition to tax, the G20 made good progress on a range of issues, including climate change and the effort to help lower income nations with their vaccine rollout so the world can finally neutralize the threat of Covid-19,” she added.Union minister for finance & corporate affairs Nirmala Sitharaman participated virtually in the meeting under the Italian Presidency. The two-day meeting on July 9-10 saw discussions on a wide range of issues including global economic risks and health challenges, policies for recovery from the Covid-19, international taxation, sustainable finance and financial sector issues.According to the ministry of finance, Sitharaman shared the Indian experience of integrating technology with inclusive service delivery during the pandemic. She also shared her insights on the Italian Presidency’s ongoing work on a roadmap to guide sustainable finance, the ministry of finance said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-variants-vaccination-pace-could-threaten-economic-recovery-warns-g20-101625938201267.html
10-07-2021||World||Pakistan says ‘not a guarantor’ of Afghan peace process as Taliban march on||As the Taliban make rapid territorial gains in Afghanistan, the Pakistani military on Saturday said that Islamabad is a facilitator of the Afghan peace process and not a guarantor. In an interview with ARY News, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director-general Babar Iftikhar said that Pakistan has tried to move the Afghan peace process with “sincerity”, adding that the United States withdrawal from the region happened a “little quickly.”"Of course other stakeholders have been a part of this, but Pakistan has played a key role," said Gen Iftikhar.“It is still a facilitator of this peace process, we are not guarantors," he added.Pakistan has been evasive on the question of the Taliban’s role in rising violence in Afghanistan even as the group continues its offensive in the war-torn country. Amid the final withdrawal of US troops in the region, the Taliban have taken control of most of the border areas near Iran and Tajikistan, causing immense concern for the Afghan government.“We have always said that we have no favourites in Afghanistan. The Afghan people have to decide which government they want and how to take the country forward," said Gen Iftikhar.Pakistan wants the US to delay the withdrawal until a transition takes place, as expressed by Gen Iftikhar during the interview, but doesn’t want to host bases on its soil. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan recently ruled out the possibility of hosting American bases for military action inside Afghanistan. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Khan argued that Pakistan cannot host American bases as they have “already paid too heavy a price.”“If Pakistan were to agree to host US bases, from which to bomb Afghanistan, and an Afghan civil war ensued, Pakistan would be targeted for revenge by terrorists again," said Khan.On Friday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that there is a “legitimacy aspect” to whoever gets to govern Afghanistan, adding that it "can not and should not be ignored." Speaking at a joint press conference in Moscow alongside Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, Jaishankar stressed the need for an immediate reduction in violence in Afghanistan, given its direct implication for regional security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-says-not-a-guarantor-of-afghan-peace-process-as-taliban-march-on-101625932861560.html
10-07-2021||World||Delta variant threatens US tourist hub, Missouri’s Ozark Mountains||Nestled in Missouri’s Ozark Mountains, the city of Branson has long drawn throngs of U.S. tourists with live country music, a replica Titanic, Dolly Parton’s Stampede dinner show, an 1880s theme park and an oversized bust of Ronald Reagan.But Branson now has another, more dire claim to fame as the origin of Missouri’s outbreak of the delta variant -- the coronavirus strain that now accounts for more than half of U.S. cases.Missouri’s delta outbreak has raised alarms nationally as the U.S. races to contain the variant, which is more transmissible than the original strain that ground the world to a halt and killed millions. With large swaths of the country’s population declining vaccines, the delta variant threatens to derail U.S. efforts to return to normal.Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this week singled out southwestern Missouri -- the region that includes Branson -- as one of several hot-spots for the variant.“Low vaccination rates in these counties, coupled with high case rates and lax mitigation policies that do not protect those who are unvaccinated from disease, will certainly and sadly lead to more unnecessary suffering, hospitalization and potential death,” Walensky said in a briefing on Thursday. “We are really encouraging people who are not vaccinated yet to get vaccinated and wear a mask until you do.”Branson is an ideal incubator, the sort of place that would worry Walensky. It sits at a crossroads of the U.S. South and Midwest, playing host to big crowds that pack entertainment venues and restaurants. It heaps on feel-good Americana, and mostly caters to conservative regions where the pandemic has become a political litmus test and vaccinations lag the national average.Trump flags and hats dot the streetscape; almost no one wears masks.And there appears to be little concern in Branson, where -- as in other conservative regions across the U.S. -- doubts about vaccines and the virus alike run deep. The town in April elected Larry Milton as mayor after he ran on an anti-mask platform. Branson is now fully reopened, shows have resumed at full capacity -- Dolly Parton’s Stampede suggests masks for the unvaccinated, but doesn’t require them -- tourists line the streets and restaurants are full. Covid restrictions have vanished.Missouri’s Republican governor, Mike Parson, joined revelers for a crowded outdoor July 4th celebration in the town, in the throes of an outbreak. Parson, who didn’t respond to a request for comment, has offered mixed messages on vaccinations -- he criticized President Joe Biden for suggesting this week that shots could be promoted door-to-door, before tweeting on Thursday that vaccination is the best way to prevent Covid-19.Branson was the first place in Missouri that the delta variant was found. Marc Johnson, a University of Missouri researcher working with the state to track coronavirus variants, first detected it on May 10 in one part of the city’s sewer system. A week later, it was found in the other part -- and in two other Missouri towns. A week after that, it was in nearby counties. Now it’s throughout the state.‘It’s Everywhere’“It’s everywhere,” Johnson said. “And I expect that everywhere that we have not seen a spike yet, we are about to.”The delta variant now accounts for more than half of U.S. cases, according to CDC estimates. Of the counties with the most new cases, 93% are less than 40% vaccinated, Walensky said. These are the locations where hospitalizations and deaths are rising among the unvaccinated, and tend to be where delta is dominant, she said, stressing that nearly every American who now falls severely ill or dies hasn’t been inoculated.Hospitalizations are rising in southern Missouri – Branson’s most serious cases go to nearby Springfield, where one hospital set a record this week for Covid-19 admissions. The hospitals have made public appeals for staff and ventilators.“All of the sudden everybody said it’s done, but it’s not,” said Tom Keller, president and chief executive officer of Ozarks Healthcare, which runs a hospital and clinics in southern Missouri. “I don’t know how the delta variant got to Springfield, Missouri, and didn’t get to the East Coast first.”The health community hasn’t been blunt enough in warning how Covid can ravage the body, Keller said: “We’re going to be a lot more direct.”Polling has shown that political conservatives are less likely to get the vaccine and more likely to say they think the pandemic is over, a combination that, in the face of delta, risks fresh outbreaks.In neighboring Arkansas, cases and hospitalizations are rising sharply, too. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said this week that the state saw its largest increase in hospitalizations since January. “We are losing ground,” he said, adding that the delta variant appears to hitting younger people.The average age of patients hospitalized for Covid-19 has fallen to 54.7 years from 62.7 in January, he said. “If you don’t want to go to the hospital, get vaccinated,” he warned.Across Missouri’s western border, Kansas has begun public-service announcements to head off what officials there fear will be a spread of the variant stemming from July 4th celebrations. The state has been monitoring rising case loads in neighboring states for weeks, said Sam Coleman, a spokesman for the governor.‘Lack of Proof’But in Missouri, local health officials say there is still deep skepticism in the region about coronavirus vaccines, and many people are misinformed about the safety of the shot and the danger of the virus.A political lens is unavoidable for the growing U.S. vaccine gap. The vaccination rate in counties that backed Biden for president is roughly 12 percentage points higher than those that backed Donald Trump, up from 2.2% in April, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation“I’ve had people tell me: ‘I’ve had it, it was no big deal, I’m not going to get vaccinated,’” said Craig McCoy, a former paramedic who’s president of Mercy Springfield Communities, which operates a hospital in Springfield. “What they don’t realize is that people with antibodies of the alpha variant are sitting in our hospital with the delta variant.”In Branson, some lay out broad skepticism with the vaccine – saying they worry it’s rushed and potentially unsafe.“It’s lack of proof,” said Stephen Pello, 63, a carpenter from Texas, during a recent visit to Branson. “I don’t trust the CDC, I don’t trust the politicians; I trust what the Bible tells me and what the Spirit puts in my heart.”Pello said his doctor mentioned vaccination to him, but didn’t press the issue after Pello said he needed more information. He suspects others like him might get the shot if Trump more fervently urged them to do so, but he said even that wouldn’t change his mind.‘We’re Not Done’Charliese Holder, 61, a Branson visitor from Oklahoma, also expressed skepticism about information coming from government officials, including Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert.“I think there’s been too much wishy-wash from Fauci and the others,” Holder said as she ate an ice cream cone outside a packed shop on Branson’s main street. She said she hasn’t ruled out getting the vaccine, but has doubts about its efficacy.“Even though they’re calling this a vaccine, per se, the way they’re making it sound, I don’t think it’s any different than the flu shot,” she said. “There’s a lot of questions that aren’t answered.”Johnson, the University of Missouri researcher, said that the key unknown about the latest outbreaks is when caseloads will plateau, and how the delta wave will look in more heavily vaccinated communities.“We’re not done, the virus is not done, there is going to be a wave through the U.S. It could be that the really highly vaccinated places do okay, but I’m not even really sure about that,” Johnson said. “Either way, I am absolutely convinced it’s not going to stay in Missouri.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-threatens-us-tourist-hub-missouri-s-ozark-mountains-101625928210501.html
10-07-2021||World||Haiti requests US to deploy troops after the President's assassination||Haiti’s interim government said it asked the U.S. to deploy troops to protect key infrastructure as it tries to stabilize the country and prepare for elections in the aftermath of President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination.Amid the confusion, hundreds of Haitians gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince pleading for a way out of the country. Women carried babies and young men waved passports and ID cards as they cried out, “Refuge!” and “Help!”“We definitely need assistance and we’ve asked our international partners for help,” Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph told The Associated Press in a phone interview late Friday. “We believe our partners can assist the national police in resolving the situation.”The stunning request for U.S. military support recalled the tumult following Haiti’s last presidential assassination, in 1915, when an angry mob dragged President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam out of the French Embassy and beat him to death. In response, President Woodrow Wilson sent the Marines into Haiti, justifying the American military occupation — which lasted nearly two decades — as a way to avert anarchy.But the Biden administration has so far given no indication it will provide military assistance. For now, it only plans to send FBI officials to help investigate a crime that has plunged Haiti, a country already wracked by gaping poverty and gang violence, into a destabilizing battle for power and constitutional standoff.On Friday, a group of lawmakers announced they had recognized Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti’s dismantled senate, as provisional president in a direct challenge to the interim government’s authority. They also recognized as prime minister Ariel Henry, whom Moïse had selected to replace Joseph a day before he was killed but who had not yet taken office or formed a government.One of those lawmakers, Rosemond Pradel, a former secretary general of Haiti’s provisional electoral commission, told the AP that Joseph “is neither qualified nor has the legal right” to lead the country.Joseph expressed dismay that others would try to take advantage of Moïse’s murder for political gain.“I’m not interested in a power struggle,” said Joseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military. “There’s only one way people can become president in Haiti. And that’s through elections.”Meanwhile, more details emerged of a killing that increasingly has taken the air of an murky, international conspiracy involving a shootout with gunmen holed up in a foreign embassy, a private security firm operating out of a cavernous warehouse in Miami and a cameo sighting of a Hollywood star.Among those arrested are two Haitian Americans, including one who worked alongside Sean Penn following the nation’s devastating 2010 earthquake. Police have also detained or killed what they described as more than a dozen “mercenaries" who were former members of Colombia’s military.Some of the suspects were seized in a raid on Taiwan’s Embassy where they are believed to have sought refuge. National Police Chief Léon Charles said another eight suspects were still at large and being sought.The attack, which took place at Moïse’s home before dawn Wednesday, also seriously wounded his wife, who was flown to Miami for surgery. Joseph said he has spoken to the first lady but out of respect for her mourning has not inquired about the attack.Colombian officials said the men were recruited by four companies and traveled to the Caribbean nation in two groups via the Dominican Republic. U.S.-trained Colombian soldiers are heavily sought after by private security firms and mercenary armies in global conflict zones because of their experience in a decades-long war against leftist rebels and powerful drug cartels.Some of the men had posted on Facebook photos of themselves visiting the presidential palace and other tourist spots in the Dominican Republic, which shares Hispaniola Island with Haiti.The sister of one of the dead suspects, Duberney Capador, told the AP that she last spoke to her brother late Wednesday — hours after Moïse’s murder — when the men, holed up in a home and surrounded, were desperately trying to negotiate their way out of a shootout.“He told me not to tell our mother, so she wouldn’t worry,” said Yenny Capador, fighting back tears.It’s not known who masterminded the attack. And numerous questions remain about how the perpetrators were able to penetrate the president’s residence posing as U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents, meeting little resistance from those charged with protecting the president.Capador said her brother, who retired from the Colombian army in 2019 with the rank of sergeant, was hired by a private security firm with the understanding he would be providing protection for powerful individuals in Haiti.Capador said she knew almost nothing about the employer but shared a picture of her brother in a uniform emblazoned with the logo of CTU Security — a company based in Doral, a Miami suburb popular with Colombian migrants.The wife of Francisco Uribe, who was among those arrested, told Colombia’s W Radio that CTU offered to pay the men about $2,700 a month — a paltry sum for a dangerous international mission but far more than what most of the men, nonommissioned officers and professional soldiers, earned from their pensions.Uribe is under investigation in the alleged murder of an unarmed civilian in 2008 who was presented as someone killed in combat, one of thousands of extrajudicial killings that rocked Colombia’s U.S.-trained army more than a decade ago.CTU Security was registered in 2008 and lists as its president Antonio Intriago, who is also affiliated with several other Florida-registered entities, some of them since dissolved, including the Counter Terrorist Unit Federal Academy, the Venezuelan American National Council and Doral Food Corp.CTU’s website lists two addresses, one of which is a gray-colored warehouse that was shuttered Friday with no sign indicating who it belonged to. The other is a small suite under a different company’s name in a modern office building a few blocks away. A receptionist at the office said Intriago stops by every few days to collect mail and hold meetings. Intriago, who is Venezuelan, did not return phone calls and an email seeking comment.“We are the ones who are most interested in clarifying what happened, so that my brother’s reputation does not remain like it is,” said Capador. “He was a humble, hard-working man. He had honors and decorations."Besides the Colombians, among those detained by police were two Haitian Americans.Investigative Judge Clément Noël told Le Nouvelliste that the arrested Americans, James Solages and Joseph Vincent, said the attackers originally planned only to arrest Moïse, not kill him. Noël said Solages and Vincent were acting as translators for the attackers, the newspaper reported Friday.Solages, 35, described himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a now-removed website for a charity he started in 2019 in south Florida to assist resident of his home town of Jacmel, on Haiti’s southern coast.He worked briefly as a driver and bodyguard for a relief organization set up by Penn following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed 300,000 Haitians and left tens of thousands homeless. He also lists as past employers the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. His Facebook page, which was also taken down following news of his arrest, features photos of armored military vehicles and a shot of himself standing in front of an American flag.Calls to the charity and Solages’ associates went unanswered. However, a relative in south Florida said Solages doesn’t have any military training and doesn’t believe he was involved in the killing.Joseph refused to specify who was behind the attack, but said that Moïse had earned numerous enemies while attacking powerful oligarchs who for years profited from overly generous state contracts.Some of those elite insiders are now the focus of investigators, with authorities asking that presidential candidate and well-known businessman Reginald Boulos and former Senate President Youri Latortue meet with prosecutors next week for questioning. No further details were provided and none of the men have been charged.Analysts say whoever plotted the brazen attack likely had ties to a criminal underworld that has flourished in recent years as corruption and drug trafficking have become entrenched. The growing power of gangs displaced more than 14,700 people in Haiti last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.“This country has nothing to offer,” said 36-year-old Thermidor Joam, one of those thronged outside the U.S. Embassy on Friday. “If the president can be killed with his own security, I have no protection whatsoever if someone wants to kill me.”Prosecutors also want to interrogate members of Moïse’s security detail, including the president’s security coordinator, Jean Laguel Civil, and Dimitri Hérard, the head of the General Security Unit of the National Palace.“If you are responsible for the president’s security, where have you been?,” Port-au-Prince prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude was quoted as telling French-language newspaper Le Nouvelliste. “What did you do to avoid this fate for the president?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-requests-us-to-deploy-troops-after-the-president-s-assassination-101625925966314.html

Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen told South China Morning Post that the group controls 85 per cent of Afghan territory and would guarantee the safety of Chinese investors and workers.The Taliban has made rapid territorial gains in Afghanistan amid the final withdrawal of US troops, threatening the progress the country made in the last two decades, especially on social issues. During the interview, Shaheen also reportedly assured China that it would not host Uyghur militants from the Xinjiang province.The comments came as China is concerned about Afghanistan becoming a hub for the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a separatist outfit waging an insurgency in Xinjiang. China has been sharply critical of the US move to pull out its troops without stabilising the peace process in Afghanistan. This week, Beijing evacuated 210 Chinese nationals from Afghanistan on a chartered flight.While the Taliban shares close ties with Pakistan, both Beijing and Islamabad face threats from the Islamic militant groups which were part of Al-Qaeda and Taliban. Earlier this week, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said that Beijing and Islamabad need to defend regional peace together as the Afghanistan issue has implications for both countries. China asked its close ally Pakistan to step up cooperation to contain the security risks in the war-torn country following the withdrawal of the foreign forces.Shaheen said the Taliban would also prevent al-Qaeda or any other terrorist group from operating there, reported SCMP. “We have been to China many times and we have good relations with them,” SCMP quoted Shaheen as saying. "If (the Chinese) have investments, of course, we will ensure their safety.”China has been eying big scale investments in Afghanistan as the country has the world’s largest unexploited reserves of copper, coal, iron, gas, cobalt, mercury, gold, lithium and thorium, valued at over USD one trillion. In 2011, the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) won a $400 million bid to drill three oil fields for 25 years, containing roughly 87 million barrels of oil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-calls-china-a-friend-promises-not-to-host-uyghur-militants-in-afghanistan-report-101625926382725.html

This represents a rise of 54,268 cases from last week, as against 50,824 last week from the week before that.We have published updated case numbers for all Variants Under Investigation and Variants of Concern in the UK. Delta cases have risen by 54,268 since last week, a 32% increaseSee the data for yourself: https://t.co/NxiBAaLVss pic.twitter.com/LlMFM9B9T6“The data continues to show that the sharp increase in cases that we’re seeing is not being followed by a similar increase in hospitalisations and death,” Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the PHE, said. “This is because two doses of the available vaccines offer a high level of protection against the Delta variant. Getting both the jabs is the best way to ensure that you and the people you love remain safe. So, we once again urge everyone to come forward for the vaccination as soon as they’re eligible,” Harries said further.She also urged people to remain “careful and cautious” as the country moves towards the planned end of restrictions, on July 19. “Cases are rising across the country, and while the vaccines offer excellent protection, they don’t give 100% safety,” Harries remarked.Also Read: 'Will move away from legal restrictions': UK PM Johnson confirms ending Covid measuresThe weekly PHE study also found that the Delta Plus variant, which is a mutation of the Delta variant, has thus far led to only 44 cases.

It will also allow the city of 3.8 million people, which houses Africa’s largest port, to get more of its energy from renewable sources as Eskom relies almost entirely on coal.Ethekwini is seeking a “diverse mix of sustainable, dispatchable and reliable power generation technologies,” the municipality said on its website, indicating that while it isn’t stipulating which technology should be proposed it does want the power to be available on demand.The request follows the decision by the South African government last year to allow cities to buy power from providers other than Eskom.Johannesburg and Cape Town have similar plans. The City of Johannesburg will issue a request for information for the construction of a 150-megawatt solar plant, 50 megawatts of rooftop solar panels and the refurbishment of an idle gas-fired plant that could generate 20 megawatts in September, the municipality said in a presentation early last month. It will also seek information for the installation of 100 megawatts of battery storage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/durban-1st-city-in-south-africa-to-have-private-energy-contract-101625919362694.html

The US space agency on Saturday said that Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations at Virgin Galactic, will operate the experiment on the “Unity 22” flight on behalf of co-investigators from the University of Florida.As part of the experiment, Bandla will activate three plant-filled tubes to release a preservative at critical data-collection stages - at standard Earth’s gravitational force before the rocket boost, just before entering microgravity, and after the conclusion of microgravity. The university researchers have flown similar experiments on suborbital flights in the past. But the data collected during the Unity 22 flight will provide a “first look at human-tended payloads on SpaceShipTwo.”For years, the two researchers from the University of Florida in Gainesville have been using plants to study biological changes in organisms when they travel through the Earth’s atmosphere and into space. The experiments are aimed at arriving at the answers to fundamental research questions essential to understanding the impact of space travel on humans and other organisms.Also Read | Who is Sirisha Bandla: Know all about Indian-origin woman to fly to spaceCo-principal investigators Robert Ferl and Anna-Lisa Paul began studying how plants respond to microgravity on the molecular level with space shuttle experiments in the late 1990s. The researchers found that plants behave quite differently in space compared to on the ground. They applied the findings to longer-term observations with nine experiments on the International Space Station.“About half of the genes in our bodies encode the exact same proteins in plants,” explained Paul. “And that’s very exciting because it means that as we look at how plants behave in the absence of gravity, we can translate many of those basic biological processes to humans.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sirisha-bandla-to-activate-nasa-supported-plant-experiment-during-virgin-galactic-mission-101625918944618.html

What’s behind sudden rush?||An enormous 1,174-carat diamond was recently unearthed in Botswana, days after another huge precious stone was discovered in the African country. The mining company, Lucara Diamond Corp., said in a statement that the diamond, which measures 77mm long, 55mm wide and 33mm thick, was found at the Karowe diamond mine last month. The company presented the diamond to the government at a ceremony on Wednesday.It is the third diamond of over 1,000 carats unearthed from the same mining location, a world record for Karowe. Apart from the recovery of the rare rock, the mining company also unearthed several other diamonds — weighing 471, 218 and 159 carats — of similar appearance, suggesting the 1,174-carat diamond was part of a larger diamond with an estimated weight of more than 2000 carats.Before the discovery of the mega diamond, another huge 1,098-carat precious stone was discovered in Botswana by diamond firm Debswana, which was then believed to be the world’s third-largest gem-quality stone ever to be mined. The world's second-largest diamond ‘Lesedi La Rona’ was also found in Botswana in 2015.Also Read | Diamond believed to be world's third-largest unearthed in BotswanaHow difficult is it to mine huge diamonds?The vast majority of global diamond production constitutes small diamonds, at less than one carat. Small diamonds are common and only useful for industrial applications. On the other hand, large gemstone-quality diamonds are extremely rare and precious.Billions of years old natural diamonds formed deep in the Earth and some scientists have suggested that there are vast quantities of gem-quality stone hundreds of kilometres deep, according to an article by The Conversation. The authors Jodie Bradby and Nigel Marks wrote that the deepest hole ever drilled is about 12 kilometres and we will never be able to mine these deep-earth diamonds.The report says that the diamonds unearthed by mining companies are typically thought to have come up near the surface due to a deep-source volcanic eruption. The surfacing of diamonds is not an easy process as the volcanic eruption needs to be fast enough to deliver the stones and at the same time, they can’t be exposed to extreme heat, shock or oxygen.Most diamonds are found within igneous rocks called Kimberlite but only a small percentage of all known Kimberlite deposits contain diamonds, the authors said. On top of it, only a handful of these rocks are rich enough with diamonds to warrant being mined, which makes it very difficult to find an ideal condition.What is behind the sudden rush?According to Brady and Marks, large natural diamonds often get destroyed during the mining process when an ore is blasted with explosives and then crushed into fragments to search for diamonds. But companies have come up with new technologies that process with the aid of X-ray ore-sorting technology, specifically targeted for these “mega diamond recovery”.The latest mega diamond from the Karowe mine was recovered using these newer techniques, indicating that more of these enormous stones will be discovered in the future. “Advances in diamond mining techniques, coupled with the inherent rarity of mega diamonds, is a boon for Botswana, where diamonds constitute a significant portion of the country’s GDP,” the duo wrote.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-mega-diamonds-unearthed-in-botswana-within-weeks-what-s-behind-sudden-rush-101625915231938.html

Lists main reasons||World Health Organisation’s (WHO) chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan warned that the pandemic is not waning because coronavirus cases are on the rise all over the world as the delta variant is spreading fast. “In the last 24 hours, close to 500,000 new cases have been reported and about 9,300 deaths -- now that’s not a pandemic that’s slowing down,” she said during a televised interview with BloombergQuint.Swaminathan listed the following reasons for suggesting the pandemic is not over yet.A fast-spreading delta variantSwaminathan said that the delta variant is behind an increase in the number of cases being reported in five out of six WHO regions, and in Africa, mortality rates have spiked from 30% to 40%. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Rochelle Walensky also predicted that the delta variant will drive infections in the US in the coming months. "An estimated 25 per cent of all reported SARS-COV-2 sequences nationwide are the Delta variants, and in some regions of the country, nearly one in two sequences is a Delta variant," ANI said quoting Walensky.Also Read: Covid-19 not slowing down yet, Delta variant spreading rapidly: WHO’s chief scientist Dr Soumya SwaminathanSlow vaccination rolloutsWHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had remarked on June 30 that the most transmissible strain of Covid-19, the Delta variant, is spreading mostly in the unvaccinated population. “Delta is the most transmissible of the variants identified so far, has been identified in at least 85 countries, and is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations,” Ghebreyesus had warned. He insisted that the only way to break the link between transmission and the emergence of new variants is mass vaccination. WHO has been urging COVAX to help nations ramp up their efforts of vaccination through adequate donations.Relaxation of safety measuresWHO has been urging nations to exercise abundant caution while relaxing Covid-19 preventative measures once cases start to decline. The UN body has warned against organising big events and “even backyard barbecues.” “All of these actions have consequences and the Delta variant is spreading rapidly among people who are unvaccinated,” said WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-scientist-warns-coronavirus-pandemic-is-not-over-lists-main-reasons-101625910630997.html

The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AMRC) on Friday warned that “things will get worse before they get better.” The coordinating body of the UK and Ireland's 23 medical royal colleges and faculties said in a statement that the country is already in the turmoil of the third wave of coronavirus, highlighting the dramatic rise in Covid-19 cases.AMRC said the National Health Service (NHS) is currently under unprecedented pressure for a combination of reasons, not all of which are yet clear. “People who stayed away from the NHS during the pandemic are now coming forward, some of them with more serious problems because of the delay in seeking help,” they added.On Friday, the UK reported more than 35,000 infections, the highest in over five months. On average, it has been recording about 410 cases per million people over the past week, one the highest cases in the world per capita. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has branded the July 19 reopening as “Freedom Day” but experts are worried about the message.Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of AMRC, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that “there seems to be a misapprehension that life will return to normal from then [July 19], and that we can throw away all the precautions, and frankly, that would be dangerous.”“We all want to make sure that the public is fully aware that this pandemic is far from over and that when the 19th comes, what we need is a responsible approach and a very cautious approach to relaxing restrictions,” she added.AMRC said that the country will see a rise in other respiratory infections as well Covid-19 cases, adding to the pressures on the NHS when hospitals are trying to tackle the huge backlog in elective work which has built up over the pandemic.“It is like the worst of a bad winter in July,” it said, urging the public to continue to show caution in their approach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-get-worse-experts-warn-as-uk-reports-highest-new-covid-cases-since-jan-22-101625909648526.html

Bandla will be astronaut no 004 and her flight role will be Researcher Experience, according to her profile on Virgin Galactic.She will become the third Indian-origin woman to fly into space after Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams."When I first heard that I was getting this opportunity, it was just. I think that that probably captured it very well, I was speechless. This is an incredible opportunity to get people from different backgrounds, different geographies and different communities into space," she said in a video posted on Virgin Galactic Twitter on July 6.Bandla, a Purdue University alumna, will be evaluating the human-tended research experience, using an experiment from the University of Florida that requires several handheld fixation tubes that will be activated at various points in the flight profile, a statement on the Galactic website said.Bandla started in her role as the Vice President of Government Affairs and Research Operations at Virgin Galactic in January 2021, the university said in a statement.Bandla grew up in Houston, near NASA’s Johnson Space Center, and always wanted to become an astronaut. But poor eyesight meant she could not meet the requirements to become a pilot or an astronaut, derailing her high-school plan to go the Air Force-to-NASA route, she said in the statement."I’ve had fond memories of my time at Purdue,” Bandla said in 2021, “being part of a group of passionate individuals... Purdue built a strong foundation of technical and programmatic principles we all carried into our successful careers.The flight window for the next rocket-powered test flight of its SpaceShipTwo Unity opens July 11, pending weather and technical checks, Galactic said in a statement.The “Unity 22” mission will be the twenty-second flight test for VSS Unity and the company’s fourth crewed spaceflight. It will also be the first to carry a full crew of two pilots and four mission specialists in the cabin, including the company’s founder, Sir Branson, who will be testing the private astronaut experience, it said."I’ve always been a dreamer. My mum taught me to never give up and to reach for the stars. On July 11, it’s time to turn that dream into a reality aboard the next @VirginGalatic spaceflight," Branson tweeted following the announcement on July 2.Building on the success of the company’s most recent spaceflight in May, Unity 22 will focus on cabin and customer experience objectives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-shirisha-bandla-set-to-fly-into-space-tomorrow-101625904054616.html

The impact of the legislation imposed by the Xi Jinping-led communist government in China has left a "chilling effect" on the people of Hong Kong, a report in the Taipei Times noted, citing officials in the mainland affiars council familiar with the matter.The council had, in its report marking the 24th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to China, said that the US-based Freedom House gave the territory the worst rating in the history of its Freedom in the World report at 52 points, back in March. Hong Kong was ranked "partly free," due mainly to the security legislation.Germany's Global Public Policy Institute and Reporters Without Borders similarly downgraded the territory in their respective reports on academic and press freedom, it added.Meanwhile, several people including activists, students, journalists have been arrested in the past few months in Hong Kong under the security legislation. The scope of those prosecuted for a speech from prior to the law's passage -- from politicians to academics and journalists -- has produced a "chilling effect," the council's report said.The press especially is facing "unprecedented political violence," including the redefinition of "media representative" to only recognize workers of media outlets registered with the government, it said.Next Digital has emerged as a victim of the security legislation, as police have used it to prosecute owner Jimmy Lai and Apple Daily executives, it said.The closure of the Apple Daily on June 25, shortly after the government froze its assets, has "sounded a death knell for press freedom in Hong Kong," Taipei Times reported.Many news firms have chosen to stay silent, leading to the closure or removal of content from online publications such as Stand News, Winandmac Media, and Post 852, it added.Meanwhile, increasing numbers of academics critical of Beijing have been dismissed or forced out since last year. Some have even seen their teaching qualifications revoked for disseminating content in support of independence, it added.Changes to the education curriculum in February also outlawed political activities on campuses and banned teachers from discussing their political views, while mandating education about the security law to more than 8,000 students, it said.Fear over-reporting by students is likely to deepen self-censorship on campuses, the council said, adding that some academics are also considering cutting back on international exchanges.Censorship has even extended to the Internet and the arts, drawing an ambiguous red line that would stifle creative freedom, it added.The website HKChronicles, which publishes personal information of police officers and pro-Beijing figures, was reportedly shuttered by Hong Kong security forces with cooperation from Internet service providers, the council said.Pro-China media have also criticized the Hong Kong Arts Development Council for funding "reactionary" works of art and the M museum for exhibiting works by Ai Weiwei, it added.Changes announced last month to the Film Censorship Ordinance would ban films that "endanger national security," it said.Public gatherings have also been halted, including the annual Tiananmen Square Massacre candlelight vigil that had been held every year for three decades, it said.Even freedom of movement could be affected, as the passage in April of changes to immigration regulations would grant authorities the power to bar individuals from entering or leaving the territory when it goes into effect on August 1, the council added.The law criminalizes any act of secession (breaking away from China), subversion (undermining the power or authority of the central government), terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces, with punishments of up to life in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-unnerved-by-chinese-security-law-citizens-doubt-their-futures-101625894860141.html
10-07-2021||World||Covid-19: Indonesia faces oxygen crisis, reaches out to countries for help||Indonesia, the world’s fourth most-populated country, is currently grappling with a severe shortage of oxygen supplies to treat critical patients infected with coronavirus disease (Covid-19). This is a drastic turn of situation as only two months ago, in May, Indonesia was providing oxygen supplies to India, when the latter was severely hit by the second wave of the pandemic. Indonesia had supplied around 3,400 oxygen cylinders and concentrators to India.The Indonesian government has reached out to several countries including China, Singapore, Australia to address its oxygen shortage. Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, the minister in charge of the country’s Covid-19 pandemic response, told the Associated Press on Friday that the government has received a shipment of over 1,000 oxygen cylinders, concentrators, ventilators and other health devices arrived from Singapore along with 1,000 ventilators provided by Australia.Pandjaitan said on Friday the government is also planning to purchase 36,000 tonnes of oxygen and 10,000 concentrators from Singapore, adding he is in contact with China and other countries.Indonesia has so far recorded 2,455,912 cases and 64,631 deaths due to the viral disease. However, reports suggest that cases and deaths are being underreported and the actual count is much higher than the official figures. On Friday, the country reported 38,124 cases and 871 more deaths in the last 24 hours. This is the first time in six days that the country did not see a record rise in its daily tally.However, the country is currently facing a more severe wave of the pandemic due to which hospitals are overwhelmed with a growing number of critically infected Covid-19 patients. Many of these patients are dying in isolation at home or while waiting to receive emergency care, AP further reported.In Java, hospitals had started setting up makeshift Intensive Care Units (ICUs) during mid-June. Earlier this week, emergency rooms at a public hospital in Bandung city were closed after running out of oxygen supplies, Yaya Mulyana, the city’s deputy mayor, told AP.As per government data, Indonesia’s daily oxygen requirement has climbed to 1,928 tons and the total available production capacity is 2,262 tons per day.“I asked for 100% of oxygen to go to medical purposes first, meaning that all industrial allocations must be transferred to medical,” minister Pandjaitan said on Friday, adding it is a race against time and “we have to work fast”. In response, the country’s industrial ministry issued an official order stating all oxygen supplies be sent to hospitals swamped with Covid-19 patients and urged people in the industrial sector to cooperate. ‘On the vaccination front, a total of 1.47 million health workers in the country will be administered with a third booster jab using the Moderna vaccine, the government said on Friday. This decision comes after several health workers, who had been fully inoculated with China’s Sinovac jab, died due to the viral disease.(With inputs from AP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-indonesia-faces-oxygen-crisis-reaches-out-to-countries-for-help-101625894157340.html

The strong quake hit 258 kilometers (160 miles) northeast of the city of Manado in North Sulawesi at a depth of 68 kilometers.Indonesia experiences frequent quakes due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an arc of intense seismic activity where tectonic plates collide that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.A 6.1-magnitude earthquake strikes off Indonesia's Sulawesi island, the USGS says, but no tsunami warning is issued and there are no immediate reports of damageThe quake hit 258kms northeast of Manado in North Sulawesi at a depth of 68kms pic.twitter.com/l0nsaxExcXIn January, more than 100 people were killed and thousands left homeless by a 6.2-magnitude quake that struck Sulawesi, reducing buildings to a tangled mass of twisted metal and chunks of concrete in the seaside city of Mamuju.A powerful quake shook the island of Lombok in 2018 and several more tremors followed over the next couple of weeks, killing more than 550 people on the holiday island and neighbouring Sumbawa.Later that year, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/magnitude-6-1-earthquake-hits-indonesia-no-tsunami-warning-issued-101625881421329.html
10-07-2021||World||Haiti tells US, UN to send troops as fears of instability grow||Haiti has asked Washington and the UN to send troops to help it secure its ports, airport and other strategic sites after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise, a government minister said Friday.The United States has already said it will send FBI and other agents to Port-au-Prince, two days after Moise was brutally killed by gunmen in his home, opening up a power vacuum in the impoverished and crisis-hit Caribbean nation.In the wake of the slaying "we thought that the mercenaries could destroy some infrastructure to create chaos in the country. During a conversation with the US Secretary of State and the UN we made this request," elections minister Mathias Pierre told AFP.The US State Department and Pentagon both confirmed receiving a request for "security and investigative assistance" and said officials remain in contact with Port-au-Prince, but did not specify whether military troops would be deployed.The UN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Washington had signaled its willingness to help the Haitian investigation, and White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki added Friday that senior FBI and other officials would be heading to the Caribbean as soon as possible.Pierre confirmed that the request had been made as questions swirled Friday about who could have masterminded the audacious assassination, with most members of a hit squad of Colombians and Americans either dead or in custody, and no clear motive made public.Amid the uncertainty, two men are now vying to lead the country of 11 million people, more than half of whom are under age 20. There is no working parliament.After days of paralysis in the capital, Port-au-Prince saw the timid return of people to the streets, shops opening and the resumption of public transport on Friday morning -- but under a pall of apprehension.People scrambled to stock up on basic necessities at supermarkets and lined up at gas stations to buy propane used for cooking in anticipation of more instability."I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow or the day after in the country, so I am preparing for bad days ahead," Port-au-Prince resident Marjory told AFP, as she and her husband stocked up on supplies at a store."I'm prioritizing everything that can last for many days."Gang violence, rife in the Caribbean nation, also picked up again on Friday, with clashes between groups paralyzing traffic on a major highway.The city's airport, shuttered in the wake of the attack, appeared to have reopened, according to Flightradar data.Contract killers?But as the shock of the killing wore off, many were demanding answers."Foreigners came to the country to perpetrate this crime. We, Haitians, are appalled," a resident of the capital told AFP."We need to know who is behind this, their names, their backgrounds so that justice can be served," he added.Police have said a 28-member hit squad of Colombians and Americans had carried out the attack, but that they were still seeking its masterminds.Senior police officers, directly responsible for Moise's security, are in the hot seat and have been summoned to appear before the courts.Others have speculated on the possible involvement of security agents in the killing, adding to the confusion."The president of the Republic, Jovenel Moise, was assassinated by his security agents," former Haitian senator Steven Benoit said on Magik9 radio Friday."It is not Colombians who killed him. They were contracted by the Haitian state."Political chaosSome alleged attackers, including both Americans, have been arrested. Three have been killed, and at least five are still on the run, officers said Friday.Some of the suspects were arrested after breaking into the Taiwanese embassy, Taipei confirmed. Several were paraded before the media on Thursday.The US has said it is aware of the arrest of US citizens but declined further comment.Colombia on Friday said 17 Colombian ex-soldiers were thought to have been involved. President Ivan Duque has told Haitian officials Bogota will collaborate in the investigation.The attack has further destabilized the poorest country in the Americas, plagued by insecurity.Haiti was already in the midst of in an institutional crisis: Moise had not organized an election since he came to power in early 2017 and the country has had no parliament since January 2020. Moise had been ruling by decree.One of Moise's last acts as president on Monday was to appoint a new prime minister, Ariel Henry. He had not taken office when Moise was killed.Hours after the assassination, Henry's predecessor Claude Joseph said he was in charge.While the opposition has accused Joseph of power-grabbing, the United Nations envoy to Haiti, Helen La Lime, has said he had authority because Henry had not been sworn in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-tells-us-un-to-send-troops-as-fears-of-instability-grow-101625880516830.html

Gavin Newsom at a Napa Valley elementary school to sign a bill that provides record funding for California schools.Newsom invited a group of young students to help him sign the legislation, which directs how most of the $123.9 billion for K-12 education in the 2021-2022 fiscal year must be spent.As part of a broad new education spending package made possible by the state’s surprise budget surplus, the state’s two-year kindergarten program will be expanded to include all 4-year-olds for free. The program aims to phase in the expansion by 2025 at a cost of $2.7 billion per year.The new plan also puts more money toward after school and summer school programs, particularly in districts that serve many high-needs students.“This is a transformational budget. This is unlike anything we have ever done in this state,” Newsom said.This year’s budget also adds money to fund free school meals for all students, with $54 million allocated for this year and $650 million in future years.Newsom’s kindergarten expansion fulfills a promise that he and Democratic legislative leaders made to foot the bill for universal 4-year-old kindergarten statewide.Currently, there are about 91,000 4-year-olds enrolled in transitional kindergarten. The new plan would boost enrollment to about 250,000.The bill achieves many longtime priorities for Democrats in the Legislature, said Democratic Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, who joined the signing ceremony.“We are changing lives,” said Aguiar-Curry, of Winters. “By the signing of this today, we’re not going to leave anyone behind.”Newsom has said the funding aims to address many of the inequities that the coronavirus pandemic exposed, including the need for robust mental health services to address childhood depression and trauma, more teachers and lower teacher-student ratios.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-california-to-require-face-masks-at-schools-this-fall-101625876037779.html
10-07-2021||World||Pfizer backs booster shots, US experts say no need yet||Pfizer Inc plans to request US emergency authorisation in August for a third booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine, based on early data showing that it can sharply increase immune protection against the coronavirus disease.At the same time, however, US federal health officials signalled that they would take a cautious approach to potential booster shots, and underlined that the currently available vaccines are effective at keeping people from being sickened by the coronavirus.Pfizer has received initial data from an early human study showing that a third dose of its existing coronavirus vaccine is safe and can raise neutralising antibody levels by 5 to 10 fold compared with the original vaccine, the company’s research head Mikael Dolsten said in an interview.Once more data is in hand, Pfizer plans to ask the FDA to authorise a booster shot that could be given six to eight months after the original two doses, Dolsten said. The drugmaker is also talking with regulators in other countries and the European Union about the new results, he said. Pfizer produces the vaccine in partnership with BioNTech SE.However, in an unusual evening joint statement on Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration pumped the brakes, saying they are engaged in a process about whether and when a booster might be needed. That “can include data from specific pharmaceutical companies, but does not rely on those data exclusively,” it said.The statement stressed that available vaccines are effective and that nearly all people hospitalised and dying from the virus currently are unvaccinated -- a message that signals a fear that Pfizer’s announcement could fuel brewing doubts about vaccines broadly.“Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,” the agencies said in the statement, adding: “We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed.”Dolsten said the company is going public with its plans because the early data looks convincing and because of increasing concern about mutations of the virus, including the ultra-transmissible Delta variant that is spreading in numerous countries.“There is a lot of fear and concern” about variants... “we are confident that such a boost will be highly effective against the delta variant,” Dolsten said.While the antibody results are based on a small initial cohort of roughly 10 to 20 people who received the booster, Dolsten said that the “the data set is so clear we have complete confidence that the full study will reproduce this.”Israeli dataMessenger RNA vaccines provide powerful protection against severe Covid-19, including cases caused by the Delta variant, but there have been signs of breakthrough cases. A British study in May, for example, found the Pfizer shot was 88% effective in preventing symptomatic disease from the Delta variant after the second dose.More recent data released by Israel this month found that Pfizer’s efficacy had dropped to 64% since the Delta variant took over there, even as it was 93% effective at keeping people out of the hospital.Dolsten said Pfizer interprets the Israeli finding as a sign that blood-antibody levels have faded somewhat since people in Israel started being vaccinated in January and February. In the presence of a highly transmissible variant, that may allow mild cases to slip through even though people remain protected against severe disease, he said.Even when front-line antibodies have faded slightly, the vaccine still produces a variety of memory responses that can stave off serious illness, Dolsten said.“When you have low blood levels of an antibody, viruses that are highly contagious may reinfect and cause mild disease,” Dolsten said.Delta trialSeparately, Pfizer plans to begin human trials of a new booster customised against the Delta variant, first detected in India. But Dolsten said it was unlikely that this customised vaccine would be needed, as the existing vaccine does a good job of producing antibodies against the variant. Even preventing mild cases can be useful because it will help slow infections that can lead to new variants, and will prevent cases of long Covid that can occur even after mild infections, Dolsten said.In the past, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has suggested that Covid booster shots might be needed but medical experts have cautioned that it isn’t clear whether and when boosters will be needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizerbacks-booster-shots-us-experts-say-no-need-yet-101625871353642.html

Police initially gave a toll of three dead, but then discovered piles of bodies after the fire was extinguished.So far 52 bodies have been recovered, but the top two floors of the factory have yet to be searched, said Debasish Bardhan, deputy director of the Fire Service and Civil Defense.He said the main exit of the factory was locked from the inside and many of those who died were trapped.Many workers jumped from the upper floors of the factory, and at least 26 suffered injuries. Information about how many people were in the factory and how many were missing was not immediately available.“For now, we only have these details. After searching the top floors we will be able to get a complete picture,” Bardhan said.

On April 2, a policeman was killed and another wounded when a man crashed his car into a barrier at the complex.US Capitol Police shot the driver dead as he jumped out of the car and lunged with a knife.mlm/mdl||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/six-months-after-riot-removal-of-us-capitol-fencing-begins-101625869435928.html

Many lawmakers have voiced support for evacuating interpreters and others who worked with US forces to third countries to protect them while their applications for visas to reach the United States are reviewed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-20-us-senators-back-legislation-to-help-afghan-interpreters-101625865528534.html
10-07-2021||World||World must invest more for 'prevention and preparedness' against another pandemic: G20 panel||The world must invest much more to avoid a repeat of the coronavirus pandemic, experts convened by the G20 said Friday as they warned the next health crisis could come within a decade."The world is far from equipped to prevent or stop the next pandemic," the High Level Independent Panel said in a report presented at the G20 finance ministers meeting in Venice, Italy.It said even as Covid-19 rages, "there is every likelihood that the next pandemic will come within a decade -- arising from a novel influenza strain, another coronavirus, or one of several other dangerous pathogens"."Its impact on human health and the global economy could be even more profound than that of COVID-19," it said.The report recommended governments collectively commit to increase financing for prevention and preparedness by at least $75 billion over the next five year.This would fund a coordinated surveillance and research network for infectious diseases, more resilient healthcare systems, better governance to manage crises and an improved global capacity to produce vaccines."We must learn the right lessons from this pandemic in order to be well prepared for the next one," said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director general of the World Trade Organization.She noted however that Covid-19 "is still here", urging the G20 ministers to do more to donate vaccines and support manufacturing and distribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-must-invest-more-for-prevention-and-preparedness-against-another-pandemic-g20-panel-101625863212967.html
10-07-2021||World||Joe Biden names close political ally Eric Garcetti to be US ambassador to India||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has named Eric Garcetti, a close political ally, as his nominee for ambassador to India. Garcetti, 50, is currently serving as mayor of Los Angeles.The White House announced his nomination on Friday along with three other ambassadors.Garcetti was co-chair of Biden’s presidential campaign and was also part of the committee that Biden had appointed to look for his running mate. After the election, Garcetti was named one of the co-chairs of the inauguration committee. He was widely expected to get a cabinet berth and reports have suggested he was being considered for secretary housing.Like all host countries, India would like a US ambassador to be someone with an open line of communications with the White House, which Eric Garcetti is likely to have, according to people familiar with these matters. It’s just more efficient and less time-consuming to not have to go through the usual state department bureaucracy, said the same people.Also Read: Imran Khan’s quest for Joe Biden’s attentionBiden’s ambassadorial nominee for India will be one of the more high-profile announcements for the administration given the focus the US president has brought on ties with India, bilaterally and as part of the Quad with Japan and Australia.President Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have spoken four times already in 100 days since the American leader took office. And they have met virtually as part of the Quad and the summit of 40 world leaders that Biden hosted in April.Eric Garcetti has been the Mayor of the City of Los Angeles since 2013, following 12 years as a member of the City Council, including six as Council President. The White House announcement said as mayor, Garcetti oversees the busiest container port in the Western Hemisphere, the largest municipal utility in the country, and one of the busiest airports in the world.Eric Garcetti co-founded Climate Mayors and led more than 400 US mayors to adopt the Paris Climate agreement. He is the current chair of C40 Cities – a network of 97 of the world’s biggest cities taking bold climate action and has led the organisation’s engagement and expansion in India as well as C40’s global response to the Covid pandemic through the sharing of best practices and resources, said the White House. Garcetti’s familiarity with the region owes also to his 12 years as Intelligence Officer in the US Navy Reserve Component. Garcetti served under the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and the Defense Intelligence Agency, retiring in 2017 as a Lieutenant. He is a Rhodes Scholar and studied at Queen’s College, Oxford and the London School of Economics and Political Science. His website as LA mayor says he is also a jazz pianist and photographer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-names-close-political-ally-eric-garcetti-to-be-us-ambassador-to-india-101625862931988.html
10-07-2021||World||Joe Biden nominates mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti to be US ambassador to India||President Joe Biden has nominated Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to serve as ambassador to India, the White House said Friday, selecting a high-profile ally to serve in one of the most difficult diplomatic posts.Garcetti, if confirmed, would be dispatched to India as it has been overwhelmed by a surge in coronavirus infections and deaths.The White House also announced Friday that Biden is nominating Democratic fundraiser Denise Bauer to serve as ambassador to Monaco, career foreign service officer Peter Haas to serve as ambassador to Bangladesh and former Obama-era national security aide Bernadette Meehan to serve as ambassador to Chile.Garcetti, who considered a 2020 White House bid and later became part of Biden’s inner circle, emerged as a widely discussed possibility to join Biden’s Cabinet last year. But he took himself out of the running, saying the raging coronavirus crisis made it impossible for him to step away.The two-term mayor would leave LA with an uneven record. He has been credited with continuing a transit buildup in a city choked with traffic, establishing tougher earthquake safety standards for thousands of buildings and steering the city though the deadly pandemic as it became a hot spot for infections. Cases have fallen steeply in the city and some restrictions have been rolled back, consistent with the trajectory in the state.But Garcetti was overmatched by a crisis of homelessness that became a national embarrassment despite the massive jump in government spending to fight it. Many streets and sidewalks remain cratered and crumbling, despite his early pledge to make fixing them a cornerstone of his administration.A lawsuit alleges that a former top staffer sexually harassed one of the mayor’s police bodyguards while Garcetti ignored it or laughed it off. The mayor denies the claims. One of his former deputy mayors was also indicted on corruption charges in an ongoing federal investigation at City Hall. And as is the case in many large cities, the crime rate in LA is spiking.In picking Garcetti, Biden is rewarding a loyalist who was one of his national campaign co-chairs, who served on the committee that vetted his pool of vice presidential contenders and who served as one of several co-chairs for Biden’s inaugural committee.Bauer, who served as ambassador to Belgium, is a prominent Democratic fundraiser. She served as executive director of Women for Biden during his last run for the White House. She served in a similar role in President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign.Haas, whose career at the State Department includes stints across five geographical bureaus and as consul general in Mumbai, currently serves as acting assistant secretary of state and as principal deputy assistant secretary for economic and business affairs.Meehan, who is the executive vice president of global programs for the Obama Foundation, spent over a decade as a foreign service officer and was a National Security Council spokesperson during the Obama administration.Biden has stepped up ambassadorial nominations in recent weeks.Among his other picks are former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar as ambassador to Mexico, former Deputy Secretary of State Tom Nides as ambassador to Israel, and retired airline pilot Chesley ”Sully” Sullenberger, most famous for negotiating the emergency landing of a US Airways plane on the Hudson River in 2009 with no fatalities, to serve as U.S. representative on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization.Biden is also expected to nominate former longtime State Department official Nicholas Burns to serve as his ambassador to China and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to serve as ambassador to Japan, according to a person familiar with the decisions who was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-nominates-mayor-of-los-angeles-eric-garcetti-to-be-us-ambassador-to-india-101625860668915.html
10-07-2021||World||Joe Biden calls Vladimir Putin, asks him to act on ransomware attacks||US President Joe Biden said on Friday that he pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin to act against groups conducting ransomware attacks from his territory.In comments made during a signing ceremony in Washington, Biden said he told Putin, "When a ransomware operation is coming from his soil even though it's not sponsored by the state, we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act on who that is."Ransomware - a breed of malicious software which hackers use to hold data hostage in exchange for payment - has become an increasingly powerful scourge for businesses across the world. Cybercriminals have used it to paralyze thousands of American organizations, setting off a series of increasingly high-profile crises.Many of the gangs carrying out the ransomware attacks are alleged by American officials and cybersecurity researchers to be operating out of Russia with the awareness, if not the approval, of the government there.Biden had warned Putin about cyberattacks in person during a summit in Geneva last month, telling his Russian counterpart that disruptive intrusions against critical infrastructure should be off limits.In his remarks Friday, Biden said that he and his Russian counterpart had "set up a means of communication now on a regular basis to be able to communicate with one another when each of us thinks something is happening in another country that affects the home country."Biden said he was optimistic following the call."It went well," he said.Internet crime has bedeviled US-Russian relations since the 1990s, when American cyber experts first began complaining of spam emails from Russia. But the sheer disruptive power of ransomware has taken the issue to a new level.In May cybercriminals alleged to be operating from Russia froze the operations of critical fuel transport group Colonial Pipeline, setting off gasoline shortages, price spikes and panic buying on the East Coast.The following month a different Russia-linked group struck meatpacker JBS, briefly disrupting its food supply chain. Last week the same hackers claimed responsibility for a mass ransomware outbreak centered on Florida IT firm Kaseya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-vladimir-putin-asks-him-to-act-on-ransomware-attacks-101625858576764.html
