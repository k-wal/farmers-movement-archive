Murthy also urged individuals, health professionals, journalists and technology platforms to help in slowing the spread of misinformation.In his 22-page advisory titled 'Confronting Health Misinformation,' his first as surgeon general under US President Joe Biden, Murthy also detailed the efforts that could be taken to curb the spread of health misinformation , which he termed as “serious threat to public health.” He also served as the surgeon general under former President Barack Obama.Health misinformation is information that is false, inaccurate, or misleading according to the best available science at the time. During this pandemic, it's divided our friends, families, and communities. It’s led to threats against our health workers. And it’s cost us lives.“Because it pollutes our information environment, misinformation is harmful to individual and public health. Together , we have the power to build a healthier information environment,” Murthy said, listing the efforts so far by health professionals, researchers and the media in addressing misinformation. However, he said that there is more to be done.“How do we curb the spread of harmful misinformation while safeguarding user privacy and free expression?” he asked. A whole-of-society effort would be required to address health misinformation, he further said.Also read | US coronavirus cases rise again due to DeltaMurthy’s advisory came as the rate of progress of Covid-19 vaccination has slowed across the US, partially due to vaccine hesitancy because of unsubstantiated claims about the safety of the shots, the Associated Press reported on Thursday. The report also noted that the death toll in the US due to Covid-19 recently crossed the 600,000-mark.Noting that misinformation spreads at “unprecedented speed and scale” in today’s world, Murthy called upon technology platforms to “assess the benefits and harms of products and platforms and take responsibility for addressing the harms” of misinformation. He also said that such platforms should redesign their recommendation algorithms, which suggests content to users , and also make it easier for consumers to report misinformation.“Impose clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate platform policies,” he further said. He directed the platforms to amplify the communications from subject matter experts and direct the users to such credible sources of true information. He also highlighted the need to protect health professionals, journalists from online harassment.“Misinformation hasn’t just harmed our physical health—it has also divided our families, friends, and communities,” he said in the report, noting that efforts against the spread of it is a moral and civic imperative for all of society.(With inputs from the Associated Press)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-surgeon-general-vivek-murthy-calls-for-efforts-against-health-misinformation-during-covid-19-pandemic-101626371159561.html

Blue Origin had auctioned a spaceship berth for a whopping $28 million but the winner, presumably an ultra-wealthy space aficionado, has chosen to fly on a future New Shepard flight “due to scheduling conflicts.”With a vacant berth on New Shepard’s first human flight, Blue Origin has picked OlivDaemen, who is about to become the youngest person in space, to fly along with Jeff Bezos, Mark Bezos, and Wally Funk, an aviation pioneer who will become the oldest person ever to do so at age 82. Daeman’s presence on the flight will also mark the beginning of commercial operations for the program. The company didn’t disclose the amount paid by the teenager for the spaceflight.“We thank the auction winner for their generous support of Club for the Future and are honored to welcome Oliver to fly with us on New Shepard,” said Bob Smith, CEO of Blue Origin. “This marks the beginning of commercial operations for New Shepard, and Oliver represents a new generation of people who will help us build a road to space.”According to Blue Origin, Daeman graduated from high school in 2020 and took a year off to obtain his private pilot’s license. He will attend the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands to study physics and innovation management, the company said.Currently, Soviet cosmonaut Ghermon Titov, the second human to orbit the Earth after Yuri Gagarin, holds the record for the youngest to fly in space. Titov was 25 when he blasted off Vostok 2 to orbit the Earth way back in 1961.New Shepard’s first human spaceflight will take off on July 20 from its Launch Site One in a remote location in the West Texas desert. While there are no on-site public viewing areas in the vicinity of the launch site, it will be broadcast live on BlueOrigin.com beginning at 11:30am UTC (5:00 pm IST).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/18yearold-to-join-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-on-blue-origin-s-1st-human-spaceflight-101626370369328.html
15-07-2021||World||Indian foreign secretary says free, fair polls need of the hour in Libya||India on Thursday called upon the international community once again to “speak in one voice” against terrorism as it sought to draw the attention of the UN Security Council (UNSC) towards continuing presence of Islamic State and al-Qaeda in Libya and their increasing influence in the region.During a UNSC briefing on UN support mission on Libya, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla raised concern over the failure of political parties in Libya to agree to a constitutional and legal basis for elections scheduled in December, which, he insisted, needs to be held as planned and in free and fair manner.“The next six months will be critical for Libya, as it embarks on a journey towards peace and stability,” the foreign secretary said, adding, “It is incumbent upon the international community and the Security Council, in particular, to continue to provide support to Libya in this critical phase.”The Libyan Political Dialogue Forum, a 75-member body comprising people from sectors, concluded five days of UN-brokered deliberations earlier this month without agreeing to the legal basis for the presidential and parliamentary elections that are considered critical to returning the warn-torn country back to peace and stability.Shringla stressed the need for all parties to “continue consultations” and for preparation to remain on course for the election, among key steps needed to be taken over the next six months. He also called for ending foreign interference in Libya and to ensure the “peace process must be fully Libyan-led and Libyan-owned with no imposition or external interference”. And, he added, provisions of the ceasefire agreement must be implemented, such as the “withdrawal of foreign forces and mercenaries”.As one of the worst victims of terrorism, India has relentlessly called on the international community to pay special attention to the scourge of violence by non-state actors. And, Shringla took the opportunity to press the Security Council on the need to prevent terrorist groups from operating unchallenged in Libya.The continued presence and activities of Islamic State in Libya, as attested to by a UN report, Shringla said, “is of serious concern”.The report indicates spread of such activities into the adjoining Sahel region - western and north-central Africa.“Libya has become a logistics platform for al-Qaeda affiliates in Mali,” the foreign secretary said, adding, “This is a matter of grave concern due the potential cascading effect it could have throughout the Sahel region. It is unfortunate that the issue is not drawing the attention it deserves. The international community must speak in one voice against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.”Efforts must be made to also for the “disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of armed groups and non-state armed actors and, finally India would recommend an “inclusive and comprehensive national reconciliation process is the need of the hour”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-foreign-secretary-says-free-fair-polls-need-of-the-hour-in-libya-101626370329241.html
15-07-2021||World||Pakistan to host peace conference on Afghanistan from July 17 to 19||Pakistan said on Thursday that it will host a peace conference on Afghanistan over the weekend to support efforts for bringing stability in the war-torn neighbouring country."I can confirm that Pakistan is hosting the Afghan Peace Conference on 17-19 July," Foreign Office spokesman Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry said.He said that the conference, which would be attended by a number of Afghan leaders, will provide momentum to the ongoing efforts for peace in Afghanistan.Earlier, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said that Prime Minister Imran Khan had a telephonic conversation with Afghanistan's former president Hamid Karzai and invited him to attend the conference."The most important Afghan leadership, including Hamid Karzai, has been invited to attend the proposed conference. It is hoped that new hopes for a solution to Afghanistan's problems will be awakened as a result of this important development,” he said.The News International newspaper had reported that several Afghan leaders have promised to attend the conference.Pakistan has been accused of trying to help the Taliban fighting for supremacy in Afghanistan and the upcoming conference seems to be an effort to assuage that impression.Taliban militants have seized dozens of districts in recent weeks and are now thought to control about a third of the country, ahead of the withdrawal of US and Western troops from Afghanistan by September 11.Under a deal with the Taliban, the US and its NATO allies agreed to withdraw all troops in return for a commitment by the militants that they would prevent extremist groups from operating in areas they control.Meanwhile, the FO spokesman said that Pakistan was concerned over the evolving situation in Afghanistan."As the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is nearing completion, we remain concerned at the evolving security situation in Afghanistan. We once again reiterate the imperative of a political settlement in Afghanistan,” he said.The spokesperson said Pakistan has played an important role in the Afghan Peace Process and it remains committed to facilitate the process in future as well. However, ultimately, it is the Afghans themselves who have to decide about their future.He called on all Afghan stakeholders to work out an inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive political settlement for durable peace and stability in Afghanistan.He also said that economic integration and regional connectivity cannot be achieved without peace and stability in Afghanistan.Pakistan has a direct stake for peace in Afghanistan because the security situation in Afghanistan has a direct bearing on the security situation in the country and any security vacuum in Afghanistan can be exploited by spoilers, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-host-peace-conference-on-afghanistan-from-july-17-to-19-101626368285479.html

Vanuatu, an archipelago made up of roughly 80 islands in the South Pacific ocean, offers a so-called golden passport through a scheme that allows people to purchase citizenship for $130,000.The Citizenship by Investment programme also enables the golden passport holders to gain visa-free access to 148 countries and territories, including the UK and the EU member states. Agencies have been marketing the citizenship scheme as “one of the fastest and simplest second passport options” available in the world, with processing time as low as 30 days.The citizenship of Vanuatu can be obtained without ever setting foot in the country. Vanuatu also serves as a tax haven since the archipelago has no income tax, wealth tax, capital gains or inheritance tax. While the government has pitched the programme for applicants who must have a clear criminal record, The Guardian reported that the beneficiaries include “a slew of disgraced businesspeople and individuals sought by police in countries all over the world.”According to the report, more than half of the passports issued under the scheme in 2020 were to Chinese nationals. The other recipients of the golden passport with the most common nationality were Nigerians, Russians, Lebanese, Iranians, Syrians, and Afghans, the report said. The controversial scheme has raised concern about the Pacific becoming a hub for trafficking drugs and money laundering.Floyd Mera, the director of Vanuatu’s Financial Intelligence Unit, reportedly told The Guardian that most people flagged in the report have “allegations, pending investigations and ongoing court proceedings.” “If there are substantial convictions against any of these names, their citizenship may be revoked,” Mera was quoted by the English daily as saying.The sale of passports has been a huge source of government revenue for Vanuatu, one of the poorest nations, and analysis by Investment Migration Insider suggests that the Pacific nation recorded a revenue of $132.6 million through the programme last year. Despite a raging pandemic, the revenue collected through citizenship by investment exceeded those raised in 2019, as per IMI analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fugitives-politicians-purchasing-vanuatu-s-golden-passport-report-101626365774570.html
15-07-2021||World||Pakistan admits bus blast that killed 9 Chinese could be terror attack||A day after claiming that a gas leak within a bus resulted in the death of nine Chinese nationals, Pakistan’s information minister Fawad Chaudhry said on Thursday that traces of explosives had been found in the vehicle and terrorism couldn’t be ruled out in the incident. Beijing pushed back strongly in the face of Islamabad’s claim on Wednesday, describing the incident as a “bomb attack” and demanding punishment for the perpetrators and steps to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Pakistan.Thirteen people, including nine Chinese nationals, were killed when a bus taking workers to the 4,300-MW Dasu hydropower project was hit by a blast in Upper Kohistan area of Pakistan’s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. “Initial investigations into Dassu incident have now confirmed traces of explosives. Terrorism cannot be ruled out, PM is personally supervising all developments in this regard. Govt is in close coordination with Chinese embassy we are committed to fight menace of terrorism together,” Chaudhry tweeted on Thursday.In the face of pressure from China on Wednesday to investigate the incident, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had said in a statement that the bus carrying Chinese workers had “plunged into a ravine after a mechanical failure resulting in leakage of gas that caused a blast”. Experts cited images of the bus shared on social media and said the damage appeared to have been caused by an explosion, instead of a fall into a ravine. They also questioned the contention that the bus was powered by gas.A statement on the incident issued by the Chinese embassy in Islamabad referred to an “attack on the Dasu Hydropower Project” and said a “Chinese company’s shuttle bus...was hit by a blast on its way to the construction site” in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The statement said the Chinese embassy had contacted the Pakistani military and foreign and interior ministries and sought steps to “strengthen security protection for the Chinese citizens, institutions and projects in Pakistan” and a thorough investigation of the incident. “The Chinese embassy in Pakistan reminds Chinese citizens, enterprises and projects in Pakistan to stay on alert, pay close attention to the local security situation, take strict precautions, and stop going out unless necessary,” the statement said.Asked about the issue during a regular foreign ministry news briefing in Beijing, spokesperson Zhao Lijian was equally blunt. He said China was “astonished to learn that the incident has caused heavy Chinese casualties”. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government attach high importance to the incident, and no effort should be spared to “promptly find out what happened, conduct in-depth assessment of security risks, and do our utmost to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel,” Zhao said. “We have asked the Pakistani side to lose no time in conducting a thorough investigation, properly transfer and treat the wounded, strengthen security measures, eliminate security risks, and ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Pakistan,” he said. China will send a “cross-departmental joint working group” to Pakistan to help investigate the incident, Zhao said.Hours before Chaudhry’s tweet, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had maintained that the incident was an accident during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of a conference in Uzbekistan. “Preliminary investigation shows that it’s an accident and no background of terrorist attacks has been found,” Qureshi was quoted as saying in a readout from the Chinese foreign ministry on his meeting with Wang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-admits-bus-blast-that-killed-9-chinese-could-be-terror-attack-101626364869958.html

And in male PLHIV over 65 years of age, common underlying conditions such as diabetes and hypertension caused an increased risk of severe and fatal Covid-19 infection and subsequently putting people at increased risk of severe disease and death, the WHO report showed.Also read | Africa on 'destructive pathway' due to Delta variant, says WHO amid record surgeResearchers have analysed the data of 15,500 PLHIV and received hospital treatment for Covid-19. The average age of the participants was 45.5 and over 66% were found with severe or critical Covid-19 infection, news agency AFP reported. Also, 92% had received antiretroviral therapy for AIDS prior to their hospitalisation.“This highlights the need for PLHIV to stay as healthy as possible, regularly access and take their ARV medications and prevent and manage underlying conditions. This also means that people living with HIV – independent of their immune status - should be prioritised for vaccination in most settings,” the WHO statement further said. WHO also cited an informal poll, according to which, 40 countries have prioritised PLHIV for Covid-19 vaccination out of 100 countries with information.Meanwhile, UNAIDS, the United Nations body for action on AIDS, said that the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the efforts against HIV, such as testing, in many countries. “Rich countries in Europe are preparing to enjoy the summer as their populations have easy access to COVID-19 vaccines, while the global South is in crisis,” UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima said in a statement.“We have failed to learn the lessons of HIV, when millions were denied life-saving medicines and died because of inequalities in access. This is totally unacceptable,” Byanyima added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hiv-significant-independent-risk-factor-for-severe-critical-covid-19-says-who-in-new-report-101626363299179.html

After the eighth emergency committee meeting on Wednesday regarding the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the WHO experts released a statement saying the pandemic remains a challenge globally.“The Committee recognised the strong likelihood for the emergence and global spread of new and possibly more dangerous variants of concern that may be even more challenging to control,” the experts said.Amid the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, the committee noted that Covid-19 continues to evolve with four variants of concern and unanimously agreed that the pandemic still “constitutes an extraordinary event” that poses a health risk to people around the world. The committee also emphasised the risk of the emergence of new zoonotic diseases while the world is still responding to the ongoing pandemic.“As such, the Committee concurred that the Covid-19 pandemic remains a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and offered the following advice to the Director-General,” it concluded.Due to different paces of vaccination around the world, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, the committee has called on all countries to vaccinate at least 10% of the population of every country by the end of September. The WHO chief urged the world to take a new approach in global health security, warning that if the world continues on the same path, it will “continue heading for the same destination”."One key area in which improved cooperation is needed is in the way information about emerging pathogens and outbreaks is collected, analysed and disseminated," Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strong-likelihood-of-more-dangerous-covid-variants-warn-who-experts-101626359931139.html

The drills include amphibious landings, ground force manoeuvres, urban operations, air combat and maritime operations.A VOA report said that it is the largest bilateral training exercise between Australia and the US. "In addition to the United States, this year will involve participating forces from Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand and the UK," Australian Air Commodore Stuart Bellingham."Due to Covid-19, you will notice fewer international participants this year compared to the past," he added.During the next two weeks, the Chinese electronic vessel is expected to observe the Talisman Sabre war games. Back in 2019, a similar ship was also tracked during military maneuvers in Australia. According to experts, such surveillance has become commonplace."This is the kind of thing we should expect to see happen and expect to see increasingly happen as the Asia-Pacific, the Indo-Pacific becomes increasingly a theatre of strategic rivalry as it is," Military analyst and former Australian Defense Department Secretary Hugh White told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.The Chinese ship is expected to remain outside Australian territorial waters to monitor the multinational war games. According to Australian officials, they do not expect its presence to impede the war drills in Queensland.This comes as diplomatic ties between Australia and China, have deteriorated over the years over various commercial and geopolitical disputes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/monitoring-chinese-ship-sailing-towards-queensland-to-spy-australia-101626353681810.html

They threw stones, which forced us to use tear gas," said a security official on the Pakistan side.He said around 1,500 people had gathered at the border Wednesday waiting to cross.Jumadad Khan, a senior government official in Chaman, said the situation was now "under control".An Afghan Taliban source told AFP that hundreds of people had also gathered on the Afghan side, hoping to travel in the other direction."We are talking to Pakistani authorities. A formal meeting to open the border is scheduled for today, and hopefully, it will open in a day or two," he said.Later on Thursday, a Pakistani border official told AFP that the border would open Friday.The crossing provides direct access to Pakistan's Balochistan province where the Taliban's top leadership has been based for decades along with an unknown number of reserve fighters who regularly enter Afghanistan to help bolster their ranks.A major highway leading from the border connects to Pakistan's commercial capital Karachi and its sprawling port on the Arabian Sea, which is considered a linchpin for Afghanistan's billion-dollar heroin trade that has provided a crucial source of revenue for the Taliban's war chest over the years.- 'Ceasefire to consolidate power' -Spin Boldak is the latest in a string of border crossings and dry ports seized by the insurgents in recent weeks as they look to choke off revenues much needed by Kabul while also filling their own coffers."The bazaar is closed and traders are scared that the situation will turn bad," Mohammad Rasoul, a trader in Spin Boldak, told AFP by phone."They fear that their products will be looted. There are scores of opportunists waiting to loot."Muska Dastageer, a lecturer at the American University of Afghanistan, said the Taliban ceasefire offer was a likely attempt by them to consolidate the positions they have gained so swiftly in recent weeks."A ceasefire now would effectively prohibit ANDSF from retaking the crucial border points which Taliban have captured recently," she tweeted, referring to Afghan forces."I think the timing of this ceasefire offer has more to do with their wish to consolidate power over these areas."At least one Kabul resident said the Taliban could not be trusted."Last year the government released 5,000 Taliban prisoners but their release did not bring peace," Ahmad Jawed told AFP."Instead most of them are now fighting government forces."Now they are asking for 7,000 prisoners to be released. That is a big number."Authorities last year released more than 5,000 Taliban prisoners to help kick start peace talks in Doha, but negotiations have so far failed to reach any political settlement, and the latest offensives suggest the insurgents are now set on a military victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-offers-afghan-govt-3-month-ceasefire-in-exchange-for-release-of-prisoner-101626358063464.html

The researchers conducted an online survey to characterise the symptom profile and time course in patients with suspected and confirmed Long Covid.They analysed the responses from 3,762 participants from 56 countries with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, making the study the largest to date of ‘long-haulers’. The data were collected from September 6, 2020, to November 25, 2020. The researchers estimated the prevalence of 203 symptoms in 10 organ systems and traced 66 symptoms over seven months.The study, published in The Lancet’s EClinicalMedicine, suggests that the time of recovery for the majority of patients exceeded 35 weeks. During the illness, the patients experienced 55 symptoms on average across nine organ systems. As per the study, the most frequent symptoms after six months were fatigue, post-exertional malaise -- worsening of symptoms after physical or mental exertion -- and cognitive dysfunction, which varied in their prevalence over time.Other symptoms included visual hallucinations, tremors, itchy skin, changes to the menstrual cycle, sexual dysfunction, heart palpitations, bladder control issues, shingles, memory loss, blurred vision, diarrhoea, and tinnitus."While there has been a lot of public discussion around long Covid, there are few systematic studies investigating this population," said Athena Akrami, a neuroscientist at University College London in the UK, and senior author of the study."Relatively little is known about its range of symptoms, and their progression over time, the severity, and expected clinical course (longevity), its impact on daily functioning, and expected return to baseline health," she added.Also Read | Over 2 million in England may have had long Covid-19: StudyThe researchers are calling for clinical guidelines on assessing Long Covid to be significantly widened beyond currently advised cardiovascular and respiratory function tests. The researchers said that the study highlights the importance of slowing the spread of the virus through validated public health measures and vaccinations and the necessity of a robust safety net, including sick leave, family leave, disability benefits, and workplace protections and flexibilities."Memory and cognitive dysfunction, experienced by over 85 per cent of respondents, were the most pervasive and persisting neurologic symptoms, equally common across all ages, and with substantial impact on work," said Akrami.Due to the retrospective nature of the study, the researchers acknowledged the possibility of recall bias, which could impact the reliability of symptom prevalence estimates. Highlighting the limitations of the study, they said that both overreporting and underreporting of symptoms are possible. They also said that the study may not be representative of the entire Long Covid population or their experiences.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-covid-has-more-than-200-symptoms-impacting-10-organ-systems-study-101626350976032.html

As many as 72 people have died and more than 1,200 people have been arrested, according to news agency AFP. The Indian community living in South Africa is living in apprehensions of dangers to their homes and businesses as cases of riots, arson and violence are being reported.The South African government has sought to deploy around 25,000 troops to quell the unrest, amid fears of fuel and food shortages. The government has said that 208 incidents of looting and vandalism were recorded on Wednesday, reports AFP.Let's take a look at the violence in South Africa and its connection with the Indian communityZuma had faced many legal challenges before, during and after his presidency, including allegations of rape, embezzlement of public fund, corruption and fraud among many others. Of all the corruption issues charged against him, the most significant one is the involvement of the Gupta family.The Gupta family, with their roots in Uttar Pradesh, moved to South Africa in 1993. Among the prominent members of the family are three brothers --Ajay, Atul, and Rajesh Gupta –and Atul's nephew, Varun. Atul founded Sahara Computers. The Gupta brothers own coal mines, computer manufacturing business, newspapers and a media outlet.The Interpol issued a red corner notice against the three brothers over a 2016 graft report.Guptagate corruptionA chartered plane was used to transport guests for the wedding of one of the relatives of the Gupta family. The plane had landed at the Waterkloof Air Base near Pretoria in 2013.

WHO’s regional director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, told a press briefing that the highly contagious Delta variant has been detected in 21 African countries, with a 43% rise in Covid-19 deaths week-on-week in the continent.Moeti said that African has recorded an additional one million cases of coronavirus over the past month, the shortest time it has taken so far to add one million cases. The top WHO official said that the fresh surge, driven by the Delta variant, is brutally costing lives and the already stretched health systems are now buckling under the pressure of Covid-19.“We’ve seen hospital admissions in around 10 countries increase rapidly and at least five countries, including SouthAfrica, Namibia and Zambia, are facing shortages of ICU beds,” she said, adding that oxygen production remains the “number one priority for African countries.”This week, Africa reached the sombre milestone of six million Covid-19 cases amid a low vaccination rate. As per Our World in Data, African has administered at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to less than 3% of its total population, and the presence of the Delta variant could become a “toxic mixture” as warned by the WHO emergencies programme head Michael Ryan.“Countries opening up who have very low levels of vaccination coverage in the presence of variants is a real toxic mixture for your hospitals filling up again. And this is something that must absolutely be avoided,” Ryan told a news conference in Geneva last week.African countries are heavily dependent on COVAX, a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines, for vaccinating their citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africa-on-destructive-pathway-due-to-delta-variant-says-who-amid-record-surge-101626347456666.html

The local authorities say 50 people are missing, adding that rising waters led several houses to collapse on Thursday.Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) are the states worst hit by the unusually heavy rain, which caused the Ahr river to burst its bank south of Bonn. Ahr is a tributary of the Rhine, the longest river in Germany."There are dead people, there are missing people, and many who are still in danger," Rhineland-Palatinate’s state premier Malu Dreyer was quoted as saying in regional parliament."We have never seen a catastrophe like this," the premier added. Rhineland-Palatinate has deployed all emergency services, which are working round the clock. Two firemen were killed in the line of duty in the towns of Altena and Werdohl, reported the local media.Heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms brought traffic to a stop in the area, toppled trees and overflowed basements on Wednesday.In NRW, 135,000 households are reported to be without power.The police in badly affected states have set up a hotline where people can report missing residents and relatives. The cops have also asked the locals to send the pictures of their loved ones which will help in looking for them.Publications like Bild reported that some people are stuck on rooftops for which helicopters have been deployed. The German military has said it is ready to send its troops to assist in the rescue operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/19-killed-in-germany-as-heavy-rain-flood-wreak-havoc-101626348133179.html

Shortly before the US Capitol riots on January 6, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Gen Miley reportedly warned his aides that the country was facing a “Reichstag moment”, referring to the arson attack on the German parliament in 1933 which Nazis used to consolidate their rule.The book titled ‘I Alone Can Fix It’, authored by Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, gives “definitive behind-the-scenes story” of Trump’s final year in office when the government failed to contain coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, followed by presidential elections which saw regime change, as per the publisher. After Joe Biden’s election victory became evident, Trump blamed the results on baseless claims of electoral fraud, causing concern for top US officials as the country prepared for a transfer of power.Also Read | ‘Hitler did a lot of good things’: New book reveals ‘stunning’ comments by former US President Donald TrumpIn the book, the authors report that Milley’s “old friend” warned the general that Trump and his allies were trying to “overturn the government” after Biden’s win. But the army general was confident that any such attempt would be thwarted since the military wouldn’t go along, reported the New York Magazine quoting the excerpts from the book.“They may try, but they’re not going to f****** succeed. You can’t do this without the military. You can’t do this without the CIA and the FBI. We’re the guys with guns,” Milley is reported to have said.At one point, Milley and other joint chiefs even discussed a plan to resign rather than carry out orders from an outgoing president that they deemed illegal and dangerous, reported CNN. According to Penguin Random House, publisher of ‘I Alone Can Fix It’, the book “reveal[s] a dysfunctional and bumbling presidency’s inner workings in unprecedented, stunning detail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-generals-informally-planned-ways-to-stop-trump-from-attempting-coup-new-book-reveals-101626343922876.html

In the town of Chaudfontaine, daily Le Soir reported that nearly 1,800 people had to evacuate."We have rarely experienced such intense flooding. You have to go back to 1998 to have experienced this," Chaudefontaine mayor Daniel Bacquelaine told RTL radio.The country's Infrabel rail network said it was suspending services in the southern half of the country on Thursday, given the risks to travel."It is indeed impossible to ensure the safe movement of trains for passengers or to have access to strategic areas for their staff," Transport Minister Georges Gilkinet told Belga news agency.Belgium frequently experiences floods. Those in June 2016 were recognised as "calamities" by the Walloon region, giving the right to exceptional compensation.But this year the country is experiencing a particularly rainy start to the summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-storms-leave-at-least-9-dead-dozens-missing-101626338475109.html
15-07-2021||World||Johnson & Johnson voluntarily recalls sunscreens on benzene concerns||Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday it is voluntarily recalling some of its sunscreen products from the market after a cancer-causing chemical was found in some of the samples.The company said all lots of Neutrogena and Aveeno brand aerosol sunscreen products were being called back as a cautionary measure after internal testing identified low levels of benzene in some samples, news agency Reuters reported.Benzene is classified as a human carcinogen, a substance that could potentially cause cancer depending on the level and extent of exposure."While benzene is not an ingredient in any of our sunscreen products, it was detected in some samples of the impacted aerosol sunscreen finished products," the company said."Daily exposure to benzene in these aerosol sunscreen products at the levels detected in our testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences."The recalled aerosol sunscreens are Neutrogena Beach Defense, Neutrogena Cool Dry Sport, Neutrogena Invisible Daily defense, Neutrogena Ultra Sheer, and Aveeno Protect Refresh. The products come in many different sizes and sun protection factors -- the list posted on Neutrogena’s website is 23 pages long.J&J said consumers should stop using the affected products and appropriately discard them.Consumers should contact their physician or healthcare provider if they have any concerns, questions or have experienced any problems related to using these products.According to a Bloomberg report, Valisure, an independent testing lab in New Haven, Connecticut, found in May some widely used sunscreens and after-sun products contained up to six parts per million of benzene. The company filed a petition with the Food and Drug Administration asking for the products to be recalled. Neutrogena topped the list of sunscreens with the highest levels of benzene.“When the industry was alerted to this matter, we immediately began a comprehensive end-to-end investigation of our manufacturing process and raw materials, including internal testing and a thorough data review,” said Jake Sargent, a spokesman for J&J.Valisure also detected benzene in CVS Health Corp. sunscreens as well as after-sun care products, among many other sunscreen brands, though it did find sunscreens that didn’t contain benzene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-johnson-voluntarily-recalls-sunscreens-on-benzene-concerns-101626337286708.html

On Wednesday, the country registered 56 local cases of the viral disease following the discovery of a cluster among social hostesses and customers of KTV karaoke lounges. Of the 56 new infections, 42 were from the KTV karaoke cluster, the health ministry said on Wednesday.The emergence of the above cluster surfaced at a time Singapore is gradually easing its pandemic-related restrictions, including allowing people to meet in larger groups and also rolling back dining curbs, a report by the BBC said on Thursday. Groups of five can now dine-in at restaurants compared to the earlier limit of just two.The health ministry has now launched an investigation into the infections found among the hostesses, a majority of them being Vietnamese, who frequented KTV lounges. Free Covid-19 testing is also being provided to anyone who was exposed to the virus in such venues, news agency Reuters reported.In another major development, 20 women were arrested on late Wednesday for alleged vice activities at the lounges. Police said the arrested included women from South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. An investigation is also underway against operators of three lounges for breaching Covid-19 protocols, police said, adding they are also planning to step up the crackdown against vice activities in Singapore along with increasing checks on lounges, according to Bloomberg.Karaoke lounges were initially closed as part of the government’s Covid-19 restrictions, but a majority of them reopened after they obtained licences to operate as food and beverage outlets.Four establishments operating as food and beverage outlets have been identified as having an ongoing transmission of Covid-19 and have been closed for two weeks, the health ministry said.As of now, Singapore is not looking at reversing the relaxations in restrictions due to a high level of vaccination rate in the country. Over 70 per cent of the population has been inoculated with at least one dose of the vaccine, one of the highest rates across Asia, Bloomberg further reported.Health minister Ong Ye Kung on Wednesday urged the public to be cautious and only meet people if they have to. ”We are in a much more resilient position than before,” Kung said while addressing reporters.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/karaoke-lounges-new-covid-19-hotspots-in-singapore-authorities-intensify-probe-101626336468462.html
15-07-2021||World||‘Won’t turn blind eye’: US Senate passes bill to ban goods from China’s Xinjiang||The US Senate passed a bill on Wednesday to impose a ban on the import of all products from or manufactured in China’s Xinjiang region. The ban will only be waived if importers can prove that the products weren’t made with forced labour, thereby marking the US’ latest effort to punish Beijing for their treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim groups.The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act reportedly needs the US Department of Homeland Security to form a list of entities working with the Chinese government to suppress Uyghurs and other groups. The bill would create a “rebuttable presumption” assuming that all products made in Xinjiang are done with forced labour and thus banned under the 1930 Tariff Act, unless importers can prove otherwise.The bill has currently received unanimous consent, and has to mandatorily pass the House of Representatives before being sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. Republication Senator Marco Rubio – who introduced the bill, with Democrat Jeff Merkley, called for fast action on the bill by the House.“We will not turn a blind eye to the CCP’s ongoing crimes against humanity, and we will not allow corporations a free pass to profit from those horrific abuses,” Rubio said in a statement.Democrat Merkley, on the other hand, highlighted that no US corporation “should profit from these abuses” and that no US consumers should be “inadvertently purchasing products from slave labour”.The US administration has consistently criticised Beijing over its actions against ethnic groups, saying they amount to genocide and crimes against humanity. In 2018, UN experts cited that anywhere from tens of thousands to over 1 million Uyghurs have been detained in China, and coerced into taking jobs under a labour-transfer programme. After this, the US put a ban on Xinjiang solar products, tomatoes, and cotton. Besides the US, the European Union (EU), Canada, and the UK have declared sanctions on China for their treatment of ethnic groups. However, China, in retaliation, has called the allegations the “biggest lie of the century,” stating that the country’s policies are to lift it out of poverty, counter-extremism, and uplift the economy.Last week, the US included 34 new entities to its blacklist, including 14 Chinese ventures with alleged links to human-rights abuses in the Xinjiang area of China. If passed, the latest Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act also brings in the chance of visa and asset-blocking sanctions in connection to Xinjiang to include foreign people and entities.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wont-turn-blind-eye-us-senate-passes-bill-to-ban-goods-from-china-s-xinjiang-101626333791400.html

It is observed on July 15 every year. The day first came into existence back in 2014, and has since then provided “a unique opportunity for dialogue between young people, technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions, firms, employers’ and workers’ organizations, policy makers and development partners,” according to the UN’s website.Once again, the World Youth Skills Day is taking place amid unprecedented times due to the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The theme for 2021 is ‘Reimagining Youth Skills Post-Pandemic’, which will pay a tribute to the resilience and creativity of the youth.This time a virtual panel discussion has been organised by the permanent missions of Portugal and Sri Lanka to the United Nations, together with UNESCO, International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth.The World Youth Skills Day aims to achieve the Incheon Declaration: Education 2030, “which devotes considerable attention to technical and vocational skills development, specifically regarding access to affordable quality TVET; the acquisition of technical and vocational skills for employment, decent work and entrepreneurship; the elimination of gender disparity and ensuring access for the vulnerable,” the UN further said in its website.The UN also listed out some important facts with regard to the state of youth employment, schools along with educational and vocational training amid the Covid-19 crisis:> According to the estimates of UNESCO, schools were shut down for over 30 weeks in 50 per cent of the countries between March 2020 and May 2021.> Respondents to a survey of the TVET, which was jointly collected by UNESCO, the ILO and the World Bank, revealed that distance learning was the most common way of imparting skills.> Youth employment fell 8.7 per cent last year, compared with 3.7 per cent for adults.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several cabinet ministers took to their social media to mark the event. PM Modi said that skill development for the youth is of national importance and is also an important basis for making India self-reliant.“On the occasion of World Youth Skills Day, we reiterate our commitment to empower youth with professional skills that improves employability and entrepreneurship,” Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari tweeted.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan wrote on the microblogging site that on the occasion of the World Youth Skills Day, “let us build an India that is the skilling hub for the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-youth-skills-day-today-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-unevent-101626328503939.html

South African government agencies and ministers on Wednesday said that the violence and looting was no longer about Zuma’s jailing, but organised by people with different vested interests, PTI reported.Notably, police and army called in by president Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday were also unable to control the violence that also saw the committing of arson by thousands of people. Several groups of people, mostly armed, have been mobilising – primarily in Indian suburbs across South Africa and the port city of Durban, to oppose attacks and looting that has caused several Indian-owned businesses and factories, among those, to be completely destroyed.Addressing the Zulu people’s dissatisfaction with the imprisonment of Zuma, KaZwelithini on Wednesday said that violence is “not the right way of expressing” it. “It creates a picture of people who have lost their dignity,” he added, as per the PTI report.KaZwelithini said that the incidents have brought “great shame” to the Zulu people as “fingers are pointed at my father’s people”. Notably, he took the crown three months ago after the passing of his parents within weeks of each other.The Zulu King pointed out that it was unexpected for him to see his “own people so complicit” in “burning down” South Africa. “I must appeal to all of us to take a great step back and consider the damage that is being done by our own actions,” KaZwelithini said, adding that he “fully understands” the depression born of poverty and joblessness.The King also said that the destruction would largely affect the poor people as significant supply chains of medicine and food have been ripped off owing to the ongoing violence at the crucial time of Covid-19 pandemic.According to the PTI report, senior former intelligence officers and other politicians loyal to Zuma, who have all not been charged or named yet, are being probed for being instigators of the violence.KaZwelithini’s remarks came as the death toll in South Africa from riots rose up to 72 on Tuesday, with several losing their lives by getting trampled during looting at stores. Over 1,200 people have till now been apprehended in the lawlessness that has even caused some Covid-19 vaccination centres to shut down, PTI reported.In a statement on Tuesday night, police major general Mathapelo Reters said that as many as 27 deaths in KwaZulu-Natal province and 45 in Gauteng province were probed. Additionally, police were probing explosion-caused deaths from when people attempted to break into ATM machines as well as other loss of lives triggered by shootings, as per the PTI report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/embrace-the-indians-zulu-king-asks-his-people-to-stop-riots-after-zuma-jailed-101626326815017.html

It comes after a petition sought the removal of the person it was named after because of his role in delaying the abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade.Other civic assets named after Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville (1742-1811), a Scottish lawyer, politician, and one of British Prime Minister William Pitt’s most trusted and powerful ministers, will also be renamed. They include two stations of Toronto’s subway system as well as the Yonge-Dundas Square, a major venue for outdoor events including concerts and in earlier years, the India Day Parade held to celebrate August 15.The reason for scrubbing Dundas’ name was given as his “controversial legacy”, according to a document from the Toronto City Council. It said, “The petition called for the street to be renamed because of Dundas’ role in delaying the abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade in the 1790s. It was not until 1807 that the Slave Trade Act was enacted, ending the slave trade in the British Empire. During this period, more than half a million more Black people were enslaved in British territories.”The council voted upon and passed the proposal on Wednesday.A statement said this was part of the city of Toronto’s “commitment to confronting anti-Black racism, advancing truth, reconciliation and justice, as well as building a more inclusive and equitable Toronto”. A new name will be decided upon next year.“The renaming process will be led by a Community Advisory Committee made up of black and indigenous leaders and representatives from the diverse communities living and working along Dundas Street, including business improvement areas and resident associations,” the statement added.Commenting on the council decision, Toronto mayor John Tory said, “We acknowledge that this is just the first of many steps to come, but this a genuine step in the right direction of who we are and what we can be. The names of our public streets, parks, and monuments are a reflection of our values as Torontonians.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colonialera-street-in-toronto-to-be-renamed-101626326465720.html

In fact, few people probably even knew it happened.The phenomenon lasted for a few hours and slightly unsettled the planet's magnetic field, according to the American agency.According to NOAA alert, the storm passed through the Earth at 16:41 UTC (22:11 IST) with a geomagnetic K-index of 4. The K-index is used to characterise the magnitude of geomagnetic storms, and a level of 4 indicates minor disturbance.NOAA said that weak power grid fluctuations occurred due to the solar storm, and expected auroras to be visible at high latitudes such as Canada and Alaska. However, the local US media has not reported any such sightings.While invisible and harmless to anyone on the Earth’s surface, the geomagnetic waves unleashed by solar storms can cripple power grids, jam radio communications, bathe airline crews in dangerous levels of radiation and knock critical satellites off kilter.As a space weather storm leaves the Sun, it passes through the corona and into the solar wind. When it reaches Earth, it energises the planet's magnetosphere and accelerates electrons and protons down to Earth’s magnetic field lines where they collide with the atmosphere and ionosphere, particularly at high latitudes. Each component of space weather impacts a different technology.In 2017, a solar storm caused ham radios to turn to static just as the Category 5 Hurricane Irma was ripping through the Caribbean. In 2015, solar storms knocked out global positioning systems in the US Northeast.In March 1989, a solar storm over Quebec caused a province-wide outage that lasted nine hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solar-wind-enveloped-earth-phenomenon-lasted-for-few-hours-noaa-101626322877587.html

He added that the coronavirus is continuing to evolve and resulting in more transmissible variants.Also Read | Centre warns states against rising 'R' factor of Covid-19. What is this factor?Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the international public health agency, pointed out that Covid-19 cases and deaths were on the decline for a while due to increasing vaccination rates in Europe and North America, but the global trend has now reversed and cases are rising once again, the last week being the fourth consecutive one which witnessed rising cases in all but one of WHO's six regions. Deaths are also rising again, after 10 weeks of steady decline, it said.WHO said that the recent spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus is being fueled by "increased social mobility" and inconsistency in the use of proven public health and social measures.Vaccination against Covid-19 is important but that alone will not stop the pandemic, the global health body said, pointing out that countries need to undertake a "comprehensive risk management approach to mass gatherings", an updated guidance for which was recently issued by WHO.Also Read | Covid-19 cases rising again in US, daily count doubled in 3 weeksMoreover, there is also a "shocking disparity" in the global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, Ghebreyesus added. This inequity has resulted in different countries taking separate approaches to battle the pandemic, resulting in a 'two-track pandemic', per se. One track is for countries with the greatest access to vaccines, who are lifting restrictions and reopening their societies, and the second track is for those without vaccine access and are left “at the mercy of the virus,” he said.There needs to be a massive Covid-19 vaccination push worldwide, WHO highlighted. The global health agency said that every nation must vaccinate at least 10% of their entire population against the coronavirus by September, at least 40% by the end of 2021, and at least 70% by mid-2022.Meanwhile, India reported 41,806 fresh cases and 581 more fatalities due to the coronavirus disease in the last 24 hours, taking the caseload and death toll to 30,987,880 and 411,989 respectively, according to the Union health ministry’s update on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-now-in-early-stages-of-third-covid-19-wave-delta-variant-dominant-who-101626320258118.html

Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee-Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, National Foundation for American Policy Stuart Anderson said the backlog is increasing and, within a decade, more than 2 million people will be waiting in line for the green cards and they might have to wait for years and decades.Without Congressional action, the total backlog for all three employment-based categories (EB 1, EB 2, EB 3) for Indians would increase from an estimated 9,15,497 individuals currently to an estimated 21,95,795 individuals by fiscal 2030, Anderson said, as reported by PTI.In March 2021, employers filed 3,08,613 H-1B registrations for cap selection for FY 2022 for only 85,000 H-1B petitions, which effectively means over 72 per cent of H-1B registrations for high-skilled foreign nationals were rejected even before an adjudicator evaluated the application.On the other hand, it is easier for international students to work in temporary status and then acquire permanent residence in Canada. Jennifer Young, CEO, Technology Councils of North America, said Canada's pre-pandemic immigration rules allowed its companies to hire high-skilled foreign talent in even four weeks.Canada says no to Covid-19 test report from India, wants flyers to take 'third country' routeIndia has been contributing significantly to the number of international students in the United States. For example, out of the US's total full-time graduate students pursuing Computer Science, 75 per cent is from outside. In the 2016-17 academic year, two-thirds of the international students were from India. According to an analysis of the US government data by the National Foundation for American Policy, this share has declined by more than 25 per cent between 2016-17 and 2018-19.At the same time, Indian students studying at Canadian universities rose by 127 per cent, from 76,075 in 2016 to 1,72,625 in 2018, according to the Canadian Bureau for International Education."In sum, Canada's immigration policies are much better than America's for facilitating the entry of talented individuals. Congress established America's policies in 1990, before smartphones, e-commerce, social media, cloud computing and the daily use of the internet exploded the demand for high-skilled technical labour. The world has changed since 1990. US immigration policy has not,” Anderson said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-indians-are-choosing-canada-over-us-experts-testify-before-us-lawmakers-101626318957145.html

We think they have understood the situation and our counter-infection measures," he told AFP.A family member of one of the infected hotel workers also tested positive, Hamamatsu officials added.Tokyo is currently under a virus state of emergency, with infections surging. The city recorded 1,149 cases on Wednesday, the highest figure since January.Several areas around the capital are under looser virus restrictions.Olympic participants will be subject to strict virus rules and kept largely away from the Japanese public.Separately, a staff member with the Russian rugby sevens team was hospitalised after testing positive, an official in their host town Munakata in western Japan told AFP.The team, comprised of 16 athletes and 10 staff members, landed at a Tokyo airport on July 10, and has had no close contact with local officials or residents since then, he said.The rest of the team is now quarantined in their accommodation, but if they test negative on Thursday, they will be able to resume training as early as Friday, the official added.The International Olympic Committee said Wednesday that of over 8,000 people who arrived between July 1 and 13, just three tested positive after arrival and were isolated.IOC chief Thomas Bach also pledged "not to bring any risk" to Japan with the Games, which open on July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cluster-emerges-at-japan-hotel-hosting-brazilian-olympians-101626319635805.html

The development comes amid a record-breaking heatwave in Russia during June which experts say could lead to the hottest summer that the country has experienced in more than a century.Moscow bakes in soaring temperatures.The meteorological service says Russia could see its hottest summer in 120 years after a record-breaking heatwave in June.Notorious for his scepticism about global warming, Putin now says climate change is a priority 📸 Alexander Nemenov pic.twitter.com/iUeCpdV17YMoscow is baking in temperatures soaring towards record highs, news agencies reported a day ago, adding that people are heading to lakes to cool off as the heatwave sweeps western Russia. Daytime temperatures in Moscow are forecast at 30-35 degrees Celsius in the coming days and could break record highs on three days this week that have stood since 1936, 1951, and 2010, the RIA news agency reported.Also Read | The Arctic is on fire: Siberian heat wave alarms scientistsTaking global warming as a cue, Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that his government is willing to work with the US to battling climate change, a rare area of common ground between the nations.For years Putin was notorious for his scepticism about man-made global warming and saying Russia stands to benefit from it. But in recent months he has also made statements to the effect that climate change is not just a boon to Moscow.In a phone call with US climate envoy John Kerry on Wednesday, Putin said that Moscow and Washington have "common interests and similar approaches" when it comes to the "climate problem". He also told the former US secretary of state that Moscow "attaches great importance" to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and "advocates de-politicising" dialogue on climate change.Also Read | Where climate scientists see danger, Russia sees an opportunityMoscow registered a temperature of 34.8-degree Celsius last month, the hottest recorded in June in 142 years of monitoring. Last Monday, temperatures in the city reached 31-degree Celsius, reported news agency Reuters, citing weather officials familiar with the matter. "The increase in the frequency of dangerous weather events and in particular heatwaves unavoidably accompany global warming," a meteorologist at the Moscow state university told the news agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-moscow-bakes-in-record-heat-russia-s-vladimir-putin-changes-tune-on-climate-change-101626311824453.html
15-07-2021||World||Covid-19 cases, deaths rise again globally||Covid-19 deaths and cases are on the rise again globally in a dispiriting setback that is triggering another round of restrictions and dampening hopes for a return to normal life.The World Health Organization reported Wednesday that deaths climbed last week after nine straight weeks of decline. It recorded more than 55,000 lives lost, a 3% increase from the week before.Cases rose 10% last week to nearly 3 million, with the highest numbers recorded in Brazil, India, Indonesia and Britain, WHO said.The reversal has been attributed to low vaccination rates, the relaxation of mask rules and other precautions, and the swift spread of the more-contagious delta variant, which WHO said has now been identified in 111 countries and is expected to become globally dominant in the coming months.Sarah McCool, a professor of public health at Georgia State University, said the combination amounts to a "recipe for a potential tinderbox.”Also Read| Sydney's extended lockdown suppress Covid-19 cases of contagious Delta variant"It’s important that we recognize that Covid has the potential for explosive outbreaks,’’ warned Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University.Amid the surge, the death toll in hard-hit Argentina surpassed 100,000. Daily coronavirus deaths in Russia hit record highs this week. In Belgium, Covid-19 infections, driven by the delta variant among the young, have almost doubled over the past week. Britain recorded a one-day total of more than 40,000 new cases for the first time in six months.In Myanmar, crematoriums are working morning to night. In Indonesia, which recorded almost 1,000 deaths and over 54,000 new cases Wednesday, up from around 8,000 cases per day a month ago, people near Jakarta are pitching in to help gravediggers keep up.“As the diggers are too tired and do not have enough resources to dig, the residents in my neighborhood decided to help,” Jaya Abidin said. “Because if we do not do this, we will have to wait in turn a long time for a burial."In the US, with one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, newly confirmed infections per day have doubled over the past two weeks to an average of about 24,000, though deaths are still on a downward trajectory at around 260 a day.Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the US, reported its fifth straight day Tuesday of more than 1,000 new cases.Tokyo is under a fourth state of emergency ahead of the Summer Games this month, with infections climbing fast and hospital beds filling up. Experts have said caseloads could rise above 1,000 before the Olympics and multiply to thousands during the games.Also Read| US coronavirus cases rise again due to DeltaThe spike has led to additional restrictions in places like Sydney, Australia, where the 5 million residents will remain in lockdown through at least the end of July, two weeks longer than planned. South Korea has placed the Seoul area under its toughest distancing rules yet because of record case levels.Parts of Spain, including Barcelona, moved to impose an overnight curfew. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said masks will be required on buses and trains even after other restrictions in England are lifted next week. Italy warned all those going abroad that they might have to quarantine before returning home.Chicago announced that unvaccinated travelers from Missouri and Arkansas must either quarantine for 10 days or have a negative Covid-19 test.Connecticut lawmakers voted Wednesday to again extend Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s emergency declarations, despite pushback from Republicans and some Democrats who argued it is time to get back to normal. Among other things, the move keeps in place orders requiring masks in certain settings.An Alabama military base has ordered troops to show proof of vaccination before they can go maskless as the state sees an uptick in Covid-19 cases, a rise attributed to low vaccination rates. The measure was put in place Tuesday at Fort Rucker, home to the Army’s aviation program.As troubling as the figures are around the world, they are still well below the alarming numbers seen earlier this year.Seven months into the vaccination drive, global deaths are down to around 7,900 a day, after topping out at over 18,000 a day in January, according to Johns Hopkins data. Cases are running at around 450,000 a day, down by half since their peak in late April.Also Read| ‘Perfect storm of factors’: UN expert warns of Covid-19 crisis in MyanmarWHO acknowledged that many countries are now facing “considerable pressure” to lift all remaining precautions but warned that failing to do it the right way will just give the virus more opportunity to spread.Pressure is growing worldwide to boost vaccination rates to counter the rise.“If you have been waiting, if you have been on the fence, sign up and get that shot as soon as possible,” New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi pleaded.Eighteen-year-old actress and singer Olivia Rodrigo appeared at the White House on Wednesday as part of an effort by President Joe Biden to persuade more young people. Getting a vaccination is something "you can do more easily than ever before,” she said.While nearly 160 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, or over 55% of the population, young adults have shown less interest.Ohio is planning another prize program to encourage vaccinations, and Gov. Mike DeWine urged the government to give the vaccines full approval instead of just emergency authorization to ease people's doubts.“The reality is we now have two Ohios,” said Bruce Vanderhoff, the state's chief medical officer. “An Ohio that is vaccinated and protected on the one hand, and an Ohio that is unvaccinated and vulnerable to delta on the other.”Michigan already started a Covid-19 vaccine sweepstakes and announced the first four $50,000 winners Wednesday. Bigger prizes, including a $2 million jackpot, are coming.In Missouri, second only to Arkansas with the worst Covid-19 diagnosis rate over the past week, political leaders in and around St. Louis have stepped up efforts to get people vaccinated through gift cards and by enlisting beauty salons and barbershops to dispense information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-deaths-rise-again-globally-101626312556050.html

The ceremony was attended by new Israeli President Isaac Herzog, The Times of Israel reported.UAE Ambassador Mohammad Mahmoud Al Khajah officially presented his credentials at the beginning of March but the official opening was not held until now."It is a great honour to open the embassy here. Ten months ago our two countries signed the Abraham Accords with a vision of dignity, prosperity and peace for the two peoples," Khajah said at the ceremony Wednesday.He added: "This is just the beginning. Both countries are innovative nations and we will harness these new approaches for the prosperity of the countries."Herzog, who took office last week, hailed the embassy opening as an "important step for the entire Middle East."Last month, Israel Foreign Minister Yair Lapid visited the UAE on the first official trip by an Israeli minister to the Gulf state, where he inaugurated the Israeli embassy in Abu Dhabi and a consulate in Dubai.The visit came nearly a year after Israel and the UAE announced they would normalise ties, and after months during which planned visits by Israeli officials were stymied by a series of issues, ranging from health crises to diplomatic scuffles.Israel and the UAE announced in August 2020 that they would normalise diplomatic relations, bringing over a decade of covert ties into the open. Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco later also joined the US-brokered Abraham Accords, and other countries were also rumoured to be in talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-becomes-1st-gulf-nation-to-open-embassy-in-israel-101626304584361.html
15-07-2021||World||White House may ease ban on remittances as part of Cuba review: Report||President Joe Biden's review of Trump-era Cuba policy could lead to big changes in the U.S. posture toward the communist government in Havana as U.S. officials take stock of large protests in that country.The White House says Biden's primary goal is helping the people of Cuba as they reel from pandemic-driven economic woes. Two sources familiar with the review said on Wednesday it could lead to the easing of restrictions on payments Americans can make to their families in Cuba.Remittances to Cuba are believed to be around $2 billion to $3 billion annually, representing its third biggest source of dollars after the services industry and tourism.The sources also said whether to ease a travel ban between the United States and Cuba is also under consideration, as well as whether to lift the designation of Cuba as a "state sponsor of terrorism," a label then-President Donald Trump gave to Cuba just days prior to leaving office in January.Biden is also considering reviving the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program, which had provided a legal way for Cuban families to be reunited in the United States, the sources said.Trump's withdrawal of U.S. diplomats from Cuba in 2017 in response to mysterious, possibly sonic, attacks on Americans in Havana basically froze the reunification program.Cuban-born Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday warned Cubans and Haitians not to attempt to enter the United States illegally by sea, saying the trek was too dangerous and they would be repatriated.The Cuba review is being coordinated by the White House National Security Council with input from the State and Defense departments as well as the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies.The outcome of the review is not considered imminent.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters the Cuba policy review is being conducted "with an eye toward its impact on the political and economic well-being of the Cuban people.""There's no question that the protests over the weekend and the events of the last several days are significant events, and it was the largest protest we've seen in Cuba in a long time. That will obviously have an impact on how we proceed," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-may-ease-ban-on-remittances-as-part-of-cuba-review-report-101626296729079.html
15-07-2021||World||9 Chinese nationals killed in Pakistan bus ‘blast’||A blast on a bus killed 13 people in north Pakistan’s Khyber-Paktunkhwa on Wednesday, including nine Chinese nationals in what Beijing said was a bomb attack but Islamabad called a vehicle failure.Two Pakistani soldiers were also among the dead after the explosion sent the bus over a ravine, local government and police sources told Reuters.Chinese engineers and Pakistani construction workers have for several years been working on hydroelectric projects as part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative in the western province of Khyber-Paktunkhwa.China’s embassy in Pakistan confirmed that nine of its nationals died.Terming the explosion a bomb attack but not giving more details, the Chinese foreign ministry offered condolences and urged both a thorough investigation and protection of its personnel and projects.“Recently, our workers at a business on a certain project in Pakistan were attacked and have suffered deaths and injuries. We have notified Chinese citizens in Pakistan to avoid venturing outside unless required by work or business and pay especial care to their safety,” the Chinese embassy statement said.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China was “shocked by and condemns the bomb attack”.“We have demanded the Pakistani side get to the bottom of the incident, arrest and strictly punish the assailants as soon as possible, and earnestly protect the safety of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Pakistan,” Zhao said at a press briefing.Pakistan’s foreign ministry on Wednesday maintained that a mechanical failure caused a gas leak, which led to the explosion.The bus “plunged into a ravine after a mechanical failure resulting in leakage of gas that caused a blast. ... Further investigations are underway,” the ministry’s statement said.However, the province’s top police official, inspector general Moazzam Jah Ansari, earlier in the day said foul play was suspected. “Looks like sabotage,” he said.A senior administrative officer of the Hazara region, who asked not to be named, said the bus was carrying more than 30 Chinese engineers to the Dasu dam in Upper Kohistan.The Dasu hydroelectric project is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a $65 billion investment plan aiming to link western China to the southern Pakistani port of Gwadar.“This is clearly an act of terrorism that has been carefully planned and was supported by information,” said an editorial in Global Times, a Chinese tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, calling it the most serious attack on Chinese nationals in recent years.Using an air ambulance, rescuers took the injured, including Chinese engineers, to a hospital in Dasu, about 10km from the blast site, authorities said.“Police and the bomb disposal squad are at the site,” added regional official Arif Khan Yousufzai outside the hospital, adding that an investigation was awaited to ascertain details.Pakistan’s foreign ministry said it was in close contact with the Chinese embassy in Islamabad, adding in a statement: “Pakistan attaches great importance to the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects and...”Recently, Pakistan has seen a resurgence in terrorist attacks, increasing worries of Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is already trying to overcome an economic crisis with the help of Chinese investment under President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative.Pakistan’s military has reported 11 such incidents in the north and south-west region since June that have killed 22 soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/9-chinese-nationals-killed-in-pakistan-bus-blast-101626292909483.html
15-07-2021||World||US coronavirus cases rise again due to Delta||The Covid-19 curve in the US is rising again after months of decline, with the number of new cases per day doubling over the past three weeks, driven by the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus, lagging vaccination rates and the July 4 Independence Day gatherings.Confirmed infections climbed to an average of about 23,600 a day on Monday, up from 11,300 on June 23, according to Johns Hopkins University data. All but two states - Maine and South Dakota - reported that case numbers have gone up over the past two weeks.Indonesia reported more than 54,000 new cases for the first time on Wednesday, surpassing recent daily infections in India, whose disastrous outbreak is declining, and becoming Asia’s new Covid-19 hot spot. Officials fear that the Delta variant is now spreading from the islands of Java and Bali, where outbreaks prompted a partial lockdown that closed places of worship, malls, parks and restaurants.The health ministry reported 54,517 new cases and 991 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, taking the number of confirmed cases since the pandemic began above 2.6 million and the number of confirmed fatalities to more than 69,000. A month ago, daily cases were running at about 8,000.Spanish court: Lockdown is unconstitutionalSpain’s constitutional court ruled on Wednesday that last year’s strict stay-at-home lockdown order by the government under a state of emergency was unconstitutional. The court ruling was in response to a suit brought by the far-right Vox party. It was a split decision according to a brief statement issued by the court.Masks mandatory for London public transportThe UK is headed for a mixed bag of rules on masks in enclosed spaces, as protection against the spread of the virus, after London mayor Sadiq Khan said that they would remain a mandatory requirement on public transport in the city. UK PM Boris Johnson had earlier said face coverings would no longer be a legal requirement in England from next Monday.French star Lea Seydoux was forced to pull out of the ongoing Cannes film festival on Wednesday after coming down with Covid-19 despite being fully vaccinated against the disease.

15-07-2021||World||Bangladesh to lift lockdown for festival despite record infections||Bangladesh will lift its nationwide coronavirus lockdown for the country's second-biggest religious festival, the government said Tuesday, even as new infections soared to record levels.The cabinet said all restrictions would be eased in the Muslim-majority country of 169 million people from Thursday, ahead of the Eid al-Adha festival which will be celebrated from July 20 to 22 this year.The removal of the curbs would "normalise economic activities" ahead of the celebrations, it added.Tens of millions of people usually head back to their villages to mark Eid al-Adha with their families.Bangladesh imposed its strictest-ever lockdown at the start of the month as new Covid-19 cases and deaths climbed to pandemic highs.Under the lockdown, people were only allowed to leave home for emergencies and to buy essentials, with public transport, shops and offices shut.But infections have continued to climb, with nearly 14,000 people testing positive on Monday -- a new daily record -- to take the total number of cases to just over one million.The death toll has risen above 16,600. But experts say the real figures could be much higher amid fears of underreporting.Mohammad Shahidullah, who heads a health committee that advises the government on how to manage the pandemic, said his group of experts opposed the easing of the lockdown."The committee opines that this strict lockdown should be continued till there is a declining trend in infections," Shahidullah told AFP."Amid the lockdown, there is an increasing trend of infections and fatalities. The infection level is still very high."There are also fears that crowding at markets to buy animals for slaughter and big gatherings during the festival could become super-spreader events.- Revived vaccination drives -The announcement came as authorities restarted the country's Covid-19 vaccination drive, which virtually ground to a halt in late April after imports of shots from neighbouring India were suspended to meet local demand amid a massive virus surge.The revived inoculation programme kicked off on a large scale on Tuesday with two million shots of Sinopharm from China and 2.5 million Moderna doses from the United States via the Covax programme.So far, 4.2 million people in Bangladesh have been fully vaccinated with two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine bought or donated from India.A further 1.6 million have received one shot.In nearby Bhutan, half a million Moderna doses arrived late Monday from the United States via Covax.More shots are expected to be donated by Denmark, Croatia, Bulgaria, China and several other countries.The tiny Himalayan kingdom, which has a population of 770,000, had pleaded for more shots after using up most of the 550,000 AstraZeneca doses donated by India.It had inoculated more than 60 percent of its population with first doses in late March and early April.In the world's second-most infected nation India, where cases have declined from record highs in May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned against people flocking to northern Himalayan states to escape the scorching summer heat."The virus does not come and go on its own... we bring it with us when we disobey the rules. Experts are warning us repeatedly that careless behaviour -- like overcrowding -- will lead to an increase in Covid cases," he said Tuesday during a meeting with state leaders.The health ministry said more than 230 million rupees ($3 million) was being allocated to an emergency package to increase the number of ambulances and ICU beds in public hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-to-lift-lockdown-for-festival-despite-record-infections-101626283412521.html
