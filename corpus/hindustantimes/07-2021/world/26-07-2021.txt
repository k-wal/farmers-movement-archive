The long and high jump records, for example, have stood for decades, or are only ever surpassed by a centimetre or two.But if athletes start taking performance-enhancing drugs, as happened in US baseball during the late 1990s, records are suddenly broken often and by a lot."The climate currently behaves like an athlete on steroids," Fischer said.At current rates of greenhouse gas emissions, the world is on track to continue warming at current rates to more than 3C by 2100."This is a very important study," commented Tim Palmer, a research professor at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the findings.But climate models with far higher resolution -- like a camera with 64 mega-pixels rather than 16 -- are needed to simulate the monster heatwaves observed the world over the last 20 years."This new study shines a valuable spotlight on the high potential for record-shattering extremes," including the kind of extreme rainfall that ravaged Germany and China earlier this month, noted Rowan Sutton, a professor at the University of Reading's National Centre for Atmospheric Science, in Britain."Whilst it may not seem rapid to us, Earth is warming at a rate that is unprecedented in the history of human civilisation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recordshattering-heatwaves-caused-by-pace-of-warming-study-101627321909964.html

The two bodies also recommended measures like faster rollout of Covid-19 vaccination to all eligible groups, implementation of public health measures and increased access to testing.“Surveillance data reported to WHO/Europe and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) show that between June 28 and July 11, 2021 the Delta variant was dominant in the majority (19 countries) of the 28 countries that reported sufficiently complete genetic sequencing information,” the joint statement by the ECDC and the WHO’s Europe office read.Also read | Over half of Europe's adult population 'fully vaccinated' against Covid-19: EUWarning against the rising number of infections across Europe since the past four weeks, the ECDC said a five-fold increase in the infections was observed among the people in the age group of 15 to 24 over the past month. It also urged the priority groups including older people and those with chronic diseases, as well as healthcare workers to receive their full dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to protect themselves from severe illness.“Based on current trends the Delta variant will be the globally dominant strain over the coming months and has already been identified in almost all European countries. It will continue to spread, displacing the circulation of other variants unless a new more competitive virus emerges,” the statement further said.In their statement, the ECDC and WHO also mentioned the increased risk of infections due to travelling. It directed the people to think about the need and assess the risks before travel and also issued directives for safe commuting.The Delta variant or the B.1.617.2 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in India and according to the WHO, is more transmissive than the Alpha variant first detected in the United Kingdom. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, said that the Delta variant has been reported in 96 countries as of July 5, 2021. The WHO termed the Delta variant as a variant of concern earlier on May 11 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-of-covid-19-now-dominant-in-most-european-countries-says-ecdc-101627321521247.html

26-07-2021||World||Yi says China, Pak to launch offensive in Afghanistan to drive out terrorists||China and Pakistan have decided to launch "joint actions" in Afghanistan to stop the war-torn country from becoming a "hotbed for terrorism" and drive out terrorist forces from there, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday.The decision was taken during a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Pakistan counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the southwestern the Chinese city of Chengdu on Saturday.During the meeting, Wang and Qureshi "decided to launch joint actions on Afghan issue," Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here.Also, a press release posted on the website of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wang in his talks with Qureshi "emphasised that as Afghanistan's neighbours, China and Pakistan are directly impacted by the Afghan situation. It is necessary for the two countries to strengthen cooperation and respond to changes".This was "one important agenda during Qureshi's visit to China," said the press release titled 'China and Pakistan Decide to Launch Joint Actions on Afghan Issue'."After in-depth communication, we decided to launch joint actions," which included making "every effort to pursue peace, give top priority to avoiding the spread of war, and prevent Afghanistan from spiralling into a full-scale civil war," Wang said."We will work together to combat terrorism and push all major forces in Afghanistan to draw a clear line against terrorism, firmly combat the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and other terrorist forces, and resolutely stop Afghanistan from becoming a hotbed of terrorism,” Wang said.China and Pakistan will actively promote peace through talks, advance effective intra-Afghan talks, and take substantive steps towards political reconciliation and building a broad-based and inclusive political framework, he said.He said both nations will promote coordination and cooperation among Afghanistan's neighbouring countries, explore the building of Afghanistan-related cooperation platforms, and help Afghanistan achieve peaceful reconstruction and live in amity with all its neighbours.China, which wants the Taliban to sever links with terrorist groups in Afghanistan, has stepped up its diplomacy to reduce frictions between Pakistan and Afghanistan over Islamabad’s backing for the Taliban and settle for a power-sharing settlement with the Afghan government.Wang-Qureshi meeting took place under the shadow of the recent bomb attack on a shuttle bus carrying Chinese engineers at Dasu area of Upper Kohistan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where a Chinese company is building a 4320-mw dam on the Indus river.Nine Chinese personnel were killed and 27 others injured.China had rushed a special team amid confusing signals from Pakistan that it could be a gas blast. Islamabad later admitted it as a bomb blast stating that an explosive substance was found.The Dasu bus blast had accentuated Beijing’s concerns as thousands of Chinese personnel worked in the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan installations, projects and personnel in Pakistan.While Pakistan is concerned over the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been waging an insurgency against the country for several years, China is worried over the regrouping the Uyghur militants from Xinjiang who operate under the aegis of ETIM, which Beijing alleges has links with Al-Qaeda.Observers say there is confusion as no one has claimed responsibility for the incident, raising questions whether it has an Afghan connection.Although no organisation has claimed responsibility yet, Chinese experts believed that the terrorist groups such as the Pakistani Taliban or the ETIM were behind the attack, a report in the state-run Global Times said on Monday.Due to a changing environment in Afghanistan, the ETIM terrorists may have fled to Pakistan where they collaborated with the Pakistani Taliban to launch an attack on China, the paper quoted experts as saying."But they also warned that if the situation in Afghanistan further deteriorates, Pakistan as well as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will be in danger," it said.The 12th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the UN issued last month confirmed the presence of the ETIM militants in Afghanistan."The ETIM consists of several hundred members, located primarily in Badakhshan and neighbouring Afghan provinces,” said the report, which was submitted to the UN Security Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yi-says-china-pak-to-launch-offensive-in-afghanistan-to-drive-out-terrorists-101627318718117.html
26-07-2021||World||More global support needed for Afghanistan to contain Taliban’s campaign||The next two to three months are crucial for blunting the Taliban’s campaign to capture territory across Afghanistan, with the group benefiting from active logistical and tactical support from across the border in Pakistan.Since the US announced its intention to withdraw all its forces from Afghanistan earlier this year, the Taliban have focused on capturing as much territory as possible, especially in rural areas, and taking control of border crossings with countries such as Iran, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Pakistan. India believes the best-case scenario is a political settlement based on a power-sharing agreement in Kabul that retains the constitutional systems and institutions built up over the past two decades, and is open to possible changes to the existing system to accommodate all stakeholders.The Afghan defence forces, which lost some of their earlier momentum in recent weeks, have now begun reorienting their strategy to contain the Taliban campaign but will require more support from the international community to intensify their operations, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.A dynamic strategy that focuses on securing the most important Afghan provinces and good military leadership will be key for the Afghan forces in the coming weeks, especially as there are indications that the Taliban will widen its campaign in August to target provincial capitals and urban areas, particularly in Kandahar, Helmand, Paktia and Ghazni. The Afghan forces have also benefited from a shake-up of the higher echelons of the security set-up, during which President Ashraf Ghani replaced his defence and interior ministers and the army chief to sharpen the fight against the Taliban.The people pointed to the $3.3 billion pledged by the US last month for Afghan forces – including $1 billion to ensure the air force can support combat operations and for the delivery of additional aircraft, $1 billion to purchase supplies such as fuel, ammunition and spare parts, and $700 million to pay the salaries of Afghan troops – but said more backing from the international community will be needed in terms of air support, maintenance of air assets and intelligence and surveillance.The Afghan forces have to adjust to the new reality and are expected to continue the fight as long as salaries are paid and there is good leadership, the people said.The Taliban have benefited from the logistical and tactical support from Pakistani soil, and all supply lines from the Pakistani side remain open, the people said. There are reports that thousands of Pakistani terrorists from groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) are fighting in Afghanistan while Pakistani identity cards had been found on many fighters killed in recent weeks.There are also reports of terrorists injured in Afghanistan being treated at hospitals in the Pakistani cities of Chaman and Quetta, both in Balochistan province, and pro-Taliban rallies have been organised in Quetta and Peshawar, the capital of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. Madrassas or seminaries in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa have issued calls for men to join the jihad in Afghanistan.In the past year, most terrorists based in Pakistan’s North and South Waziristan regions have also been pushed into Afghanistan. These developments have coincided with greater scrutiny of Pakistan’s efforts to curb terrorism by Western powers and watchdogs such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).For India, the presence of fighters from the LeT, the JeM and the Haqqani Network, which has deep-rooted ties with Pakistan’s military, remains a key concern. The Haqqani Network was linked to attacks on the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008 and 2009 and the network also has ties with Al-Qaeda. The people also described reports of the Taliban controlling 85% of Afghan territory as exaggerated and said the group is believed to control about 45% of the country or about 212 of the 420-odd districts, while more than 110 districts are under government control. In the worst-case scenario, of all the Afghan stakeholders failing to reach an agreement on a political settlement and the Taliban capturing power by force, there are fears that the group won’t be able to control all parts of Afghanistan, leaving ungoverned areas that could be used by foreign terrorists to pose a threat to countries across the region, including several Central Asian states. “The Central Asian states will be most affected in terms of security. China too has its concerns about groups like East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). The Tajikistan border is the most tense now as large stretches are controlled by the Taliban,” one of the people cited above said. While the core ideology of the Taliban – including the establishment of an Islamic emirate and disregard for human rights – remains unchanged, the group is not a monolith and has several power centres and factions. While some Taliban commanders on the ground believe they have won the war, others such as the political leadership based in Doha have a different outlook and some are open to power-sharing.The Taliban are learning from their experiences and they don’t want to be seen as taking over provinces by force. They also want some sort of recognition from the world, and are visiting Iran and Russia to get “some sort of legitimacy”, the people said.These factors are also believed to have shaped India’s move to open channels of communication with the Taliban, as first reported by Hindustan Times. The external affairs ministry has not formally confirmed such contacts but has said India is in touch with “various stakeholders”.Though there are differences in the approaches of countries such as Iran, Russia and the US to the Afghanistan issue, there is convergence in opposing any forcible or military takeover in Kabul, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-global-support-needed-for-afghanistan-to-contain-taliban-s-campaign-101627317460161.html
26-07-2021||World||Mary Simon sworn in as Canada’s 30th governor-general||Social activist, journalist and former diplomat Mary Simon was sworn in as Canada’s 30th governor-general on Monday making her the first person of indigenous heritage to hold the post.She was sworn in by the chief justice of the Canadian Supreme Court at a ceremony in the chamber of Senate of Canada in the country’s capital, Ottawa, in the first-ever socially distanced event, with limited attendance due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Simon, 73, was born in the village of Kangiqsualujjuaq in the Nunavik region of the province of Quebec. During her career, she has championed the rights of the indigenous Inuit people of Canada. She served as Canada’s ambassador to Denmark from 1999 to 2001 while also serving as ambassador for circumpolar affairs from 1994 to 2003, during which she negotiated the creation of the Arctic Council. In 2008, she delivered the formal response of the Inuit to an apology from the Government of Canada on residential schools in the House of Commons.She was appointed to the position by Queen Elizabeth II as the governor-general is the monarch’s representative in the country. That appointment was announced on July 6.It also comes at a time when hundreds of unmarked graves of indigenous children have been unearthed across Canada. These graves were discovered at or near residential schools that had been run by the Catholic Church in the past.Simon’s appointment was seen as a symbol of an attempt at reconciliation with the indigenous people during a time of crisis.While her appointment was largely praised, there were a handful of complaints to the commissioner of official languages of Canada, as she does not speak French, but is fluent in English and Inuktitut, the Inuit language. Those complaints, numbering over 400, are being investigated by the watchdog.The post of governor-general fell vacant following the resignation of Simon’s predecessor Julie Payette in January. In a development unparalleled in Canadian history, she resigned following the submission of an independent report about a toxic work environment in her official quarters of Rideau Hall in Ottawa. While other governor-generals in the past were unable to complete their tenures due to death or illness, this is the first time an incumbent had to leave the office amid controversy.A former astronaut, Payette was a high-profile selection by the Trudeau government to become governor-general in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mary-simon-sworn-in-as-canada-s-30th-governorgeneral-101627316499983.html

The meeting was held in Tianjin as Beijing is not hosting any foreign dignitaries due to Covid-19 protocols.On her arrival, she tweeted, "heartfelt condolences (from the United States) to those who have lost loved ones" in severe storms and flooding last week in China’s Henan province resulting in the deaths of 69 people.Monday’s pattern of the US-China talks followed the highly contentious first meeting in March in Anchorage, Alaska where Wang and top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi exchanged barbs with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.China also came under immense pressure mounted by the US and allies over the allegations of genocide in Xinjiang over mass detention camps holding thousands of Uyghur Muslims.The Biden administration's special envoy on climate John Kerry visited Shanghai in April this year for meetings with his Chinese counterpart.The China-US relationship turned adversarial under previous US President Donald Trump who besides imposing trade sanctions also squarely blamed China for the spread of the coronavirus, which had first emerged in Wuhan in December 2019 and the possibility of it leaking from a bio-lab in the city.Biden sought to firm up Trump’s stern China policy by uniting Washington allies like the EU, Canada, Australia and Japan, which has further riled China.He had a lengthy phone conversation with Xi after he took over and reports say the two countries may work out plans for a bilateral summit soon."I know him pretty well," Biden said earlier and described Xi as "very bright" and "very tough" but without "a democratic, small D, bone in his body", highlighting the autocratic style of functioning of the 68-year-old Chinese leader.Under pressure especially over the Covid-19, China is drumming up support against independent inquiry by the World Health Organisation (WHO) into the origins of the coronavirus.China has mounted a massive campaign at home and abroad to avert any such move to facilitate international investigators to probe the Covid-19 origins in Wuhan.Zhao said about 55 countries including Russia, Belarus, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have written to the WHO expressing opposition to the politicisation of the Covid-19 origin.Ahead of the talks, Wang Yi said on Saturday that China will give the US a "tutorial" on how to treat other nations equally."The United States always wants to exert pressure on other countries by virtue of its own strength, thinking that it is superior to others," he said, according to his comments posted on the foreign ministry website."However, I would like to tell the US side clearly that there has never been a country in this world that is superior to others, nor should there be, and China will not accept any country claiming to be superior to others,” he said.In his speech at the talks, Xie said the China-US relationship is in a stalemate, fundamentally because some Americans portray China as an "imagined enemy," and Washington must change the highly misguided mindset and dangerous policy."It seems that a whole-of-government and the whole-of-society campaign is being waged to bring China down. It is as if when China's development is contained, all US domestic and external challenges would go away,” he said.The US policy seems to be demanding cooperation when it wants something from China. "China wants to work with the US to seek common ground while shelving the differences," he said."After all, a healthy and stable China-US relationship serves the interests of both sides. And the world expects nothing less from the two sides," he added, according to a report by state-run Xinhua news agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-attacks-us-at-bilateral-talks-hands-list-of-demands-to-revive-ties-101627305610486.html

This includes stabilisation of Afghanistan, Chinese aggression in Indo-Pacific, counter-terrorism and cementing of defence cooperation."The Deputy Secretary also raised the cases of American and Canadian citizens detained in the PRC (People's Republic of China) or under exit bans and reminded PRC officials that people are not bargaining chips," State Department spokesperson Ned Price said about the talks which were held in Tianjin, a city some 100km from capital Beijing, adding that the discussions were "frank and open".The number 2 US diplomat also affirmed the importance of cooperation in areas of global interest, such as the climate crisis, counter-narcotics, non-proliferation, and regional concerns including around the Korean peninsula, Iran, Afghanistan, and Burma, the State Department said.The two leaders also discussed ways to set terms for responsible management of the US-China relationship, it added.Sherman was in China on a two-day visit, during which she also met key officials.

According to Harrington, she conducted the research to prove or disprove MIT's theory. She studied 10 key variables, including population, industrial output, population, fertility rates, pollution levels, food production etc.Herrington concluded that the world could actually experience a "total societal collapse" by 2040. Her data was found most closely aligned with two particular scenarios from the original study: Business-as-usual (represented as BAU2) and CT (Comprehensive Technology). According to Herrington's report, which was published in the Yale Journal of Industrial Ecology, both scenarios "show a halt in growth within a decade or so from now" and indicate that continuing business as usual, that is, pursuing continuous growth, "is not possible."The KPMG researcher's study has been described in details by various publications, including Vice, The Daily Mail and Livescience. It is also available on KPMG's website.In their research, the MIT researchers had envisaged 12 scenarios, most of which projected a point at which natural resources would become so scarce that any future growth would become "impossible", and personal welfare would decline. Published in that year's bestselling book, The Limits to Expansion, the study had described the imminent "collapse" as a point which would see standards of living around the world deteriorate, for decades, and not a point which would be the "end" of the human race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mit-study-on-collapse-of-human-society-may-become-reality-says-a-new-research-101627298936281.html

He added.Infected patients who show no or mild symptoms can now be housed in community-care facilities rather than hospitals."That means that as many as 60 per cent of infected cases may recover in community-care facilities. The government aims to raise the number to 80%, with some patients even recovering at home," Wong informed.While easing the curbs, the government will closely monitor all the health outcomes, especially the hospitalisation and intensive care units in the country, Bangkok Post reported.A few months back, Singapore surfaced a sudden spike of cases in April, most likely caused by undetected imported cases, causing the government to take a couple of steps back in its re-opening process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-ease-covid-curbs-aims-to-allow-quarantine-free-travel-from-sept-101627299506641.html
26-07-2021||World||Saudi foreign minister eyes mending ties during Pakistan visit tomorrow||Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud is scheduled to visit Pakistan on Tuesday to meet the country’s leadership on bilateral and global issues, Islamabad said on Monday. The Saudi minister’s visit is aimed at boosting bilateral ties with Pakistan which has been under stress in recent times, according to a report by news agency PTI.Al Saud will be accompanied by a delegation of senior officials of the Saudi government, the Pakistan foreign office said. Al Saud’s trip follows months after Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan’s visit to Saudi Arabia in a bid to mend ties. The meeting came after Prince Bin Salman called up Khan in March and invited him for a visit.Al Saud is also expected to meet his counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi and exchange views on the entire gamut of bilateral relations along with discussions on regional and international issues. Pakistan’s ties with Saudi Arabia came under strain when Islamabad refused to send troops for the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen in 2015.Pakistan has also expressed its displeasure with the growing bonhomie between Saudi Arabia and India. Pakistan’s difference with Saudi came into open after it pulled out of a summit of Muslim leaders in Malaysia in 2019 as Saudi Arabia was not part of it. Islamabad saw it as an effort to create a rival group of non-Arab Muslim countries. It also returned $3 billion to Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the summit fallout. Qureshi also criticised the Saudi government for failing to organise a meeting of OIC foreign ministers on the Kashmir issue.“It will provide a timely opportunity to review progress in bilateral cooperation in line with the vision of the leadership of the two countries. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long-standing and historic fraternal relations, rooted deep in common faith, shared history and mutual support,” Pakistan’s foreign office said in reference to Saudi foreign minister’s upcoming visit.The visit also comes amid the worsening situation in Afghanistan where the Taliban is aiming to take control of the nation as US and NATO troops are scheduled to withdraw completely by the end of August.

Do bad things and get good results. How is that ever possible?” Xie said.The US notion of “engaging other countries from a position of strength” is just another version of the big bullying the small and “might is right”.This is pure coercive diplomacy, Xie addedThe talks took place in the backdrop of tension between the two countries over wide-ranging issues including alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong and US’s ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as interference in its internal matters.Chinese President Xi Jinping had warned US counterpart Joe Biden that confrontation between China and the US will be disastrous for both countries and the world in their first phone call in February after the latter became president in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-demonising-china-to-build-national-purpose-chinese-diplomat-101627296878153.html

The charity, which works for the welfare of children, confirmed Allen's death on its Facebook page.An experienced and veteran climber, Allen was involved in an avalanche and was rescued in 2018 when he was scaling Broad Peak, which like K2 lies also in the Karakoram Range, along the Pakistan-China border.“Rick died doing what he loved the most and lived his life with the courage of his convictions," said the charity's statement.Pakistan is home to several top mountain peaks and climbers flock from all over the world to attempt to scale the summits.Earlier this year, three climbers — Pakistani mountaineer Ali Sadpara, Jon Snorri of Iceland and Juan Pablo Mohr of Chile — died while attempting to summit the 8,611-meter (28,250-foot) high K2. Their bodies could not be traced and retrieved despite several attempts by Pakistani search and rescue team aided by the military.Last week, famous South Korean climber Kim Hong Bin fell into a crevasse and went missing in bad weather after scaling the 8,047-meter (26,400-foot) high Broad Peak. A rescue operation to try and find him has been put on hold because of bad weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scottish-climber-dies-in-avalanche-on-k2-in-pakistan-says-pakistani-official-101627289296934.html
26-07-2021||World||Covid-19: Malaysia to not extend state of emergency beyond August 1||Malaysia's government will not extend a controversial coronavirus state of emergency beyond August 1, a minister said Monday, as parliament convened after a months-long suspension that sparked widespread anger.The king in January declared the country's first nationwide state of emergency in more than half a century to fight Covid-19, following the advice of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.It allowed the government to rule by decree and suspend parliament, prompting critics to accuse Muhyiddin of using the crisis to avoid a no-confidence vote and shore up his weak coalition.Despite the emergency and a nationwide lockdown, the outbreak only worsened, fuelled by the highly infectious Delta variant. Malaysia's caseload breached the one million mark at the weekend, and there have been around 8,000 deaths.Facing mounting public anger and pressure from the king, Muhyiddin agreed to reconvene the legislature for a five-day sitting before the state of emergency officially ends next month.However, the opposition has slammed the short session as a sham that will not truly test the embattled premier's support.As lawmakers gathered in the 222-seat lower house Monday wearing masks and separated by transparent screens, Law Minister Takiyuddin Hassan announced the government would not request an extension of the state of emergency.Muhyiddin also defended his handling of the pandemic in an address to the legislature, saying he understood "the public's anxiety amid the spike in Covid cases"."The government is not sitting back and watching the public suffer -- (we are) acting to save lives."Other ministers are due to brief MPs on matters related to the pandemic.But opposition lawmakers expressed anger at not being able to debate or vote on anything during the session, pointing out the king himself had called for important issues to be scrutinised."The prime minister has acted as a traitor for not adhering to the wishes of the king," opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim told the legislature.Muhyiddin, who seized power in March last year without an election after the collapse of a reformist government, has seen his administration riven by infighting.The biggest party backing him, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), announced it was withdrawing support for his coalition earlier this month.But UMNO itself is split -- some of its MPs still back Muhyiddin -- and his position seems secure in the short term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-malaysia-to-not-extend-state-of-emergency-beyond-august-1-101627289472198.html
26-07-2021||World||Imran Khan's party wins PoK elections marred by irregularities, violence||Prime Minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party is set to form the next government in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) as it emerged as the largest political party in the legislative assembly elections in the region which was marred by allegations of irregularities and violence, local media reported, citing unofficial results.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) has won 23 seats while Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was second with eight seats and the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secured just six seats, the state-run Radio Pakistan reported.Muslim Conference (MC) and Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Party (JKPP) were successful in one seat each.However, Geo TV reported that PTI won 25 seats, followed by PPP with nine and PML-N six. One seat each was won by Muslim Conference and Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Party.Thus, PTI got a simple majority to form the government without support of any other party. It is for the first time that it will form a government in PoK.Traditionally, the ruling party in the country wins the elections in Pok.The assembly has a total of 53 members but only 45 are directly elected, while five seats are reserved for women and three are meant for the technocrats.The 45 members directly elected included 33 residents of PoK and 12 refugees’ who came over the years from Kashmir and settled in various cities of Pakistan.India has previously slammed Pakistan for its decision to hold elections in Gilgit-Baltistan and said any action to alter the status of the militarily occupied region has no legal basis.PTI Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry, who is the front-runner candidate for the 'Prime Minister' of the region, won from his seat. Former 'Prime Minister' and PML-N leader Raja Farooq Haider retained his seat. Another ex-'Prime Minister' and chief of Muslim Conference, Sardar Attique Ahmed Khan, also won.A total of 587 candidates contested the elections in 33 constituencies of various PoK districts and 121 candidates in 12 constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir refugees settled in Pakistan.Pakistan's Opposition parties, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), have accused Khan's party of "rigging" the elections held on Sunday.“There is proof of systematic rigging in the election,” PPP's vice-president Senator Sherry Rehman.She said PTI workers attacked the PPP worker during polling time, while police had uprooted a camp belonging to her party. "There is a clear difference between the voter lists of several polling stations,” she said.PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb, in a statement, claimed that to rig the election the PTI "goons" attacked her party's workers in Gujranwala's Alipur Chatha area."PTI has been allowed to engage in hooliganism with complete liberty," she said.However, the region's Election Commission rejected the allegations and said that the polls were held in a fair and peaceful manner.The chief election commission, Abdul Rashid Sulehria, told the media that he was satisfied with the election process.At least two PTI workers were shot and killed in clashes with PPP activists at a polling station in Charhoi area of Kotli district on Sunday. The two men were shot dead by unidentified persons, police said.Also, at least four soldiers were killed while three soldiers and a civilian driver were injured when their vehicle plunged down a ravine off a curvy mountain road in Laswa area of the region, the military said in a statement on Sunday.The soldiers were part of army troops deployed to help maintain peace during the elections.In another incident, five police constables were injured after Jamaat-e-Islami activists attacked them with batons at the Dhal Chakhya polling station of Jhelum valley district.A PML-N candidate Choudhary Muhammad Ismail Gujjar kicked up a storm as he threatened on Sunday that he would "seek India's help" if the local administration failed to address his concerns after his party's polling agents were removed from a polling station, the Geo News reported.Following their exit from the polling station, the agents got into a heated argument with the deputy commissioner after which the polling process was halted there.He, however, later clarified on media that his statement was directed towards the administration.Region's Secretary Election Commission Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan claimed that the elections were held in a free, fair and transparent manner.He expressed satisfaction over the law and order and appreciated the performance of the police and the Pakistan Army for ensuring the peaceful conduct of the elections, in which there were 32 lakh people eligible to vote to elect 45 members of the assembly for a five-year term.The last general election for PoK Legislative Assembly was held in July 2016 and won by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.In this election, the PTI nominated candidates for all the 45 constituencies, while PML-N and PPP each issued tickets to candidates for 44 seats. Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), the radical Islamist party which was banned in April by the Pakistan government for its violent activities, contested on 40 seats. The TLP was not de-registered by the Election Commission of Pakistan even after the ban, enabling it to take part in the elections.Apart from the ticket holders of different political parties, a total of 261 independent candidates were also in the race for the 33 constituencies in PoK, while 56 independents were running for the 12 refugees’ seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-s-party-wins-pok-elections-marred-by-irregularities-violence-101627287541598.html
26-07-2021||World||Robert Moses, American civil rights activist, dies aged 86 in Florida||Robert Parris Moses, a civil rights activist who was shot at and endured beatings and jail while leading Black voter registration drives in the American South during the 1960s and later helped improve minority education in math, has died. He was 86.Moses, who was widely referred to as Bob, worked to dismantle segregation as the Mississippi field director of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the civil rights movement and was central to the 1964 “Freedom Summer” in which hundreds of students went to the South to register voters.Moses started his “second chapter in civil rights work” by founding in 1982 the Algebra Project thanks to a MacArthur Fellowship. The project included a curriculum Moses developed to help struggling students succeed in math.Ben Moynihan, the director of operations for the Algebra Project, said Moses’ wife, Dr. Janet Moses, told him her husband passed away Sunday morning in Hollywood, Florida. Information was not given as to the cause of death."Bob Moses was a hero of mine. His quiet confidence helped shape the civil rights movement, and he inspired generations of young people looking to make a difference," said former President Barack Obama on Twitter.Moses was born in Harlem, New York, on January 23, 1935, two months after a race riot left three dead and injured 60 in the neighborhood. His grandfather, William Henry Moses, has been a prominent Southern Baptist preacher and a supporter of Marcus Garvey, a Black nationalist leader at the turn of the century.Like many Black families, the Moses family moved north from the South during the Great Migration. Once in Harlem, his family sold milk from a Black-owned cooperative to help supplement the household income, according to “Robert Parris Moses: A Life in Civil Rights and Leadership at the Grassroots,” by Laura Visser-Maessen.Moses didn’t spend much time in the Deep South until he went on a recruiting trip in 1960 to “see the movement for myself.” He sought out the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta but found little activity in the office and soon turned his attention to SNCC.“I was taught about the denial of the right to vote behind the Iron Curtain in Europe,” Moses later said. “I never knew that there was (the) denial of the right to vote behind a Cotton Curtain here in the United States.”The young civil rights advocate tried to register Black people to vote in Mississippi’s rural Amite County where he was beaten and arrested. When he tried to file charges against a white assailant, an all-white jury acquitted the man and a judge provided protection to Moses to the county line so he could leave.In 1963, he and two other activists — James Travis and Randolph Blackwell — were driving in Greenwood, Mississippi, when someone opened fire on them and the 20-year-old Travis was hit. In a press release from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Moses described how bullets whizzed around them and how Moses took the wheel when Travis was struck and stopped the car.“We all were within inches of being killed," Moses said in the 1963 press release.A reoccurring theme in Moses' life and work was the need to listen and work with the local populations where activists were trying to effect change, whether that was registering Black voters in some of the most staunchly anti-integration parts of Mississippi or years later working with students and teachers to come up with ways to improve math knowledge.In an interview with the National Visionary Leadership Project, he talked about the need for civil rights workers to earn the trust of the local population in Mississippi.“You had to earn the right for the Black population in Mississippi to decide that they were going to work with you because why should they risk everything to work with you if you were somebody or a collection of people who were just not serious?" he said.He later helped organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, which sought to challenge the all-white Democratic delegation from Mississippi in 1964. But President Lyndon Johnson prevented the group of rebel Democrats from voting in the convention and instead let Jim Crow southerners remain, drawing national attention.Disillusioned with white liberal reaction to the civil rights movement, Moses soon began taking part in demonstrations against the Vietnam War then cut off all relationships with whites, even former SNCC members.Moses worked as a teacher in Tanzania, Africa, returned to Harvard to earn a doctorate in philosophy, and taught high school math in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He later taught math in Jackson, Mississippi, while commuting back and forth to Massachusetts on the weekends.The press-shy Moses started his “second chapter in civil rights work” by founding in 1982 the Algebra Project using money he received through the MacArthur Foundation Fellows program — often referred to as “genius” grants — to improve math literacy among underserved populations. Ben Moynihan from the Algebra Project said Moses saw the work of improving mathematics literacy as an extension of the civil rights work he had started in the 1960s.“Bob really saw the issue of giving hope to young people through access to mathematics literacy.... as a citizenship issue, as critical as the right to vote has been," Moynihan said.Ernesto Cortés Jr., director emeritus and senior advisor to the Industrial Areas Foundation which helps develop community organizers, worked with Moses over four decades during which Moses would come to seminars and training. Cortés said Moses did not talk fast and was very attentive and deliberate. One of the key lessons Moses imparted was his “steadfastness” — sticking to a goal despite being repeatedly knocked down — and his generosity.“Bob always looked to develop other people, and give them recognition and give them their due,” Cortés said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robert-moses-american-civil-rights-activist-dies-aged-86-in-florida-101627276219929.html
26-07-2021||World||France passes law that makes special Covid-19 passports, vaccines mandatory||The French parliament on Monday approved a law that made special virus passports a part of daily life and vaccination mandatory for health workers as the nation continued its fight against a resurging coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. A compromise was reached between the two Houses of parliament amid massive protests against the new measures that many believe were an infringement to civil liberties.President Emmanuel Macron last week ordered that the health pass -- proof of full vaccination or a negative test -- would be required for the French to visit any public venues such as cinemas, nightclubs or even trains and planes. It initially applies to only adults, but will become mandatory for everyone above 12 years of age starting September 30. The health pass can be in paper or digital format.The law also requires all workers in the healthcare sector to start getting vaccinated by September 15 or risk suspension. The new law further says a government decree will outline how to handle vaccination documents from other nations.The rules will be applicable through November 15 depending on the pandemic situation.The bill was unveiled just six days ago. Lawmakers worked through the night and the weekend to reach a compromise version approved by the Senate on Sunday night and by the National Assembly after midnight.The new legislations are part of the Macron government’s bid to make vaccinations the top weapon against Covid-19 as new variants emerge taking a toll on the country’s health infrastructure. More than 1,11,000 people have lost their lives to the virus in France, which is registering about 20,000 new infections daily compared to just a few thousand earlier this month.Macron appealed for national unity and mass vaccination to fight the resurgent virus, and lashed out at those fueling anti-vaccine sentiment and protests.About 1,60,000 people staged protests across the country on Saturday against the special pass rule and mandatory vaccinations for health workers. Many marchers shouted “liberty!” and said the government should not tell them what to do.On a visit to a hospital in French Polynesia, Macron asked, “What is your freedom worth if you say to me ‘I don’t want to be vaccinated,’ but tomorrow you infect your father, your mother or myself?”While he said protesters are “free to express themselves in a calm and respectful manner,” he said demonstrations won’t make the coronavirus go away.He slammed “people who are in the business of irrational, sometimes cynical, manipulative mobilization” against vaccination. Among those organising the protests have been far-right politicians and extremist members of France’s yellow vest movement tapping into the anger at the Macron government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-passes-law-that-special-covid-19-passports-vaccines-mandatory-101627270463494.html

26-07-2021||World||Tunisian president suspends Parliament, fires PM; Opposition cries 'coup d'etat'||Tunisian President Kais Saied announced Sunday the suspension of parliament and dismissal of Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi following a day of protests against the ruling party, who condemned the move as a "coup d'etat".Thousands of Tunisians had marched in several cities protesting against the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party, criticising what they said were government failures in the North African nation and crippling coronavirus rates.Since Saied was elected president in 2019, he has been locked in a showdown with Mechichi and parliament speaker Rached Ghannouchi, a rivalry that has blocked ministerial appointments and diverted resources from tackling Tunisia's many economic and social problems.Car horns sounded after Saied announced parliament's suspension following an emergency meeting at his palace."The constitution does not allow for the dissolution of parliament, but it does allow for its work to be suspended," the president said, citing Article 80 which permits such a measure in case of "imminent danger".Saied said he would take over executive power "with the help" of a government headed by a new chief appointed by the president himself.He also said that parliamentary immunity would be lifted for deputies."What Kais Saied is doing is a coup d'etat against the revolution and against the constitution, and the members of Ennahdha and the Tunisian people will defend the revolution," Ennahdha wrote in a statement on its Facebook page.Earlier on Sunday in the capital, Tunis, hundreds rallied in front of parliament, shouting slogans against Ennahdha and premier Mechichi.Demonstrations were also reported in the towns of Gafsa, Kairouan, Monastir, Sousse, and Tozeur."The people want the dissolution of parliament," the crowd chanted.Several protesters were arrested and a journalist was injured when people hurled stones and police fired tear gas canisters, an AFP reporter said.Despite a decade passing since the 2011 revolution which overthrew dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia remains prone to chronic political turmoil that has stymied efforts to revive crumbling public services.The country's fractious political class has been unable to form lasting, effective governments.Tunisia has been overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases, including more than 18,000 people who have died in a country of around 12 million.Last week Mechichi fired his health minister over his handling of the pandemic, as cases skyrocketed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tunisian-president-suspends-parliament-fires-pm-opposition-cries-coup-detat-101627262205150.html

Wang’s comment, according to Chinese official media, was in response to US state department spokesperson Ned Price’s statement that Sherman’s discussions in China will be held from a “position of strength”.“The US has always put pressure on others with its self-claimed strengths in a condescending manner,” Wang was quoted as saying in the state media. “But I want to tell the US side that there is never a country that is superior to others, and there shouldn’t be one.”Much of the focus will be on Sherman’s two-day visit and talks in Tianjin, a port city some 100km from Beijing.It will be the first face-to-face talks between Washington and Beijing in months as the two negotiate acrimonious ties.Ahead of her visit, US officials told reporters in Washington that Sherman will tell Beijing that while Washington welcomes competition, it wants to ensure that ties do not veer into conflict. “She’s going to underscore that we do not want that stiff and sustained competition to veer into conflict,” a Reuters report from Washington quoted a US official as saying.“The US wants to ensure that there are guardrails and parameters in place to responsibly manage the relationship,” the official said. “Everyone needs to play by the same rules and on a level playing field.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-slams-us-before-top-diplomat-s-key-visit-101627249195968.html

Attendees carried signs and banners reading “Wake up Australia” and “Drain the Swamp”.In France, where police deployed tear gas and water cannon against some protesters, an estimated 160,000 took to the streets in nationwide protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s health pass that will drastically curtail access to restaurants and public spaces for unvaccinated people.“Freedom, freedom”, chanted demonstrators in France, carrying placards denouncing “Macron, Tyrant”, “Big Pharma shackles freedom” or saying “No to the pass of shame”.Meanwhile, around 5,000 people demonstrated in Athens, carrying placards touting slogans such as, “Don’t touch our children”, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.In Italy, protesters gathered in Rome to rally against a mandatory “green pass” for indoor dining and entertainment.Fauci warns US headed in ‘wrong direction’The US is in an “unnecessary predicament” of soaring Covid-19 cases fuelled by unvaccinated Americans and the Delta variant of the virus, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert said on Sunday. “We’re going in the wrong direction,’’ said Dr Anthony Fauci, describing himself as “very frustrated”.He said recommending that the vaccinated wear masks is “under active consideration’’. Also, booster shots may be suggested for people with suppressed immune systems who have been vaccinated, he said.UK health min says sorry for controversial remarkUK health secretary Sajid Javid, who was in self-isolation after testing positive for Covid-19, posted an update on Twitter to announce his “full recovery” but his words sparked a controversy.

The US military is set to end its mission in Afghanistan on August 31 on orders from President Joe Biden.Austin added that he believed the Afghans had the capability and the capacity to make progress, but “we’ll see what happens”.Taliban insurgents are gaining control of more and more territory, which the Pentagon estimated on Wednesday now extends to over half of Afghanistan’s district centres.4 held for rocket attacksAfghan forces have captured four Taliban fighters including a militant commander for carrying out this week’s rocket attack targeting the presidential palace in Kabul during the Eid prayers.
