On average, there were 328 new confirmed and probable cases daily over the past week, up from 208 as of June 28.That’s a far cry from spikes this year when city officials reported thousands of cases per day, and the positivity rate is below the national level of 3.4%. But the trendline is concerning, given the possibility of variants spreading in pockets of the city where fewer residents are vaccinated.“The spread of the delta variant means that it is perhaps the most dangerous time to remain unvaccinated,” Dave Chokshi, the city’s health commissioner, said at a virus briefing Monday. “That’s why we have ensured that our vaccination efforts are proceeding with as much urgency as possible.”Mayor Bill de Blasio failed at his goal of vaccinating 5 million New Yorkers by June. By mid-July, only 4.4 million New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, or 53% of the population. Meanwhile, the inoculation rate has plummeted to around 16,000 doses a day from more than 100,000 in April.Staten Island has emerged as a miniature hot spot, with its seven-day positivity rate averaging 2.34% as of July 8, well above the citywide average. The borough’s Great Kills and Silver Lake/St. George neighborhoods had the highest hospitalization rates in the city in the latest 28-day period reported, May 31-June 27.Chokshi said younger, unvaccinated people in Staten Island are a primary cause. Less than half of the population is fully vaccinated, as is the case in Brooklyn and the Bronx.About 26% of cases tested over the past 4 weeks were classified as B.1.617.2, or delta, a highly contagious variant that was first detected in India and is now the dominant strain in the U.S.De Blasio said the city was watching the data carefully, and the low hospitalization rate was a good sign. On average, about 20 patients have been hospitalized daily citywide, some of the lowest rates since the beginning of the pandemic.Nationally, the U.S. is reporting an average of about 37 cases per day per 100,000 people, with New York City at about 21. Missouri and Arkansas have the highest rates, at more than 160 per 100,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-in-nyc-rising-as-delta-variant-surges-vaccinations-slow-101626111496786.html

We receive a lot of queries from people who say they have taken one [dose] and are planning to take another one (doses). It’s a little bit of a dangerous trend here. We are in a data-free, evidence-free zone as far as mix and match,” Swaminathan said in an online briefing earlier in the day.CLARIFICATION: The WHO has clarified that public health agencies, not individuals, should make decisions on mixing and matching COVID vaccines, based on available data. We are deleting other tweets that lack context https://t.co/r3u0FKgvhb pic.twitter.com/ITjGM1PvPDMixing and matching of Covid-19 vaccines is a method of immunisation using two doses of the shot from different manufacturers. Most vaccines currently in use, including those of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, University of Oxford-AstraZeneca, Bharat Biotech as well as the Russian Sputnik V, are all required to be administered in two doses with the prescribed intervals between the shots differing for each vaccine. Sputnik V also has a single-dose vaccine named Sputnik V Lite and the jab by Johnson & Johnson is a single-dose vaccine too.Also read | 'Submitted all documents to WHO for EUL of Covaxin as of July 9': Bharat Biotech“There is limited data on mix and match. There are studies going on, we need to wait for that. Maybe it will be a very good approach. But, at the moment we only have data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, followed by Pfizer. It will be a chaotic situation in countries if citizens start deciding when and who will be taking a second, a third and a fourth dose,” she said.WHO’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the global gap in Covid-19 vaccine supply is "hugely uneven and inequitable." "Some countries and regions are actually ordering millions of booster doses before other countries have had supplies to vaccinate their health workers and most vulnerable," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.Swaminathan also stressed the need for equal distribution of the vaccine globally. “We have four countries that have announced booster programs and a few more that are thinking about it. If 11 high and upper-middle-income countries decide that they will go for a booster for their population, or even sub-groups, this will require an additional 800 million doses of vaccine,” she said.She also said that there is no scientific evidence that a booster shot is definitely needed, especially immediately after the inoculation of the two doses. Instead, she said that the medicine needs to be distributed via the COVAX program to countries that are yet to immunise their front-line workers and the elderly and the vulnerable populations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mixing-and-matching-covid-19-vaccines-dangerous-trend-who-s-chief-scientist-soumya-swaminathan-101626110838092.html

"We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime," Biden said in a statement.The unprecedented anti-government protests erupted amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union and the recent record surge in Covid-19 cases, with people denouncing shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the authorities' handling of the coronavirus pandemic. They chanted "freedom" and called for President Miguel Diaz-Canel to step down."The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected," Biden added. "The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves," he said.Diaz-Canel on Monday blamed the historic protests on what he called was the US "economic asphyxiation" and social media campaigns by a minority of counter-revolutionaries. "In the last few weeks the campaign against the Cuban revolution has increased in social media, drawing on the problems and shortages we are living," Diaz-Canel said in a televised address, according to news agency Reuters."They threw stones at foreign currency shops, they stole items ... and at police forces, they turned over cars - a totally vulgar, indecent and delinquent behaviour," he said blaming counter-revolutionaries of fomenting unrest.Diaz-Canel did not directly address the US statement but slammed what he called Washington's hypocrisy for expressing concern when it was fueling the crisis in Cuba with its trade embargo. "Is it not very hypocritical and cynical that you block me ... and you want to present yourself as the big saviour?" Diaz-Canel said. "Lift the blockade .. and then we will see what this people, that has achieved an immense social work despite what is practically a war economy, is capable of."Cuba has been under US sanctions since 1962. The US tightened the sanctions on Cuba under Donald Trump, including restricting key remittances in the middle of the pandemic.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cuba-blames-unrest-on-us-as-biden-says-he-stands-with-cubans-101626107737547.html

Miller has been the top commander in Afghanistan since his appointment to the role in 2018.Marine Gen Frank McKenzie, another four-star general, took over from Miller and would operate from the central command headquarters in Tampa, Florida. He will assume command and continue the airstrikes in defence of the Afghan forces at least until the US pulls out all its troops by August 31, the Associated Press (AP) reported.During the flag-passing ceremony at the Resolute Support headquarters at the heart of Kabul, Miller remembered the US and Nato troops along with the thousands of Afghan nationals who were killed during the war. He said he told Taliban officials that “it’s important that the military sides set the conditions for a peaceful and political settlement in Afghanistan... But we know that with that violence, it would be very difficult to achieve a political settlement,” the AP further reported.Also read | Afghanistan situation to figure at 3 meetings in Central Asian statesHamdullah Mohib, National Security Advisor of Afghanistan, said that the withdrawal of US and Nato troops has left the Afghan forces stranded on the battlefield without resupplies, the AP reported. Mohib also expressed concerns about the lack of aircraft for supporting and resupplying the troops.Following US President Joe Biden’s earlier announcement that all American troops would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021, the Pentagon said that the process is 90 per cent complete. Biden said that it was the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people to decide the future of the country. “Our military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on August 31. The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritising the safety of our troops as they depart,” Biden said on July 8. He said that his government would continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance.The Taliban have claimed that they now control 85% of the country, which has not been verified independently, news agencies reported. The Afghan government has also strongly disputed these claims and rejected another claim that the insurgents now control more than half of the country’s 400 districts.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-commander-in-afghanistan-steps-down-as-20-year-war-nears-end-101626105563443.html
12-07-2021||World||Afghanistan situation to figure at 3 meetings in Central Asian states||Three meetings to be held in the Central Asian states of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan this week will allow external affairs minister S Jaishankar to compare notes on the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan with interlocutors from several key countries. Jaishankar will visit the Central Asian states against the backdrop of growing concern in the region over the Taliban’s violent campaign aimed at capturing territory while stalling on peace talks aimed at finding a political settlement. He will visit Tajikistan during July 13-14 at the invitation of foreign minister Sirojiddin Muhriddin to participate in a meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). On the second day of the visit, he will take part in a meeting of the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan. Jaishankar will then travel to Uzbekistan to participate in a conference on regional trade, transport and connectivity in Tashkent during July 15-16. He is expected to meet several key interlocutors on the margins of the conference with the theme “Central and South Asia: Regional connectivity. challenges and opportunities”. Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi is set to attend all three events, but people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that no bilateral meeting with Jaishankar has so far been lined up. Though the main item on the agenda of the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting is the preparations for the SCO heads of states’ meeting to be held in Dushanbe during September 16-17, the people cited above said the situation in Afghanistan is expected to figure prominently in the discussions. Afghanistan has observer status with the SCO, which includes India, Kazakhstan, China, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar is expected to participate in both meetings in Dushanbe. Though the focus of the conference in Uzbekistan is on regional trade and connectivity, the presence of top leaders will provide opportunities for the Indian side to discuss the situation in Afghanistan on the margins of the meeting. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is expected to attend the meeting in Tashkent. The Uzbek government was keen to rope in the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers for the meeting in Tashkent, but the two countries will be represented by their foreign ministers. Representatives of China, Russia, Iran, the European Union and the US are also set to participate in the meeting. India has expressed strong concerns about the levels of violence in Afghanistan and Jaishankar asserted the need for a legitimate government in Kabul during a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow last week. Russia has its own concerns about the violence in Afghanistan spilling over into the Central Asian states. Tajikistan has been concerned over the worsening security situation, especially after more than 2,000 Afghan troops crossed over into its territory this month to escape assaults by the Taliban. Many of these Afghan troops have since returned to Afghanistan. Amid the drawdown of US forces in Afghanistan, the Taliban have also seized border crossings with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, which last month began a large-scale military exercise to assess the readiness of troops along the Afghan border. External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar will also participate in the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan that will meet on 14 July 2021 with the participation of the Afghanistan government. Ahead of the SCO Summit in September, several meetings of the ministers of defence, justice and finance of the member states are scheduled. Last month, national security advisers of SCO states met in Dushanbe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-situation-to-figure-at-3-meetings-in-central-asian-states-101626104210134.html
12-07-2021||World||WHO calls for all studies involving human genome editing to be made public||The World Health Organization issued new recommendations Monday on human genome editing, calling for a global registry to track “any form of genetic manipulation” and proposing a whistle-blowing mechanism to raise concerns about unethical or unsafe research.The UN health agency commissioned an expert group in late 2018 following a dramatic announcement from Chinese scientist He Jiankui that he had created the world's first gene-edited babies.In two reports Monday, WHO's expert group said all studies involving human genome editing should be made public, although the committee noted that wouldn't necessarily stop unprincipled scientists.“In the field of stem cell research, unscrupulous entrepreneurs and clinics have deliberately misused clinical trial registries by registering procedures they plan to undertake as if they were properly sanctioned clinical trials,” the group said, calling for WHO to ensure that all genetic editing research registered in their database are reviewed and approved by an ethics committee.When Chinese scientist He announced he had altered the DNA of twin babies to prevent them from catching HIV, he said the university where he worked was not aware and that he had funded the work himself. He was later sentenced to three years in jail for conducting “illegal medical practices.”WHO's expert group also said the UN agency should develop ways to identify any potentially concerning gene editing trials, saying a mechanism should be developed “for reporting violations of research integrity.”Robin Lovell-Badge of the Francis Crick Institute, one of the experts on the committee, cited several instances where scientists in Russia, Ukraine and Turkey planning controversial genetic editing experiments were pressured not to proceed and called for a more formal whistle-blowing mechanism.Still, the group acknowledged that as gene editing techniques become cheaper and easier to use, the ability of WHO to monitor such research is limited. The UN agency also has no authority to compel countries to cooperate, even during a public health emergency.During the coronavirus pandemic, for example, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has repeatedly criticized rich countries for not sharing their vaccines, warning in January that the world was on the brink of a “catastrophic moral failure.”But rich countries have made little effort to immediately share their doses with poor countries, even as Covid-19 spikes across Africa and Southeast Asia. Of the more than 3 billion vaccines that have been administered globally since then, fewer than 2% have been in poor countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-calls-for-all-studies-involving-human-genome-editing-to-be-made-public-101626097152547.html

Before the meeting a source close to the EU had said it was a priority for her to derail the new digital levy.The United States also feared that the EU plan, if proposed in July, could undermine the global deal and complicated its approval in the US Congress. Even within the Commission there was opposition, with one European official echoing the view that the new levy could hurt the broader global agreement.The EU has been trying for years to impose its own digital levy and was aiming to put its proposal forward this month to raise revenues to finance its huge economic recovery plan in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-delay-plan-for-new-levy-on-digital-services-101626089317573.html

In January WhatsApp introduced a new privacy policy, according to which, some data of the users could be shared with its parent company Facebook Inc and other firms owned by the group. However, WhatsApp also said that the changes would not affect private conversations of the users.Many users globally criticised the new policies of the company and rival messaging applications such as Telegram and Signal messenger also saw their user base expanding due to many switching from WhatsApp.Criticising this policy change, the BEUC along with eight of its members, lodged a complaint with the European Commission and the European network of consumer authorities aimed at WhatsApp for “multiple breaches of consumer rights.” The complaint focussed on how the company has left no choice for its users but to accept the changes. “The content of these notifications, their nature, timing and recurrence put an undue pressure on users and impair their freedom of choice. As such, they are a breach of the EU Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices,” the BEUC’s complaint said.Also read | WhatsApp will put policy on hold till data law is enactedAlso, it pointed out that the new terms of use have not been explained in simple and plain language by the company. “It is basically impossible for consumers to get a clear understanding of what consequences WhatsApp’s changes entail for their privacy, particularly in relation to the transfer of their personal data to Facebook and other third parties,” it said, noting that the ambiguity amounts to a breach of EU’s consumer laws.In an accompanying report with the complaint, titled ‘What’s Up With WhatsApp - an assessment of WhatsApp’s practices in the light of EU consumer protection rule,’ the BEUC said the data sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook has increased incrementally with various amendments to the privacy policy of the messaging platform by the parent company.Meanwhile, Facebook, in its response, said that the BEUC has misunderstood the purpose of the terms of service. “BEUC's action is based on a misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of the update to our terms of service,” news agency Reuters quoted a spokesperson from the company.“The update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook, and does not impact the privacy of your messages with friends or family, wherever they are in the world. We would welcome an opportunity to explain the update to BEUC to clarify what it means for people,” they further said, Reuters reported.BEUC, an umbrella group of 46 independent consumer organisations from 32 countries, urged the European network of consumer authorities and network of data protection authorities “to work in close cooperation” regarding the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-consumer-organisation-lodged-plaint-against-whatsapp-says-privacy-policy-breached-multiple-consumer-rights-101626090000500.html

The bench comprised four other senior most justices -- Dipak Kumar Karki, Mira Khadka, Ishwar Prasad Khatiwada and Dr Ananda Mohan Bhattarai -- at the apex court.President Bidya Devi Bhandari had dissolved the 275-member lower house for the second time in five months on May 22 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli and announced snap elections on November 12 and November 19.Last week, the Election Commission had announced the schedule for mid-term elections despite the uncertainty over polls.As many as 30 petitions, including one by the opposition alliance led by the Nepali Congress, were filed against the dissolution of the House by the President.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).On February 23, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House of Representatives, in a setback to embattled Prime Minister Oli who was preparing for snap polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-sc-orders-to-appoint-sher-bahadur-deuba-as-pm-within-next-28-hours-101626077841170.html

South Korea, which is currently witnessing the fourth wave of the pandemic, has so far recorded 1,69,146 cases and 2,044 deaths due to the viral disease.According to the new regulations, private social gatherings of three or more people will be prohibited after 6pm, churches and night clubs will be closed, and visitors will not be allowed at hospitals and nursing homes. All types of rallies have been banned and only family members can attend funerals and marriages.On Sunday, 1,100 people tested positive for Covid-19, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). This is the sixth consecutive day that the daily infections were above the 1,000 mark. However, the fourth wave of the pandemic has brought fewer serious cases and deaths than the earlier ones and many senior citizens along with vulnerable people have been vaccinated, news agency Reuters reported.On the other hand, health authorities and experts have warned the situation might worsen as a rising number of young patients have not been vaccinated yet and the threat of the highly infectious Delta variant is still looming.A report by the Washington Post on July 9 said that during the earlier period of the pandemic, South Korea had received global recognition for controlling the viral disease by carrying out robust testing and contract tracing and while also avoiding a strict countrywide lockdown.The report added that authorities might have given an incorrect signal to the public with the “premature lifting” of Covid-related restrictions. Choi Jae-wook, a medical professor at the Korea University in Seoul, told the Washington Post that as the delta variant of Covid-19 is spreading globally, authorities should have tightened and not eased the restrictions.The fourth level of social distancing restrictions starting Monday has also put the country’s industrial sector into an ‘emergency mode’. Industries are now focusing on reducing cases among their employees by expanding the spectrum of telework, which in simple terms means working from home, and have also upgraded their in-house quarantine guidelines, according to news agency ANI. Samsung has asked its employees to refrain from visiting karaoke, nightclubs and bars and get tested for Covid-19 before returning to work if they visited such places. LG Electronics, meanwhile, is imposing a total ban on business trips, training and external meetings.(With inputs from agencies, The Washington Post)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19south-korea-s-seoul-faces-strictest-distancing-curbs-as-virus-spreads-101626074594528.html

The storm is moving towards the direction of the earth and is expected to batter parts of the planet.According to website Spaceweather.com, the storm is approaching the Earth at a speed of 1.6 million kilometres. It originated from the Sun's atmosphere and can have a significant impact on a region of space dominated by Earth's magnetic field.Due to solar storms, the outer atmosphere of the Earth can be heated which can have a direct effect on satellites. This can cause interference with GPS navigation, mobile phone signal and satellite TV. The current in power lines can be high, which can also blow transformers.What do we know about solar storm?In May this year, millions of tons of super-heated gas shot off from the surface of the sun and hurtled 90 million miles toward Earth. The eruption, called a coronal mass ejection and when it hit the Earth’s magnetic field it triggered the strongest geomagnetic storm seen for years, reported Bloomberg.In March 1989, a solar storm over Quebec caused a province-wide outage that lasted nine hours, according to Hydro-Quebec’s website.To head off such a catastrophe, US President Barack Obama’s administration laid out a strategy to begin raising awareness of the dangers of massive solar storms and to assess the risks they pose. Last year, President Donald Trump signed the ProSwift bill into law, which aims to build up technology to improve forecasting and measurement of space weather events.How does a solar storm form?Solar storms have their roots in an 11-year cycle that shifts the polarity of the Sun’s magnetic field. The magnetic forces at work on the sun get tangled during the process and can punch out through the surface, sending the sun’s plasma into outer space and potentially triggering storms on Earth.The most powerful geomagnetic storm ever recorded resulted in the 1859 Carrington Event when telegraph lines electrified, destroying operators and setting offices ablaze in North America and Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highspeed-solar-storm-may-hit-earth-today-all-you-need-to-know-101626068079285.html
12-07-2021||World||Sydney records 112 new Covid cases as Delta outbreak worsens||Sydney recorded 112 new coronavirus cases on Monday, as the locked-down Australian city battles its largest outbreak since beating back the first wave of the pandemic more than a year ago.“We just want people to stay at home. The virus won’t spread if people don’t leave home. That is the bottom line,” New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney on Monday. At the weekend, Australia’s most-populous city recorded its first death since April after the delta-strain leaked into the local community in mid-June.The city of 6 million people has been in lockdown since June 26, and faces being increasingly isolated from the rest of the nation after Berejiklian indicated that the current stay-at-home orders may need to be extended beyond Friday. On Sunday, Victoria state implemented a hard border with its neighbor, and plans for an Australia-Singapore travel bubble have been delayed until at least the end of the year.The outbreak is highlighting the problems nation’s tardy vaccine roll-out, which has been hit by supply-chain hold-ups from contracted drug-makers amid accusations from political rivals that Prime Minister Scott Morrison failed to secure enough doses from a wide-enough range of suppliers.Alongside other so-called “Covid-zero” nations such as China and Singapore, the persistent outbreaks show the limits of Australia’s strategy to beat the pandemic with closed international borders and rigorous testing. The Labor opposition says the delta variant is responsible for more than 20 virus leaks out of the nation’s quarantine hotels.The Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker shows Australia has administered enough doses for just 17.8% of its population, compared with the U.K. with 60.4% and the U.S. with 52.2%In a bid to encourage more Australians to get the jab, Morrison’s government has launched an televised advertising campaign featuring a young female actor struggling to breath. Bill Bowtell, an adjunct professor in infectious diseases at the University of New South Wales, described the ad -- which has received a barrage of criticism on social media -- as “not honest or truthful or authentic.”Economic engine room“We are facing a terribly serious problem in Sydney -- the worst health crisis in 120 years,” Bowtell told an Australian Broadcasting Corp. interview Monday. He’s calling for tougher stay-at-home restrictions to be imposed in Sydney so the city can exit lockdown sooner, similar to what Melbourne endured last year in one of the world’s longest and most stringent lockdowns. “Businesses are being smashed. People are being laid off.”Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney, agreed that the repercussions of the lockdown to businesses were going to be serious, with New South Wales the nation’s economic engine room.“It’s going to be the longest lockdown we’ve had since Victoria back in the middle of last year,” he said in an interview Friday. “The longer they go on, the more permanent economic damage they do -- businesses having to close and people changing their behavior and it then takes longer to recover from that.”The testing, tracing and quarantining system in New South Wales, which accounts for 32% of national gross domestic product, is being heavily tested by the delta variant, HSBC Global Research said in a note on Monday.“The lockdown in Greater Sydney will weigh significantly on economic activity for as long as it is in place, at least initially mostly impacting” the third quarter, it said, adding that New South Wales Treasury estimates that each week of lockdown wipes A$850 million ($637 million) from the growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-records-112-new-covid-cases-as-delta-outbreak-worsens-101626071380326.html

12-07-2021||World||US, Canada hit by new round of scorching hot temperatures||Millions of people across the western United States and Canada were hit Sunday by a new round of scorching hot temperatures, with some roads closed, train traffic limited and new evacuations ordered.In Canada, with wildfires continuing to spread -- including 50 more blazes erupting in the past two days -- the government announced new emergency measures aimed at preventing further fires.Sweltering conditions hit much of the Pacific seaboard and as far inland as the western edge of the Rocky Mountains over the weekend."A dangerous heat wave will affect much of the western US, with record-breaking temperatures likely," the National Weather service said on its website Sunday, while Canadian meteorologists predicted highs approaching 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) in parts of western Canada -- well above seasonal norms.Las Vegas on Saturday matched its all-time record of 117 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Weather Service (NWS) -- a temperature recorded in the desert entertainment city once in 1942 and three other times since 2005.Sunday was expected to be only a few degrees cooler there, while Death Valley, California -- often the nation's hottest spot -- was headed for a high of 126 degrees Fahrenheit.Forecasters issued an excessive heat warning for several other urban centers including the southern city of Phoenix and San Jose, the center of the Silicon Valley tech industry south of San Francisco.The weekend's hot weather follows an earlier heat wave that struck the western United States and Canada at the end of June.The scorching conditions saw the all-time record daily temperature broken three days in a row in the Canadian province of British Columbia.Warming temperatures Canadian transport minister Omar Alghabra on Sunday announced new emergency measures aimed at preventing further wildfires in the tinder-dry region, including steps to slow or limit train traffic.Trains are a common cause of wildfires, often when their spark-arresting devices are poorly maintained.Several roads and highways in the area have been closed as the government rated the wildfire risk in much of the province as "extreme." A dozen towns or locales remained under evacuation orders.The Canadian government has sent investigators to the town of Lytton, 150 miles (250 kilometers) northeast of Vancouver, to see whether a passing cargo train might have caused a late June fire that destroyed 90 percent of the town.The overall death toll in British Columbia was not yet known but is thought to run into the hundreds.As of Sunday morning, the number of wildfires across British Columbia was continuing to rise, hitting 298, authorities said.In the US state of Oregon, the Bootleg Fire more than tripled in size between Friday and Sunday, gaining more than 100,000 acres, according to the US Forest Service.Last month was the hottest June on record in North America, according to data released by the European Union's climate monitoring service.Human activity has driven global temperatures up, stoking increasingly fierce storms, extreme heatwaves, droughts and wildfires.The World Meteorological Organization and Britain's Met Office said in May there was a 40 percent chance of the annual average global temperature temporarily surpassing 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures within the next five years.The past six years, including 2020, have been the six warmest on record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-canada-hit-by-new-round-of-scorching-hot-temperatures-101626056692671.html
12-07-2021||World||Sirisha Bandla becomes 3rd Indian-American woman to fly into space||Aeronautical engineer Sirisha Bandla on Sunday became the third Indian-American woman to fly into space when she joined British billionaire Richard Branson on Virgin Galactic's first fully-crewed successful suborbital test flight from the US state of New Mexico.Virgin Galactic's VSS Unity, as the spaceplane is called, took off for the 1.5-hour mission above New Mexico from the Spaceport America launch facility at 10:40 a.m. ET following a 90-minute delay due to bad weather.Bandla joined Branson and four others on board Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo Unity to make a journey to the edge of space from New Mexico. They reached an altitude of about 88 kilometers over the New Mexico desert - enough to see the curvature of the Earth. The crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness before making a gliding descent back to Earth."I am so incredibly honoured to be a part of the amazing crew of #Unity22, and to be a part of a company whose mission is to make space available to all," 34-year-old Bandla tweeted days before the flight."When I first heard that I was getting this opportunity, it was just... I was speechless. I think that that probably captured it very well. This is an incredible opportunity to get people from different backgrounds, different geographies and different communities into space," she said in a video posted on the Twitter handle of Virgin Galactic on July 6.The primary objective for Unity 22 was to serve as a test flight for future commercial passenger flights by Virgin Galactic.Bandla, who was born in Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh and brought up in Houston, was astronaut No 004 and her flight role was Researcher Experience. The other crew members were two pilots and three other crewmates, including billionaire Branson, who turns 71 in a week.She became the third Indian-origin woman to fly into space after Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams. Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma is the only Indian citizen to travel in space. The former Indian Air Force pilot flew aboard Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984, part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme.Bandla moved to the US when she was 4-year-old and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Purdue University in 2011. She finished her Master of Business Administration degree from George Washington University in 2015.Bandla wanted to be an astronaut for the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). However, her poor eyesight meant she could not meet the requirements to become a pilot or an astronaut.When she was at Purdue University, a professor told her about an opportunity in the field of commercial space flights.Virgin Galactic - the business Branson started in 2004 - aims to fly private citizens to the edge of space. The trips are designed to permit passengers to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and observe the curvature of Earth.Sunday's test flight was telecast live.The gleaming white space plane was borne with a twin-fuselage carrier jet VMS Eve (named after Branson's mother).Branson has earlier stated that the entire flight will be about 90-minutes long and can be broadly divided into four portions: ascent up to launch position, release, flight to space and glide back to Earth for a runway landing at Spaceport America.The Virgin Galactic carrier can launch up to eight people (two pilots and six passengers) on the Unity 22 flight, but on Sunday there were only six occupants (two pilots and four passengers).The four mission specialists evaluated different experiences that Virgin Galactic has promised its future customers, many of whom have already reserved trips to space with the company at USD 250,000 a seat.Bandla tested the experience of performing experiments aboard Unity during different phases of the flight, including the weightless period.This was the 22nd flight of Unity, but only its fourth launch to space.VSS Unity is the company's second SpaceShipTwo after the first, VSS Enterprise, broke apart during a 2014 test flight, killing one pilot and seriously injuring another.Virgin Galactic has made numerous safety upgrades to prevent such an accident from happening again.If one has booked a trip with Virgin Galactic early, he may get your chance to fly in space as early as 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sirisha-bandla-becomes-3rd-indian-american-woman-to-fly-into-space-101626056465092.html
12-07-2021||World||Woman infected with two variants of Covid-19 at the same time||A 90-year-old woman who died after falling ill with Covid-19 was infected with both the Alpha and Beta variants of the coronavirus at the same time, researchers in Belgium said Sunday, adding that the rare phenomenon may be underestimated.The unvaccinated woman, who lived alone and received at-home nursing care, was admitted to the OLV Hospital in the Belgian city of Aalst after a spate of falls in March and tested positive for Covid-19 the same day.While her oxygen levels were initially good, her condition deteriorated rapidly and she died five days later.When medical staff tested for the presence of any variants of concern, they found that she was carrying both the Alpha variant, which originated in Britain, and the Beta variant first detected in South Africa.“Both these variants were circulating in Belgium at the time, so it is likely that the lady was co-infected with different viruses from two different people,” said molecular biologist Anne Vankeerberghen from the OLV Hospital who led the research.“Unfortunately, we don’t know how she became infected,” she said.Vankeerberghen said it was difficult to say whether the co-infection played a role in the fast deterioration of the patient.The research, which has not yet been submitted to a medical journal for publication, is being presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases.While Vankeerberghen said in a press release that there had been “no other published cases” of similar co-infections, she added that the “phenomenon is probably underestimated due to limited testing for variants of concern and the lack of a simple way to identify co-infections with whole genome sequencing”.This is because of limited testing for variants of concern, she said, calling for an increase in the use of fast PCR testing to detect known variant mutations.Researchers have also previously found evidence of people becoming infected with multiple variants of influenza. The cases suggest co-infection might be more common than currently known.In January, scientists in Brazil reported that two people had been simultaneously infected with two different variants of the coronavirus, but the study has yet to be published in a scientific journal.In comments reacting to the research, Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick, said it was not a surprise to find an individual infected with more than one variant.“This study does highlight the need for more studies to determine whether infection with multiple variants of concern affects the clinical course of Covid-19 and whether this in any way compromises the efficacy of vaccination,” he added.Such instances also raise questions over how much protection vaccines can provide. With the rapidly spreading Delta variant now the dominant variant in many places, including the UK, drugmakers are rushing to test their shots against variants and create new versions that could provide a better defence.Countries are also mulling whether to offer booster shots this winter to guard against diminishing responses from vaccines.Belgium, like much of the European Union, faced vaccine delivery problems early in 2021 and its vaccination programme started slowly, although the EU has now delivered vaccines to cover 70% of the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-infected-with-two-variants-of-covid-19-at-the-same-time-101626049152477.html

The organisation has been identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group, the news outlet reported.It was painted in front of Palo Alto City Hall in June of 2020 following George Floyd's murder that created the Black Lives Matter movement in the US against racial injustice.He was killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes, which was captured on video footage in May 2020 and triggered nationwide demonstrations for racial justice.Later Chauvin was convicted for murdering Floyd and has been sentenced to 22.5 years in prison.Meanwhile, Molly Stump, the city's attorney, told the news outlet that Palo Alto has not been served with the lawsuit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-cops-sue-palo-alto-city-over-black-lives-matter-mural-101626049114210.html
12-07-2021||World||Covid-19: Tokyo to enter 4th state of emergency from today||Tokyo entered its fourth coronavirus state of emergency on Monday. The measure will last throughout the Olympics and end on August 22.The government has requested bars and restaurants not to offer alcohol as part of efforts to prevent infections, reported NHK World.Chief Cabinet Secretary Kato Katsunobu said on Sunday that the government will consider providing subsidies more quickly to make it easier for pub owners to cooperate.The emergency declarations and focused anti-infection measures are scheduled to continue through August 22.The duration includes the Tokyo Olympics between July 23 and August 8 and the Obon holiday period in mid-August when many people usually visit their hometowns or tourist spots, reported NHK World.The government is urging people to take thorough anti-virus measures out of concern that an increase of people's movement could spread infections. Officials are also concerned about the spread of the Delta variant.The government also extended the state of emergency for the south-western prefecture of Okinawa and intensive anti-virus measures for Tokyo's neighbouring prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa, as well as the western prefecture of Osaka, reported NHK World.The government has been pushing ahead with its vaccination drive to curb infections and reduce the risk of patients becoming seriously ill.It plans to consider lifting the emergency declaration earlier if the situation improves and the strain on the medical system is eased.Tokyo reported 614 new infections on Sunday, up 96 from a week ago.New daily cases in the capital have been up week-on-week for 22 straight days, reported NHK World.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-tokyo-to-enter-4th-state-of-emergency-from-today-101626047599142.html
12-07-2021||World||Thousands of protesters take to the streets in Cuba against vaccine shortage||Thousands of Cubans took to the streets from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in rarely seen protests, expressing frustration over economic conditions, the pace of Covid-19 vaccinations and what they said was government neglect.President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who also heads the Communist Party, blamed the United States for the unrest in a nationally televised speech on Sunday afternoon.Special forces jeeps, with machine guns mounted on the back, were seen in the capital, Havana, and Diaz-Canel called on supporters to confront “provocations."Thousands of people gathered in downtown Havana and along parts of the seaside drive amid a heavy police presence. There were a few arrests and scuffles.A Reuters reporter witnessed police pepper spray a few protesters and hit others with batons, but there was no attempt to directly confront the thousands chanting "Freedom" as they gathered and marched in the city center. Their shouts of “Diaz- Canel step down” drowned out groups of government supporters chanting "Fidel."The protests broke out in San Antonio de los Banos municipality in Artemisa Province, bordering Havana, with video on social media showing hundreds of residents chanting anti-government slogans and demanding everything from coronavirus vaccines to an end of daily blackouts.“I just walked through town looking to buy some food and there were lots of people there, some with signs, protesting,” local resident Claris Ramirez said by phone.“They are protesting blackouts, that there is no medicine,” she added.Diaz-Canel, who had just returned from San Antonio de los Banos, said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns and “mercenaries” on the ground, and warned that further “provocations” would not be tolerated.There were protests later on Sunday hundreds of miles (km) to the east in Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba, where social media video showed hundreds marching through the streets, again confirmed by a local resident.“They are protesting the crisis, that there is no food or medicine, that you have to buy everything at the foreign currency stores, and on and on the list goes,” Claudia Perez said.ECONOMIC CRISIS"We are calling on all the revolutionaries in the country, all the Communists, to hit the streets wherever there is an effort to produce these provocations," Diaz-Canel said in his broadcast remarks.The Communist-run country has been experiencing a worsening economic crisis for two years, which the government blames mainly on U.S. sanctions and the pandemic, while its detractors cite incompetence and a Soviet-style one-party system.A combination of sanctions, local inefficiencies and the pandemic has shut down tourism and slowed other foreign revenue flows in a country dependent on them to import the bulk of its food, fuel and inputs for agriculture and manufacturing.The economy contracted 10.9% last year, and 2% through June of 2021.There has been a surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths this year, with a record 6,900 cases and 47 deaths reported on Saturday.Cuba has two vaccines and has begun a mass vaccination campaign, with 1.7 million of its 11.2 million residents vaccinated to date and twice that many at various states of the three-shot process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-protesters-take-to-the-streets-in-cuba-against-vaccine-shortage-101626047064464.html
12-07-2021||World||A cosmic leap: Billionaire Branson reaches edge of space in own ship||Swashbuckling entrepreneur Richard Branson hurtled into space aboard his own winged rocket ship on Sunday in his boldest adventure yet, beating out fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos.The British billionaire is the first person to go to space in his own ship, beating the Amazon founder by nine days.The nearly 71-year-old Branson and five crewmates from his Virgin Galactic space tourism company reached an altitude of about 88km over the New Mexico desert — enough to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth — and then safely glided home to a runway landing.“It was a “complete experience of a lifetime”, a jubilant Branson said as he congratulated his team that included India-descent Sirisha Bandla on the trip aboard the sleek white space plane, named Unity.The brief, up-and-down flight — the rocket ship’s portion took only about 15 minutes, or about as long as Alan Shepard’s first US space flight in 1961 — was intended as a confidence booster for Virgin Galactic, which plans to start taking paying customers on joyrides next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-cosmic-leap-billionaire-branson-reaches-edge-of-space-in-own-ship-101626039766956.html
12-07-2021||World||Wildfire pushing California toward the brink of blackouts||A wildfire raging uncontrollably across southern Oregon has knocked out three electrical lines so critical to the stability of grids in the western U.S. that California has warned of rotating blackouts and Nevada faced a power emergency.The fast-moving Bootleg fire crippled a key transmission system known as the California Oregon Intertie that the Golden State has depended on for years for electricity imports.Making matters worse: The takedown of the intertie has had a knock-on effect on another key import hub known as the Pacific DC Intertie that brings in electricity from the Pacific Northwest, California’s grid operator said in a media briefing Saturday. In all, California has lost 5,500 megawatts of power-import capacity -- enough to light up roughly 4.13 million homes.After days of pushing state residents to conserve energy with the risk of rolling blackouts, the grid operator said conditions are expected to be stable with no flex alert planned Sunday -- for now. The transmission lines knocked out by the Bootleg fire are still out of service, affecting power supplies.The fact that a single wildfire has brought America’s most populous and affluent state to the brink of blackouts is among the most powerful demonstrations yet of how vulnerable the world’s power grids have become to the effects of climate change.Extreme heat, drought and dry conditions globally have shrunk hydropower reserves, driven up electricity demand to record levels and touched off some of the worst wildfire seasons in modern history.Climate change is “forcing us to do things we never imagined” at this time of the year, said Elliot Mainzer, who took over as chief executive officer of grid manager California Independent System Operator nine months ago. The agency is “anticipating what could be a very long and hot summer,” he said.California has emerged as the epicenter of climate disasters in the U.S. Wildfires burned an unprecedented 4.3 million acres across the state last year, killing 33 people and scorching nearly 10,500 structures.In August, California suffered its first rolling blackouts since the U.S. West energy crisis two decades ago because of extremely hot weather. And in a foreshadowing of what was to come: Days before this year’s summer officially began, high temperatures forced the California ISO to make an unusually early call for conservation, allowing the region to duck another round of rotating outages.“Bottom line is we took everything we learned from last summer, and we still came into this summer thinking our issues were going to primarily be associated with August and September,” Mainzer said, but “we had the first major heat wave four days before the official beginning of summer.”On Friday evening, the grid operator took the rare step of ordering a Stage 2 emergency -- one step away from rotating blackouts -- to cope with the loss of import capacity. Energy conservation helped the state avert a crisis. But as temperatures rose yet again and supplies fell off the grid Saturday, Mainzer said, “We’re going to need more. Honestly, I think we are going to need more response than we saw last night.”The grid operator issued an all-clear at about 9 p.m. local time Saturday. Earlier in the day, Governor Gavin Newsom also signed an order to free up more energy capacity to help alleviate the supply crunch.California wasn’t the only state facing power woes. Nevada’s power system was among those in the region that also faced emergency levels on Friday evening, said Mark Rothleder, California’s ISO’s chief operating officer. On top of managing California’s grid, the agency serves as a reliability coordinator and is responsible for monitoring conditions across the western region.Nevada utility NV Energy Inc. said it wasn’t forced to resort to blackouts, but the company was calling for customers to conserve over the weekend.Exactly when the Bootleg fire would subside enough to re-energize the California Oregon Intertie remains to be seen. Mainzer said it was possible the lines would return to service on Sunday at midnight local time, but the grid operator was operating under the assumption that the system would remain down.The Bootleg fire had burned through 76,897 acres of southern Oregon and zero percent of it was contained as of Saturday afternoon, forcing evacuations in Klamath County and shutting sections of a national forest, according to an update from the U.S. Fire Service. Meanwhile, the agency said, it has no timeline available for the restart of the intertie lines.Temperatures across California were forecast to remain high into Sunday, with Sacramento set to reach 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius), before cooling down slightly Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wildfire-pushing-california-toward-the-brink-of-blackouts-101626036009111.html

It’s partly driven by the more transmissible Delta variant and partly by increased social mixing with the easing of lockdown rules. New cases now stand at over 34,000 a day.Yellen ‘very concerned’US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said on Sunday she was “very concerned” about the risk that new variants could pose to the global economic recovery from the pandemic.“We are very concerned about the Delta variant and other variants that could emerge and threaten recovery,” she told reporters following a G20 meeting in Venice. “We are a connected global economy, what happens in any part of the world affects all other countries.”In Thailand, beauty contestants who took part in a pageant last month could face criminal charges for not wearing masks, police said on Sunday, after a cluster of 22 infections emerged from the event.Thirteen contestants and nine others associated with the Miss Grand Samut Sakhon pageant, which was held at a Bangkok venue late June, have tested positive for the virus, officers said.Thailand is grappling with a deadly third wave of Covid-19 infections with 9,539 new cases announced on Saturday and 86 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-masks-now-expected-beyond-july-19-101626030429410.html

This has led to conflict, war, terrorism, refugees, among other complications that still persist today,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. “The US, in disregard of its responsibilities and obligations, hastily withdrew from Afghanistan, leaving a mess and turmoil to the Afghan people and regional countries.”Separately, Pakistan-based News International has reported that Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi is set to discuss the Afghan security situation with counterparts from Russia, India, Pakistan and several Central Asian countries at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation next week.Anti-missile system set up at Kabul airportAfghan authorities said on Sunday that they have installed an anti-missile system at Kabul’s main airport to counter incoming rockets, as the Taliban pressed on with a blistering offensive across the country.Washington and its allies are due to end their military mission in Afghanistan at the end of next month, even as the insurgents claim that they now control 85% of the country’s soil.“The newly installed air defence system has been operational in Kabul since 2am on Sunday,” the country’s interior ministry said. “The system has proven useful in the world in repelling rocket and missile attacks.”Afghan security forces spokesman Ajmal Omar Shinwari said the system was given by “our foreign friends”. “It has complicated technology. Our foreign friends are operating it while we are trying to build the capacity to use it,” he said.The Taliban fighters have been regularly launching rockets at government forces across Afghanistan.‘Pakistan can facilitate peace, not guarantee it’Pakistan said it is prepared to deal with the spillover effect it may face in case a civil war unfolds in Afghanistan, the country’s army spokesman said, insisting that Islamabad is only a “facilitator” of the Afghan peace process, not a “guarantor”.“Pakistan is only a facilitator of the Afghan peace process, not a guarantor,” Babar Iftikhar told ARY News. “Pakistan has no favourites among the Afghan stakeholders. The Afghans have to choose their leadership.”He said Pakistan was well aware that the situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating and that measures were taken to deal with it. He also said the security on the border has been tightened. Over 90% of the 2,611km border has been fenced. Pakistan is “very well prepared” to handle the current situation, the spokesperson said, adding that there were fears of a fresh wave of Afghan refugees heading towards Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blames-us-for-afghan-crisis-101626030047818.html
