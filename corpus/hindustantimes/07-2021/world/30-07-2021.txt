Johnson & Johnson Inc has not yet requested full approval for its one-dose Covid-19 shot.Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the White House, said full approval by the FDA could also help spur more Americans to get the Covid-19 vaccine as it might reduce their fears about the safety of the shot and make local officials more comfortable about implementing vaccine mandates."Given what we've been through now and the number of months that have gone by since the (emergency use authorization), I would hope that within the very reasonable period of time in the future we'll see that. I hope as we get into the middle of August that we're almost there," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-hopes-us-regulators-fully-approve-covid-19-shots-by-midaugust-101627665794591.html

Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan.UNAMA said no U.N. personnel were hurt in the incident.Herat city is the second provincial capital the Taliban have entered in the last 24 hours. Insurgents entered the capital of the southern province of Helmand a day earlier, and clashes are under way there. Civilians rushed to evacuate the city."Since Thursday morning the Taliban have launched attacks from several directions on Lashkargah city," a government official told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. Lashkargah is the capital of Helmand, a southern province bordering Pakistan.With U.S.-led foreign forces nearing a complete withdrawal of troops, the Taliban have made swift territorial gains over the last two months but have not yet captured any provincial capitals.A United Nations report this week said civilian casualties had been surging in recent weeks in Afghanistan, with as many killed in May and June as in the previous four months. The report did not cover casualties in July, when fighting has intensified further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-headquarters-attacked-in-western-afghanistan-at-least-one-guard-killed-101627663164754.html

Official explains||Russia on Friday blamed a “short-term software failure” for an incident that threw the International Space Station (ISS) out of control after a research module was docked. The ISS was knocked off its course due to an unplanned firing of jet thrusters of the Russian research module Nauka, causing “loss of attitudinal control” that lasted for a little more than 45 minutes, according to the manager of Nasa's space station program.Vladimir Solovyov, designer general at Energia, a Russian space agency company, said in a statement that a direct command was “mistakenly implemented” to activate the thrusters of the multipurpose laboratory module, turning on the engines for withdrawal. He said that the software failure led to “some modification of the orientation of the complex as a whole.”"The crew is now busy balancing the pressure in the Nauka module. In the afternoon, the crew will open the hatches, enter the module, turn on the necessary means of purifying the atmosphere and begin normal regular work," Solovyov added.On Thursday, Nasa assured that ground teams had regained attitude control and the motion of the space station was stable. The ground teams restored the attitudinal control and orientation of the space station by activating thrusters on another module attached to it. Quoting Nasa specialists at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, Russian state-owned news agency RIA described the struggle to regain control of the space station as a “tug of war” between two modules.The US space agency stressed that the seven crew aboard the ISS were never in any immediate danger. The malfunction, however, prompted Nasa to postpone the launch of the Boeing Starliner spacecraft until August 3.Currently, three Nasa astronauts, two Russian cosmonauts, a Japanese astronaut and a European space agency astronaut from France are onboard the space station."Dear friends, I’m reading your numerous comments. Don’t worry! Our work at the International Space Station to integrate the newly arrived Nauka module continues! Tonight we are going to open the hatches. Will keep you posted!" tweeted Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky, who is onboard the ISS.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-russian-module-nauka-knocked-space-station-out-of-control-official-explains-101627660977332.html

According to on-site monitoring and an expert assessment, the unit’s performance indicators, including the radioactivity of the primary reactor coolant, remain within the range of normal conditions and technical specifications.By the end of 2020, China had 49 operational nuclear power units with more than 51 gigawatts of installed nuclear power capacity, the third-largest globally, the China Nuclear Energy Association (CNEA) told state media in June.Nuclear power makes up around 5% of the country’s total generation, compared with 70% in France, 19% in the United States and 12% in Germany, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported.The CNEA predicts that China will surpass France as the world’s second-biggest nuclear power generator in 2022 and overtake the United States four years after that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nuclear-reactor-shut-down-in-southern-china-over-fuel-rod-damage-101627659072643.html

Announcing the decision, Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah told a press conference that Karachi, the largest city of Pakistan, will be the focus during the partial lockdown because of its “serious situation.”In the last 24 hours, Pakistan reported nearly 4,500 new Covid-19 cases and 86 related deaths, of which 14 deaths were reported from Karachi. Health experts have warned that Eid-al-Adha, the Muslim holiday, and elections held in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) could prove as superspreader events.The Delta variant, first detected in India, is believed to be responsible for Pakistan’s fourth Covid wave. Citing data from Aga Khan University Hospital, Shah said that there is almost 100% prevalence of the Delta variant in Karachi."If you help us, we will be able to contain the spread of this disease. People are asking what will happen after August 8. We have to take measures so that our hospital facilities are not choked," the provincial chief minister said.The announcement came a day after Pakistan’s federal government banned staff from entering public offices, schools, restaurants, transport, shopping malls and air travel without vaccination certificates despite low vaccination coverage. Less than 3% of Pakistan’s population has been fully vaccinated against coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“I know, people will not be comfortable with lockdown, but it is inevitable we have to bring the numbers down,” Shah added.According to the lockdown guidelines issued by the chief minister’s office, restaurants will be allowed only for delivery and no takeaway or dine-in will be permitted. There won’t be any restriction on the movement of citizens but inter-city travel will be banned. All markets will remain closed except pharmacies and grocery stores, that too only till 6pm. While health facilities including vaccination centres will remain open, all government offices will be closed during the week.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-spread-forces-partial-lockdown-on-karachi-pakistan-s-largest-city-101627655970639.html
30-07-2021||World||Delta variant as contagious as chickenpox: Report||The Delta variant of the coronavirus causes more severe illness than the earlier versions and it is as contagious as chickenpox, several US media outlets have reported citing an internal document prepared by the top American health agency.The Washington Post, which first reported these findings, said the internal document makes the case for health officials to “acknowledge the war has changed”.The report prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is based on outside studies and unpublished data from outbreak investigations, shows the Delta variant jumps from people to people more swiftly than the viruses that cause Ebola, MERS, SARS, the common cold, the seasonal flu and smallpox. It is as contagious as chickenpox, according to news reports citing the CDC document.The document indicates vaccinated people, though protected from severe illness, can transmit the Delta virus as much as the unvaccinated. If infected, vaccinated people were found carrying the same amount of measurable viral load as those unvaccinated and it was this finding, the news reports suggested, that was behind the CDC’s course-reversal on masks.The health agency changed its two-month-old guidance allowing vaccinated people to do without masks and issued a new recommendation calling for the use of face coverings in certain high-risk conditions earlier this week.The US is witnessing a surge in new infections, with about 70,000 every day. And the CDC believes vaccinated people are also spreading the virus, although at a far lesser intensity than those unvaccinated. The data shows there are roughly 35,000 symptomatic infections per week among 162 million vaccinated Americans, the New York Times reported on the basis of the CDC document.The internal document recommends vaccinated people with weak immune systems must wear masks even in low-risk conditions and so should vaccinated people who come in contact with children or older adults, according to the NYT report.But the current masking guidance is unlikely to be enough and the CDC report said, “Given higher transmissibility and current vaccine coverage, universal masking is essential.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-as-contagious-as-chickenpox-report-101627656131078.html

The nine countries include Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.The Philippines had earlier imposed the travel ban on India on April 29 which was extended. On July 14, the government further extended the travel ban on India along with Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the UAE, and Oman till July 31, according to news agency PTI.Also Read| Philippines reports first locally transmitted cases of Delta variantHarry Roque, the Presidential spokesperson for President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, said on Friday the current travel ban will be in place from August 1 till August 15. The orders came after President Duterte expressed concerns over the Delta variant, according to a report by Manila TimesThe Philippines has so far reported 216 cases of the Delta variant, which was first discovered in India in October 2020. However, experts pointed out there might be more unidentified cases due to the sluggish pace of the country’s genome sequencing capacity, PTI reported. Two weeks back, the country reported its first locally transmitted cases of the variant.The government on Friday also imposed a lockdown in the Manila capital region from August 6-20 to curb the spread of the Delta variant. The capital region covers 16 cities and is home to over 13 million people. “While it is a painful decision, this is for the good of all,” Presidential spokesperson Roque was quoted as saying by Reuters.Also Read| Philippines to impose lockdown in Manila to curb Covid-19 Delta variant spreadAs per the lockdown rules, people will not be allowed to step outdoors except for shopping for essential items.

On Friday, the country saw 8,562 new cases, the highest single day spike in two months.Amid the spread of the Delta variant, President Duterte urged those citizens who do not want to be vaccinated to stay at home as they are a “walking spreader”. “If you go out, I will tell the police to escort you back to your house because you are a walking spreader,” he added, according to the Manila Times report.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-extends-travel-ban-on-india-9-other-nations-due-to-delta-variant-101627651265745.html
30-07-2021||World||Rights groups warn assaults on women on the rise in Pakistan||Noor Mukadam's last hours were terror-filled. Beaten repeatedly, the 27-year-old jumped from a window but was dragged back, beaten again and finally beheaded. A childhood friend has been charged with her killing.The gruesome death last week in an upscale neighbourhood of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, is the latest in a series of attacks on women in Pakistan, where rights activists say such gender-based assaults are on the rise as the country barrels toward greater religious extremism.Mukadam was the daughter of a diplomat, and her status as a member of the country's elite has shone a spotlight on the relentless and growing violence against women in Pakistan, said prominent rights activist Tahira Abdullah.But the majority of women who are victims of such violence are among the country's poor and middle classes, and their deaths are often not reported or, when they are, often ignored.“I could give you a list longer than my arm, only in one week” of attacks against women, said Abdullah. “The epidemic of sexual crimes and violence against women in Pakistan is a silent epidemic. No one sees it. No one is talking about it.”Still, Pakistan's Parliament this month failed to pass a bill that seeks to protect women from violence in the home, including attacks by a husband. Instead, it asked an Islamic ideology council to weigh in on the measure — the same council that previously said it was OK for a husband to beat his wife.Data collected from domestic violence hotlines across the country showed a 200% increase in domestic violence between January and March last year, according to a Human Rights Watch report released earlier this year. The numbers were even worse after March, when COVID-19 lockdowns began, according to the report.In 2020, Pakistan was near the bottom of the World Economic Forum's global gender index, coming in at 153 of 156 countries, ahead of only Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan, which held the last spot despite billions of dollars spent and 20 years of international attention on gender issues there.Many of the attacks in Pakistan are so-called honor killings, where the perpetrator is a brother, father or other male relative. Each year, more than 1,000 women are killed in this way, many of them unreported, say human rights workers.“The authorities have failed to establish adequate protection or accountability for abuses against women and girls, including so-called 'honor killings' and forced marriage,” according to the HRW report.Rights groups have been sharply critical of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and his government, saying he panders to the religious right and excuses the perpetrators of attacks on women.A former cricket star who has married three times, Khan once had a reputation as a womanizer but has now embraced a conservative Islam. He keeps close ties with a religious ceric who blamed COVID-19 on “the wrongdoing of women."He once appeared to blame women for attacks by men saying, “if you raise temptation in society ... all these young guys have nowhere to go, it has consequences in the society.”His information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, says Khan's statements have been taken out of context and denied violence against women is on the rise, without offering evidence. He said his government encourages women in politics and sports and in provinces where Khan's party dominates human rights legislation has been strengthened.“I think this perception is not really close to reality, that in Pakistan women are not safe or maybe that there's a misogyny in practice in Pakistan,” Chaudhry said in an interview.Yet last week, one of Khan's Cabinet ministers, Ali Amin Gandapur, told a rally of thousands of mostly male supporters, that he would “slap and slap” a female opposition political leader.Last September, a senior police officer blamed a woman who was ambushed and gang raped in front of her two children, saying she should not have been travelling at night and without a man.Such remarks reflect an increase in ultraconservative and even extremist religious values in Pakistan, said Amir Rana of the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies.The country has seen an explosion of religious organizations and religious political parties, many with extreme beliefs, said Rana, whose organization tracks and documents extremism in Pakistan.These organizations have tremendous reach in most cities and towns, where they provide services from education to health care, and thus have extensive ability to influence social values, said Rana.The history of religious extremism in Pakistan is complicated, and Chaudhry, the information minister, argued that America shares responsibility for the role it played in the region in the 1980s.At that time, Pakistan's military dictator aided by the U.S. used religious fervor to inspire Afghans to fight an invading Soviet Union. Many of those Afghans ended up in Pakistan as refugees.“And very conveniently now, the US media and US authorities ... blame everything on Pakistan and have left the region," he said.But Abdullah, the rights activist, said Pakistan cannot shirk its own responsibility, noting that same dictator, Gen. Mohammad Zia-ul Haq, introduced Islamic laws that, among other things, reduced women's rights to inheritance, limited the value of their testimony in court and made reporting a rape almost impossible by requiring four male witnesses.In Mukadam's assault, police have charged Zahir Jaffar, the son of a wealthy industrialist, with murder. Initial reports say she was killed after spurning his marriage proposal. It's not clear whether Jaffar has a lawyer.The brutality of the assault — the attacker used so-called brass knuckles — and the fear that his high social status means he could be freed, galvanized many in Pakistan to speak out. They have held protests and a candlelight vigil and launched a social media campaign #justicefornoor to preempt attempts to use influence and money to whisk the accused out of the country.In one petition circulating online, the author demanded the country's judicial system “hold perpetrators of violence responsible. We demand justice. We demand it swiftly. We demand it for Noor. We demand it for all women.”Zarqa Khan, a student who attended a candlelight vigil for Mukadam, bemoaned how religion now pervades so much of life in Pakistan and how today she fears walking alone on the streets.“I just didn't feel safe outside anymore,” said Khan. “And that shouldn't be the scenario.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rights-groups-warn-assaults-on-women-on-the-rise-in-pakistan-101627634748744.html

An increase in radiation inside Unit 1 reactor of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant had sparked fears of a leak, according to a CNN report."After lengthy conversations between French and Chinese technical personnel, Taishan Nuclear Power Plant ... decided to shut down Unit 1 for maintenance," China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) said in an online statement.The Taishan Nuclear Power Plant, owned by CGN and Electricite de France (EDF), began commercial operation in December 2018. EDF had warned of an “imminent radiological threat” after damage to fuel rods, reported CNN citing a letter to the US department of energy.Also Read | 5 fuel rods broken in Taishan nuclear power plant, no radiation leak: ChinaIn the letter, the French power company reportedly accused the Chinese safety authority of raising the acceptable level of radiation outside the power plant, a report denied by the Chinese government.

It also downplayed the damage saying it was a “common phenomenon” and the damaged fuel rods accounted for “less than 0.01 percent" of the 60,000 fuel rods in the reactor.After China’s admission of minor damage to the plant, a spokesperson for EDF told CNN that it was a "serious situation that is evolving."

He said that this decision was made after “considerable research and analysis” and that its information would be shared around the world.″The only way we can defeat Covid is together. Together means sharing information. Together means sharing methods, technologies, insights, and actionable steps,″ said Bennet said Friday.More than 57% of the country’s 9.3 million citizens have received both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and over 80% of the population over 40 is vaccinated.Neither the US nor the EU has approved coronavirus booster shots, and the World Health Organization said earlier this month that there is not enough evidence to show that a third dose is needed.Most studies — and real-world data from Britain and the US — so far show that the Pfizer vaccine remains powerfully protective against serious illness. Just Wednesday, Pfizer released data from its long-running 44,000-person study showing that while protection against any symptomatic infection declined slightly six months after immunization, protection against severe Covid-19 remained at nearly 97%. Earlier this month, Israel’s Health Ministry announced that protection against severe disease was around 93%.Israel has carried out one of the world’s quickest and most successful vaccination campaigns. They reached a deal with the pharmaceutical company, Pfizer, to purchase enough vaccines for its population in exchange for sharing its data with the drugmaker.The vaccination program allowed Israel to reopen its economy before other countries. The Israeli government had planned to reopen the country to vaccinated tourists in July but has pushed the date back following concerns over the rise in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-israel-administers-booster-shots-of-vaccine-to-citizens-over-60-101627643581956.html

The study came at a time when nearly 60% of citizens in Europe have received at least one dose of the vaccine.Probability of a vaccine-resistant variantA pan-European team of experts studied the chances of a vaccine-resistant strain of the coronavirus emerging in a population of 10 million people over three years. The study was done to predict how the SARS-CoV-2 might mutate in response to vaccination campaigns.Many variables such as vaccination, mutation and transmission rates, including recurring "waves" of infections and the fall in cases in response to lockdowns were considered for the study.As expected, the model showed that a faster pace of vaccination would reduce the risk of the emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain.Also read | Fourth wave of Covid-19 hits Middle East, WHO sounds alarm over delta variantHowever, the authors also said that the risk of a resistant strain emerging was the highest when a large proportion of the population was vaccinated but not large enough to achieve herd immunity. They called this scenario “counter-intuitive.” The authors also said that their model estimated a threshold of 60% population being vaccinated after which, the vaccine-resistant variants appeared more likely to emerge.Co-author of the study Simon Rella from the Institute of Science and Technology, Austria, said that the vaccines are the “best bet” to beat the Covid-19 pandemic. “What our model showed is that when most people are vaccinated, the vaccine-resistant strain has an advantage over the original strain. This means that the vaccine-resistant strain spreads through the population faster than the original strain at a time when most people are vaccinated,” Rella said in an online briefing.The authors, based on the results of the study, urged policymakers and individuals to consider keeping the measures in place throughout the entire vaccination process.Delta variantEurope, which is now witnessing the rapid spread of the Delta Covid-19 variant, is currently in a similar scenario, where 60% of the population is vaccinated. In the US too, where 60% of adults are fully vaccinated, the conditions appear similar. Also, 80% of new cases of Covid-19 in the US were due to the Delta variant. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday recommended wearing a face mask indoors for vaccinated people too, in areas where the prevalence of the Delta variant was higher.While the Delta variant is significantly more infectious than the original variant, there is little evidence currently to suggest that it is more deadly.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dropping-face-masks-social-distancing-rules-may-trigger-new-vaccine-resistant-covid-19-variants-study-101627643796057.html
30-07-2021||World||China seizes locally made maps showing Aksai Chin, Arunachal in India||Chinese customs recently seized a large consignment of locally manufactured world maps, which showed Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh as part of India.China claims the north-eastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet and occupies the India-claimed Aksai Chin region, mostly as part of the southwest Hotan county of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).The consignment, worth some $600, was confiscated during a check by the customs department at the Shanghai Pudong international airport.At least 300 packages to be exported as “bed covers” were pulled out of the express channel for closer inspection during the check-up, a report on the website, ThePaper.com said.It was found that the maps on the “bed covers” showed Arunachal and Aksai Chin as Indian territories as Indian maps show.The goods were immediately seized as they violated legal provisions regulating how Chinese maps should be drawn, the report said.The regulations are stipulated under China’s State Council, or cabinet’s “Regulations on the Management of Map Drawing and Publication”.The regulations say Chinese maps should not show content that endangers national unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.The brief article did not mention the identity of the manufacturer or where the maps were to be exported. The consignment of cloth material is likely to be destroyed and the manufacturing company is expected to be heavily fined and censured.Commenting on the report, angry Chinese netizens demanded that the company should be shut down immediately and called on the authorities to punish the owner.In March, 2019, nearly 30,000 world maps showing Arunachal Pradesh as a part of India and Taiwan as a separate country were destroyed by customs authorities in the city of Qingdao in the eastern province of Shandong.“A total of 803 boxes with 28,908 wrong maps were seized and destroyed, the largest amount to be disposed of in recent years,” the province’s Natural Resources ministry said; the maps were taken to a secret location and shredded.China is particularly sensitive to the depiction of Arunachal Pradesh as a part of Indian territory and even opposes the visit of Indian leaders to the state.Last week, China criticised the channel NBC Universal for showing an “incomplete map” of the country in its broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony after a map displayed during the arrival of Chinese athletes did not include Taiwan or the South China Sea.The display “hurt the dignity and emotions of the Chinese people”, the Chinese consulate in New York said in a social media post on its official Weibo social media account.“Maps’ references to self-ruled Taiwan and the disputed South China Sea have stirred controversy in recent years, with Johns Hopkins University last year reversing a decision to show Taiwan as part of China on a map indicating the spread of the coronavirus,” Reuters said in a recent report.China’s sensitivity over territorial claims doesn’t stop at maps.In 2018, India’s national carrier Air India changed the name of Taiwan to Chinese Taipei on its website after China raised concerns about Taiwan being described as a separate region by various airlines worldwide.Air India was among 40 international airlines to do so.Also, last year, the US clothing company GAP had to apologise for selling T-shirts with a map of China which didn’t show Taiwan or the South China Sea.The international hotel chain Marriott had its Chinese website briefly blocked for listing the Tibet Autonomous Region, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau as separate countries in a questionnaire for customers in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seizes-locally-made-maps-showing-aksai-chin-arunachal-in-india-101627643590458.html

The Taliban with Pakistan fighters within ranks have suffered heavy casualties in these attacks.The action against the Sunni Pashtun insurgent group also includes keeping the important highways of the country safe. The Afghanistan government has stepped up the security of Maymana-Aqina, Hairatan–Kabul-Torkham, Spin Boldak-Kandahar city-Lashkarga and Islam Qala-Herat highways to ensure free movement of security forces.The ANDSF cleared several villages along the highway of insurgents and defused at least nine improvised explosive devices or IEDs according to inetlligence reports from Afghanistan. They also foiled an attack on India-built and funded Salma Dam in Herat, in which a number of Taliban fighters were killed and five others injured.The security cover of Kabul and other important cities, including Mazar-e-Sharif, Jalalabad, Kandahar city and Herat, has also been increased.The local leaders are encouraging the people to raise arms against the Taliban. Daikundi-based Shia cleric, Ayatullah Wahizada, has even issued a fatwa to motivate people to do so.The US forces, till the time they are in Afghanistan, are helping the ANDSF eliminate Taliban terrorists. A number of air strikes - both using manned and unmanned strike platforms - has killed key Taliban leaders, the highest (81) in Shiberghan. The US forces have conducted air strikes in Kandahar and Helmand.The Taliban have condemned the US air strikes with their spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid warning of "consequences".The Afghan security forces has also killed Pakistani military officials, which points to the fact that Pakistan is actively supporting the Taliban in their endeavours. According to Afghan Army 209 Corps, a Pakistan army officer named Javed was killed by intelligence agency officers. They said that Javed was leading the Taliban in Logar, Paktia, and Paktika provinces.A protest march were held in Pakistan's South Waziristan (in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province) on Tuesday to express solidarity with Afghan citizens and oppose the undeclared war against Afghanistan from Pakistani side in which several innocent people have been killed. The march was organised by the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) whose chief Manzoor Pashteen said that the war in Afghanistan has kept the entire region in poverty and stagnation.Meanwhile, Commander of the US Central Command (CENTCOM) General Kenneth F McKenzie recently met Afghanistan president Ashraf Ghani to discuss the security situation. After the meeting, he said that the US was prepared to continue air strikes against the terrorists. He termed the battle for Kandahar a "tough fight", and emphasised that while the city had not fallen yet, it’s control was 'critical' for both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/buoyed-with-us-air-strikes-afghan-security-forces-push-back-taliban-101627641279016.html
30-07-2021||World||Pakistan reluctant to take back fighters captured in Syria||An international effort to repatriate Pakistan fighters captured by Kurdish groups in northern Syria has run into problems because of Islamabad’s reluctance to acknowledge their nationality or give guarantees about their safety, people familiar with developments said on Friday. The effort was made through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to repatriate at least four Pakistani captured fighters caught by Kurdish forces while fighting for the Islamic State in northern Syria, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Also Read | Imran Khan must stop human rights violations in PoK: JKNAPHowever, there was an impasse between ICRC and Pakistan authorities over formalities related to the repatriation process. The Pakistani side has been reluctant to acknowledge or confirm the identity of the Pakistani fighters and other civilians being held in camps run by Kurdish groups, the people said. Another point of contention has been the requirement of a sovereign guarantee for the safety of repatriated foreign fighters and prisoners and the Pakistani side has been unwilling to commit to this, the people added. Over the years, the Pakistan government has denied reports that fighters from the Pakistani Taliban and other groups had gone to Syria to fight alongside Sunni rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad or with the Islamic State. Any acknowledgement of the presence of Pakistani fighters in Syria at this stage would be a potential source of embarrassment for Islamabad. According to a confidential report, there have been around 21 Pakistani nationals, including civilians, detained in camps run by Kurdish groups in northern Syria since June last year. Some of the detainees are women. Pakistan is among very few countries from which both Shia and Sunni fighters have gone to Syria. The Liwa Zainebiyoun, a pro-government militia in Syria has attracted Shia Muslims from north and northwest Pakistan, primarily Kurram district and Gilgit-Baltistan, since 2013. Several dozen Shia fighters have died in combat in Syria. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed to have sent its men to fight with rebels in Syria, and there were of these fighters setting up a base in Syria with the help of Arabs who earlier fought in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Taliban was helped in these efforts by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a notorious anti-Shia terror group. There were also reports of some 50 Pakistani fighters being killed in action by the Turkish Army and Syrian forces in northwest Syria in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-reluctant-to-take-back-fighters-captured-in-syria-101627637531141.html

Thursday's announcement represents a sizable shift as the White House tries to convince more people to get vaccinated as Covid-19 cases rise due to the spread of the delta variant, The Hill reported.A growing number of businesses have elected to mandate vaccines for employees as a condition of returning to in-person work. Several private colleges have done the same for their students.According to the White House, the federal government will ask employees and onsite contractors to attest to their vaccination status. Those who do not show that they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 will need to mask, socially distance and submit to weekly or twice weekly coronavirus testing. Their work travel will also be restricted.The Hill quoting Public health experts reported that the new mandate could help drive up vaccination rates by setting a model for other businesses at a time when the delta variant."We're at the point where some use of mandates is really important," said Harold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Health Lab.The federal government employs over four million people. It's unclear what percentage of the workforce is currently not vaccinated against COVID-19."I don't have that number to share with you at that time," White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday when asked for an estimate on how many federal government employees the administration believes are not vaccinated.Meanwhile, Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that mask mandates are once again in effect indoors in the United States' capital for everyone over the age of two - regardless of Covid-19 vaccination status.Amid a troubling rise in coronavirus cases and new information on the spread of the delta variant, masks will be required indoors in DC for all people over 2. The new mandate will kick in at 5 am on Saturday (local time), DC Mayor Bowser announced at a press conference.On Tuesday (local time), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its mask guidance to prevent further spread of the Delta variant in the United States, by mandating vaccinated people to wear masks in certain situations.The recommendation urges fully vaccinated people to wear masks indoors when in areas with "substantial" and "high" transmission of Covid-19, which includes nearly two-thirds of all US counties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/federal-workers-must-be-vaccinated-or-submit-to-regular-covid-testing-biden-101627634885530.html
30-07-2021||World||Mixing Russia's Sputnik V, Astrazeneca Covid shots proves safe: RDIF||The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) on Friday announced that the initial safety results of the world’s first study of a combination between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the first component of the Sputnik V vaccine in Azerbaijan show combined vaccine use completely safe. "No SAEs (Serious Adverse Events) or cases of coronavirus after vaccination. Positive immunogenicity results expected in August," Sputnik V said in a statement.Sputnik V developed the vaccine cocktail approach with two different vectors for two shots (Ad26+Ad5). This mix and match approach has recently gained global recognition, Sputnik V said, adding that the RDIF actively collaborates with other vaccines to show mix and matching is effective against new Covid-19 strains.“As new strains of coronavirus emerge, partnerships between vaccine manufacturers and combining different vaccines are key to successfully fight the pandemic. Based on the high efficacy of the heterogeneous boosting (vaccine cocktail) approach, RDIF was the first in the world to initiate partnerships with other coronavirus vaccine manufacturers," Kirill Dmitriev, RDIF's chief executive, said, according to Sputnik V.Dmitriev said that the first partnership of this kind was a joint clinical trial with AstraZeneca, adding that it looks forward to its success in Azerbaijan and other countries, which will allow more effective implementation of vaccination programs and protect people around the globe. "We consider it important to conduct joint research on combining the first component of Sputnik V with vaccines from other manufacturers for a more effective fight against emerging new strains of coronavirus," Dmitriev added.The first partnership of this kind was concluded in December last year in the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin. RDIF, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, AstraZeneca and R-Pharm has signed a memorandum of intent which is aimed at cooperation in vaccine development, Sputnik V stated.“A heterogeneous prime-boosting involving administering components of different vaccines to a patient is one of the most promising vaccination regimens to study. It is becoming especially relevant now when the issue of preventing the spread of new strains of coronavirus infection is acute, and the need for revaccination of the population is also coming to a head," Irina Panarina, general manager of AstraZeneca Russia and Eurasia, said. "That is why the results of the study can be of great importance for those countries where both the vaccine by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford and the Sputnik V vaccine are registered," she said.The studies on the safety and immunogenicity of the combination of the AstraZeneca vaccine and the first component of the Sputnik V vaccine in Azerbaijan began in February this year. To date, 50 volunteers have been vaccinated and new participants are invited to join the trial process. Provisional analysis of the data demonstrates a high safety profile for the combined use of the vaccines with no serious or adverse effects or cases of Covid-19 after vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mixing-russia-s-sputnik-v-astrazeneca-covid-shots-proves-safe-rdif-101627632658843.html

In the process, Tong Ying-kit became the first person to be convicted under the Hong Kong National Security Law, which was imposed on the city by Beijing one year ago to stamp out dissent.Officially called the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the legislation was enacted by the Chinese Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on June 30, 2020, as opposed to it being approved by the Hong Kong Legislative Council.The legislation triggered widespread protests in Hong Kong, as democracy activists took to the streets against the national security law. The Hong Kong administration detained and arrested several protesters over the months for breaking the law, of which the 24-year-old Tong Ying-kit was one.Ying-kit allegedly drove a motorcycle into three police officers while flying a protest flag during a rally on July 1 last year, a day after the Hong Kong national security law was enacted. Charged with terrorism and secession, the Ying-kit's case was under trial in the city.At the sentencing this Tuesday, Ying-kit was convicted of both of the aforementioned charges and sentenced to nine years behind bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-man-gets-9-years-in-jail-in-first-trial-under-china-imposed-security-law-101627629853144.html

30-07-2021||World||Fully vaccinated people should get tested after potential Covid-19 exposure: CDC||Fully vaccinated people should get tested three to five days if they have been exposed to Covid-19 infection, even if they don’t have symptoms, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention has said.The latest guidance from the CDC said this is because experts do not know yet how long one is protected after recovering from Covid-19. Even if someone has already recovered from Covid-19, it is possible, although rare, that one could be infected with Covid-19 again, the CDC said.The change in guidance comes two months after the agency eased its initial testing directions. The CDC said in May that Covid-19 vaccinated people face very little risk of serious illness and don’t need to be tested in most cases, even if exposed to someone who was sick. The thinking behind this was that vaccinated people also weren't likely to spread the infection to others.The agency has now said it is reversing that guidance because of the more contagious Delta variant, which now accounts for most Covid-19 infections. The CDC noted that studies have shown vaccination provides a strong boost in protection in people who have recovered from Covid-19, but the new data shows vaccinated people infected with the Delta variant could infect others."If you were treated for Covid-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a Covid-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a Covid-19 vaccine," it said.The CDC said that US citizens returning from abroad still have to present a negative Covid-19 test before boarding flights, regardless of their vaccination status. It added that anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 should still isolate for 10 days."If you or your child has a history of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults or children (MIS-A or MIS-C), consider delaying vaccination until you or your child have recovered from being sick and for 90 days after the date of diagnosis of MIS-A or MIS-C. Learn more about the clinical considerations people with a history of multisystem MIS-C or MIS-A," the CDC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fully-vaccinated-people-should-get-tested-after-potential-covid-19-exposure-cdc-101627620328711.html
30-07-2021||World||Delta variant may spread as easily as chickenpox: Reports||The Delta variant of the coronavirus may cause more severe illness than all other known versions of the virus and spread as easily as chickenpox, US media reports quoting an internal document from the US health authority said.The document from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) outlines unpublished data that shows fully vaccinated people might spread the Delta variant, first identified in India, at the same rate as unvaccinated people, reports said.The contents of the document - a slide presentation - were first reported by The Washington Post on Thursday.Dr Rochelle P Walensky, the director of the CDC, acknowledged on Tuesday that vaccinated people with so-called breakthrough infections of the Delta variant carry just as much virus in the nose and throat as unvaccinated people and may spread it just as readily, if less often.But the internal document lays out a broader and even grimmer view of the variant.The Delta variant is more transmissible than the viruses that cause MERS, SARS, Ebola, the common cold, the seasonal flu and smallpox, and it is as contagious as chickenpox, according to the document, a copy of which was also obtained by The New York Times.The Delta variant -- originally known as B.1.617.2 -- might cause more severe disease, according to the document.The immediate next step for the agency is to “acknowledge the war has changed,” the document said.The document’s tone reflects alarm among CDC scientists about Delta’s spread across the country, the NYT quoted a federal official, who has seen the research described in the document, as saying.The agency is expected to publish additional data on the deadly variant on Friday.“The CDC. is very concerned with the data coming in that Delta is a very serious threat that requires action now,” the official said.There are roughly 35,000 symptomatic infections per week among 162 million vaccinated Americans, according to data collected by the CDC as of July 24 that was cited in the internal presentation.But the agency does not track all mild or asymptomatic infections, so the actual incidence may be higher.Infection with the Delta variant produces virus amounts in the airways that are tenfold higher than what is seen in people infected with the Alpha variant, which is also highly contagious, the document noted.The amount of virus in a person infected with Delta is a thousandfold more than what is seen in people infected with the original version of the virus, according to one recent study.The CDC document relies on data from multiple studies, including an analysis of a recent outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts, which began after the town’s Fourth of July festivities.Walensky told CNN that the Delta variant "is one of the most transmissible viruses we know about. Measles, chickenpox, this -- they're all up there."And she said everyone in schools -- students, staff and visitors -- should wear masks at all times."The measures we need to get this under control -- they're extreme. The measures you need are extreme," Walensky said."The bottom line was that, in contrast to the other variants, vaccinated people, even if they didn't get sick, got infected and shed virus at similar levels as unvaccinated people who got infected," Walter Orenstein, who heads the Emory Vaccine Center and who viewed the documents, told CNN.But vaccinated people are safer, the document indicates."Vaccines prevent more than 90 per cent of severe disease, but may be less effective at preventing infection or transmission," it reads."Therefore, more breakthrough and more community spread despite vaccination," the document adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-may-spread-as-easily-as-chickenpox-reports-101627628178712.html

The Taliban has escalated its offensive against Afghan security forces and civilians and imposed archaic rules in the territories it has captured. According to US General Mark Milley, the Taliban now control about half of the 419 district centres in Afghanistan.While both the US and the UN has warned the Taliban of international isolation and travel sanctions if the Sunni group unilaterally tries to seize power in Kabul, the Islamist group, with its leadership safely ensconced in neighbouring Pakistan is in no mood to change from its 1996 version. The Deobandi group's larger objective is to impose Sharia on Afghanistan by converting it into an emirate and expand the Sunni Pashtun influence all over the country at the cost of the minorities and women rights.Also read | Taliban asks for list of girls, widows to be married to their fighters: ReportsThat the group is in no mood to negotiate peace except for mouthing the words is evident from the reports indicating that Indian photographer Danish Siddiqui was deliberately tortured and killed by the Taliban at Spin Boldak after establishing his nationality.

His body could be seen in one of those clips.Earlier this month reports said the Taliban has ordered women to not leave home alone, set dowry regulations for girls and men to grow their beards among other diktats. According to reports, the Taliban has also issued a statement ordering local religious leaders to give them a list of girls over 15 years of age and widows under 45, reports have said. The Taliban, the reports said, has promised for them to be married to its fighters.In the past as well, the Taliban enforced a strict interpretation of Islamic law, including public lashings, flogging and stonings. Women were required to cover their bodies and faces in a burqa and were barred from going to school or work or leaving the house without a male relative.The United Nations has expressed concern with the number of reported "serious human rights abuses" and violations. The global body has said that authorities are obliged to respect the human rights and dignity of all Afghans, especially those of women and girls. Reports of killing, ill-treatment, persecution and discrimination are widespread and disturbing, creating fear and insecurity, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has also said.Apart from the torturing people in captured areas, reports also said that Taliban fighters have destroyed 11 sites on the Salam telecommunication network and looted its equipment. Reporterly, an Afghan online portal, said citing local officials that the Taliban fighters also closed seven other sites in Paktia’s occupied districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/videos-show-taliban-has-no-interest-in-peace-in-afghanistan-101627626943691.html

We call on the PRC to act as a responsible nation hoping to welcome foreign media and the world for the upcoming Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games," the state department.Recently, after Chinese state media hit out at foreign media for their coverage of floods in Chinese cities, citizens harrassed correspondents for several international media outlets on the streets of Zhengzhou city of Henan province over the weekend.According to a report in Hong Kong Free Press early this week, the Chinese social media platform Weibo was filled with angry posts criticising the coverage of foreign correspondents as Chinese cities witnessed heavy downpours and flooding.The criticism was mainly aimed at BBC's China Correspondent Robin Brant for a report that questioned government policies after a dozen people die in a train carriage amid the flooding.Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under President Xi Jinping rules China with an iron fist. The media in the country is tightly controlled and journalists, who are deemed as anti-government, are punished and jailed.According to Reporter Without Borders, China continues to be the world's "biggest jailer of press freedom defenders", with more the 120 currently detained in the country, "often in life-threatening conditions".In recent months, China has been targeting foreign journalists for highlighting the atrocities of the Chinese Communist Party and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.At least 20 journalists have been expelled or forced to leave China since last year, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China has said.The club says Beijing deploys "intimidation" tactics as part of efforts to obstruct the work of foreign reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-concerned-over-harassment-intimidation-of-foreign-journalists-in-china-101627625383002.html

From free beer in Israel to complimentary dessert in Malaysia, authorities and businesses are hoping to make more people get vaccinated against Covid-19. A property developer in Hong Kong raffled off a $1.4 million apartment for people who have been vaccinated.Many countries, including the United States, have seen rising infections and have urged people to get vaccinated against Covid-19. More than 197.3 million people have been reported to have contracted Covid-19 globally and 4,214,619 have died, according to a Worldometer tally.Here are what some of the countries are doing to urge people to get the Covid-19 jabs:USWashington State has allowed retailers to offer a free marijuana joint when they get a shot in ‘joints for jabs’ promotions.

"We are now in the fourth wave of Covid-19 across the region."The delta variant of the coronavirus has now been reported in 15 out of 22 countries in the Middle East, according to WHO. Most of the new Covid-19 cases and hospitalised patients are unvaccinated. The low rate of vaccination in the region, coupled with the increased transmissibility of the delta variant of the coronavirus, remains a major cause for concern.Iran, Iraq, Tunisia, and Libya are the countries worst hit by the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in the Middle East, said the public health body of the United Nations (UN). "Over 310 000 new cases and 3500 deaths have been reported on average on a weekly basis during the last 4 weeks, which is a 55% and 15% increase in the number of cases and deaths, respectively, compared to the previous month," a statement issued by the WHO media centre read."Admission and hospitalisation rates have increased in the last few weeks, and some referral hospitals are reaching full capacity and facing a shortage of intensive care beds and oxygen supplies," it added.Covid-19 management does not only include churning out vaccines that are highly effective against coronavirus disease infection, but also requires an equitable increase in the vaccination coverage, the UN body said. "Until and unless vaccination coverage is increased equitably for everybody, everywhere, the virus will continue to circulate and mutate to produce new variants," WHO said in its statement.Notably, only 41 million people in the Middle East (a mere 5.5% of the region's population) had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 till the last week in July. Among these vaccine doses, 40% were administered in high-income countries in the region, which account for only 8% of the region’s population. Meanwhile, more and more people elsewhere in the region continue to be infected with the virus and succumb to their deaths due to inequitable vaccine rollout, increased social mixing, and poor enforcement of public health and social measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fourth-wave-of-covid-19-hits-middle-east-who-sounds-alarm-over-delta-variant-101627612069509.html
30-07-2021||World||ISS thrown out of control by misfire of Russian module: NASA||The International Space Station (ISS) was thrown briefly out of control on Thursday when jet thrusters of a newly arrived Russian research module inadvertently fired a few hours after it was docked to the orbiting outpost, NASA officials said.The seven crew members aboard - two Russian cosmonauts, three NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut and a European space agency astronaut from France - were never in any immediate danger, according to NASA and Russian state-owned news agency RIA.But the malfunction prompted NASA to postpone until at least Aug. 3 its planned launch of Boeing's new CST-100 Starliner capsule on an uncrewed test flight to the space station. The Starliner had been set to blast off atop an Atlas V rocket on Friday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.Thursday's mishap began about three hours after the multipurpose Nauka module had latched onto the space station. The module's jets inexplicably restarted, causing the entire station to pitch out of its normal flight position some 250 miles above the Earth, U.S. space agency officials said.The "loss of attitudinal control" lasted for a little more than 45 minutes, until flight teams on the ground managed to restore the space station's orientation by activating thrusters on another module of the orbiting platform, according to Joel Montalbano, manager of NASA's space station program.In its broadcast coverage of the incident, RIA cited NASA specialists at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, as describing the struggle to regain control of the space station as a "tug of war" between the two modules.At the height of the incident, the station was pitching out of alignment at the rate of about a half a degree per second, Montalbano said hours later in a NASA conference call with reporters.The Nauka engines were ultimately switched off, the space station was stabilized and its orientation was restored to where it had begun, NASA said.Communication with the crew was lost briefly twice during the disruption, but "there was no immediate danger at any time to the crew," Montalbano said.A drift in the space station's normal orientation was first detected by automatic sensors on the ground, and "the crew really didn't feel any movement," he said.What caused the malfunction of the thrusters on the Nauka module, delivered by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, has yet to be determined, NASA officials said.Montalbano said there was no immediate sign of any damage to the space station. The flight correction maneuvers used up more propellant reserves than desired, "but nothing I would worry about," he said.After its launch last week from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, the module experienced a series of glitches that raised concern about whether the docking procedure would go smoothly.Roscosmos attributed Thursday's post-docking issue to Nauka's engines having to work with residual fuel in the craft, TASS news agency reported."The process of transferring the Nauka module from flight mode to 'docked with ISS' mode is underway. Work is being carried out on the remaining fuel in the module," Roscosmos was cited by TASS as saying.The Nauka module is designed to serve as a research lab, storage unit and airlock that will upgrade Russia's capabilities aboard the ISS.A live broadcast showed the module, named after the Russian word for "science," docking with the space station a few minutes later than scheduled."According to telemetry data and reports from the ISS crew, the onboard systems of the station and the Nauka module are operating normally," Roscosmos said in a statement."There is contact!!!" Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, wrote on Twitter moments after the docking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iss-thrown-out-of-control-by-misfire-of-russian-module-nasa-101627611841026.html
30-07-2021||World||Flawed scientific papers fueling Covid-19 misinformation||Scientific studies with poor methodology and inaccurate findings are exacerbating a Covid-19 misinformation crisis that is discouraging vaccination and putting lives at risk.The intense public interest in the pandemic and divisive debate in the United States over how to address it facilitates the spread of faulty research papers online, including by vaccine opponents. And even if a study is retracted, it is too late."Once the paper is published, the damage is irrevocable," said Emerson Brooking, resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which focuses on identifying and exposing disinformation.Flawed papers "have been fuel to the fire for Covid-19 skeptics and conspiracy theorists. They are frequently the subject of viral online activity. Their findings are further filtered through salacious and misleading articles from fringe websites," Brooking told AFP.Inaccurate information about vaccines is especially dangerous at a time when uptake of the shots has slowed in the United States, where health officials say almost all recent Covid-19 deaths occurred among those who were not immunized.- 'Shock your socks off' -Medical journal Vaccines published a peer-reviewed paper in late June titled "The Safety of Covid-19 vaccinations -- we should rethink the policy." It concluded that Covid-19 shots were causing two people to die for every three they saved -- findings that quickly spread on social media.A tweet from scientist and Covid-19 vaccine critic Robert Malone summarizing the paper garnered thousands of retweets. A video in which conservative pundit Liz Wheeler discussed the study -- which she said "will shock your socks off" -- has been viewed more than 250,000 times on Facebook.But Vaccines then retracted the paper, saying it contained "several errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings."At least four Vaccines board members resigned as a result of the study's publication, including Katie Ewer, an associate professor and senior immunologist at the University of Oxford's Jenner Institute."It should have been recognized that this paper would have a big impact," said Ewer, who was not involved in its publication. "That no one at the journal picked up on that... is very worrying, especially for a journal dedicated to vaccines."Malone's tweet about the paper is no longer available, but Wheeler's video still appeared on Facebook weeks later.The Gateway Pundit, a website that frequently publishes inaccurate claims, reported earlier in the year that a Stanford University study found mask wearing, which US health authorities recommended to help slow the spread of Covid-19, to be "ineffective" and harmful.- 'Do a better job' -The study -- "Facemasks in the Covid-19 era: A health hypothesis" -- was subsequently retracted by the journal Medical Hypotheses, which said it selectively cited published papers and included "unverified" data.The Gateway Pundit's article -- which has been shared tens of thousands of times as a link or screenshot on social media -- was updated to say the study's author was unaffiliated with Stanford, but it failed to mention the retraction.Some of the biggest scientific journals, including The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine, have retracted papers related to the coronavirus crisis, and even a limited number of faulty studies can cause extensive damage online.Scientific papers have been drawn into the public eye in "an unprecedented way," so experts must "do a better job" of explaining their work to a lay audience that may lack the skills to assess them, said Maimuna Majumder, a computational epidemiologist at the Harvard Medical School."Not all of the studies that have been produced and widely shared during the pandemic have been scientifically robust," Majumder said."This is particularly troubling because poorly-executed studies have proven to be capable of influencing individual-level decision-making during the pandemic, including those pertaining to vaccination."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flawed-scientific-papers-fueling-covid-19-misinformation-101627610220526.html
30-07-2021||World||Saudi Arabia to reopen to vaccinated tourists after 17-month Covid closure||Saudi Arabia announced Friday it would reopen its borders to fully vaccinated foreign tourists after a 17-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic, the state news agency said.However, Riyadh did not announce any lifting of restrictions on the umrah, a pilgrimage that can be undertaken at any time, which usually attracts millions of Muslims from across the globe each year."The Ministry of Tourism announced that the Kingdom will open its doors to foreign tourists, and lift... the suspension of entry for tourist visa holders, starting from August 1," the Saudi Press Agency reported.It said travellers fully vaccinated with Saudi-approved jabs -- Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson -- will be able to enter the kingdom "without the need for an institutional quarantine period", provided they also have proof of a negative PCR Covid-19 test taken within the last 72 hours and register their details with health authorities.Riyadh has spent billions trying to build a tourism industry from scratch, as part of efforts to diversify its oil-reliant economy.The once-reclusive kingdom began issuing tourist visas for the first time in 2019, part of an ambitious push to revamp its global image and draw visitors.Between September 2019 and March 2020, it issued 400,000 -- only for the pandemic to crush that momentum as borders were closed.Covid-19 also hugely disrupted the hajj and umrah pilgrimages, usually a key revenue earner for the kingdom -- in normal times, they together rake in some $12 billion (10.3 billion euros) annually.Currently only immunised pilgrims resident in Saudi Arabia are eligible for umrah permits.The government has accelerated a nationwide vaccination drive as it moves to revive tourism and host sports and entertainment extravaganzas, all pandemic-hit sectors.So far, 26 million jabs have been administered to the population of 35 million, and the kingdom has said that from August 1, vaccinations will be mandatory to enter government and private establishments, including education institutions and entertainment venues, as well as to use public transport.Saudi Arabia has registered more than 523,000 coronavirus cases, with 8,213 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-to-reopen-to-vaccinated-tourists-after-17-month-covid-closure-101627608932557.html
30-07-2021||World||Antony Blinken supports virus origin probe||US secretary of state Antony Blinken met the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Kuwait on Wednesday where he pledged his support to the UN agency’s investigation in China into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.Earlier this month, the WHO called for all countries to work together to investigate the origins of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. China has rejected plans for more checks on labs and markets in its territory.“The U.S. supports the @WHO plans for additional studies into COVID-19 origins, including in (the People’s Republic of China), to better understand this pandemic and prevent future ones,” Blinken tweeted after arriving in the Gulf Arab state.The meeting with Tedros had not been on the US diplomat’s published schedule.In a statement, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that Blinken “stressed the need for the next phase (of the investigation) to be timely, evidence-based, transparent, expert-led, and free from interference.”And he “emphasised the importance of the international community coming together on this matter of critical concern”, the statement said.The UN health agency has been under intensifying pressure for a new, more in-depth investigation of how the disease that has killed more than four million people around the world first emerged.The WHO was only able to send a team of independent, international experts to Wuhan in January, more than a year after Covid-19 first surfaced there, to help Chinese counterparts probe the pandemic’s origins.Long derided as a right-wing conspiracy theory and vehemently rejected by Beijing, the idea that Covid-19 may have emerged from a lab leak has been gaining momentum. Beijing has repeatedly insisted that a leak would have been “extremely unlikely”, citing the conclusion reached by a joint WHO-Chinese mission to Wuhan in January.But earlier this month, the WHO said a second stage of the international probe should include audits of Chinese labs, amid increasing pressure from the United States for an investigation into a biotech lab in Wuhan.The first human cases of Covid-19 were reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.China said that such a proposal showed “disrespect” and “arrogance towards science”.Blinken and Tedro also “discussed opportunities for collaboration to continue reforming and strengthening the WHO,” State Department spokesperson Price said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-supports-virus-origin-probe-101627601658341.html
30-07-2021||World||Ex-Cardinal McCarrick charged with sexually assaulting teen||Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was defrocked after a Vatican investigation confirmed he had sexually molested adults as well as children, has been charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy during a wedding reception in Massachusetts in 1974, court records show.McCarrick is the first cardinal in the US to ever be criminally charged with a sexual crime against a minor, according to Mitchell Garabedian, a well-known lawyer for church sexual abuse victims who is representing the man alleging the abuse by McCarrick."It takes an enormous amount of courage for a sexual abuse victim to report having been sexually abused to investigators and proceed through the criminal process," Garabedian said in an email. “Let the facts be presented, the law applied, and a fair verdict rendered.”McCarrick faces three counts of indecent assault and battery on a person over 14, according to documents filed in the Dedham District Court on Wednesday.Barry Coburn, an attorney for McCarrick, told The Associated Press that they “look forward to addressing the case in the courtroom," and declined further comment.The charges against McCarrick were first reported by The Boston Globe on Thursday.The man said the abuse started when he was a young boy, according to the court records. The man told authorities during an interview in January that McCarrick was close to his family and would perform wedding masses, baptisms and funerals for them.The man said that during his brother's wedding reception at Wellesley College in June 1974 — when he was 16 — McCarrick told him that his father wanted him to have a talk with McCarrick because the boy was “being mischievous at home and not attending church.”The man said that the two of them went for a walk around campus and McCarrick groped him before they went back to the party. The man said McCarrick also sexually assaulted him in a “coat room type closet” after they returned to the reception, authorities wrote in the documents.Before leaving the room, McCarrick told him to “say three Our Fathers and a Hail Mary or it was one Our Father and three Hail Marys, so God can redeem you of your sins," according to the report.The man also described other instances of sexual abuse by McCarrick over the years, including when the man was an adult, the report said.Authorities began investigating McCarrick after Garabedian sent a letter alleging the abuse to the district attorney's office, according to the court records.McCarrick can still be charged in this case because he wasn’t a Massachusetts resident and had left the state, stopping the clock on the statute of limitations, authorities said.McCarrick, 91, was defrocked by Pope Francis in 2019 after a Vatican investigation confirmed decades of rumors that he was a sexual predator.The case created a credibility crisis for the church since the Vatican had reports from authoritative cardinals dating to 1999 that McCarrick’s behavior was problematic, yet he became an influential cardinal, kingmaker and emissary of the Holy See’s “soft diplomacy.”It led to a two-year investigation that found that bishops, cardinals and popes downplayed or dismissed multiple reports of sexual misconduct. An internal investigation report released last year put the lion’s share of blame on Pope John Paul II, who appointed McCarrick archbishop of Washington, D.C., despite having commissioned an inquiry that confirmed he slept with seminarians.Anne Barrett Doyle, co-founder of the online research database BishopAccountability.org, said that “for McCarrick, today’s reckoning is long overdue.”"We hope that these charges lead to justice," she said in an emailed statement.Jeff Anderson, an attorney who has represented others who say they were victimized by McCarrick, said in a statement that the defrocked cardinal's “history of prolific sex crimes has been ignored by the highest-ranking Catholic officials for decades.”“For too long Catholic institutions have been self-policing while making pledges and promises without action. McCarrick should be behind bars for his crimes," Anderson said.McCarrick, who now lives in Missouri, has been ordered to appear in Massachusetts for his arraignment on Sept. 3. The hearing was originally scheduled for Aug. 26.Of the thousands of Catholic clergymen implicated in sexual abuse in recent decades, McCarrick was distinctive in having reached the highest circles of church leadership — even as awareness of his suspect behavior spread steadily through the hierarchy.Ordained as a priest in New York City in 1958, McCarrick rose to become archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, in 1986 and then archbishop of Washington, D.C., in 2000. He was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II.In June 2018, McCarrick suddenly became the face of the long-festering Catholic sex abuse crisis as Pope Francis removed him from public ministry due to allegations that he abused a teenager while a priest in New York. A church panel determined that a former altar boy’s allegations that McCarrick fondled him before Christmas Mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in 1971 and 1972 were “credible and substantiated.”The church also acknowledged that it had made previously undisclosed financial settlements with adults who accused McCarrick of sexual misconduct decades ago. It was apparently common knowledge in the US and Vatican leadership that “Uncle Ted,” as McCarrick was known, slept with seminarians, and yet he still he ascended up the church ranks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/excardinal-mccarrick-charged-with-sexually-assaulting-teen-101627596722298.html

Meanwhile, Olympic organisers reported 24 new infections among Games participants, the highest yet, bringing the total to 193.International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said there was nothing to suggest a link between the Games and the rising figures in Japan.“As far as I’m aware there’s not a single case of an infection spreading to the Tokyo population from the athletes or Olympic movement,” he told reporters. “We have the most tested community probably anywhere... in the world, on top of that you have some of the toughest lockdown restrictions in the athletes’ village.”Of the Olympic participants reported positive, 109 are residents of Japan, with the rest coming from abroad.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said his government will decide on Friday whether to expand the emergency measures. The government is expected to extend Tokyo’s emergency until August 31 and add the capital’s three neighbouring areas and Osaka.Delta drives virus surge in Mideast, warns WHOThe World Health Organization said on Thursday the Delta variant has led to a “surge” in coronavirus outbreaks triggering a “fourth wave” in the Eastern Mediterranean region, where vaccination rates remain low.Beijing reported two locally transmitted coronavirus cases on Thursday, breaking a six-month streak of zero community infections in the Chinese capital.The virus has killed at least 4,190,383 people worldwide since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally compiled by AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-cases-hit-record-high-in-japan-101627592183343.html
