The US State Department said that Turkey was providing “tangible support” to the Sultan Murad division, a faction of Syrian opposition which Ankara has long supported, which the US said had recruited and used child soldiers.The TIP report also showed that governments placed under the list could be subject to restrictions on certain security assistance and commercial licensing of military equipment. “Beginning October 1, 2021, and effective throughout Fiscal Year 2022, these restrictions will apply to the listed countries, absent a presidential waiver, applicable exception, or reinstatement of assistance pursuant to the terms of the CSPA,” the report showed.Also read | US donates 2.5 million doses of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine to PakistanOther countries in the CSPA ListAlongside Turkey, Afghanistan, Burma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.Relations with TurkeyTurkey, a key NATO ally and critical regional partner to the US, is currently in negotiations for running the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, after the withdrawal of US and NATO troops.However, officials have hinted that Turkey’s name in the list wouldn’t affect those negotiations.“When it comes to trafficking in persons, I would not want to link the report today with the constructive discussions we are engaging in with Turkey, in the context of Afghanistan or any other area of shared interest,” Reuters quoted State Department spokesperson Ned Price as saying.Also read | Grave violations against children remained ‘alarmingly’ high in 2020: UN reportHow US defines ‘child soldiers’In the report, the US defined child soldiers as anyone below the age of 18 who takes part in hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces, police or other security forces. It also includes anyone under 18 years of age who has been compulsorily recruited into such forces, anyone under 15 years of age who has been voluntarily recruited into such forces.Also, any person under 18 who has been recruited by armed forces distinct from the armed forces of the state are also included for the report.Apart from hostilities, it also includes those serving in any capacity “including in a support role, such as “cook, porter, messenger, medic, guard or sex slave”” the report showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-adds-turkey-14-other-countries-to-child-soldiers-prevention-act-list-in-its-human-trafficking-report-101625247950025.html
02-07-2021||World||Canadian PM takes second dose of Covid-19 vaccine||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opted for the Moderna vaccine for his second dose after having received the AstraZeneca jab for the first. Trudeau was inoculated on Friday morning at a pharmacy in Ottawa. He told the pharmacist he was “very excited” to complete the vaccine series. His wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau received her second dose on Thursday and Trudeau said he expected the common side-effects.The choice of the mRNA vaccine manufactured by the American firm came after Canadian health authorities updated guidance allowing for vaccine interchangeability. On June 17, National Advisory Committee on Immunisation (NACI) announced that mRNA Covid-19 vaccines were deemed the “preferred” jabs for both the first and second dose even if the first was administered using AZ, which is manufactured in India under the Covishield brand name.In its recommendations, NACI said the mRNA vaccines should be preferred unless “is inaccessible or there is a contraindication, for example, an allergy to an mRNA vaccine or its components”. Only in the latter circumstances should a viral vector vaccine, like AZ, be offered.It also endorsed vaccine interchangeability, basically that doses can now be mixed with those receiving the first dose of AZ now being given the second dose as an mRNA vaccine such as those from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.NACI said that “emerging evidence” from studies in Germany have suggested a “potentially better immune response, including against variants of concern, when a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine is followed by a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, compared to two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.” Similarly, it said, evidence suggested that such mixing “has a good safety profile”.The Trudeaus received their first injection at a pharmacy in Ottawa, and just before getting the jab, the Prime Minister said he was “very excited” to get it.While there have been concerns about adverse reactions to the AZ vaccine, Canadian health authorities have maintained that the “benefits of vaccines authorised in Canada continue to outweigh the risks”.In its latest data on adverse events linked to vaccines, the Public Health Agency of Canada had noted that of the 31,400,466 doses administered till June 18, just 1,719 or 0.005% had caused serious reactions. These include anaphylaxis or a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine, cases of blood clotting, a rare syndrome associated following vaccination with AZ/Covishield vaccine. Health authorities are also monitoring other reactions like capillary leak and Guillain-Barré Syndrome, linked to the AZ jab. The former causes fluid to leak from small blood vessels while the latter is an immune disorder. Health Canada has also recently introduced labelling for the mRNA vaccines, warning of the possibility of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-takes-second-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-101625241590225.html

The suicide watch programme involves monitoring an inmate’s mental health for weeks, months, or even years. For reasons related to the confidentiality of the programme, the authorities have refused to divulge any details of the 75-year old’s time when he was placed under suicide watch.Also Read: 'His last words to me were I love you': McAfee was not suicidal, says widowMcAfee, who was awaiting extradition to the US for allegedly evading more than $4 million in taxes, had married Janice McAfee in 2013, a year after meeting her in Miami. His widow had asked for a “thorough investigation” to provide “answers about how this was able to happen.” She blamed the US authorities for his death, stating that “because of these politically motivated charges against him my husband is now dead.”This latest development comes amidst claims made by McAfee’s Spanish lawyer Javier Villalba that his client did not exhibit suicidal tendencies before being found dead in his cell. Janice, too, had backed Villalba’s claims, holding US authorities responsible for the software mogul’s death.A Spanish daily had reported on Monday that an autopsy showed McAfee died by suicide, and that the authorities have also recovered a suicide note. His lawyer told the Associated Press that Janice asked him to request a second, independent autopsy once the results of the first one were released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/john-mcafee-attempted-to-take-his-own-life-in-february-was-put-under-suicide-watch-says-prison-authorities-101625240980662.html

Along with the monarchs, the statue of British explorer Captain James Cook was also toppled by the protesters.The incident took place on Canada Day (July 1), when the country celebrates its national day every year. The protests were led by the orange-clad members of a group named ‘Idle No More’ according to the online news website Daily Mail.According to the report, ropes were tied to the statues before they were brought to the ground alongside chants of “no pride in genocide.” The protests came as many citizens had also called for the cancellation of Canada Day celebrations this year due to the country’s colonial past.Also read | Canada Day eclipsed by graves found at indigenous schoolThe statue of Queen Victoria was toppled outside the Manitoba provincial legislature to the cheer of many protesters and both the statue and pedestal were defaced with red paint hand marks. Meanwhile, the statue of Queen Elizabeth II, which was nearby, was also pulled down by the crowd.Indigenous schoolsBehind the anger of the protesters is the discovery of many unmarked graves of children in the indigenous schools of Canada.Nearly 1,000 such graves have been found at the locations of former residential schools in British Columbia and Saskatchewan in Canada, according to news reports. These schools were run by the Catholic Church and funded by the government, according to a Reuters report.Earlier on June 23, hundreds of such graves were discovered at the site of the former Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan that operated between 1899 and 1997 before it was replaced by a day school.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier on July 1 said that the discoveries of the remains of the children at former schools "have rightfully pressed us to reflect on our country's historical failures," during his Canada Day address.Also, a spokesperson for British PM Boris Johnson said that their government condemned any incident of defacing the statues of the queen. “Our thoughts are with Canada's indigenous community following these tragic discoveries, and we follow these issues closely and continue to engage with the Government of Canada on indigenous matters,” Reuters quoted the spokesperson as saying, earlier on Friday.(With inputs from Daily Mail online, agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-victoria-queen-elizabeth-ii-statues-torn-down-defaced-in-canada-by-protesters-against-colonial-past-101625235893135.html
02-07-2021||World||Russia rejects lockdown despite record rise in daily Covid-19 deaths for 4th straight day||Russia on Friday said it would not impose a new lockdown despite reporting a record number of coronavirus deaths for the fourth day in a row.A government tally showed 679 pandemic-related deaths in the previous 24 hours, as Russia battles a surging outbreak driven by the highly infectious Delta variant and worsened by a lagging vaccination drive.Russia, the fifth worst-hit country in the world in terms of total cases, has refused to impose a full lockdown since the first wave of the pandemic last year. It continues to host mass events, including Euro 2020 football fixtures in Saint Petersburg.The surge in infections prompted President Vladimir Putin this week to once again urge Russians to get vaccinated in an annual televised phone-in session with the nation.The Kremlin stressed Friday that a new lockdown was off the table."Nobody wants any lockdowns, and yes, it is not up for debate," said Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. "It is not being discussed."Saint Petersburg, Russia's second city, on Friday recorded 101 deaths, just shy of its record from earlier in the week of 119.Organisers have said the Euro 2020 Spain vs. Switzerland quarter-final later Friday will go ahead despite the high infection rates, in front of thousands of spectators.Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said the Delta variant now accounts for 90 percent of new cases in the city.Sobyanin has ordered offices to send home a third of their workforces, except employees who had been vaccinated, and said 60 percent of people working in the service industry must be fully inoculated by mid-August.'I want to feel safe'Moscow's restaurants have been told to only allow indoors patrons who have been vaccinated or infected in the past six months.Vaccine hesitancy has been a huge challenge for the Russian authorities but the new restrictions appear to be working.On Friday, AFP journalists saw hundreds of people waiting at vaccination points across the city of more than 12 million."I've been queueing for about two hours already," student Svetlana Stepereva said in Sokolniki park in northeast Moscow.The 21-year-old said it was time to get vaccinated, pointing to the ever-tightening restrictions."I want to get a jab and feel safe."Mikhail Shutov, the head of a Moscow clinic, told AFP at the park that there was a clear increase in the number of people who wanted to be inoculated."There are definitely more people who want to get vaccinated for the first time," he said.The Kremlin had set a goal of fully inoculating 60 percent of Russia's population by September, but conceded this week it would not be able to meet that target, even though free jabs have been available since early December.Sobyanin this week urged Muscovites inoculated more than six months ago to get a booster jab with the country's homegrown Sputnik V vaccine or the one-dose Sputnik Light.Russia, with 136,565 deaths from the virus, has the highest official toll from Covid-19 in Europe even as authorities have been accused of downplaying the severity of the country's outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-rejects-lockdown-despite-record-rise-in-daily-covid-19-deaths-for-4th-straight-day-101625231474010.html
02-07-2021||World||Over 6 million EU citizens seek to settle in post-Brexit UK||More than 6 million European Union citizens applied to settle in the UK before the end-June deadline that the British government had imposed as part of the country's departure from the bloc.In a statement Friday, Britain's Home Office said of the 6.02 million people who had applied, 400,000 applications were made in the final month before the end of the EU Settlement Scheme.“Having more than 6 million applications to the scheme is an unprecedented achievement and I am delighted that we have secured the rights of so many EU citizens — our friends, neighbours and family members," Home Secretary Priti Patel said.The Home Office said that the 570,000 people with pending applications will have their rights protected until their application is decided and that there will be “indefinite scope” for anyone who missed the deadline to make a late application.People who submitted an application by the deadline have received a certification that they can use if they need to prove their immigration status for any reason, such as taking up a new job or renting a property.The scheme was introduced in March 2019 as part of the UK's plans to leave the EU. One of the main impacts of Brexit was the end of freedom of movement, whereby anyone in any EU state can live and work anywhere else within the bloc, which numbers 27 countries after the UK's departure.Under the scheme, EU citizens in the country will be guaranteed their rights, including access to benefits and healthcare, in the UK Any EU citizen who hasn't applied could now potentially lose their rights or even be subject to deportation.Similar schemes have been in place in the EU with regard to the 1 million or so British citizens who live within the bloc. Those applying for post-Brexit residency permits in France also faced a deadline on Wednesday.One key concern is that the immigration policy could leave a disastrous legacy similar to Britain’s “Windrush” scandal, when many people from the Caribbean who legally settled in the UK decades ago were wrongly caught up in tough new government rules to crack down on illegal immigration.Many in the “Windrush generation” — named after the ship that carried the first post-war migrants from the West Indies — lost their homes and jobs or were even deported simply because they couldn’t produce paperwork proving their residency rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-6-million-eu-citizens-seek-to-settle-in-post-brexit-uk-101625228927780.html

The VT-4 battle tanks have been produced by Chinese state-owned armoured vehicle manufacturer, Norinco, and the delivery of these started in April last year. With the latest induction, Pakistan is the third country to have procured these tanks from China after Thailand and Nigeria procured got them from Beijing.Lieutenant general Shaheen Mehmood, the commander of the Mangla Corps, on Wednesday visited the armoured division and inspected the first batch of VT-4 tanks, the army’s media affairs wing said in a statement. Major General Rashid Mahmood briefed the commander about ongoing post-shipment inspections of the first batch of tanks, the statement said. General Mehmood also witnessed the mobility and manoeuvrability test of the tanks, reported PTI.Pakistan army said, after their on-field tests in September last year, that the VT-4 tanks would be employed in an offensive role by strike formations after induction. “The VT-4 is compatible with any modern tank in the world integrating advanced armour protection, manoeuvrability, firepower capabilities and state-of-the-art technology,” the army said.Pakistan has heavily relied on China to buy defence weapons and procured several such artillery to boost its capability along the border with India.In 2018, Pakistan was learnt to have around 17 units of Chinese origin T-59 and T69 tanks, which comprise 30 per cent of its total tank strength, people familiar with the matter said. It also has 12 regiments of Al-Zarar tanks, which makes 20 per cent of the tank fleet while Ukrain origin T-80-UD and T-85 UD, as well as an upgraded version of T-59 tanks, comprise the rest of the 50 per cent tank fleet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-inducts-china-made-vt-4-battle-tanks-for-offensive-role-101625209770342.html

Dr Fauci's assertion comes as the threat of another wave of the pandemic on the back of this fast-spreading variant is looming large across the world."...From Public Health England, from June 14, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 96 per cent effective against hospitalization from the Delta variant after two doses, and the AZ (AstraZeneca) was 92 per cent effective against hospitalisation after two doses," Dr Fauci said.As AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson are based on very similar platforms like that of Pfizer, it can be assumed that the results against the Delta variant will be similar, he said."Since these vaccines -- the AZ and the J&J (Johnson & Johnson) are based on very similar platforms, one could anticipate and make a reasonable assumption that the results against the Delta variant would be at least similar, perhaps even better. We are now looking at neutralization data, and soon we will have more firm data which we will make available to you as soon as it occurs," he said.Johnson and Johnson has claimed that its single-shot Covid-19 vaccine is effective against the Delta variant, with an immune response lasting at least eight months. The company conducted two studies to find out the efficacy of the vaccine against the Delta variant - one on eight people vaccinated with the J&J jab and the second with 20 vaccinated patients at a Boston hospital.The World Health Organization has said Delta will become the predominant variant in the coming months as at present 96 countries have reported this variant.Dr Fauci too has expressed concern over the Delta variant as it is "more efficient" than the other variants. "The Delta variant has the capability of spreading much more efficiently from person to person. It also can cause more severe diseases. So there are two things about it that are troublesome," he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-us-authorised-covid-19-vaccines-effective-against-delta-fauci-explains-why-101625214716917.html
02-07-2021||World||Explained: What is Trump Organization and what tax fraud it committed||Donald Trump's company Trump Organization and its finance chief have been charged with "sweeping and audacious" tax fraud schemes. CFO Allen Weisselberg has been accused of collecting more than $1.7 million off the record, which included his apartment rent, car payments and school tuition fee. This is the first criminal case that has come out from the New York authorities' two-year investigation against the business dealing of the former US president.How is Donald Trump involved?Donald Trump has not been charged but the probe has found out that Trump signed some of the cheques of this alleged scheme. Before he became the president of the United States, he stepped down from all positions that he held in the Trump Organization. But he remained the sole owner of the businesses and has now recently returned to his old offices.What is Trump Organization?Trump Organization is a business entity that includes hundreds of firms and partnerships that own or manage office buildings, hotels, residential towers, golf clubs, branding rights, licensing deals and other assets around the world. Both Trump's sons are executive vice presidents of the company.What are the charges?According to the indictment, starting from 2005, the Trump Organization paid senior executives off the books in the form of fringe benefits to evade tax. Weisselberg alone was accused of defrauding the federal government, the state and the city out of more than $1 million in unpaid taxes and tax refunds to which he was not entitled.How could the indictment hurt Trump's company?The indictment may make it harder for Trump's company to strike new deals, secure bank loans and push more money into the business. Associated Press quoted defence lawyer Daniel Horwitz as saying, "Companies that are being indicted, whether they are private or public, big or small, face serious collateral consequences." “Companies in the financial services industry are reluctant to do business with them. Their access to capital is limited or cut off as is their ability to place their liquid assets with banks and brokerages," Horwitz said.

02-07-2021||World||Australia further curbs new arrivals due to risks of Delta variant||Australia plans to halve commercial passenger arrivals due to virus risks as parts of the country emerged from lockdowns Friday.Australia will reduce its cap on arrivals from 6,000 passengers a week to 3,000 by July 14 to reduce pressure on hotel quarantine, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said after a meeting with state and territory leaders.Australia already has some of the world’s tightest border restrictions aimed at keeping Covid-19 out of the country. The new restrictions add to obstacles faced by 34,000 Australian citizens and permanent residents stranded overseas and registered with the government as wanting to come home.The government will charter more airliners to repatriate Australians, but the reduced limit on commercial passenger arrivals could continue until next year.“If medical advice changes between now and then, if medical advice suggests that we can alter that, then, of course, the National Cabinet has always been receptive to that advice and we’ll continue to monitor that,” Morrison told reporters, referring to his decision-making meetings with the state and territory leaders.“We wouldn’t want to keep those caps in place any longer than we had to,” he added.Almost half the Australian population locked down since last week due to clusters mostly of the delta variant of the coronavirus that is thought to be more contagious.Several cities in Queensland state and the Northern Territory came out of lockdown on Friday. The Queensland capital Brisbane and the neighboring Moreton Bay area would remain in lockdown until Saturday after a mother and daughter tested positive in Brisbane.The biggest cluster is in Sydney where 31 new cases were reported on Friday, the largest daily tally of the current emergency. Sydney’s two-week lockdown is due to end on July 9.Australia has been relatively successful in containing clusters throughout the pandemic, registering fewer than 31,000 cases in a population of 26 million and 910 deaths total.The higher infection rate of the delta variant has exposed the vulnerability of the Australian population in which, according to government data, only 8% are fully vaccinated.Morrison said a vaccine would be made available to every Australian who wanted one by the end of the year.The government has proposed fewer restrictions for vaccinated people, such as allowing them to quarantine at home for a week after travelling overseas instead of two weeks in a hotel for the unvaccinated.“A lot of people say: ‘Well, why should I get vaccinated?’ They go: ‘There’s not much COVID around in Australia. I’ve got more chance of, I don’t know, getting run over by a car than catching COVID,’” Morrison said.“We’re prisoners of our own success in this. If you get vaccinated, you get to change how we live as a country. You get to change how you live in Australia. And I think this is a very powerful message,” he added.Australia introduced extraordinarily tough border restrictions in March 2020 that prevent Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving the country as well as foreigners from arriving except under limited circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-further-curbs-new-arrivals-due-to-risks-of-delta-variant-101625203789968.html

More than half of those were caused by lightning strikes that ignited trees and woods that were left dry due to the historic temperatures recorded in the province over the past week.Trudeau will chair a meeting of the Incident Response Group, a crisis and emergency management committee, on Friday “to discuss the extreme weather-related conditions in British Columbia and the wildfire situation throughout Western Canada”, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.Trudeau also spoke to British Columbia’s premier (equivalent of a chief minister) John Horgan on Thursday and assured him of the federal government’s support to those affected by the fires. The PM also informed him that defence minister Harjit Sajjan and public safety and emergency preparedness minister Bill Blair were “working with provincial ministers to ensure that all federal resources necessary are available to British Columbia”.“I cannot stress enough how extreme the fire risk is at this moment in every part of British Columbia,” Horgan said during the course of a media briefing. The fires raging in the province include nine of note which “are highly visible or which pose a potential threat to public safety,” according to the British Columbia Wildfire Service.Among the worst hit areas is the hamlet of Lytton and its vicinity. Over Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Lytton recorded new highs in temperatures in Canadian history, peaking at 49.6 degrees Celsius. It was ordered evacuated on Wednesday, with nearly 1,000 inhabitants in the area having to move to safety as local officials said nearly 90% of Lytton being decimated by a wildfire. Trudeau described the situation there as “catastrophic”. The British Columbia Wildfire Service classified it as “out of control” and estimated it was 6,400 hectares in size.Evacuation orders are in place across several communities in the wildfire-hit regions and over 500sq km of area has been impacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-calls-emergency-meeting-to-tackle-wildfires-in-british-columbia-101625204206048.html
02-07-2021||World||Canada Day eclipsed by graves found at indigenous school||Canada's national holiday Thursday was marked by a grim reckoning over its colonial history, after more than 1,000 unmarked graves were found near former boarding schools for indigenous children.Several cities across the country cancelled their traditional Canada Day celebrations, usually marked by fireworks and barbecues. The hashtag #CancelCanadaDay was trending on social media, and rallies in support of the indigenous community were held around the country.The 154th anniversary of the Canadian Confederation came one day after 182 unmarked graves were found near a former boarding school in British Columbia where indigenous children were forcibly assimilated.The discovery was the latest in a series that have outraged the country, with 751 similar graves found near a school in Marieval in western Saskatchewan province last week, and 215 found at the end of May at another school in Kamloops, British Columbia.Until the 1990s, some 150,000 indigenous, Inuit and Metis youngsters were forcibly enrolled in the 139 schools, where students were physically and sexually abused by headmasters and teachers who stripped them of their culture and language.More than 4,000 died of disease and neglect in the schools, according to a commission of inquiry that concluded Canada had committed "cultural genocide.""The horrific findings... have rightfully pressed us to reflect on our country's historical failures, and the injustices that still exist for Indigenous peoples and many others in Canada," Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement Thursday."We as Canadians must be honest with ourselves about our past," he said.'Happy denial day'Days after the Kamloops discovery the city council of Victoria, the capital of British Columbia, voted unanimously to cancel their planned virtual celebrations.In Toronto, demonstrators marched early Thursday wearing orange T-shirts in support of indigenous communities, many carrying signs with slogans such as "No pride in genocide."Thousands held a similar rally in Montreal with slogans like "Happy denial day.""I come here because I have small children and I think it's important to send the message that we don't want our children to be touched, to be mistreated," said an emotional Therese Dube, 56, an indigenous woman from the Akikamekw nation and a survivor of one of the residential schools in Quebec.April Courtney Kipling, a 29-year-old indigenous woman, came "to remember, to recognize all the children who will never go home."Others had a more pointed reason for showing up. "Canada Day is like celebrating genocide," said Olivia Lya, a 22-year-old Innu woman."Anyone celebrating Canada on July 1 is celebrating oppression," said Nakuset, co-organiser of the Montreal Native Women's Shelter, in a statement.Several indigenous people noted the presence of non-indigenous Canadians at the Montreal rally."It's hopeful, it shows that people are listening," said Nadine Bellerose Lavallee, a 50-year-old Metis woman.A statue of Queen Victoria, the 19th century ruler of the British empire, was covered in red paint and toppled in Winnipeg, in the central Canadian province of Manitoba, while at least ten churches suffered damage in Calgary, in the western province of Alberta, local media reported.The Canadian flag on the Peace Tower in Ottawa was flown at half-mast to honour indigenous children, as was the flag on the central tower of the Quebec National Assembly."This year, the tragic history of residential schools has overshadowed Canada Day celebrations," said Quebec premier Francois Legault.But opposition leader Erin O'Toole defended Canada Day. "The road to reconciliation does not start by tearing Canada down," the Conservative leader said, admitting that Canada is "not a perfect country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-day-eclipsed-by-graves-found-at-indigenous-school-101625197215666.html
02-07-2021||World||Canadian PM opts for Moderna vaccine for second dose||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has opted for the Moderna vaccine for his second dose of the Covid-19 jab after having received the AstraZeneca one for the first.Trudeau is scheduled to be inoculated on Friday in Ottawa.The choice of the mRNA vaccine manufactured by the American firm came after Canadian health authorities updated guidance allowing for vaccine interchangeability. On June 17, the National Advisory Committee on Immunisation (NACI) announced that mRNA Covid-19 vaccines were deemed the “preferred” jabs for both the first and second dose even if the first was administered using AZ, which is manufactured in India under the Covishield brand name.In its recommendations, NACI said the mRNA vaccines should be preferred unless “is inaccessible or there is a contraindication, for example, an allergy to an mRNA vaccine or its components”. Only in the latter circumstances should a viral vector vaccine, like AZ, be offered.It also endorsed vaccine interchangeability, basically that doses can now be mixed with those receiving the first dose of AZ now being given the second dose as an mRNA vaccine such as those from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.NACI said that “emerging evidence” from studies in Germany have suggested a “potentially better immune response, including against variants of concern, when a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine is followed by a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, compared to two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine”. Similarly, it said, evidence suggested that such mixing “has a good safety profile”.The Trudeaus received their first injection at a pharmacy in Ottawa, and just before getting the jab, the Prime Minister said he was “very excited” to get it. While there have been concerns about adverse reactions to the AZ vaccine, Canadian health authorities have maintained that the “benefits of vaccines authorised in Canada continue to outweigh the risks”.In its latest data on adverse events linked to vaccines, the Public Health Agency of Canada had noted that of the 31,400,466 doses administered till June 18, just 1,719 or 0.005% had caused serious reactions. These include anaphylaxis or a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine, cases of blood clotting, a rare syndrome associated following vaccination with AZ/Covishield vaccine. Health authorities are also monitoring other reactions like capillary leak and Guillain-Barré Syndrome, linked to the AZ jab. The former causes fluid to leak from small blood vessels while the latter is an immune disorder. Health Canada has also recently introduced labelling for the mRNA vaccines, warning of the possibility of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canadian-pm-opts-for-moderna-vaccine-for-second-dose-101625201507679.html

The province of British Columbia has recorded 62 new fires in the past 24 hours. Almost 90 per cent of Lytton, which is 250 kilometres northwest of Vancouver, has been burnt.I spoke with @JJHorgan about the wildfires in Lytton and across BC. @BillBlair and @HarjitSajjan are working with their counterparts - and tomorrow, the Incident Response Group will go over the situation. We’re ready to assist in any way we can. More here: https://t.co/axu844VpJtPrime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with British Columbia Premier John Horgan and assured him of the government of Canada's support fr the people of Lytton.Lytton has 250 residents who were evacuated on Wednesday evening, a day after the temperature soared to 49.6 degrees Celsius (121 degrees Fahrenheit). The evacuation order was extended Wednesday night to residents of about 100 properties north of Lytton. So far, no injuries or death related to the fires have been reported.Lytton's Main Street, before and after yesterday's devastating fire. (Photo from a Chilliwack Fire Department member) pic.twitter.com/OaoRvg1ch3In the past 5 days, Vancouver reported 486 "sudden and unexpected" deaths, which is far above the regular number of 165 deaths for a similar period.The cause of the wildfire is yet to be ascertained, while the fire has been classified as "out of control" and is estimated to be 6,400 hectares in size, reports said."The last 24 hours have been devastating for Lytton residents," defence minister Harjit Sajjan wrote on Twitter.What happened in LyttonThis town, which is at 50 degree N latitude, almost the same as London, became one of the hottest places in the world on Sunday. On Monday, the mercury soared to 47.9 degree and on Tuesday, it was 49.6 degree. On Wednesday, the temperature came down and settled below 39 degree, a wildfire tore down the town in 15 minutes before the authorities could issue an official evacuation order.The heatwave situation has been attributed to the phenomenon called heat dome in which hit air gets trapped by high-pressure fronts pushing it back to the ground. In such a situation, cloud formation is prevented which, in turn, leads to more heating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1000-people-evacuated-in-and-around-western-canadian-village-as-wildfire-rages-101625198385809.html
02-07-2021||World||Trump firm, top executive charged with criminal tax fraud||Former US president Donald Trump’s eponymous company together with a related entity and a long-time top finance executive have been charged with running a scheme to defraud the federal Internal Revenue Service and New York state and New York City tax authorities for 15 years starting 2005.The Trump Organization, Trump Payroll Corporation, an entity that process payments and compensations to employees of the company and chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg were charged on Thursday with 15 felony counts including criminal tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records.Weisselberg is personally accused of evading taxes on $1.7 million in indirect income he received from the Trump Organization for a rented accommodation where he has lived for years, private school tuitions for members of his family, lease on two Mercedes Benz cars for himself and his wife.“To put it bluntly, this was a sweeping and audacious illegal payments scheme,” Carey Dunne, general counsel for the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R Vance, Jr, said during an arraignment in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, according to a report in the New York Times.Weisselberg was marched to court in handcuffs. He was released but his lawyers were made to surrender his passport as prosecutors argued he is a flight risk given his resources.Former president Trump dismissed the charges as a “political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats” and said the New York prosecutors, who are both Democrats, “now taking over the assignment, continues”. And sought to portray it as something that “dividing our country like never before”!Though Trump was not personally charged nor any of his children who have been involved in the running of the organisation, he was clearly bothered by the indictment of the company which made him famous around the world and which he liked to tout as a huge success, which, he had vowed to replicate as president.“If the name of the company was something else, I don’t think these charges would have been brought,” said Alan Futerfas, a Trump Organization attorney.The White House did not comment directly on the indictment. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One President Joe Biden “has made clear that it’s long past due for the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share”.The Thursday indictment came after two years of investigation that started with the conviction of Micheal Cohen, Trump’s once-time lawyer and fixer for making hush-money payments to women who had claimed to have had relations with Trump. Cohen had also said in a congressional testimony that the Trump Organization inflated the value of its assets when seeking bank loans and undervalued them for taxation purposes.Manhattan attorney had tried to pressure Weisselberg, who is considered the most important figure in the Trump Organization outside the Trump family, to cooperate and flip on the former president. He withstood the pressure, but experts believe the threat of a long prison sentence can make him change his mind.Weisselberg has pleaded not guilty. “He will fight these charges in court,” his lawyers, Mary E Mulligan and Bryan C Skarlatos, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-firm-top-executive-charged-with-criminal-tax-fraud-101625199765422.html

Anise is a colourless aniseed-flavored alcoholic beverage made from distilled spirit along with sweetener and is reported to be popular in Mediterranean nations. Anisette cookies are also very popular in the United States. Anise is a herb with its native in Egypt and was also used by Romans in medicine and to change their bitter taste, as per media reports.All you need to know:The drink obtained from the seed is intense and has a high liquor content, which makes it impossible to be drunk neat. It has been 200 years since the creation of the drink and is celebrated enthusiastically around the world every year on July 2.As a herb, anise was first used in Egypt during 1500 BC, as per Bible records, media reports said.Anís del Mono is the trademark for the famous anisette liqueur of Spain. Pastis is a kind of the same drink produced from aniseed and licorice root extracts.Anisette is mostly consumed in countries like Spain, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Greece, Lebanon, Cyprus, Israel, and France.A long fermentation process is involved in producing the liqueur and is the most common drink during Easter and Christmas times.It is not taken as it and is combined with the water which changes its colour to milky white. It is popularly called palomita in Italy and is often considered as a drink for refreshment.The Anisette water is often used for religious rituals in some countries. It is used spirited water offered to the goddess.The aniseed is used for medicinal purposes to cure epileptic, hysterical, rheumatic, septic, congestion and digestion problems. However, its heavy dosage can lead to respirational problems and is reportedly perhaps deprives blood circulation to some extent due to its narcotic effects. It could also lead to skin irritation and is not recommended during pregnancy.Star anise of some of the countries is considered highly toxic and dangerous if consumed and is also attributed to some kinds of cancer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-anisette-day-all-you-need-to-know-101625195632860.html

The day was first observed in 2001 by UFO researcher Haktan Akdogan. On the day, people gather together to watch the skies looking for extraterrestrial objects.Earlier, the day was celebrated on June 24 by some people while others observed it on July 2. Later, July 2 was officially declared as World UFO Day. It was also celebrated on June 24 because as per aviator Kenneth Arnold, nine unusual objects flew over Washington in the early 1990s on that day.Also read: Alien spacecrafts or earthlings? What Pentagon's UFO report says on sightingsJuly 2 is celebrated as World UFO Day to commemorate the supposed UFO crash incident in Roswell New Mexico in 1947. Thousands of researchers and paranormal enthusiasts gather for the UFO festival in Roswell every year.In the latest development, a day before the annual UFO day, the US federal government has decided to embark on a major overhaul of how documented encounters with unidentified flying crafts are tracked, organised and analysed. The examination is expected to be key investigations yielding conclusions that were lacking in the unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) study released last week, reported the Washington Times.The newly found legitimacy to the objects by government transparency and UAP investigations head by the Pentagon and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has made the event extra significant and prominent this year.In Roswell and other parts of the world, people have become more interested in knowing about UFOs. Researchers say that the next few months and years will be very crucial in determining if the shroud of secrecy has lifted, according to the Washington Times report.“Will this be carried through? Because this will not be done in a short amount of time. This is going to take years,” the Washington Times quoted Mark Rodeghier, scientific director at the Center for UFO Studies, as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-ufo-day-significance-and-developments-101625191933448.html

The US-based company said in a statement that recipients of its single-shot Covid-19 vaccine produced strong neutralising antibodies over the course of at least eight months against all variants including Delta, which was first seen in India and has been spreading around the world. The healthcare company added that its vaccine was 85 per cent effective and could also help prevent hospitalisation and death."Current data for the eight months studied so far shows that the single-shot Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine generates a strong neutralizing antibody response that does not wane; rather, we observe an improvement over time," Mathai Mammen, head of research & development at J&J's drugs business, said in the statement.Also read | UK approves single shot Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccineThe Delta variant contributed to a surge in Covid-19 cases in India and also prompted the UK to delay its reopening by one month in June. The Delta variant is expected to become the dominant strain in the US in the coming weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The findings disclosed by J&J on Thursday were from two studies. The company has submitted data as a preprint to the website bioRxiv ahead of peer review. The company said that its Covid-19 vaccine shot neutralised the Delta variant within 29 days of a first dose and protection matured and improved over time. J&J evaluated the blood samples of eight participants in its late-stage clinical trial of the Covid-19 vaccine to assess neutralising antibodies produced against the Delta variant.Also read | US looking at joint production of Johnson & Johnson vaccine in India“We’re extremely happy, actually, and confident there’s no need for the booster at the moment and we’re protected against different strains,” said Johan Van Hoof, J&J’s global head of infectious diseases and vaccines, in an interview, according to Bloomberg.Van Hoof said J&J doesn’t believe people given its Covid-19 vaccine should need a booster within a year of getting the jab. “And if a boost is needed we don’t think we’ll need to change the formulation,” he said.Scientists and some vaccine manufacturers have been creating updated versions of their Covid-19 vaccines to directly target the emerging variants, which have been seen as significantly more transmissible than the original coronavirus that first emerged in China's Wuhan in 2019.Other vaccine makers, including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna Inc, and AstraZeneca Plc, have previously said that their Covid-19 vaccines are effective against the fast-spreading Delta variant.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-neutralises-delta-variant-lasts-at-least-8-months-j-j-101625192855724.html

Imran Khan also said China's take on the Uighur issue was completely different from what was being reported in the Western media. "Because of our extreme proximity and relationship with China, we actually accept the Chinese version," Khan was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper on Thursday.Last month, Imran Khan when asked about his silence on the atrocities on Uighur Muslims in China and outspokenness about Islamophobia in Europe and the US, he said he is "more concerned about what is happening at the border of his country." Khan, in an interview with HBO Axios, also said he has been talking to Beijing "behind the closed doors" and he has been informed, "this is not the case, according to the Chinese people."Also read | Imran Khan on Uighur Muslims genocide: 'China one of the greatest friends’An estimated 1 million people or more -- most of them Uighurs -- have been confined in mass detention camps in the Xinjiang region in recent years, researchers have said. China has been accused of imposing forced labour, systematic forced birth control, torture and separating children from incarcerated parents. China has time and time refuted these allegations of interning millions of Uighurs and said these are education camps to wean them away from religious extremism."It is hypocritical. There are much worse human rights violations taking place in other parts of the world... But Western media hardly comment on this," Imran Khan said, lashing out at Western media for highlighting the Uighurs' situation and Hong Kong.Also read | Amnesty calls Xinjiang a ‘dystopian hellscape’The United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and several other countries have accused China of committing genocide against the Uighurs in resource-rich Xinjiang and called for an international probe by human rights groups.China accuses East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) of being responsible for several violent attacks in the province and outside, including one at the Forbidden City in Beijing in 2013, which have killed several people.Also read | US, Canada, UK call on China to end 'repression' in XinjiangBeijing has sharply criticised the US for delisting Xinjiang’s separatist militant outfit from its list of terrorist organisations last year, saying it reflected Washington’s "double standards" on fighting global terrorism.Imran Khan said China has always stood by Pakistan whenever his country has faced trouble, politically or internationally.

02-07-2021||World||Nasa's Perseverance rover 'takes the wheel' in search of signs of ancient life||Perseverance rover, the National Aeronautical Space Agency's (Nasa's) newest six wheeled-robot on Mars, is beginning an epic journey across a crater floor for the signs of ancient life on the planet, the agency said on Thursday. Nasa said the rover team will now be deeply engaged with planning navigation routes, drafting instructions to be beamed up, and will even use special 3D glasses to help map the course. However, it said, the rover will take charge of the drive-by itself, using a powerful auto-navigation system.The enhanced system is called AutoNav and makes 3D maps of the terrain ahead, identifies hazards, and plans a route around any obstacles without additional direction from controllers back on Earth.Also read: Scientists closer to solving methane mystery on Mars, says Nasa"We have a capability called ‘thinking while driving'. The rover is thinking about the autonomous drive while its wheels are turning,” said Vandi Verma, a senior engineer, rover planner, and driver at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.AutoNav is considered to be the key feature in helping the Perseverance rover in its first science campaign on the floor of Jezero Crater. The team members look forward to letting AutoNav “take the wheel" but will intervene when needed.The space agency said that the rover might hit a top speed of 393 feet or 120 metres per hour, more than its predecessor, Curiosity, which was equipped with an earlier version of AutoNav that covers about 66 feet or 20 metres per hour as it climbs Mount Sharp to the southeast.“We sped up AutoNav by four or five times,” said Michael McHenry, the mobility domain lead and part of JPL’s team of rover planners. “We’re driving a lot farther in a lot less time than Curiosity demonstrated.”When Mars was wetter than today, billions of years ago, this crater was a lake and the Perseverance’s destination is a dried-out river delta at the crater’s edge, the agency said. If life ever existed on the red planet, signs of it might be found there, as per the agency. The rover will gather samples over some 9 miles (15km), prep the samples for collection by a future mission that would take it back to Earth for analysis.The space agency said the delay in radio signal between Earth and Mars makes it difficult for the team as they need to scrutinize satellite images, sometimes donning those 3D glasses to view the Martian surface in the rover’s vicinity. When the team signs off, the instructions are beamed to Mars and the rover executes them the following day.Perseverance’s wheels were modified as well to help with just how swiftly those plans are executed. Along with being slightly greater in diameter and narrower than Curiosity’s wheels, they each feature 48 treads that look like slightly wavy lines, as opposed to Curiosity’s 24 chevron-pattern treads. The goals were to help with traction as well as durability, Nasa said in a statement.Perseverance can also employ one of its computers for navigation on the surface and its main computer can devote itself to the other tasks. This Vision Compute Element, or VCE, guided Perseverance to the Martian surface during its entry, descent, and landing in February and is now used full-time to map out the rover's journey.It also keeps track of its movements using a system called "visual odometry". The rover periodically captures images as it moves, comparing one position to the next to see if it moved the expected distance."Jezero is incredible. It’s a rover driver’s paradise. When you put on the 3D glasses, you see so much more undulation in the terrain. Some days I just stare at the images,” Verma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-perseverance-rover-takes-the-wheel-in-search-of-signs-of-ancient-life-101625184780185.html

Bezos' company Blue Origin said in an announcement on Thursday Wally Funk will be aboard the July 20 launch from West Texas, flying in the capsule as an “honored guest.” She will join Jeff Bezos, his brother and the winner of a $28 million charity auction, as the first people to ride a New Shepard rocket. At 82, Funk will be the oldest person ever to travel into space, Blue Origin said in an announcement on Thursday.Wally Funk said she feels “fabulous” about finally getting the chance to go to space--after six decades of acing astronaut tests but barred because she was a woman. "I didn't think I would ever get to go up," Funk said in a video interview posted on the company's website.Also read | Bezos going into space on July 20, beating ‘space barons’ Musk, Branson to it “I’ll love every second of it. Whoooo! Ha-ha. I can hardly wait. Nothing has ever gotten in my way. They said, ‘Well, you’re a girl, you can’t do that.’ I said, 'Guess what, doesn’t matter what you are. You can still do it if you want to do it and I like to do things that nobody has ever done,” Funk said in an Instagram video posted by Bezos.'It's time'“No one has waited longer. It’s time. Welcome to the crew, Wally,” Bezos, who is stepping down as the chief executive of Amazon on July 5, said via Instagram.Wally Funk will beat the late John Glenn, who set a record at age 77 when flying aboard space shuttle Discovery in 1998. Glenn dismissed the idea of women flying in space, shortly after he became the first American to orbit the world in 1962.Also read | Jeff Bezos says Blue Origin will take the first woman to moon’s surfaceFunk at 21 was the youngest of the 13 women who passed the same rigorous physical tests as the Mercury Seven male astronauts in Nasa's program that first sent Americans into space between 1961 and 1963. All of the women passed but they were denied the chance to become astronauts themselves because of their gender. The Russians went on to launch Valentina Tereshkova—the first woman into space—in 1963.Also read | Thousands sign petition to stop Bezos from returning to Earth after space trip“They told me that I had done better and completed the work faster than any of the guys. So I got hold of Nasa four times. I said I want to become an astronaut, but nobody would take me.

Responding to the reports, the United States said that the "dramatic build-up" of Beijing's nuclear arsenal was concerning and called for "practical measures to reduce the risks of destabilizing arms races -- potentially destabilizing tensions".Also Read | For CCP, the era of seeking strengthThe Washington Post first carried the report with satellite images of around 119 construction sites which mirror China's existing arsenal of nuclear-tipped ballistic missile launch facilities. These photos, obtained and analysed by researchers at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California, showed that the construction of these missile silos is already underway at several sites in the desert spanning hundreds of square miles in China's Gansu province.Taking note of the reports, US state department spokesperson Ned Price said that Washington considers this buildup "concerning" and questioned the intent of the People's Republic of China (PRC). "These reports and other developments suggest that the PRC's nuclear arsenal will grow more quickly, and to a higher level than perhaps previously anticipated," Price said while addressing a regular news briefing.Highlighting that the US government is trying to engage other nuclear powers, including Russia, in an agreement prioritising strategic stability, he said that the same rationale also applies to China.Also Read | As CCP celebrates its centenary, Mao’s hydraulic legacy lives onBeijing, on the other hand, has insisted that its military or nuclear arsenal is insignificant compared to that of the United States or Russia and has called for bilateral dialogues on strategic security that respect "equality".Notably, the Pentagon had estimated last year that China's nuclear warhead stockpile was somewhere in "the low 200s" and could double in size with the country's recent push to develop fuel for a new generation of nuclear reactors. The US stockpile of nuclear weapons, in contrast, consisted of around 3,800 warheads, of which 1,357 have already been deployed, a factsheet issued by the US state department stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/photos-show-china-building-over-100-nuclear-missile-silos-us-voices-concern-101625182765642.html

02-07-2021||World||Covid-19 Delta variant: White House to send special teams to hotspots across US||The White House on Thursday said it would send out special teams to hot spots around the United States to combat the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant amid rising case counts in parts of the country where vaccination rates remain low.The speedy US vaccination campaign has dramatically reduced Covid-19 cases among residents. The peak seven-day-average of more than 250,000 cases per day in January fell to around 11,000 in mid-June.But daily cases have since leveled out and in the past week rose about 10% to about 12,500, driven by case increases in the Midwest and Southeast where vaccination rates are low and where the highly contagious Delta variant, first found in India earlier this year, is spreading.White House Covid-19 senior adviser Jeffrey Zients told reporters that "surge response" teams would be ready to speed additional testing supplies and therapeutics to communities that were experiencing increases in Covid-19 cases.More than 180 million people and more than 66% of adults in the United States have received shots, but around 1,000 counties still have vaccination rates below 30%, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky said on a Tuesday news call."It is clear that communities where people remain unvaccinated are communities that remain vulnerable," Walensky said.Nevada and Missouri now have the highest rates of Covid-19 infection, and there have been recent outbreaks in states including Utah, Wyoming and Nebraska, Michael Newshel, a healthcare analyst for Evercore ISI, wrote in a Tuesday analyst note.The more easily transmitted Delta variant is thought to have become the second most prevalent coronavirus variant in the United States, Walensky added.The Delta variant previously contributed to a surge in Covid-19 cases in India that resulted in the highest daily deaths in the world. It also prompted the United Kingdom to delay its reopening by one month in June.Recent studies suggest that existing vaccines are highly effective against the Delta variant. The protection is strongest in those who received both doses of two-dose shot regimens, such as those made by Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc .Both shots, which have been the mainstays of the United States vaccination campaign, have been shown to be highly effective against the original variant Covid-19 and several newer variants.Zients said the White House is mobilizing federal personnel to assist communities with public health staffing and the CDC will provide assistance in containing potential outbreaks.Zients said that the White House will have exported around 40 million shots by the end of the week to countries including Bangladesh, Ecuador and Taiwan.The Biden administration is planning a 1,000-person Fourth of July celebration on the White House lawn with essential workers and military personnel, partly to celebrate the United States' success in driving down Covid-19 cases."Right now it's an appropriate time to step back and celebrate the progress we've made; at the same time, we've got a lot more work to do," Zients said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-white-house-to-send-special-teams-to-hotspots-across-us-101625170338693.html
02-07-2021||World||US govt warns of dangers of systemic racism in human trafficking report||An annual US State Department report released on Thursday said discriminatory policies perpetuated human trafficking, drawing a link with systemic racism in the United States and abroad for the first time.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in the Trafficking in Persons report that inequities undercut Washington's battle against human trafficking."If we're serious about ending trafficking in persons, we must also work to combat systemic racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination," Blinken said.A State Department official said it was the first time the report drew a connection to systemic racism."We know that talking about these issues in the report is just the beginning and are committed to working with our partners to create and implement plans for how to ground our anti-trafficking response in equity going forward," a senior State Department official said.The United States has been re-examining its treatment of African Americans since nationwide protests last year sparked by the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white police officer.US authorities have also warned of increased threats from white supremacist groups.The report also cited the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on human trafficking, as traffickers capitalized on the pandemic and governments diverted resources to fight the health crisis.The report looked at countries and territories and ranked them into four tiers, downgrading countries such as Ethiopia but upgrading others.ETHIOPIAThe United States faulted Ethiopia for not demonstrating increased efforts to eliminate trafficking.The report highlighted the conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region that has killed thousands of people, displaced more than 2 million people and pushed hundreds of thousands to the brink of famine.The report said that since the conflict began in November, international organizations increasingly reported armed actors were responsible for committing human rights abuses and gender-based violence, including potential trafficking crimes.Ethiopians seeking asylum in Sudan were increasingly vulnerable to trafficking and unaccompanied children in the conflict areas may be vulnerable to recruitment by non-state armed groups, the report also warned.BELARUSBelarus was cited for "key achievements" even if, as the report said, resident Alexander Lukashenko’s government did not "fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking."The report made no mention of Lukashenko’s brutal crackdown on ongoing protests over his claim of victory in a 2020 presidential election widely seen as being rigged.SAUDI ARABIASaudi Arabia, a key US ally in the Middle East, was cited for "making significant efforts" toward eliminating human trafficking, the report said.However, the government failed to meet minimum standards in a number of areas, including fining, jailing and deporting foreign workers for prostitution or immigration violations even though many may have been trafficking victims, the report said.ISRAELThe report said Israel, Washington’s closest Middle Eastern ally, had worked to eliminate human trafficking, but its efforts “were not serious and sustained” compared to the previous reporting period even accounting for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.Victim identification policies “sometimes re-traumatized” victims and delayed their access to necessary care, sometimes for years, while the government reduced its overall efforts to investigate, prosecute and convict traffickers, it said.CHINAThe report repeated past charges that China has "a government policy or pattern of widespread forced labor," including through the continued mass arbitrary detention of more than one million ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang, where the United States has accused Beijing of committing genocide against the minorities.TURKEYThe United States added Turkey to the list of countries implicated in the use of child soldiers over the past year, placing a NATO ally for the first time in such a list, in a move likely to further complicate fraught ties between Ankara and Washington.MALAYSIAThe State Department downgraded Malaysia to the worst ranking after a string of complaints by rights groups and US authorities over the alleged exploitation of migrant workers in plantations and factories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-govt-warns-of-dangers-of-systemic-racism-in-human-trafficking-report-101625168415435.html
