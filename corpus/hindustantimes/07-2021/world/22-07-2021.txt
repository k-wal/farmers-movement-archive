22-07-2021||World||Should you be worried about 'breakthrough' Covid cases amid Delta surge? Here's what experts say||The reports of fully vaccinated people testing positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has caused concern for the authorities around the world who were depending on vaccination to contain the virus surge. While the ‘breakthrough’ Covid-19 cases raise questions about the efficacy of vaccines, especially against the highly contagious Delta variant, health experts have said that they are not a cause for alarm.What are breakthrough cases?When a fully vaccinated individual gets infected with coronavirus, it is termed a breakthrough case. UK health secretary Sajid Javid, some White House staffers, and athletes taking part in Tokyo Olympics testing for Covid-19 are examples of breakthrough cases.Covid-19 vaccines generate neutralising antibodies that work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen whenever the body is exposed to the virus. Recent studies have suggested that Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines have been highly effective against Sars-Cov-2.However, the same vaccines have shown reduced efficacy against the Delta variant which has been identified in at least 124 countries and is rapidly becoming the dominant variant across the world. But it is still good at protecting people from severe illness - a strong reason to get vaccinated.Why do breakthrough cases occur?Dr William Moss, a vaccine expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it’s difficult to determine the reason behind a particular breakthrough case but viral load could be a factor in such infections. Moss said that underlying health conditions or medications taken by them could make their immune system less responsive to the vaccines. He added that most people with breakthrough infections experience mild illness.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said that vaccine breakthrough cases are expected since no vaccines are 100% effective. It also noted that a small percentage of fully vaccinated people will get sick, hospitalised and even die from Covid-19. While the current data, as per the CDC, suggest that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines offer protection against most variants, however, they will cause some vaccine breakthrough cases.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/should-you-be-worried-about-breakthrough-covid-cases-here-s-what-experts-say-101626972479400.html

However, the EU was still short of the 70% vaccination target it had set for the summer this year.Dana Spinant, spokesperson for the European Commission, said, “As many as 54.7% of the adult population is fully vaccinated with either both doses or the single dose — in the case of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine,” citing the latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), news agency AFP reported. “We have 68.4% of adults in the EU who have already received their first dose,” Spinant further said.Meanwhile, the ECDC’s Covid-19 vaccine tracker showed that 437,842,446 doses have been distributed to the member states of the bloc. Of these, 371,127,468 doses have been administered by the EU states.The data also showed that 212,732,730 adults (above the age of 18) have received at least one dose of the vaccine while 167,310,628 adults have been fully immunised against the coronavirus disease in the EU.Also read | Covid Delta variant now in 124 countries, to dominate within months, says WHO“We are now among the regions of the world that have vaccinated the most, but it is important that this progress is distributed in a more balanced way so that there are no pockets where the virus can spread and mutate,” Spinant told reporters.Earlier this month, president of the European Commission (EC) Ursula von der Leyen said that enough vaccine doses have been delivered to the EU countries to achieve the target of fully inoculating 70% adults by the end of July.“Target achieved! We have delivered enough vaccines to EU countries to fully vaccinate at least 70% of EU adults still this month. COVID-19 is not yet defeated. But we are prepared to deliver more vaccines. We will only come out of this crisis together,” she had tweeted on July 10.Further, the European Commission chief also said that more than 200 million vaccine doses would be shared by Europe with low- and middle-income countries by the end of this year.“Team Europe takes its responsibility in helping the world fight the virus, everywhere. Vaccination is key —that's why it is essential to ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines to countries worldwide. We will be sharing more than 200 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines with low and middle-income countries by the end of this year,” Ursula von der Leyen said, a press release from the EC showed.Earlier in May 2021, von der Leyen had committed at least 100 million doses to be distributed via the COVAX programme to the countries in need. However, in her latest announcement she said that the EU is on track to exceed this goal.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-half-of-adult-population-in-europe-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19-eu-101626971535121.html

The Perseverance rover, which landed on Mars on February 18, has been exploring a 4 square kilometre patch of the crater floor in search of a scientifically interesting target to collect Martian rocks.The US space agency said on Wednesday that the rover will require about 11 days to complete its first sampling with the help of the ‘Sampling and Caching System’. The rover will perform an imagery survey to help Nasa’s science team determine the exact location for collecting the sample. The mission is aimed at learning whether life ever existed on Mars.“The idea is to get valuable data on the rock we are about to sample by finding its geologic twin and performing detailed in-situ analysis,” said science campaign co-lead Vivian Sun, from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.The science team has identified the Jezero Crater as an ancient lakebed that gradually dried up as the climate on the Red Planet changed. Scientists have planned to collect rocks from Jezero Crater since evidence of life on Earth is often preserved in the mud and sand deposited at the bottom of the lake. The ongoing mission is the first leg of a relay race to return samples from Mars.Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at Nasa Headquarters, said in a statement that Neil Armstrong began a process that would rewrite what humanity knew about the Moon when he collected the first sample from the ‘Sea of Tranquility’ during the Apollo 11 mission.“I have every expectation that Perseverance’s first sample from Jezero Crater, and those that come after, will do the same for Mars. We are on the threshold of a new era of planetary science and discovery,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-perseverance-rover-prepares-to-collect-first-martian-sample-for-earth-101626965639001.html

The data is very close to the findings of a similar survey done by the company back in 2018. However, the company also said that the number of customers who were exposed to such scams globally has come down in comparison with 2018 data.Findings from the survey were published in the Global Tech Support Scam Research 2021 report released by Microsoft on Thursday. YouGov, a market research firm, was commissioned by Microsoft to conduct the survey. The web-based survey was conducted between May 6 and May 17, across 16 countries in which 16,254 adult internet users were involved. The sample size from each country included internet users based on age, gender and region.Also read | US, allies accuse China of Microsoft Exchange hackIn India, tech support scams by unsolicited telephone calls witnessed the maximum increase since 2018. While it was 23% in the last survey, it grew to 31%, an increase of eight percentage points. Also, pop-up advertisements or windows, unsolicited emails, redirects to websites remained the other forms of the scam.The report showed that in India 31% people continued to respond to the scam and also lost money. It was 14% in 2018. Moreover, 48% people were tricked into continuing with the scam while this was recorded at 40% in the 2018 survey. The global average of the respondents who continued with the scam was 16%, the 2021 report also showed.Microsoft said that the high number of people being exposed to scams in India was likely due to customers believing that a company would initiate contact and being more trusting of such unsolicited contact. In addition to this, on average, ₹15,334 was lost by customers to the scams but 88% people who lost money were able to recover some amount back.Globally, “three out of five consumers have encountered a tech support scam in the last 12 months,” Microsoft said. In terms of age demographics, millennials (between 24 and 37 years old) and Gen Z (between 18 and 23 years old) were found to have the highest exposure to tech support scams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-survey-finds-69-people-in-india-encountered-tech-support-scams-in-past-12-months-101626958319837.html

Army personnel and firefighters continued to help citizens stranded without food and shelter.More cities in the province have been flooded and farmlands destroyed as the severe weather spread northwards closer to Hebei, a northern province near national capital, Beijing.Xinhua news agency reported direct economic losses of 1.22 billion yuan ($189 million) until Thursday.Torrential rain has affected about 3 million people in Henan province, severely impacting the capital city, Zhengzhou, where 12 people died in a flooded subway train carriage on Tuesday.376,000 RESIDENTS RELOCATEDA total of 376,000 residents have been relocated to safe places, said the provincial emergency management department.Global Times newspaper reported that “…electricity was still a luxury for some parts of the city as of Wednesday… A total of 468 out of 602 power lines haven’t been restored as of Wednesday night”.The province has seen widespread damage to crops.“Rainwater has damaged more than 215,200 hectares of crops, causing a direct economic loss of about 1.22 billion yuan,” the Xinhua report said.“Henan is one of China’s major crop production regions and contributed 10% of the country’s total harvests.”As the unprecedented rainstorm moved north on Thursday, more than 73,000 people were being evacuated from the city of Anyang, on Henan’s border with Hebei province. Anyang has been swamped by more than 600mm of rainfall since Monday, Xinhua reported.Hourly rainfall in Zhengzhou, at the centre of this round of heavy rainfall, has hit a record high for the Chinese mainland, according to meteorologists.Meanwhile, from 8am on Saturday to 8am on Wednesday, the accumulated precipitation in parts of Zhengzhou exceeded the city’s annual average of 641mm.FLOODED HOSPITALSXinhua reported that incessant rains have flooded and damaged many hospitals in Henan province with patients and medical staff stuck inside, waiting to be evacuated.It included the Fuwai Central China Cardiovascular hospital in the county of Zhongmu, under the jurisdiction of Zhengzhou.“We have 1,075 regular patients and 69 in severe conditions, and the number of family members is about 1,300,” said Gao Chuanyu, vice president of the hospital.“Most people will be brought to safety by rafts, but for critically ill patients, we need to use helicopters.”The Xinhua report said that at the entrance and inside the hospital registration hall, rescuers in yellow life vests use rafts to transport patients who are stuck inside.“The hospital was completely engulfed by floodwater,” said rescuer Chen Lixin. “There was no drinking water, no electricity, no internet connection, nothing.”FINANCIAL SUPPORTThe Chinese finance ministry has earmarked 100 million yuan ($15.42 million) of disaster relief funds for Henan.China’s state assets regulator on Thursday said that centrally administered state-owned enterprises have donated a total of 686 million yuan ($106 million) for disaster relief.China’s national meteorological centre has forecast that Henan will see more rain and it will likely abate on Friday.“Experts have warned of an extremely high risk of disasters caused by the continuous rainfall, calling for local governments to enhance prevention and control of floods and geological disasters and strengthen epidemic prevention work in advance,” Xinhua reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-floods-death-toll-33-economic-loss-closing-on-200mn-101626956819468.html
22-07-2021||World||Was awaiting death: Survivors share details of being stuck on China subway flood||As many as 33 people reportedly died and several still remain missing as rescue operations continue following the worst flood in China in 1,000 years. Torrential rains triggered landslides and the floods, leading inundated neighbourhoods, trapped passengers in subway cars, and even overflowing dams.Henan, which is China’s most populous province, has been worst affected. Several thousand who are trapped are reportedly being evacuated. In Henan’s capital Zhengzhou – home to 12 million people — as many as 12 people were killed after they were trapped for hours on a flooded subway line.In interviews with local media, and on social media, some survivors have now shared how water entered and caused disaster on the underground Line 5 of the Zhengzhou subway, CNN reported. Notably, the incident unfolded during the evening rush hour on Tuesday wherein several passengers were trapped after rising rainwater entered into the tunnel and seeped inside the trains.Survivors recount horrorIn a post on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, a woman said water began to seep into the carriage soon after it stopped between two stations. Subway staff had initially instructed passengers to leave the train and evacuate through the tunnel, but were soon told to head back due to gushing floodwater ahead, the CNN report added.However, when the commuters reached the subway cars, the water had already reached their waists – and it kept rising as more water entered the tunnel and the carriage through gaps between the subway car doors. “We tried to stand on seats as much as we could, but even then, the water reached our chests in the end,” CNN quoted her as writing on Weibo.She, however, added that the most “terrifying” thing was not the rising floodwater, but the “diminishing air in the carriage – as many seemed to have trouble breathing.” “I was really scared,” she wrote.At this time, she heard another woman providing her family with her bank details over the phone, and she wondered if she should follow suit, the CNN report added. She ended up sending a message to her mother, telling her that she “might not make it.” She spent the next two and half hours on the “brink of breakdown” while awaiting rescue.The woman, however, fainted later due to lack of oxygen and was awakened by a call from her mother, who informed that rescue was on the way. It was then that she heard footsteps atop the train as firefighters smashed open the windows to let fresh air in. Eventually, more rescuers arrived before the passengers were evacuated one after another – those who fainted first, followed by women.Strangely, the woman’s post on Weibo was later deleted and CNN said that they failed to verify her account as well.In another such experience recounted by a survivor, a woman told state-run China Youth Daily that she failed to control herself from weeping after noticing flood water seeping inside the train. Some other people around her also cried. Several others attempted to call an emergency number and even asked their family and friends to get help, but to no avail. She said that among the passengers were pregnant women, elderly people, and even children. By 9pm when the water inside the carriage reached their throats, people around her began gasping for air, retching and shaking, the CNN report stated.“I was really terrified at that time. When I saw the water rising above our heads outside the window, I was preparing myself to accept that I would never be able to get out,” CNN quoted her as saying to China Youth Daily.Her phone only had 30% battery left, and she closed all other apps and sent messages to her relatives and friends on WeChat. She asked her parents to send help till 9pm, but after that, she was primarily making arrangements for people to take care of things in the event she died.Floods in central China have made several other cities come to a standstill as well. Aerial views of the region after the floods hit showed cars piled up one over another in highways. The Chinese military has opened a dam to release the floodwater from Henan, however, they added that the death toll is likely to rise further, the Associated Press reported.According to CNN, officials said that over 6,000 firefighters and 2,000 military and paramilitary forces had been deployed across regions affected by the disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/was-awaiting-death-survivors-share-details-of-being-stuck-on-china-subway-flood-101626952639109.html
22-07-2021||World||'I’m sorry': Australian PM on slow vaccine rollout amid spike in Covid-19 cases||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday apologised to his country for the slow rollout of Covid-19 vaccination campaign, even as cases due to the virus outbreak continue to see a spike amid lockdown.Talking to reporters, Morrison said, “I’m sorry that we haven’t been able to achieve the marks that we had hoped for at the beginning of this year.”The country has been inoculating less than 150,000 Covid-19 vaccine jabs a day – much behind other developed countries.Two of the country’s largest states – New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria - logged sharp increases in the daily infection rates on Wednesday. While NSW, which houses Australia’s largest city Sydney, recorded 110 new cases – up from 78 on the preceding day - Victoria clocked 22 fresh cases. Sydney was put under lockdown on June 26, and the same will remain enforced until at least July 30. Meanwhile, Victoria is staring at an almost two-week lockdown.Speaking at a televised news conference on Wednesday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said, “Had we not gone into a lockdown a few weeks ago, the 110 number today would undoubtedly have been thousands and thousands.”However, Berejiklian has urged the people of NSW to get vaccinated and “brace” amid anticipations that “case numbers will continue to go up before they start coming down”.She further stated that whether NSW will exit the lockdown by July 30 target cannot be confirmed until the following week due to rise in coronavirus cases.The Australian government has said that it will meet its target of vaccinating its adult population by the end of 2021 as millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses from Moderna and Pfizer are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, a third state – South Australia - began its first day of a week-long lockdown on Wednesday. Furthermore, NSW’s neighbouring state Queensland has closed its border with the former due to the spike in cases, thereby shutting off one of Australia’s most travelled routes.The highly virulent and transmissible Delta variant of Covid-19 has been confirmed in 124 countries now, including Australia, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. First detected in India, the variant is “expected” to “rapidly outcompete other variants and become the dominant circulating lineage over the coming months,” the global health agency stated in its weekly epidemiological update.Notably, the Delta variant accounts for over 75 per cent of coronavirus cases in multiple nations, including Australia, South Africa, Great Britain, Russia, Singapore, and India, among others. The US health officials on Tuesday confirmed that the variant is responsible for nearly 83 per cent of the cases in the country.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/im-sorry-australian-pm-on-slow-vaccine-rollout-amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases-101626942519140.html

Afghan local authorities in the northern province said on Wednesday that the Taliban are forcing the local people who live in areas under the group's control in Balkh province to pay them part of their income. They are also recruiting locals forcefully, local media reported."There are only about 20 Taliban fighters inside the district building compound and the police headquarters; the rest of them have taken up positions inside the villages to collect Zakat (charity)," Mohammad Yousuf, the acting district governor of Kaldar district, was reported saying by the news agency ANI.The number of Taliban fighters in the district is about 200 fighters, but they are looking to recruit more fighters from among the people, local media said in its report.The Taliban has also imposed taxes on the shops and local markets, which locals say that it "beyond their capacity" to pay. In case one fails to pay the money that the Taliban is harassing them, ANI reported quoting Mohammad Hashem Mansoori, a District Governor for Shortepa district in Balkh province.Due to this, business activity in the region has also been affected, it also reported. "The people have serious concerns, the business owners are very fearful because of the businesses," said Sifatullah, a resident in Hairatan, as per ANI.Meanwhile, security forces have assured them that they are fully prepared to defend the Afghan people and said that they will soon launch an "offensive" against the Taliban. "The morale of our forces is very high; they are fully prepared and have the strength to defend the city. Soon we will launch our offensive operations," said Khanullah Shuja, the commander of 209 Shaheen Army Corps.Insecurity has been growing in Afghanistan in recent weeks, largely spurred by fighting in its provinces as US-led foreign troops complete their withdrawal and the Taliban launch major offensives, taking districts and border crossings.More than 200 of the 419 district centres were under Taliban control as of this week, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had informed the media on Wednesday. While the insurgent group had not taken over any provincial capitals, they were putting pressure on the outskirts of half of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-tightens-grip-over-afghanistan-levies-high-taxes-recruits-forceful-101626933364872.html
22-07-2021||World||China rejects WHO proposal for second Covid-19 origin study||China on Thursday rejected the World Health Organization’s (WHO) plan for the second phase of the Covid-19 origin study, saying it is “shocked” by the proposal as it contains language that does not respect science.China opposes politicising the study into the origin of the virus, national health commission (NHC) vice minister Zeng Yixin said on Thursday.Beijing’s angry reaction comes after WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said last week that it was premature to rule out a potential link between the Covid-19 pandemic and a laboratory leak, adding that he had asked China to be more transparent as scientists search for the origin of the coronavirus.The first cases of the disease were identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 before it triggered the worst pandemic in a century, killing and infecting millions and stalling the global economy.China has voiced strong opposition against international opinion, which believes a high-security bio lab in Wuhan was the source of the virus.There have also been a spate of articles, some offering very-plausible arguments on why the virus may have been engineered. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the pandemic has thus far infected at least 192.1mn people around the world, killed over 4.1mn while it has also ravaged economies. Zeng said China cannot accept the current version of the WHO plan because it has been compromised by political manipulation and disrespects scientific facts.Chinese state media quoted Zeng as saying the second phase of the proposed study has listed the hypothesis that China had violated lab regulations and leaked the virus as one of the major research objectives, and he was “very shocked” after reading the proposal.“We hope the WHO should carefully consider the advice by Chinese scientists, take investigating the origin of the Covid-19 virus as a scientific question free from political interference, and proactively and properly conduct sustained investigations into the origin of the virus in various countries,” he said.Zeng rejected that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had three infected workers, carried out gain-of-function research (which increases the virulence of virus), and engineered the virus. There was zero infection among staff and students at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said Yuan Zhiming, director of the National Biosafety Laboratory at the presser.In a departure from his earlier narrative, the WHO chief had said last week that getting access to raw data had been a challenge for the international team of scientists who travelled to China earlier this year to investigate the Covid-19 origin.According to an Associated Press report from Berlin, Tedros told reporters that the UN health agency based in Geneva is “actually asking China to be transparent, open and cooperate, especially on the information, raw data that we asked for in the early days of the pandemic”.China has consistently been on the offensive in countering allegations on the Wuhan lab leak theory.On Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that in less than five days, about 5 million Chinese have signed an open letter, asking the WHO to investigate the US’ Fort Detrick lab over Covid-19 origin instead.The rising numbers are a representation of the anger of the Chinese people at the political manipulation by some in the US on Covid-19 origin, Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angry-china-rejects-who-proposal-for-second-covid-19-origin-study-101626933165159.html

The US and others say that China has not been transparent about what happened in the early days of the pandemic. China accuses critics of politicizing an issue that should be left to scientists.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of WHO, acknowledged last week that it was premature to rule out a potential link between the pandemic and a leak from a Chinese government lab in Wuhan, the city where the disease was first detected in late 2019.Zeng said the Wuhan lab has no virus that can directly infect humans. He noted that a WHO-coordinated team of international experts who visited the lab earlier this year concluded that a lab leak was highly unlikely.Most experts believe the virus most likely jumped from animals to humans. The highly politicized debate centers on whether a lab leak is so unlikely that the theory should be ruled out as a possibility, or if it merits further study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cant-accept-who-s-plan-for-2nd-phase-of-covid-19-origins-study-china-101626931045839.html

Tens of thousands of people are reportedly being evacuated from the flood-hit province of Henan, one of the most heavily populated provinces in central China where heavy rains over the week have inundated key areas and destroyed crops.China's military has blasted open a dam to release the floodwater threatening the Henan province, the Associated Press reported, adding that the death toll is likely to climb further.The floods in China have resulted in direct economic losses worth 1.22 billion yuan ($189 million) so far, the Xinhua news agency reported. As of late Wednesday, more than 470,000 people and over 55,000 hectares of crops have been affected by the heavy downpours in Xinxiang, a small city north of the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, Xinhua added. The local government reportedly deployed more than 76,000 personnel, part of a search and rescue team.Among those who died were 12 people who could not be rescued from a subway in Zhengzhou when the floodwater drowned the trapped individuals in the narrow underpass. The fatal flooding prompted the government to order local authorities to immediately improve urban transit flood controls and emergency responses.More than 73,000 people were being evacuated from the city of Anyang, on Henan's border with Hebei province, after being swamped by more than 600 mm of rainfall since Monday, Xinhua reported.China has raised a red storm alert for four cities in the north of Henan -- Xinxiang, Anyang, Hebi, and Jiaozuo. The red alert is the highest state of storm alert in a four-tier colour-coded weather warning system followed by the country. The provincial weather bureau told state media it had issued a report warning of the coming torrential rains two days in advance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-floods-death-toll-goes-up-to-33-thousands-evacuated-from-henan-province-101626923266923.html

The forum is partly supported by the Canadian government and it is customary of the country’s defence minister to open the annual event.HFX Taipei will be held over a period of three days in the Taiwanese capital. In a statement, HFX president Peter van Praagh said, “HFX will celebrate the courage and achievements of one of Asia’s most vibrant democracies by holding a landmark international security forum in Taipei.”“All people who value democracy will immediately recognise the importance of showing solidarity with the Taiwanese people at this time,” he added.It is expected that President Tsai will receive her honour in Taipei which will ensure the Canadian government does not have to deal with the nettlesome issue of having to host the Taiwanese leader.The forum will be held, as usual, in November this year in Halifax. Relations between Canada and China remain cold since Beijing arrested two Canadians, businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig, days after a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei Meng Wanzhou was detained in Vancouver in December 2018 for possible deportation to the US with relation to a case of alleged defrauding of a bank to sidestep sanctions against the Iranian regime. The trial continues in Canada while Ottawa has described the detention of the Canadians as “hostage diplomacy” and accused Beijing of holding sham trials for the two Michaels.The Taipei event will be held in association with Taiwan’s Institute for National Defence and Security Research or INDSR.The Halifax Forum has been branded “as the world’s leading security gathering for democracies”.HFX has taken a strong line against China and issued a 101-page handbook, titled “China vs Democracy: The Greatest Game”, prior to its November 2020 event. The handbook stated that the People’s Republic of China or PRC was “intent on undermining democracy abroad” including in India and focused on the significant role that the Quad or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue could play as a bulwark against Beijing’s expansionism. The Quad was formed in 2007 and comprises India, the United States, Australia and Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-watch-taiwan-to-host-halifax-security-forum-event-in-2022-101626930823746.html
22-07-2021||World||India, Afghanistan criticise Pakistan’s handling of envoy’s daughter’s kidnapping||India on Thursday criticised Pakistan for dragging the country into the controversy over the abduction and assault of the Afghan envoy’s daughter in Islamabad last week and for denying the victim’s account of the “very shocking incident”. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi contended that India was forced to respond because Pakistan interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed had dragged the country into the matter. Ahmed has described the incident as a “conspiracy” linked to India’s external intelligence agency. Bagchi’s comments came hours after Afghanistan reiterated its deep concern over Ahmed’s claims that there is no evidence the Afghan envoy’s daughter was abducted in Islamabad and said such remarks could lead to greater mistrust between the two countries. “This is, of course, a very shocking incident. It involves two other countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and usually we’d not comment on it. However, since the interior minister of Pakistan has dragged India into it, I would only like to say that even by their standards, Pakistan’s denial of the victim’s account is stooping to a new low,” Bagchi told a regular news briefing. Also Read | Af min ‘concerned’ at Pak charge of Indian hand in envoy daughter’s abductionSelsela Alikhil, the 26-year-old daughter of Afghan ambassador Najibullah Alikhil, was abducted, held for almost five hour and assaulted by unidentified men in Islamabad on July 16. Two days later, the Afghan government recalled its envoy and senior diplomats from Islamabad over security concerns. Ahmed, who is close to Pakistan’s military establishment, told a news conference on Tuesday that an investigation into the incident had found no evidence of an abduction. “There is no case of kidnapping,” Ahmed said. The Afghan foreign ministry reiterated its concern at Ahmed’s remarks in a statement issued on Wednesday. Afghan foreign minister Mohammed Haneef Atmar had earlier conveyed similar concerns in a phone call with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Monday. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again expresses deep concern over the continuation of unprofessional remarks by Pakistan’s Interior Minister regarding the abduction of the daughter of our Ambassador in Islamabad,” the statement said. “While the investigation process has not been concluded and the perpetrators have not been arrested, the continuation of unilateral statements and unprofessional prejudgments will call the transparency of the investigation into question and result in increased mistrust,” it added. The statement pointed out that hospital reports had “endorsed the mental and physical torture” of Selsela Alikhil. “We expect unprofessional prejudgements to be avoided before the investigation comes to an end. Instead, we urge that all efforts should be geared towards obtaining evidence and completing the probe, as well as arresting and prosecuting the perpetrators,” it said. The Afghan foreign ministry said it is committed to full cooperation in the investigation process through the collaboration of delegations from both sides. “We hope to see the reasons behind the incident, and the investigation results soon finalized and announced based on the findings of the investigating teams of the two countries,” it added. Ahmed had also said on Tuesday that the incident was being used as a way to “defame” Pakistan. He added, “Pakistan will not back down from this case, even though there is a huge difference between her (claim) and our findings.” As fighting raged in Afghanistan with the Taliban, a war of words erupted last week and vice president Amrullah Saleh accused the Pakistani military of providing “close air support to Taliban in certain areas”. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has accused Pakistan of failing to prevent the influx of 10,000 terrorists and of not doing enough to nudge the Taliban to join peace talks to find a political settlement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-again-criticises-pak-minister-over-abduction-of-envoy-s-daughter-101626928604497.html
22-07-2021||World||Taliban victory not ‘foregone conclusion’, says top US general||The top US military leader on Wednesday expressed doubts if a Taliban victory is imminent in Afghanistan, contrary to a reported intelligence assessment.“There are a range of possible outcomes in Afghanistan,” General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said at a Pentagon news conference with secretary of defence Lloyd Austin. “A negative outcome, a Taliban automatic military takeover, is not a foregone conclusion.”“The Afghan security forces have the capacity to sufficiently fight and defend their country, and we will continue to support them where necessary in accordance with the guidance from the president and the secretary of defence.”Taliban forces have advanced rapidly in recent weeks to take control of the country, moving towards major urban centres. But despite a narrative that has gained currency of the imminent fall of Kabul, they have not taken yet any of the country’s 34 provincial capitals though they have taken district centres.The top American general put the Taliban progress in perspective, knowing perhaps how closely the rest of the world is watching, resigned to a Taliban victory.Asked why the Taliban with 75,000 military personnel appear to be winning against the Afghan military of 300,000 with 20 years of US training and support, General Milley said, “warfare is not just about numbers” but also about “will and leadership” to fight and prevail.Gen Milley went on to preview Afghan military strategy in perhaps the clearest terms yet. He started by putting in perspective the talk of Taliban progress, as a narrative propagated by the Taliban. “There clearly is a narrative out there that the Taliban are winning. In fact, they are propagating an inevitable victory on their behalf; they’re dominating a lot of the airwaves - that sort of thing.”Gen Milley said that roughly 212 or 213 district centres are in Taliban control. “That’s half of the 419 in all. And the Taliban haven’t captured yet any of the 34 provincial capitals. Although the Taliban are putting pressure on the outskirts of probably about half of them - 17 of them, in fact - and what they’re trying to do is isolate the major population centres,” he said, adding, “They’re trying to do the same thing to Kabul.”And although the Taliban may appear to have the momentum, the American general said the Afghans are being extremely tactical in their manoeuvres. “The Afghan security forces, are consolidating their forces,” Gen Milley said, adding, “So part of this is they’re giving up district centres in order to consolidate their forces because they’re taking an approach to protect the population, and most of the population lives in the provincial capitals and the capital city of Kabul.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-victory-not-foregone-conclusion-says-top-us-general-101626928483950.html

Amid this escalation, the daughter of the Afghan envoy in Pakistan Najibullah Alikhil was abducted and tortured on July 16, following which President Ashraf Ghani called back several diplomats from Pakistan."Pakistan's diplomatic community is working hard painting and decorating a fictional image for Talibs.

She will travel there after her stops in Tokyo and Seoul and Ulaanbaatar as well," State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.In China, she will take part in meetings in Tianjin where she will meet with Chinese officials. China has confirmed an in-person meeting with state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi, he said."These discussions, as we've said, are part of an ongoing US effort to hold candid exchanges with PRC officials, designed to advance US interests and values and overall, to allow us to responsibly manage this incredibly consequential bilateral relationship," he added.Price said, "We said earlier this week, before we were in a position to confirm the trip, that the deputy would be prepared to travel if her engagement there would be substantive, constructive; if it were indeed to be a forum and a venue for us to accomplish what we seek to accomplish, and that is to advance US interests, to explore and to discuss how we can manage this relationship responsibly, and how we can address the competition... stiff competition that we welcome with the PRC."He said the US believes that this meeting has the potential to be substantive and constructive."In the context of relationships that are complex, that are challenging, that are dynamic, we believe it's important to maintain open lines of communication between high-level officials, and that includes in times of, as in the case with the PRC, sustained competition, even when the PRC is taking actions that challenge our interests, that challenge our values. And these are shared interests," Price said."These are shared values, And so, I think it's important in that context to note that the deputy will be travelling to the PRC, after having visited Japan, after having visited the Republic of Korea, after having visited Mongolia as well."She'll be travelling there, as we have said, from a position of strength, not unlike how Secretary Blinken met with Director Yang and other PRC officials in Anchorage on the way back from the Indo-Pacific region, where we had engaged in consultations with our Japanese and South Korean counterparts as well," he added.Sherman, Price said, intends for this engagement to show and to demonstrate to China what responsible and healthy competition can look like."We know this relationship is going to be competitive. We welcome that competition. We welcome that stiff competition. But we also want to make sure that the playing field is level, and importantly, that competition doesn't veer into conflict," he said."We want to make sure that this is a relationship that has guard rails there – where there are clearly defined parameters to the relationship as well. And we believe, again, that engaging in practical, substantive, and a direct manner, as we expect this visit will be, will help us achieve those goals," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-deputy-secretary-of-state-to-visit-china-this-sunday-discuss-bilateral-ties-101626922756648.html
22-07-2021||World||France makes Covid-19 pass mandatory for visiting Eiffel Tower, other sites||France has now made a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pass mandatory for any tourists or visitors intending to ride up the Eiffel Tower, visit French museums, or movie theaters, news agencies reported on Wednesday. Making the requirement of this special Covid-19 pass mandatory is the first step in a new campaign against what the government calls a “stratospheric” rise in delta variant infections.The Covid-19 pass requirement took effect on Wednesday at cultural and tourist sites in France, following a government decree. At the Eiffel Tower, masked workers scanned QR codes on digital health passes and checked printed vaccines or test certificates.What is a Covid-19 pass?To get the special Covid-19 pass, visitors must show they are either fully vaccinated, have tested negative for the coronavirus, or recovered from Covid-19. As the new rule came into effect on Wednesday, tourists who came to the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris unprepared were seen lining up for quick virus tests at the site.French president Emmanuel Macron also wants to expand the Covid-19 pass requirement to all French restaurants and many other areas of public life, as well as requiring that all health workers get vaccine shots.Reactions to special pandemic passFrance's requirement of a special Covid-19 pass has triggered mixed reactions from various different walks of life. People opposed to vaccines and being asked to present passes showing their immunity status are growing increasingly vocal.A group of protesters attending an anti-pass demonstration in the Alpine city of Chambery broke away and entered the town hall, removing a portrait of French President Emmanuel Macron from a wall and taking it away.Also Read | Xavier Bertrand, ex-insurance salesman, takes on Emmanuel Macron in French presidential raceJohnny Nielsen, a Danish tourist traveling with his wife and two children, said, “In Denmark, you need the pass everywhere.” So while he questioned the usefulness of the French rules, he said that didn’t make them reconsider the family's travel plans.Government reactionThe French government wants to rush the expanded pass requirement bill through the Parliament as soon as possible despite the resistance in some quarters. More than 100,000 people have protested the measures around France over the weekend, and prime minister Jean Castex said on Wednesday that the government will seek approval from the constitutional court, which will also take time.Also Read | UK govt tightens quarantine rules for travellers returning from FranceThe solution is “vaccination, vaccination, vaccination,” Castex said on Wednesday over TF1 television, urging his compatriots to sign up for vaccine injections to avoid new lockdowns.

22-07-2021||World||Xavier Bertrand, ex-insurance salesman, takes on Emmanuel Macron in French presidential race||Xavier Bertrand, a "smalltown politician" and former insurance salesman, is now emerging as a potential dark horse in next year's presidential election in France and looking to topple Emmanuel Macron from his post. It was assumed by many that the upcoming polls would be a straight contest between Macron's La République en Marche (LREM) and far-right leader Marine Le Pen's National Rally, but the meteoric rise of two-time minister Bertrand has complicated the scene, news agencies reported.Bertrand, the 56-year-old former health and labor minister, reckons he can topple the current president by casting himself as the anti-Macron candidate. Playing his working-class roots up, Bertrand is hoping to stoke the anger in provincial France over a feeling that the government favours Paris and helped stoke the Yellow Vests protests that marked Macron's third year in office.Also Read | French President Emmanuel Macron targeted in project Pegasus spyware case, claims Le Monde“Bertrand’s gamble is to win the support of the right, with a classical, traditional right-wing agenda,” while appearing as an outsider “to expand his reach to less well-off voters, including left-wing voters who dislike the president,” news agency Bloomberg quoted Remi Lefebvre, a political scientist in Lille, as saying.According to a report by Politico, Xavier Bertrand's "crushing victory" over Marine Le Pen's National Rally in a far-right bastion could prove to be rather concerning for the latter, since the electoral win proves that Le Pen's allies could be defeated by a conservative. This has directly shifted the spotlight towards Bertrand, whose bid for the presidency had failed to garner much attention until now, even though it was announced back in March this year.Bertrand, although his chances of winning slim in a projected neck-to-neck election between Macron and Le Pen next year in France, could still create enough problems by peeling off voters to prevent either of his two rivals from reaching the runoff round, the report noted.Also Read | Protests in France against Covid-19 'health pass' rulesAccording to a recent survey on the upcoming French presidential elections, Xavier Bertrand is projected to win 18% of the votes in the first round of the contest, while Le Pen and Macron are both expected to get around 25% votes.If Bertrand can overtake Le Pen to qualify for the runoff, it would transform the race and potentially put French president Emmanuel Macron, who has been shaping up for a scrap with the nationalist leader, on the back foot.Bertrand says he just wants to end “the mess” that Macron’s policies have created. Asked at the conference if he was worried about being pushed out by the two top contenders, Bertrand smiled and replied: “Do I look like the worried type?”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xavier-bertrand-ex-insurance-salesman-takes-on-emmanuel-macron-in-french-presidential-race-101626911148172.html

22-07-2021||World||Taliban seem to have 'strategic momentum' in Afghanistan: Top US general||The Taliban appear to have the "strategic momentum" in their sweeping offensives across Afghanistan, but their victory is far from assured, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley said Wednesday.Nearly 20 years after the US toppled the Taliban regime in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, and with the withdrawal of US-led foreign forces all but complete, the resurgent militants now control about half of Afghanistan's roughly 400 districts.But they have none of the country's densely populated main cities, Milley told a press conference.With the militants putting pressure on around half of the country's provincial capitals, Afghan troops are "consolidating their forces" to protect those major urban centers, he added."They're taking an approach to protect the population, and most of the population lives in the provincial capitals and capital city of Kabul," Milley said."A Taliban automatic military takeover is not a foregone conclusion."The Taliban are surging across Afghanistan, snapping up territory, seizing border crossings and encircling cities.Their success has tested the morale of the Afghan army, already battered by years of shockingly high casualties and, more recently, the decision by US-led international troops to leave.Though the Afghan army has been trained by international forces, and estimates show it vastly outnumbers the Taliban's ranks, Milley said numbers are not all it takes to win a war."The two most important combat multipliers actually are will and leadership. And this is going to be a test now of the will and leadership of the Afghan people, the Afghan security forces and the government of Afghanistan," he said.US President Joe Biden has also said that a Taliban takeover is "not inevitable."But earlier this month he also warned that Afghans must come together against the insurgents, and admitted that it was "highly unlikely" that one unified government would end up controlling the entire country.- End game 'not yet written' -Milley's comments came hours after the Taliban said Wednesday they would fight only to defend themselves over the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, but stopped short of declaring a formal ceasefire.In recent years, the militants have declared a pause in fighting with government forces over Islamic holidays, offering a brief respite to Afghans who can visit family in relative safety.Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada said over the weekend that he "strenuously favors" a political settlement to end the war with the government in Kabul.But the hardline Islamist movement's push to capitalize on the last stages of the international withdrawal has left many Afghans sceptical.President Ashraf Ghani said Tuesday that the Taliban had proved "they have no will and intention for peace," with negotiations between the two warring sides achieving little.More than a dozen diplomatic missions in Kabul this week called for "an urgent end" to the Taliban's current offensive, saying it was at odds with claims they want to secure a political deal to end the conflict.Afghan civilians, who have long taken the brunt of the fighting since 2001, are also watching the Taliban advance in fear.Many -- especially women and minorities -- stand to lose hard-won rights and freedoms if the militants return to any form of power.Even if Kabul can hold them off, among the scenarios that civilians face is the prospect of a protracted and bloody civil war and the possibility of the country fracturing along ethnic lines.It was the chaos of the civil war in the 1990s that helped usher the Taliban to power.Milley said the chance of a negotiated political settlement is "still out there.""There's a possibility of a complete Taliban takeover or possibility of any number of other scenarios -- breakdowns, warlordism, all kinds of other scenarios out there," he said."We're monitoring very closely. I don't think the end game is yet written."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-seem-to-have-strategic-momentum-in-afghanistan-top-us-general-101626898513980.html
22-07-2021||World||UK Covid restrictions could return after three weeks, scientists warn||Several coronavirus restrictions could be reintroduced in England after three weeks if hospital admission rises above expected levels, scientists advising the government on the pandemic have reportedly warned. Members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) have warned the government to be prepared to reimpose restrictions amid record hospitalisations in nearly five months, reported inews.According to NHS England, 752 hospital admissions were reported on July 19, the day virtually all restrictions were removed in Britain. While hospitalisations are still well below the peak of the second Covid wave, the exponential rise in infections largely driven by the highly contagious Delta variant is pushing the admissions towards worrying levels.The UK reported 44,104 new Covid-19 cases and 73 related deaths on Wednesday, taking the total infections over 5.56 million. Earlier this week, chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the hospitalisations were doubling roughly every three weeks. During a webinar hosted by the Science Museum, Whitty said that the country was not “out of the woods” by any means and the hospitalisations could escalate in the next couple of months."It doesn't take many doublings until we're in actually quite scary numbers again ... I don't think we should underestimate the fact that we could get into trouble again surprisingly fast," Whitty said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government removed coronavirus restrictions even as experts and scientists from around the world kept warning against the move. They said that Britain’s plan to kick off the final phase of the four-step roadmap out of the lockdown amid the third Covid wave could be a threat to the world.The Delta variant now accounts for more than 75% of Covid-19 cases in several countries including India, Australia, Britain, South Africa, Singapore, Indonesia, Russia, and China among others, according to a weekly epidemiological update by the World Health Organization (WHO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-restrictions-could-return-after-three-weeks-scientists-warn-101626897540587.html

More than 500 people were evacuated from the subway system late on Tuesday. In all, about 200,000 people had to be relocated in the city because of the heavy rainfall.The highest-level emergency alert notice has been issued across the province.President Xi Jinping on Wednesday instructed authorities to deploy the PLA to rescue those stuck in inundated subways, hotels and public places. The PLA has deployed 3,000 personnel to help local authorities with flood control and evacuation efforts.As the scale of the disaster continued to emerge and the damage ran into tens of millions of dollars, the Chinese army said it averted the collapse of the stricken Yihetan dam around an hour from Zhengzhou city.On Wednesday morning, the PLA said blasting operations were carried out at the dam and troops had “successfully opened a new flood diversion opening”, AFP reported.“From 8pm on July 17 to 8pm on Tuesday [July 20], total precipitation of 617.1mm was recorded in Zhengzhou, close to the city’s average annual precipitation of 640.8mm, said the city’s meteorological bureau,” Xinhua news agency reported.The city registered 201.9mm of rainfall between 4pm and 5pm on Tuesday, a record hourly high for the Chinese mainland.The city broke its own single-day precipitation record, hitting its highest level since Zhengzhou’s weather station was established in 1951, the Xinhua report said.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/25-killed-as-record-rains-batter-china-101626894766124.html
