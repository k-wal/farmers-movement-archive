Warehouse workers, who were considered essential, packed and shipped orders throughout the pandemic.Amazon disclosed in October that nearly 20,000 workers, or about 1.4% of its total workforce, had been infected with Covid-19 by that point in 2020.Vaccines began to roll out about two months later and in May, employees who uploaded a picture of their vaccine cards to an Amazon worker app were allowed to ditch masks in the work place if they chose.U.S. cases of Covid-19 last week increased by 17,000 nationwide over a 14-day period for the first time since late fall, and an increase in death historically follows a spike in illness. Much of the worsening problem is being driven by the delta variant first identified in India, that has since hit the United Kingdom and other countries, said U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy.Health officials said Tuesday that the delta variant of the coronavirus continues to surge and accounts for an estimated 83% of U.S. Covid-19 cases.News that Amazon would stop testing workers was first reported by The Information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-to-end-testing-for-covid-19-at-warehouses-this-month-101626798064932.html

In the video posted on Instagram, Jeff Bezos, his brother Mark, Wally Funk and Olive Daemen can be seen floating inside the space capsule that blasted off the New Shepard rocket from Blue Origin’s private launch site in the West Texas desert.“This is how it starts. #gradatimferociter,” wrote Bezos on Instagram, referring to Blue Origin's motto which means “Step by Step, Ferociously" in Latin.The 93-seconds long video clip shows the crew members experiencing zero-g outside the Earth’s atmosphere after they travelled above the Kármán Line, the internationally-recognised boundary of space. As they were performing somersaults in near-zero gravity, Earth was visible in the background through the huge windows of the spacecraft.“Fantastic...that’s great...I love it,” 82-year-old Wally Funk, who became the oldest person to have flown in space can be heard saying.A post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos)Also Read | Jeff Bezos back on earth after 10-min flight to space on Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraftThe first human spaceflight from Blue Origin safely touched down after about 10 minutes of flight. It was the first time in the history of a commercial company launching a privately funded and built spacecraft from a private launch range with astronauts on board."Every astronaut who's been up into space, they say that it changes them ... they look at it and they're kind of amazed and awestruck by the Earth and its beauty, but also by its fragility, and I can vouch for that," Bezos told reporters after the successful flight.This month has witnessed two successful crewed suborbital flights from private companies, with billionaire Richard Branson beating his competitors in flying above Earth’s atmosphere on his Virgin Galactic’s rocket ship. Branson congratulated the Blue Origin crew for the major milestone in commercial spaceflight."Well done @blueorigin, @jeffbezos, Mark, Wally and Oliver. Impressive! Very best to all the crew from me and all the team at @virgingalactic," Branson tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-other-blue-origin-spacecraft-crew-perform-somersaults-in-space-101626801488408.html
20-07-2021||World||Research finds novel coronavirus, related to SARS-Cov-2 that causes Covid-19, in horseshoe bats in UK||A novel coronavirus, related to SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19 in humans, has been detected in horseshoe bats in the United Kingdom, a new collaborative research from the University of East Anglia, Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Public Health England (PHE) showed. The researchers, however, said that there is no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to humans, or that it could in future, unless it mutates.The new virus falls within the subgroup of coronaviruses called sarbecoviruses which contains both SARS-CoV-2, that causes Covid-19, and SARS-CoV, which was responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak.Researchers from the University of East Anglia collected faecal samples from more than 50 lesser horseshoe bats from places like Somerset, Gloucestershire and Wales. The samples were then sent to the Public Health England for viral analysis, the university’s website said.The genome sequencing of the bat samples has detected the presence of novel coronavirus in one of the samples. It has been named ‘RhGB01’ by the team. The sarbecovirus, SARS-related coronavirus, has been found for the first time in a lesser horseshoe bat and it is also the first to be discovered in the United Kingdom.Also, the researchers said that the bats would have “almost certainly” harboured the virus for a very long time and this is the first time that this has been tested and so has been found now. Unless the virus mutates, they are unlikely to pose a direct risk to humans, they added.The virus could mutate if a Covid-19 infected human passes it to an infected bat, the researchers said. They also asked anyone who comes into contact with bats or their droppings to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).“Horseshoe bats are found across Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia and the bats we tested lie at the western extreme of their range,” said professor Diana Bell of the University of East Anglia. “Our research extends both the geographic and species ranges of these types of viruses and suggests their more widespread presence across more than 90 species of horseshoe bats,” she added.“Our findings highlight the need for robust genotype testing for these types of viruses in bat populations around the world. And it raises an important question about what other animals carry these types of viruses,” she further said.“Our findings highlight that the natural distribution of sarbecoviruses and opportunities for recombination through intermediate host co-infection have been underestimated,” said Prof Andrew Cunningham from the Zoological Society of London.Ensuring that the UK virus is not a threat to humans, Cunningham said, “But the problem is that any bat harbouring a SARS-like coronavirus can act as a melting pot for virus mutation.”“Preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to bats, and hence reducing opportunities for virus mutation, is critical with the current global mass vaccination campaign against this virus,” Prof Cunningham further said.The closest relative to the virus was found to be one discovered in a Blasius’ bat from Bulgaria in 2008, further analysis of the virus in comparison with others found in horseshoe bat species in China, southeast Asia and Europe showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/research-finds-novel-coronavirus-related-to-sars-cov-2-in-horseshoe-bats-in-uk-101626795475866.html
20-07-2021||World||EU says democratic standards under threat in Poland, Hungary||Democratic standards in the European Union are eroding in several member countries, particularly in Hungary and Poland where judicial independence is under threat, the EU’s executive commission said Tuesday in its annual report on adherence to the rule of law.The report also singled out Slovenia, which recently took over the six-month rotating presidency of the European Council, for attacks against the Balkan nation's media.“There are causes for serious concern in a number of member states, especially when it comes to the independence of judiciary,” said Vera Jourova, the Commission vice-president for Values and Transparency.The review, which is in its second year, was published a week after the EU’s top court ruled that Poland’s way of disciplining judges contravenes EU law and undermines judicial independence, telling the country’s right-wing government which introduced the system to change it.The European Commission has also started legal action against Poland and Hungary for what the EU’s executive arm sees as blatant disrespect for the rights of LGBT people.The wide-ranging audit found Poland deficient in the four main areas reviewed: national justice systems, anti-corruption frameworks, media freedom and checks and balances.According to the EU's executive arm, reforms of the Polish justice system carried out over the past six years by the current government continue to increase the influence of the government over the justice system, damaging judicial independence.The report also pointed out a risk of “undue influence on corruption prosecutions for political purposes" and noted a deterioration of working conditions for journalists, “with use of intimidating judicial proceedings."Hungary was criticized for its perceived inadequate anti-corruption measures and the report noted that media pluralism “remains at risk." The report depicted a bleak media situation in Slovenia, reporting online harassment and threats against journalists.The EU has repeatedly warned that democratic standards are being challenged in Hungary and Poland. At a June summit, EU leaders strongly clashed with Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban over new legislation that bans the display of LGBT issues to children in that country.Earlier this year, the European Union’s executive arm also condemned Slovenia’s right-wing prime minister, Janez Jansa, for a series of aggressive comments about journalists.But the EU's criticism seems to have little effect. After the European Court of Justice's ruling, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki dismissed it as a “typical dispute of the doctrine” and insisted that the EU court has no authority on the shaping of the justice systems in individual member nations.Jourova said the commission has asked Poland to fully comply with the ruling by Aug. 16 or face financial sanctions and an infringement procedure.“EU law has primacy over national law. All decisions by the European Court of Justice are binding," she said.The aim of the report is not to sanction countries. To try to rein in member states they believe are at fault, EU institutions can use the so-called Article 7 procedure, but proceedings launched against Poland and Hungary have not been conclusive so far.EU lawmakers have been losing patience and threatened last month to sue the bloc’s executive branch if it fails to take action against countries allegedly violating democratic standards, notably Hungary and Poland. They urged European Parliament President David Sassoli to demand that the European Commission “fulfil its obligations” within two weeks, under a system tying access to some EU funds to a country’s respect for the rule of law.The system was included in the budget the EU approved last year covering the 2021-27 period and which also included a massive coronavirus economic stimulus fund. In March, the right-wing governments of Poland and Hungary filed a complaint with the European Court of Justice to challenge it.Both countries have submitted their plans to receive a share of the €800 billion EU recovery fund to finance the 27-nation bloc’s recovery from the coronavirus crisis, but the commission has yet to approve them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-says-democratic-standards-under-threat-in-poland-hungary-101626790426387.html

The founder of Blue Origin was accompanied by brother Mark Bezos, Wally Funk, and 18-year-old passenger Oliver Daemen."Congratulations to all of Team Blue past and present on reaching this historic moment in spaceflight history. This first astronaut crew wrote themselves into the history books of space, opening the door through which many after will pass," Blue Origin said after the capsule carrying the passengers touched down safely.The mission marked another milestone in the space race started by private companies. It was the first time in the history of a commercial company launching a privately funded and built spacecraft from a private launch range with astronauts on board.The astronauts boarded the crew capsule 30 minutes before the launch and the hatch closed six minutes later. They experienced three to four minutes of zero-g and travelled above the Kármán Line, the internationally-recognised boundary of space. Blue Origin's recovery team joined the four-member crew to celebrate their return from space. The successful launch and subsequent touchdown made Wally Funk, 82, the oldest person and Daeman the youngest to have flown in space.New Shepard, a fully autonomous spacecraft, didn't have any Blue Origin staff astronauts during its maiden human spaceflight.Billionaire Richard Branson, who recently went into space aboard his Virgin Galactic's rocket ship, congratulated Blue Origin crew on their achievement.

The US channel carried a report which claimed that the video was aired on a channel approved by the CCP.In the video, as claimed by Fox News, the CCP singled out Japan as the one exception to China's policy to not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear powers."We will use nuclear bombs first," the CCP says in the vide, according to Fox News. The report further claimed that China's ruling party threatened of using the nuclear bombs continuously "till Japan declares unconditional surrender for the second time."According to Taiwan's local publication Taiwan News, the 5-minute-long video was uploaded on Sunday on China's YouTube-like platform Xigua and quickly gained two million views. It was later deleted, but copies of the video, which were uploaded by some users on YouTube and Twitter, still exist.In the video, a narrator dares Japan to interfere when China liberates Taiwan, warning of a full-scare war if the island nation tries to do so, Taiwan News reported. The CCP video also talks about the tension between the two countries and atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers against the Chinese during Sino-Japan wars, Taiwan News further reported.The threats follow comments made two weeks ago by Japanese officials about Taiwan's sovereignty, with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso saying that Japan must "defend Taiwan", according to Japan Times.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US. China has threatened that "Taiwan's independence" means war.Japan has been seeking to expand and deepen security ties with other nations in addition to its chief ally, the United States, as China presses its claims to contested areas in the South China Sea and to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku islands, which China also claims and calls Diaoyu.Britain said on Tuesday that it would permanently deploy two warships in Asian waters after its Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier and escort ships sail to Japan in September where China is vying for influence. This comes after Japan expressed growing alarm in recent months over China's territorial ambitions in the region, including Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-threatens-to-nuke-japan-over-taiwan-in-video-report-101626785921884.html

It also warned that the rebound from the pandemic is set to drive emissions of greenhouse gases to all-time highs."We estimate that full and timely implementation of the economic recovery measures announced to date would result in CO2 emissions climbing to record levels in 2023, continuing to rise thereafter," the IEA said in the report.The agency highlighted that spending plans the governments across the world on clean energy in this quarter is $380 billion making up just 2% of their total stimulus funds in response to Covid-19.This, the IEA said, is around a third of what is needed according to its estimates in order to put the world on course to reach net zero emissions by mid-century."(Countries) must then go even further by leading clean energy investment and deployment to much greater heights beyond the recovery period in order to shift the world on to a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050, which is narrow but still achievable - if we act now," IEA chief Fatih Birol said.The lack of sufficient green spending means that global emissions could go past their 2018 peak as soon as 2023, said IEA. To keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world needs to halve its emissions by the end of the decade relative to 2018, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-recovery-to-push-emissions-to-all-time-high-says-iea-101626771821241.html

American space agency Nasa has said that an asteroid named '2008 GO20' is headed towards the Earth at 18,000 miles an hour, but there is nothing to worry.The asteroid will go pass Earth on July 24, according to Nasa. The space agency has categorised the flying object as a Apollo class asteroid; for common people, it is as big as a stadium, or thrice the size of the Taj Mahal.Though the asteroid will be very close to Earth, it will still be 0.04 au (astronomical unit) away from Earth, according to Nasa's calculations. That's a distance of 3,718,232 miles. To put it in perspective, the moon is approximately 238,606 miles from Earth.Asteroid 2008 GO20 won't come any closer than 2,605,509 miles miles, according to interactive map give by Nasa.However, it has still been classified as Near Earth Object by Nasa due to its close approach with Earth.What are asteroids?According to the Nasa, asteroids are "rocky remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago". There are currently 1,097,106 known asteroids. These are different from meteors, which are small bodies of matter that appear as a streak of light when entering the Earth's atmosphere.Chinese researchers have proposed sending large rockets to practice turning away a sizable asteroid - a technique that may eventually be crucial if a killer rock is on a collision course with Earth - news agency Reuters reported.Sometime between late 2021 to early 2022, the United States will launch a robotic spacecraft to intercept two asteroids relatively close to Earth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asteroid-the-size-of-stadium-to-fly-past-earth-on-july-24-says-nasa-101626765408094.html

Folks I think we may need to recalibrate."Reuters could not independently verify whether the messages were genuine.A spokesperson for Johnson said the prime minister had taken "the necessary action to protect lives and livelihoods, guided by the best scientific advice".Britain's opposition Labour Party said the revelations by Cummings strengthened the case for a public enquiry and were "further evidence that the prime minister has made the wrong calls time and again at the expense of public health".Cummings told the BBC that Johnson told officials that he should never have agreed to the first lockdown and that he had to convince him not to take the risk of meeting the queen."I said, what are you doing, and he said, I'm going to see the queen and I said, what on earth are you talking about, of course you can't go and see the queen," Cummings said he told Johnson. "And he said, he basically just hadn't thought it through."Despite questioning Johnson's fitness for his role as prime minister and castigating the government's fight against Covid-19, Cummings' criticism has yet to seriously puncture the British leader's ratings in opinion polls. The full interview will be broadcast on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-junked-covid-lockdown-said-only-elderly-would-die-ex-aide-cummings-101626764042178.html

The government has imposed a strict lockdown starting July 20 till July 24 due to the growing number of daily deaths and infections.The full lockdown will begin at 5pm Oman time on July 19 and end at 4am on July 24. According to local media reports, buses will remain completely suspended from July 20 and will resume on July 24.All commercial activities, public Eid prayers, traditional Eid market activities, travel and family reunions during the lockdown period have also been restricted by the Oman Supreme Committee.The holy festival of Eid al-Adha is celebrated on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic or lunar calendar. According to Quran, the holy book of Islam, it is celebrated in commemoration of Prophet Abraham's faithfulness to god after he was tested to sacrifice his son. During the celebrations, Muslims sacrifice and distribute the meat of the sacrificed animal to the needy as well as their family members.The surge in the latest Covid-19 cases in Oman has mostly been led by the Delta variant of the coronavirus. According to local media reports, the steady rise in Covid-19 cases has led to the healthcare system being overwhelmed. Covid-19 wards are full and medics are restricting admissions only to patients who need inpatient treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oman-to-observe-eid-al-adha-amid-strict-covid-19-lockdown-101626763435244.html
20-07-2021||World||Pak-Taliban upbeat, but the Afghan battle has just begun||At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers' meet in Tajikistan and connectivity conference in neighbouring Uzbekistan past week, it was quite evident that rapidly changing events in Afghanistan had taken top priority in the global diplomatic circuit. Yet, all the countries including US, Russia, China and neighboring Central Asian republics are in a wait and watch mode even as the deep Pakistani state handling the Taliban are conducting a psychological operation by trying to convince the world that the fundamentalist are unstoppable and it is a matter of time when Kabul falls to them.While the security advisors from New York to Dushanbe are concerned about the Republic of Afghanistan being turned into Islamic emirate, the Taliban today is projecting an image that it is equally adept at fighting guerilla war as also a powerful negotiator as it has forced the US on the dialogue table to concede on issues critical to their longevity.The Taliban under ISI spin doctors have succeeded to certain extent in spreading that Pakistan-based Haibatullah Akhundzada, Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mullah Yaqoob have matured with both a military and diplomatic plan as compared to 1996 when the Taliban under Mullah Omar (father of Yaqoob) seized power in Kabul by torture, mayhem and public executions through hanging and stoning. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was established in September 1996 but was ostracised by the global community sans mentor Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates who recognised the Islamic State. The Taliban are now playing a two-pronged game by waging war in Afghanistan and talking peace outside the country to ensure that US and the west grant recognition to the Emirate when they capture Kabul through force or a transitional government. Mentor Pakistan will also reap collateral benefits of this after all they brought the once political pariah Taliban to the negotiating table with possible relief from the FATF grey list.A perception is deliberately being created to say that Taliban 2.0 is a different force from its original version and the rapid fall of Badakhshan, once a citadel of revolutionary Ahmed Shah Masoud, shows that the decimation of Northern Alliance, the powerful counter force to the Taliban in 1990s. A similar narrative is being built by Pakistani deep state me in northern territories where Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum writ used to run by claiming that Afghan security forces have virtually surrendered to the Talib. The projection that Taliban now comprises of non-Pashtun commanders including Shias, Uzbeks and Tajiks and represents a cross section of Afghanistan rather than a puritan Sunni Pashtun force with Deobandi ideology of the 1990s is to show the so called inclusivity of the Islamic warriors. Rather than be in a hurry, the Taliban are playing a deliberate game by consolidating their gained positions and at the same time talking about ceasefire in faraway Doha with both US and Russia not having stomach for any more battles for Afghanistan. China is playing through its proxy Pakistan and will coopt Afghanistan under Taliban in the Belt Road Initiative (BRI) to exploit natural resources of the strife torn country. However, this is far distant from truth on the ground.Fact is that Taliban is still largely a Sunni Pashtun force and not all the 30 percent Pashtuns in Afghanistan are with the fundamentalists as they have developed other interests. The ISI backed Taliban has taken control of border crossings in Afghanistan including Spin Boldak near Kandahar as it spells money and weapons from the truckers crossing the Afghan-Pak border. The Afghan special forces and hardcore military elements have withdrawn not because they fear Taliban onslaught but for military consolidation. After Gen Bismillah Khan Mohammadi has been appointed as new Afghan Defence Minister, the security forces are not only retaking districts but also counter-attacking. Gen Khan, who was Army Chief of Afghan National Army from 2002 to 2010, has been able to iron out differences within the Kabul government and has a cogent military strategy. It is quite evident that the Afghan security forces will not only defend but also take the war to the Taliban in their strongholds.“The Taliban currently has talk-talk war-war strategy to project that they have changed. It is only a matter of time that war-war strategy of Taliban will be evident to the world particularly the US and Russia. The ISI spin doctors are projecting an imminent Taliban victory but the fact is that Afghanistan is heading towards a civil war as the Afghan security forces will pushback for Taliban still do not take prisoners but kill them,” said a former foreign secretary. The Taliban animal has matured in age and cunning but its stripes remain unchanged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paktaliban-upbeat-but-the-afghan-battle-has-just-begun-101626760945887.html

The palace is in the middle of a so-called Green Zone that is fortified with giant cement blast walls and barbed wire, and streets near the palace have long been closed off.The barrage comes as the US and NATO complete their final withdrawal from Afghanistan which has unnerved Afghans uncertain whether their war-ravaged country will fall deeper into chaos and violence. The withdrawal is more than 95% complete and the final US soldier will be gone by August 31, President Joe Biden said in an address earlier this month.Abdullah Abdullah, the No. 2 official in the government, returned on Monday from the first high-level round of peace talks with the Taliban in the Middle Eastern state of Qatar.

20-07-2021||World||Reports full of wrong assumptions, says NSO Group||NSO Group, a private Israeli cybersecurity firm that sells the spyware Pegasus, has dismissed media reports that alleged that phones of prominent personalities, including journalists, politicians and experts in India were targeted for surveillance, terming them “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories”.“The report by Forbidden Stories is full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories that raise serious doubts about the reliability and interests of the sources. It seems like the ‘unidentified sources’ have supplied information that has no factual basis and are far from reality,” the NSO Group said in a statement.“We firmly deny the false allegations made in their report. Their sources have supplied them with information which has no factual basis, as evident by the lack of supporting documentation for many of their claims. In fact, these allegations are so outrageous... that NSO is considering a defamation lawsuit.”An investigation by a consortium of media houses has alleged that phone hacking software Pegasus was used to target potentially thousands of people around the world, including 38 Indian journalists, and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, political strategist Prashant Kishor and former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa.In its statement, the NSO Group also said that it “has a good reason to believe the claims that are made by the unnamed sources to Forbidden Stories, are based on misleading interpretation of data from accessible and overt basic information...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reports-full-of-wrong-assumptions-says-nso-group-101626740609238.html
20-07-2021||World||China, Iran diplomats among people in Pegasus list: Report||A number once used by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and those of dozens of diplomats in India from countries such as China and Iran are among potential targets selected by users of the Pegasus spyware programme, according to media reports on Monday.Woman who accused ex-CJI of harassment in surveillance listParis-based Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International have gained access to a leaked list of more than 50,000 records of phone numbers that clients of the Israeli company NSO Group, the developer of Pegasus, selected for surveillance. More than 1,000 phone numbers in India were part of the list, according to 17 media outlets that examined the list. The records included at least one number once used by Prime Minister Khan and that had been selected by a NSO client for surveillance, The Washington Post and Le Monde reported.“Not surprisingly, Pakistan is the most scrutinised country,” Le Monde said in its report.Decoding the legality of ‘authorised’ surveillance in India“The numbers of Imran Khan and several of his ambassadors in India appear on the list as potential targets. Dozens of other Delhi-based diplomats and ambassadors are also included, from Iran, Afghanistan, China, Nepal and Saudi Arabia,” the report added.Hari Menon, the India head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and one more foundation employee and two employees of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based in New Delhi were also on the list, The Washington Post reported.There was no immediate response from Indian officials or the missions of the countries named in the reports. Khan didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post.While surveillance of phone numbers of diplomats is not unheard of around the world, the matter continues to be very sensitive. For instance, Pakistan’s security agencies have been known to tap the phones of all Indian diplomats and officials as well as those of visiting Indian journalists.Given India’s currently strained relations with China and Pakistan, closer scrutiny of the diplomats of both countries would not be surprising, experts said. However, most of the other countries named in the Le Monde report are not perceived as security concerns.NSO Group has said all its clients are sovereign governments and that all exports are cleared by the Israeli government. It has also said Pegasus has been used by some 60 intelligence and law enforcement agencies in 40 countries and insisted that the spyware, which can access all data on a mobile phone and turn it into an audio or video recorder, is for use only against terrorists and criminals.The Indian government has neither confirmed nor denied licensing Pegasus and it has denied all the news reports.However, the global investigative project has alleged Pegasus was used to target politicians, ministers, civil society and rights activists and journalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-iran-diplomats-among-people-in-list-report-101626736108335.html
20-07-2021||World||UK celebrates ‘freedom day’ but Covid cases peak||Day-to-day pandemic restrictions were lifted in England on Monday as the country’s “freedom day” met with deep concern from scientists as coronavirus cases surge across the nation.The country has lifted legal mandates on social distancing, wearing masks and working from home, urging personal responsibility instead. Covid-19 travel rules and self-isolation for close contacts remain in place.Nightclubs reopened their floors to dancing for the first time since March 2020, while sports stadia, cinemas and theatres can now run at full capacity.But while businesses are jubilant, many are worried about the government’s decision to scrap restrictions at a time when Covid-19 cases are on an upswing as the Delta variant, first detected in India, sweeps parts of Europe and Asia.Cases topped 50,000 per day last week for the first time since January, although virus deaths remain comparatively low so far.The country added more than 54,000 new cases Saturday, and over 47,600 on Sunday, more than Indonesia, the pandemic’s current epicenter, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University,Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has dialled down talk of freedom in recent weeks, urged the public to exercise “prudence and respect for other people and the risks that the disease continues to present”.The Prime Minister was spending “Freedom Day” in quarantine, along with treasury Rishi Sunak, after contact with health secretary Sajid Javid, who tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday.Johnson tested negative for the disease on Monday.British officials have repeatedly expressed confidence that the U.K.’s vaccine rollout — 68.3% of adults, or just over half of the total population, has received two doses — will keep the threat to public health at bay.Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said he was “confident” the government was “doing the right thing” now, before any winter resurgence in respiratory disease.But scientists described England’s “Freedom Day” as a threat to the whole world, and 1,200 scientists backed a letter to British medical journal The Lancet that criticized the Conservative government’s decision.“I can’t think of any realistic good scenario to come out of this strategy, I’m afraid,” said Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at the University of Leicester. “I think it’s really a degree of how bad it’s going to be.”The end of restrictions in England is a critical moment in Britain’s handling of the pandemic, which has killed more than 128,000 people nationwide, the highest death toll in Europe after Russia. Other parts of the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — are taking slightly more cautious steps out of lockdown and keeping mask requirements for now.Globally, the World Health Organization says cases and deaths are climbing after a period of decline, spurred by the delta variant.European nations including Greece, the Netherlands and Spain have been forced to reimpose restrictions to battle new outbreaks recently.In the U.S., many areas abandoned face coverings when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said fully vaccinated people didn’t need to wear them in most settings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-celebrates-freedom-day-but-covid-cases-peak-101626723666174.html
20-07-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada extends ban on direct flights from India until August 21||The Canadian government has extended the prohibition on direct flights from India by another 30 days. The ban was set to expire on July 21, but will now remain in place until August 21.It is the fourth time the ban has been extended since it was first imposed on April 22 due to fears in Canada over the devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and concerns over transmission of the Delta variant of the coronavirus.A release issued on Monday from Health Canada noted that the extension of the ban was “based on public health advice”. Canada has also extended the requirement related to third-country pre-departure Covid-19 tests for travellers to Canada from India via an indirect route. Passengers from India connecting at another point of departure for Canada will require a mandatory pre-departure negative RT-PCR test before continuing their journey to the Canadian destination.That announcement came even as Canada announced a slew of measures relaxing travel restrictions to the country. On September 7, if “domestic epidemiologic situation remains favourable”, Canada will open its borders “to any fully vaccinated travellers who have completed the full course of vaccination with a government of Canada-accepted vaccine at least 14 days prior to entering Canada and who meet specific entry requirements”.As a first step in this direction, fully vaccinated American citizens and permanent residents will be allowed to enter the country for non-essential travel on August 9, as long as they have completed their inoculations at least 14 days prior to entering Canada.Fully vaccinated travellers will also not require a post-arrival test from August 9, while those not fully vaccinated, unvaccinated or vaccinated with jabs not recognised by Canadian health authorities, will continue to be tested.Starting on the same day, the Canadian government is eliminating its mandatory three-day quarantine requirement at a designated hotel while awaiting results of the test. Vaccinated travellers will be exempted from any requirement for quarantine, but others will have to provide a quarantine plan.The vaccines authorised for emergency use in Canada are those made by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca (Covishield), and Johnson & Johnson.India had recently petitioned the Canadian government to scrap the bar on direct flights, with India’s high commission in Ottawa sending a letter in this regard to Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry.“Canadians’ safety and security always come first. With rising vaccination rates and fewer cases in Canada, we can begin to safely ease border measures. A gradual approach to reopening will allow our health authorities to monitor the Covid-19 situation here and abroad,” Canada’s minister of health Patty Hajdu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-extends-ban-on-direct-flights-from-india-until-august-21-101626720510048.html
