The unprecedented heatwave began on June 25 and ravaged the continent’s northwest before slowly subsiding.Also Read: Extreme weather blamed, authorities monitoring wildfiresCanada is so far the worst hit of the two nations in terms of the number of fatalities. The heatwave there has claimed as many as 700 lives over the last one week alone, according to officials. Two people were reported to have died due to a raging wildfire triggered by the heat in the village of Lytton in British Columbia, which had sizzled under a record high temperature of 49.6°C earlier in the week.It has been reported that one of well more than 100 wildfires peppering the heatwave-hit western part of Canada, especially British Columbia, has decimated about 90% of Lytton.Numbers could go upBritish Columbia’s chief coroner Lisa Lapointe told reporters that 719 sudden deaths were recorded in the province in the week ending July 1 – which is three times higher than the average tally. The high temperatures are believed to be a significant contributing factor in the jump, and the number is expected to increase as more information is compiled, Lapointe said.The escalating crisis sent Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau into an emergency huddle with the country’s incident response group as they discussed ways to combat it, focusing largely on British Columbia.Across the border, the US state of Washington’s authorities have linked about 30 deaths to the heat, with more reports coming in each day this week.Nearly 100 die in OregonThe death toll in Oregon alone has reached 95, the state medical examiner said on Friday, with most occurring in Multnomah county, which encompasses the hard-hit city of Portland. The deaths include a Guatemalan immigrant who collapsed as he worked at a nursery in an Oregon town amid the heat.“I think, over time, we will understand that the numbers are only going to climb,” feared Steve Mitchell, director of Harborview Medical Center’s emergency medicine department in Seattle. “I know, in my experience, that I’m expecting to see much larger numbers than what we are currently able to report because of talking to colleagues who were experiencing twice as many calls for help that day.”There were 1,792 emergency room visits for suspected heat-related illness since June 25, the Washington state department of health said on Thursday. Of those visits, 21% required people to be admitted to the hospital.Monday had the most emergency room visits, with 702, the health department said. It was the hottest day of the heat wave in many areas, with Seattle, Portland, Oregon, and other cities smashing all-time heat records. It reached 42°C in Seattle, and 47°C in Oregon’s largest city.Over 170 wildfires rageIn Canada, the military was on standby to evacuate towns and fight over 170 wildfires fuelled by the heatwave and tinder-dry conditions as the government in Ottawa warned of a “long and challenging summer” ahead. At least 177 fires were active in the western province of British Columbia, 76 of them sparked in the last two days, officials said.(With inputs from Anirudh Bhattacharyya)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-heatwave-toll-tops-800-101625334250895.html

Experts fear that these attacks can have a multiplying effect as hackers can access and infiltrate the customers of the MSPs.In Sweden, more than 800 stores of grocery chain Coop’s could not open on Saturday after the attack led to a malfunction of its cash registers, Coop spokesperson Therese Knapp told news agency Bloomberg.The recent attack has affected MSPs in 11 countries, according to Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET. The hackers attacked Kaseya Ltd, a Miami-based developer of software used by these MSPs. The attack was orchestrated to attack Kaseya’s customers.“What makes this attack stand out is the trickle-down effect, from the managed service provider to the small business. Kaseya handles large enterprises all the way to small businesses globally, so ultimately, it has the potential to spread to any size or scale business,” Hammond was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.Kaseya said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been notified and it has identified at least 40 customers impacted by the attack. The president of Avtex LLC, one of MSPs affected by the breach, George Demou said that the attack appears to be a global supply chain hack as hundreds of MSPs have been targeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-ransomware-group-strikes-again-affects-800-stores-in-sweden-101625330820552.html

Countries are running against time to vaccinate people against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as highly transmissible variants are rapidly spreading across the world.The lack of vaccine availability in low- and lower-middle-income countries, along with vaccine hesitancy across the world, has been working as an impediment in suppressing the emergence of new virus variants and deadly mutations. Dr William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that the higher the number of unvaccinated people, the more opportunities the virus will have to multiply, reported CNN.While all viruses mutate and some mutations even weaken the virus, mutations like the variants of concern, including the Delta variant, could disrupt the pandemic response. "When it does, it mutates, and it could throw off a variant mutation that is even more serious down the road," Schaffner was quoted by CNN as saying.According to experts, a mutant version has to replicate itself to become a variant and unvaccinated groups provide that opportunity. Since viruses that don’t spread cannot mutate, maximum vaccination coverage is an effective tool to stop mutations from becoming a variant of concern. "The more we allow the virus to spread, the more opportunity the virus has to change," the World Health Organization (WHO) said last month.Also Read | World in ‘very dangerous period’ as Delta variant continues to mutate, warns WHO chiefThe Delta variant has already been reported from nearly 100 countries and the UN health agency on Friday warned that the world is in a “very dangerous period” of this pandemic. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press briefing that the Delta variant is continuing to evolve and mutate, suggesting constant evaluation and careful adjustment of the public health response."I have urged leaders across the world to work together to ensure that by this time next year, 70% of all people in every country are vaccinated [against Covid-19]," said the WHO chief.The Delta variant has further mutated to form the Delta plus, characterised by B.1.617.2 variant acquiring another mutation, K417N, also found in the B.1.351 or Beta variant of concern. India has classified it as a "variant of concern", saying the mutation spreads more easily, binds more easily to lung cells and is potentially resistant to monoclonal antibody therapy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expert-calls-unvaccinated-people-variant-factories-as-delta-continues-to-evolve-101625328191655.html

The spokesperson of the separatist group Azad Baloch said that it released three men out of the six but continued to detain the rest as they were deemed suspicious by the group.He said that the outfit decided that if the United Nations (UN) or international organisations including representatives of the Red Cross in Geneva act as guarantors for the release of rest of the men and provide assurance that these men will not again work for spy networks of the Pakistani army they will release the rest of the hostages. The BLA said that these men should not return to work in such ‘exploitative projects’.Azad Baloch gave the international bodies 10 days to respond to their demands. The BLa had earlier warned the telecommunication companies against working as ‘facilitators in expansionist ambitions of the imperialist powers.’China set up a communications network in Pakistan using telecom giants Huawei, Netcom, Exeleron and ZTE to spy and trace Balochistan's citizens under the Universal Service Fund programme, the ANI report said. The report also pointed out that these telecom companies set up towers in uninhabited hilly areas to exchange information about the Baloch separatist movement. Balochistan is the focal point of China's $60 billion Belt and Road development programme.Clashes between Baloch separatists and Pakistan army continues as last week five soldiers died in Sangan in Quetta. The Pakistan army said that the attack was carried out by ‘ suspected’ militants.(with inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bla-sets-afire-installations-of-chinese-telcos-in-pak-s-quetta-report-101625326464556.html

One individual has already succumbed to the virus, and two new cases have also been detected. This comes as the country is battling a deadly third wave of coronavirus.Black fungus or mucormycosis, which is caused by exposure to mucor mold, commonly found in soil, air, in the nose and mucus of human beings, was reported in India during the brutal second wave of coronavirus. It spreads through the respiratory tract and erodes facial structures. In severe cases, doctors have to operate on black fungus patients to surgically remove the eye to keep the infection from reaching the brain, and turning deadly.Cases of black fungus have been cropping up in Egypt and Oman since the beginning of June, reported Reuters. Immunocompromised patients who are recovering from coronavirus are more likely to be infected by it. Use of certain over-the-counter medicines like steroids in treating the virus has also caused mucormycosis cases to rise.Also Read: 128 died of black fungus in Mumbai hospitals since FebAfghanistan has been struggling to treat patients as its crumbling healthcare infrastructure is unable to keep up with the rising number of daily cases. The country recorded 1,272 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, taking the country’s total number of infections to 124,757. 5,199 people are also believed to have succumbed to the virus since the pandemic started in February of last year, although the figures are believed to be massively underreported.

Miranda has alleged he was under "undue pressure" to sign off on the deal with India's Bharat Biotech International Limited for 20 million doses of its anti Covid-19 shot, Covaxin. He also spoke of "irregularities" in the invoices, particularly in a $45 million upfront payment to a Singapore-based company.On its part, Bharat Biotech, headquartered in the southern city of Hyderabad, has denied receiving any advance payment from the Bolsonaro government for Covaxin. Though the vaccine received emergency use authorisation (EUA) in the Latin American nation in early June, negotiations between the two sides were on for the last seven-eight months.Also Read: Bharat Biotech says it received no advance payment from Brazil govt for CovaxinIn their deposition, the Miranda brothers also accused Bolsonaro of assuring them he would report the alleged irregularities to the Federal Police. The police, however, say they never received any request to investigate the deal.Now, prosecutors will probe Bolsonaro, who has denied any wrongdoing, for "prevarication." This is a crime when a public official, for "reasons of personal interest," delays an action, or refrains from carrying out an action, which they are required to perform as a part of their duties.The development comes at a time when Bolsonaro is facing pressure over his government's handling of the pandemic. He is also due to face a presidential election next year.According to Johns Hopkins University, Brazil has thus far recorded 18,687,469 Covid-19 cases, and is only behind the United States and India, respectively, on that count. The country's death toll due to the viral disease stands at 521,952, the Johns Hopkins dashboard shows; this is the second-highest Covid-19 death toll globally after that of the United States, and is just ahead of India's.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-top-court-okays-graft-probe-against-bolsonaro-in-covid-19-vaccine-deal-101625321651840.html

The two rockets, scheduled to be launched on separate days, will team up with Nasa’s Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) satellite to advance our understanding of the atmospheric dynamo, said the US space agency.About 80,000 metres above the Earth surface, where the atmosphere blends into space, a pattern of electrical current swirls in continent-sized circuits forming an Earth-sized electric generator. The giant electrical current migrates across the planet in the ionosphere wherever the Sun is directly overhead. In the ionosphere, the Sun's intense radiation separates electrons from their atoms, allowing electricity to flow.While most measurements of the dynamo come from magnetometers, a device on the ground that monitors the way current disturbs Earth’s magnetic field, taking measurements from inside the ionosphere will provide more detail about the phenomenon. Earth’s ionosphere is the dynamic region high in the atmosphere where terrestrial weather from below meets space weather from above.Also Read | 'We're going big': Nasa's Ingenuity copter set to push its limits for next flight on MarsScott England, a space physicist and collaborator for the upcoming Dynamo-2 campaign, said that the measure from inside the ionosphere is a “really tricky part” because the air is much too thin for an aircraft and too dense to fly most spacecraft. “So one way of making these measurements is to fly a rocket through it,” England added.One sounding rocket will launch into “quiet” conditions, while the other will launch into “disturbed” conditions, on two separate days. The launches will be timed so that the ICON satellite, designed to investigate changes in the ionosphere of Earth, will be passing over at the same time to compare data.The sounding rockets will make brief measurements in space before falling back to Earth a few minutes later.“While ground-based methods can provide large-scale, integrated measurements, sounding rockets give us local, fine-scale data on the ionospheric current,” said Takumi Abe, a space physicist at JAXA and collaborator for the Dynamo missions.The Dynamo-2 rockets will launch from Nasa’s Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia on separate days between July 6-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-rockets-satellite-team-up-to-study-earth-sized-electric-generator-101625323095538.html

The investigation was launched two days after Didi Chuxing debuted in the New York Stock Exchange. The news of the investigation knocked off 5% off Beijing-based Didi’s shares on Friday. Didi’s Initial Public Offering (IPO) was the bourse’s second-biggest of the year.The Chinese government’s internet watchdog claims that the investigation is aimed at preventing security-related risks. It has also prevented its application from accepting new users until the investigation is over. Didi Chuxing said that they will cooperate with the relevant government authority. It said that apart from taking in new users its operations are continuing normally.Didi Vice President Li Min said that Didi Global Inc stores all China user and road data at servers in the country and denied all possibilities that the company passed data to the United States. Min also said that it would sue any social media user who claimed that Didi transferred data during its recent IPO process after several such claims were made on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media platform.“Like many overseas-listed Chinese companies, Didi stores all domestic user data at servers in China, it is absolutely not possible to pass data to the United States,” Li said in a post on Weibo, according to news agency Reuters. Didi said that it will conduct a comprehensive examination of cybersecurity risks.Several experts however believe that the investigation on Didi is a measure to control the country's fast-growing and freewheeling tech sector. The Wall Street Journal in a report said that China increased its crackdown on tech companies citing anti-competitive practices among Chinese internet giants. It also said that the Chinese government called out tech companies citing alleged offences, including inconsistent pricing, user privacy concerns and difficult working conditions.Earlier in April, the Chinese government slapped a $2.8 billion dollar fine on Alibaba claiming it had abused its dominant market position by engaging in controversial practices.(with inputs from Reuters, ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-alibaba-chinese-govt-cracks-down-on-ride-hailing-company-didi-chuxing-101625322276556.html

Cancer patients experience a higher burden of Covid-19 severity, complications, and mortality than the general population, and little data were available on vaccine efficacy in such high-risk patients.An international team of researchers surveyed 131 patients with cancer to study the immune response to mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. Among them, 94% developed antibodies to the coronavirus while seven high-risk patients did not. The small group of patients who exhibited no response to the mRNA vaccines raised questions about how their protection against the virus will be addressed moving forward."We could not find any antibodies against the virus in those patients," said Dimpy P. Shah, MD, PhD, of the Mays Cancer Center, home to UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson. "That has implications for the future. Should we provide a third dose of vaccine after cancer therapy has completed in certain high-risk patients?"Also Read | Delta symptoms may differ from traditional Covid symptoms, claims studyWhich group is less likely to respond to Covid vaccines?The median age of patients included in the survey was 63 and most of them (106) had solid cancers as against haematological malignancies (25). Pankil K. Shah, a co-lead author of the study, said that patients with haematological malignancies, such as myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma, were less likely to respond to vaccination than those with solid tumours.Among the patients, those receiving Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of haematological cancers and autoimmune diseases, within six months of vaccination developed no antibodies. Patients on chemotherapy developed antibody response but it was muted compared to the general population.“How that relates to protection against Covid-19, we don't know yet," Dr Dimpy Shah said.The study suggests that patients with high-risk cancers should continue taking precautions even after being vaccinated. The findings of the study were published in the journal 'Cancer Cell'.Limitations of the studyThe highly transmissible Delta variant and other mutants were not examined in the study. The team also did not analyze the response of infection-fighting T cells and B cells in patients with cancer. The study population was 80% non-Hispanic white, 18% Hispanic and 2% Black, which means immune response among Black may vary in a bigger sample size."We recommend that future studies be done in Black, Asian and Hispanic patients, as well, to see if there are any differences in vaccination immune response," Dr Ruben Mesa, MD, FACP, executive director of the Mays Cancer Center said.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-immune-response-to-covid-19-vaccines-in-small-group-of-cancer-patients-study-101625318473927.html
03-07-2021||World||Jill Biden's pace of travels reveals many missions and emotions||After wrapping up a hectic, two-day swing through Dallas, Houston and Phoenix to promote Covid-19 vaccinations, Jill Biden didn’t relax on the four-hour flight back to Washington.She prepped for yet more travel in a week that by itself demonstrated the range of missions and emotions associated with the first lady's movements around the country.Within the span of 36 hours this past week, Biden went from clinking cups of beer with Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, at an Astros baseball game in Houston to joining the president in Florida to comfort families whose loved ones were lost or missing after the Surfside condo collapse.Along the way, she continued the juggling act that comes with being the first first lady to continue the career she had outside the White House. In Texas, she set aside an hour to Zoom into a book club meeting back in Virginia with women at the community college where she teaches English.Jill Biden’s pace of travel is on par with the president's.The week before her stops in Texas and Arizona, she pushed vaccinations in Mississippi and Tennessee, and again days later in the Florida cities of Kissimmee and Tampa.Her stop at the Astros game was designed to help showcase a vaccination push by Major League Baseball that features incentives like tickets to future games and a replica World Series ring.“It’s safe. It’s effective. It’s free,” she declared of the Covid-19 vaccines.Jill Biden is spending most of the Fourth of July weekend appearing in Maine, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania at events celebrating progress on fighting the coronavirus.“I think that we knew right from the start that she was going to be a more active first lady,” said Myra Gutin, who studies first ladies at Rider University in New Jersey. “She just personally strikes me as somebody that wants to be busy and somebody that wants to help.”Laura Bush, a former elementary school teacher and librarian, spent her initial months as first lady planning an education summit she hosted at Georgetown University in July 2001 and on supporting the No Child Left Behind education law, the first major domestic policy initiative of the new administration.Michelle Obama used her opening months to visit Cabinet departments and thank federal workers for their service. Melania Trump lived at Trump Tower in Manhattan until son Barron finished the school year and they joined President Donald Trump at the White House in June 2017.Anita McBride, a first lady scholar at American University, said Jill Biden came to the role well-prepared after being in the public eye for most of her adult life. Joe Biden was already a U.S. senator when they got married, and he was in Congress for a total of 36 years, followed by eight years as vice president.Unlike Michelle Obama or Melania Trump, Jill Biden, 70, has no young children to command her attention. The first lady also likes to travel and stay busy.It isn’t lost on the president just how busy his wife of 44 years is these days. He even suggested the stepped-up pace of White House life had cut into their “romantic time.”“She’s been traveling all over the country. And doing major events for me … and for the country,” the president told Vogue magazine for a recent profile of his wife. “And so I’ll find that I’m working on a hell of an important speech and I’m distracted. And then I may not be working on one and I want to go and hang out with her, and she’s working on an important speech! Or grading papers.”“We have to figure out a way, and I mean this sincerely, to be able to steal time for one another,” he said.McBride, who was Laura Bush's chief of staff, said that while it's important for presidents to leave Washington and spend time among the people, they can catch criticism if they're seen as spending too much time traveling and not enough time taking care of the people's business.“It's a balance for presidents to do both and a huge asset when the first lady can help,” McBride said in an email.To that end, Jill Biden has become a top promoter of her husband's policies as well as her own issues and causes, ranging from child tax credits and a proposal for free community college to support for military families and finding a cure for cancer.By Sunday she will have taken 20 solo official plane or car trips outside of Washington, including a handful of overnighters on the West Coast and in the Southwest. The count does not include her local stops in Washington or her trips with the president, such as last week's stop in Surfside, where she laid a large bouquet of white irises on the curb of a makeshift memorial near the site of the collapsed condo building.Meanwhile, the president's trip to Michigan on Saturday will be his 21st aboard Air Force One for official business, including last month's trip to Europe. The count does not include Biden's weekends at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, or at the Camp David presidential retreat. It also does not include Biden's trip to Wilmington for a former staffer's wake, and a midweek getaway in June to his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, for the first lady's birthday.The first lady said she'll keep traveling around the country to encourage people, especially young people, to get vaccinated to help ward off Covid-19.In Texas and Arizona, the first lady tried to cut through misinformation about the vaccines, assuring people that the doses are safe, effective and had been thoroughly tested. She stressed that the jabs are free, that people can get free rides to clinics and that appointments aren't necessary. She also noted that the shot itself is so quick, it doesn't hurt, and that she was vaccinated even though she hates needles.At a clinic in an area of Phoenix where the vaccination rate is lagging, she made small talk with a girl as an alcohol pad was rubbed on her arm in preparation for the Covid-19 shot.Then the vaccinator pushed the needle into the girl's arm, and pulled it out.“It's over,” Biden exclaimed and applauded before she moved on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jill-biden-s-pace-of-travels-reveals-many-missions-and-emotions-101625315013463.html

Dr Nagpaul further warned that the infections continue to rise “at an alarming rate” due to the Delta variant of Covid-19, which was first found in India last year.Also Read: Johnson rebuffs Covid concerns raised by Merkel due to large crowds at Euro 2020The measures, which the BMA believes should remain in effect even beyond the expected date of the lifting of Covid-19 curbs, include face masks in enclosed places such as public transport, shops and healthcare settings, as well as social distancing messaging for people to gather in well-ventilated places.“The sensible, cautious measures that we are proposing will be vital in maintaining not just the impact of rising case numbers on people’s individual health and the health services, but also in maintaining the wider damage to the economy and the society, caused by even further waves, new variants and lockdowns,” Dr Nagpaul further said.Also Read: Experts want countries to closely watch UK strategy of combating Delta variantOn the Delta variant he said it makes “no sense” to remove the restrictions in their entirety because cases are rising at an alarming rate due to a “rapid transmission” of the said variant. The rise in cases, he said, is also due to an increase in “people mixing with one another.”In a warning for Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government, Dr Nagpaul said the ministers must not “simply disregard the most recent, damning numbers by rushing into meeting their July 19 deadline.” According to BMA’s data, weekly Covid-19 cases have risen 74% over the last seven days, while the number of new hospitalisations has increased 55% over the previous week.On Friday, Public Health England (PHE) released its weekly data on variants of concern (VoC). The data showed a further 50,824 Covid-19 cases due to the Delta variant, a 46% rise from the previous week.According to Johns Hopkins University, the United Kingdom has thus far seen 4,871,811 cases of the coronavirus disease, of which 128,453 cases have resulted in patients’ deaths.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-doctor-urges-uk-govt-to-keep-in-place-covid-19-safety-measures-postlockdown-101625315057951.html

The US has vaccinated nearly half of its population, giving authorities the confidence to allow outdoor gatherings to celebrate the July 4 weekend.However, facemasks remain mandatory for all passengers, including those fully vaccinated against Covid-19, in transportation hubs as well as on many commercial and public transportation networks. The Transportation Security Administration said on Thursday that air travel to some vacation hotspots within the country is already exceeding pre-pandemic levels, thus putting more pressure on authorities to enforce the mask mandate. Apart from intra-US travel, Americans will be also looking to fly overseas as more countries are now opening up to boost tourism.Here’s the status of some of the coveted destinations for Americans:EuropeThe EU Digital Covid Certificate launched on July 1 has made travel easier for fully vaccinated individuals. Travellers with a recent negative PCR test or those who have recovered from Covid-19 will be able to avail the benefits of the “vaccine passport” that allows people to skip quarantine and move around the bloc more freely.Switzerland and Sweden have joined the list of countries opening their borders this week for travellers from the United States. Spain has even waived vaccination requirements for American tourists, which means unvaccinated travellers will be able to visit the European country without needing to quarantine.Also Read | US likely to miss July 4 Covid-19 vaccination targetAfricaMauritius has launched the first phase of the multiphase reopening plan under which vaccinated individuals will be able to enter the island from July 15. They have to stay at the accommodation of their choice for 14 days and will be able to move freely around the island upon completion of the semi-quarantine.Asia-PacificThe United States has been included in the list of countries from where travellers will be allowed for a quarantine-free trip in Thailand under the ‘Phuket Sandbox’ plan. But instead of quarantining in a hotel or government-approved facilities, the tourists will have to stay within the limits of the popular resort island of Phuket for 14 days in order to access the rest of Thailand.South AmericaGuided tours in Peru's famous Inca Trail, which terminates at Machu Picchu, will resume from July 15. The permits for the adventure tour have gone on sale for the first time since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic last year.

03-07-2021||World||US experts sound alarm over 'soft-pedal coverage' of CCP's centenary||The 'soft-pedal coverage' of the Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech at the Communist Party centenary has left US experts sounding the alarm bells.According to Fox News, the mainstream media in the United States had a celebratory tone leading up to the 100-year anniversary of CCP, despite its poor human rights record.China expert Gordon Chang believes that a lot of news organizations want to do business in China, and as a result, they are willing to mellow down their coverage."I think it's because a lot of news organizations want to do business in China, and so they are willing to soft-pedal coverage and they are not willing to give context where context is required," Chang told Fox. "I think there's the commercial motive there."During the 100th founding anniversary of the CCP, Xi threatened that any nation that gets in the way of China's priorities "will find their heads bashed bloody against a great wall of steel".According to Chang, the mainstream media didn't pick up on an "important message" that was sent to America through the communist leader's rhetoric."What they should have said was that Xi Jinping has territorial designs on other countries. So really what he was saying was that he's going to wage war on the region. And that was not pointed out," Chang said, adding that most American media outlets lack context when covering China and failed to pick up on a key element of the speech.On Thursday, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Chinese President is serious about his 'bashing heads bloody' remark and called on President Joe Biden's administration to strengthen its policies against Beijing.Pompeo urged the Biden administration to take the Chinese threat seriously and that the Chinese President sees America as 'weak'. "We've seen this now for six months with this administration: unprepared to respond to Chinese aggression," he said.Pompeo further remarked: "Xi is serious. He has confidence, he's aggressive. He thinks America is declining. He's wrong about that but it's going to take American leadership to prove him wrong."According to Fox News, China revelled in what it views as the bedrock of the nation's global success. However, they will without a doubt fail to mention that tens of millions of people have been killed at the hands of the CCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-experts-sound-alarm-over-soft-pedal-coverage-of-ccp-s-centenary-101625309109349.html

Yi insisted that a “wall of immunity” will also help deal with political discrimination and bring about a collective global response to the pandemic."The most urgent priority is to expedite the construction of the 'Great Wall of Immunity' to fend off the virus, surpass political discrimination and carry out international anti-pandemic cooperation." Yi said, reported Reuters."We should face the imminent challenges together," he added.China has been facing intense scrutiny from the international community for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is believed to be the epicentre of the virus, has been the subject of intense scrutiny and with President Biden renewing an investigation into the ‘Lab leak theory’ , China has been left to battle the virus at home and abroad.The US has been stringently questioning the lab’s safety and have levelled allegations against its scientists for engaging in a controversial gain of function research that manipulated viruses in a manner making them more dangerous.Chinese President Xi Jinping in a defiant speech from atop Tiananmen Gate during the centenary celebration of the founding of the ruling Communist Party cautioned that anyone who tries to bully China “will face broken heads and bloodshed,". China watchers have suggested that none other than the US is at the receiving end of Xi’s anger, for pushing issues of virus origin, and criticising the Communist Party’s technology policies, military expansion and human rights record.China, which has administered about 19.47 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine domestically, till July 1, as per the national health bureau records, has been busy with vaccine diplomacy, sending shipments of its home grown vaccine to Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Pakistan, South Africa, supplying more than 480 million vaccine doses to other nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-urges-nations-to-construct-a-great-wall-against-covid19-101625310452333.html

Iran has reported more than 3.2 million Covid-19 cases and over 84,000 related deaths, according to official figures, overwhelming the health infrastructure of the Islamic republic."It is feared that we are on the way to a fifth wave throughout the country," Rouhani told a meeting of Iran's anti-virus taskforce.The Iranian health ministry has classified the capital and nine other cities in Tehran province as “red”, the highest category on the country’s coronavirus risk scale. The southern and southeastern provinces of Fars, Hormozgan, Kerman and Sistan-Baluchistan have also been classified as "red".The outgoing president warned the public to be careful as "the Delta variant has spread" in southern provinces. According to the health ministry, only 1.7 million people in Iran have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, leaving the country highly vulnerable to new coronavirus waves driven by more deadly and transmissible variants."God willing, the situation will improve in terms of vaccinations from next week," Rouhani said.Iran is administering two locally produced vaccines under emergency use authorization as the country’s vaccination procurement has been hit by the sanctions imposed by the United States. The US sanctions have made it difficult for Iran, which is struggling to import vaccines for its population, to transfer money to foreign firms.On Friday, World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the world is witnessing a very “dangerous period” as the Delta variant continues to evolve and mutate. The highly transmissible Delta variant, first detected in India, is rapidly spreading in many countries, and the WHO has warned about the scenes of hospitals overflowing with patients in countries with low vaccination coverage.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-iranian-cities-in-red-as-rouhani-fears-fifth-wave-linked-to-delta-variant-101625307382778.html

In a statement, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe said that “increased mixing, travel, gathering and easing of social restrictions” contributed to the rise in cases.He added that the upward trend of cases – which occurred after a 10-week decline in 53 member states of the WHO European region – is happening at a time when infections due to the Delta variant of coronavirus is fast spreading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-suggests-mix-and-match-of-covid-vaccines-for-better-immune-response-101625307202265.html

The WHO chief told a press briefing on Friday that the Delta variant, first identified in India, has been detected in at least 98 countries and is quickly becoming the dominant strain in many of them.“Compounded by more transmissible variants, like Delta, which is quickly becoming the dominant strain in many countries, we are in a very dangerous period of this pandemic,” Ghebreyesus said.Ghebreyesus said that terrible scenes of hospitals overflowing are again becoming the norm in countries with low vaccination coverage, adding that no country is “out of the woods yet”. Terming the Delta variant “dangerous”, the head of the UN health agency warned that the Delta variant is continuing to evolve and mutate. He also advised governments for constant evaluation and careful adjustment of the public health response.The WHO chief underlined that there are essentially two ways for countries to push back against new surges in Covid-19 cases. He stressed that public health and social measures like strong surveillance, strategic testing, early case detection, isolation and clinical care remain critical, adding that masking, physical distance, avoiding crowded places and keeping indoor areas well ventilated are required to keep the surge in check."And second, the world must equitably share protective gear, oxygen, tests, treatments and vaccines," said Ghebreyesus.He also urged Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna to share mRNA technology and know-how to help new manufacturing hubs accelerate the production of Covid-19 vaccines. He lamented that though some sharing of Covid-19 vaccines are happening, “it’s still only a trickle, which is being outpaced by variants.”“The sooner we start building more vaccine hubs and upping global vaccine capacity, the sooner we can diminish deadly surges," Ghebreyesus added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-in-very-dangerous-period-as-delta-variant-continues-to-mutate-warns-who-chief-101625304216229.html

Here’s how they were rescued||Two pilots of a Boeing 737-200 cargo plane were forced to make an emergency landing in the ocean near Honolulu in the early hours of Friday after reporting engine trouble, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said, according to media reports. The US Coast Guard (USCG) rescued both the pilots from a debris field after they made the emergency landing at around 1.30am local time. In a statement, the FAA said that the pilots reported an engine glitch soon after starting their 33-minute intra-transport journey from Honolulu to the regional Kahului Airport on the island of Maui.According to audio from Honolulu's Daniel K Inouye International Airport’s tower, one of the pilots complained of losing “number 1 engine” and that the plane had about “two hours’ worth of fuel,” CNBC reported. The pilot also said that there is a possibility of them losing the other engine as well because “it’s running very hot,” the CNBC report added. Moments later the air traffic controller alerted for low altitude, and the first pilot asked the former to “let the Coast Guard know,” the report further stated.The USCG stated that after receiving a report from the Honolulu Air Traffic Control regarding the Boeing 737 downing offshore, it sent a helicopter, a cutter, a rescue plane and a 45-foot boat to search for the two pilots. “Once on the scene, the Dolphin crew was able to rescue one of the people on board while the Honolulu Fire Department rescue boat recovered the other,” the USCG statement read.Both the pilots were in “good condition,” USCG spokesperson Lieutenant Commander Karin Evelyn said in an email, the New York Times reported. They were later sent to a hospital and are now in stable condition, the USCG said in a statement.Commander Evelyn said that the plane debris remains at the landing site and that the USCG will evaluate the pollution at first light, the New York Times reported.The Boeing 737-200 was built in 1975 and its size is just over 100 feet in length. The plane can be converted to accommodate up to 100 tourist passengers, as per Boeing’s description of the plane. Jet officials of the downed Boeing in question said that it was not a 737 Max plane, which has been banned globally following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, CNBC reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilots-land-boeing-737-in-ocean-near-honolulu-here-s-how-they-were-rescued-101625298306385.html

The flames resembled molten lava and were dubbed “eye of fire” on several social media platforms. Several Mexican journalists and publications shared videos on Twitter of the fire raging in the middle of the ocean as boats sprayed streams of water on it and the clips quickly racked up millions of views.A Reuters report noted that Pemex said it took more than five hours to completely extinguish the fire. A video of the incident showed the blaze having a circular shape, as it emerged a few distances from a Pemex oil platform.🚨 Sobre el incendio registrado en aguas del Golfo de México, en la Sonda de Campeche, a unos metros de la plataforma Ku-Charly (dentro del Activo Integral de Producción Ku Maloob Zaap)Tres barcos han apoyado para sofocar las llamas pic.twitter.com/thIOl8PLQoPemex officials familiar with the matter told Reuters that the fire began in the underwater pipeline which connects to a platform at the firm’s flagship ‘Ku Maloob Zaap’ oil development. This flagship is situated just up from the Gulf of Mexico’s southern rim.Pemex said no injuries were reported in the incident and that oil production from its flagship project remained unhindered following the gas leak that occurred around 5:15am local time. The flames were fully put out by 10:30am local time, Reuters reported. The company said it would probe the cause of the fire, the Reuters report added. Pemex further highlighted it has also shut the 12-inch-diameter pipeline’s valves.The company reportedly said that it used boats to pump water over the flames, although its workers said that nitrogen was also used, Reuters added, citing an incident report.This is not the first time that such an incident has happened at Pemex, which has a long record of industrial accidents at its facilities, Reuters reported.The head of Mexico’s oil safety regulator ASEA, Angel Carrizales, wrote on Twitter that the fire incident on the Gulf of Mexico “did not generate any spill.” However, he refrained from providing an explanation of what was burning on the water’s surface.The flagship project ‘Ku Maloob Zaap’ is Pemex’s biggest crude oil producer, with over 40 per cent of the firm’s nearly 1.7 million barrels of daily output coming from it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eye-of-fire-on-gulf-of-mexico-after-gas-leak-in-underwater-pipeline-101625291884343.html

The NACI continued to strongly recommend that mRNA vaccines be offered to those who are eligible to receive it.“We have been closely monitoring the evolving situation of rare cases of myocarditis or pericarditis following mRNA vaccination among younger people. The NACI is encouraged to see that the clinical presentations appear mild, and resolve quickly. The benefits of the Covid-19 immunisation programme continue to outweigh the relatively small risk for all people including adolescents,” NACI chief Shelley Deeks said.Her views were echoed by Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam, who said, “There have been a small number of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis reported in Canada after vaccination. Evidence is evolving, and Canadian and international investigations into an association between myocarditis or pericarditis and mRNA vaccines continue. I want to let Canadians know that the benefits of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines continue to outweigh their potential risks.”According to data available from Health Canada till June 18, there were 65 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis detected in the country. Of these, 50 happened after Pfizer-BioNtech jabs, 10 after Moderna and five after Covishield, which is the India-made version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-warns-of-very-rare-risk-of-heart-issues-from-mrna-vaccines-101625290375865.html

Ariana News cited civil society activists in Takhar as saying that the Taliban have also have set dowry regulations for girls. “They urged women in a statement to not leave without a relative (Moharam) and also urged men to have beards,” Merajuddin Sharifi, a civil society activist in Takhar, was quoted as saying by Ariana News. Sharifi also said the “Taliban insist on trials without evidence.”Also read | Afghanistan ripe hunting ground for Taliban as last US troops exit key airbaseThe Taliban have in the past imposed a harsh version of Islamic rule. They included barring girls from school and women from working outside their homes and prohibiting them from being in public without a male relative before they were ousted after the US-led invasion in 2001. Those who violated those rules often suffered humiliation and public beatings by the Taliban's religious police.The Taliban have intensified its offensive against civilians and government defence and security forces and have taken control of several districts across the country as foreign forces are withdrawing from the war-torn country. The group seized Tagab district in Kapisa province on Thursday, Ariana News reported citing people familiar with the developments.Also read | Engaging with the Taliban is necessaryResidents in areas captured by Taliban also have to pay more for food as their risen substantially, members of Takhar provincial council said, according to Ariana News. “People are facing problems there; services are nonexistent, clinics, and schools are closed,” Mohammad Azam Afzali, a member of the provincial council, told Ariana News.Takhar governor Abdullah Qarluq said that government buildings have been destroyed by the Taliban and services have been stopped in areas controlled by Taliban. “They (Taliban) looted everything, and no services exist,” Qarluq said.The Taliban, according to Ariana News, have rejected the claims and called them propaganda against the group.Also read | India alerts its nationals of 'serious threat of kidnapping' in AfghanistanIn May, top US intelligence analysts warned that the Taliban "would roll back much" of the progress made in Afghan women's rights if the Islamist extremists regain national power.

"Progress (in women's rights) probably owes more to external pressure than domestic support, suggesting it would be at risk after coalition withdrawal, even without Taliban efforts to reverse it," the assessment said, according to Reuters.The situation in Afghanistan has been deteriorating for several weeks and fighting has surged since early May when the US military began its final withdrawal of troops. The Taliban have claimed that they have recently captured more than 100 of the over 400 districts across Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-issue-rules-in-captured-afghan-districts-for-women-men-101625289058314.html

At least 19 people are missing following the landslide, the news agency quoted the Japanese authorities as saying.Atami, located in Japan's Shizouka Prefecture, is a town known for its hot springs -- the name "Atami" literally meaning "hot ocean". As such, the town at the northern end of the Izu Peninsula sits on the steep slopes of a partially submerged volcanic caldera on the edge of Sagami Bay.According to disaster management officials cited by the Associated Press, the mudslide in Shizuoka prefecture in central Japan occurred on Saturday morning. A "deluge of black water and debris" crashed into the residences in the town, Japanese media networks said.News media captured footage of the black mudslide sliding down the mountainside and crushing residences in its path, as helpless neighbors watched in horror, some recording on their phones.Rescue work is on, officials were quoted as saying, to retrieve the 19 people who are unaccounted for in the incident. "The safety of 19 people is unknown," news agency AFP quoted a Shizuoka prefecture official, who is in charge of disaster management, as saying.Heavy rainfall has been lashing across Japan since earlier this week, causing rivers in the central part of the country and in Tokyo to swell, increasing the risk of landslides.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-mudslide-sweeps-away-row-of-houses-near-tokyo-at-least-19-missing-101625288829563.html

Center deputy spokesperson Apisamai Srirangsan said Bangkok authorities must urgently set up isolation stations to separate infected people in their local communities and add beds for treatment of serious cases.Critics since the beginning of the year have charged that the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has failed to secure timely and adequate vaccine supplies, and efforts to obtain more have proceeded slowly.Experts at a Health Ministry briefing on Friday painted a grim picture of how to prioritize who gets vaccinated.Epidemiologist Kamnuan Ungchoosak said the arrival of the delta variant of the virus, believed to be more contagious, could push the number of deaths up to 1,400 in July and more in coming months.He said 80% of the deaths are among the elderly and people with chronic diseases, and if they are vaccinated it could significantly reduce the death rate while also lowering the demand for ICU beds. Around 10% of elderly and infirm patients die, while the rate for those age 20-40 is less than 0.1%, he said.But at the same time, significant outbreaks are occurring among other groups, including people in construction worker camps and restaurant workers, who also need to be vaccinated, he said.“We currently have closed the camps and businesses, but the number of cases is not declining and the economy is bad. But if we focus on old people and those who have chronic diseases, we might not have to shut down the businesses and the bed demands from these two groups will also decline,” Kamnuan said.Prayuth has targeted mid-October for opening up the country to vaccinated visitors from abroad without quarantines.Sopon Mekthon, chairman of the government’s subcommittee on Covid-19 vaccine management, said only 2 million of about 16 million old and infirm people have received vaccines.Nakorn Premsri, director of the National Vaccine Institute, said a Thai company, Siam BioScience, was supposed to provide the country with 10 million doses a month of the locally produced AstraZeneca vaccine, but that has been cut to 5-6 million doses. The company, owned by Thailand's king, reportedly has had production problems. It also has contracts to provide vaccines to other countries.He said Thailand is trying to negotiate with other producers to fill the gap. So far, Thailand has only used vaccines from AstraZeneca and China's Sinovac and Sinopharm, although the government says it has agreements to also buy from Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-sees-record-single-day-spike-of-over-6-200-new-covid-19-cases-101625275591679.html

This rise in deaths came as Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava news agency AFP on Friday that she signed an order which authorised the demolition of the portion of the building which is still standing.“We’re still evaluating all possible impacts and determining the best timeline to actually begin the demolition,” Cava said, adding the top priority is search and rescue and the building poses a threat to public health and safety.The number of people missing in the June 24 tragedy in South Florida fell from 145 to 126, after duplicate names were striked off and some residents, which were earlier reported missing, were found to be safe. Cava added the figures of missing are expected to keep changing as detectives are constantly reviewing the list and verifying reports.Officials, meanwhile, said detectives have been working round the clock to contact the relatives and acquaintances of the missing residents. However, not a single person has been rescued since the first hours after the condominium building collapsed.Miami-Dade assistant fire chief Raide Jadallah told AP on Friday that only a woman’s voice had been heard during the entire search. “Most of the victims have been deceased in their bedroom indicating they were asleep,” Jadallah said.Amid the possible arrival of Hurricane Elsa, which will bring strong winds to Florida, Jadallah said the rescue operations might be suspended. “We will try to go as long as we can, but you can see from different periods of inclement weather we’ve had, we have stopped,” he said. According to the National Weather Service, the storm could approach Florida as early as Monday.Meanwhile, authorities started evacuating residents of nearby condominium building on Friday in the wake of the June 24 mishap. The city of North Miami Beach said in an official statement the 156-unit Crestview Towers had been deemed structurally and electrically unsafe months ago.“In an abundance of caution, the City ordered the building closed immediately and the residents evacuated for their protection, while a full structural assessment is conducted and next steps are determined,” city manager Arthur H Sorey III said in the statement.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-condo-collapse-toll-rises-to-22-nearby-building-evacuated-101625275753720.html
03-07-2021||World||Lightning strikes in Western Canada increase tenfold, may fuel forest fires||Lightning strikes in Western Canada over the past two days soared nearly tenfold from the same time a year ago, triggered in part by a record-breaking heatwave, meteorologists said, warning of more strikes over the weekend that could further stoke forest fires fanned by high winds.Over 710,000 lightning strikes were recorded in British Columbia and western Alberta between 3 p.m. on Wednesday and 6 a.m. on Thursday, up from an average of 8,300 from the same period over the past five years, said Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist with Vaisala, a global environmental measurements company which collects the data.The Pacific province of British Columbia has been recovering from the grip of an unprecedented heatwave, which has so far caused 719 confirmed deaths, triple what would normally occur in the same time period, the province's chief coroner said on Friday.During the heatwave, the town of Lytton broke Canada's 80-plus-year-old heat record with a 49.6°C (121.28°F) temperature. A forest fire that started on Wednesday razed Lytton to the ground, and caused two deaths. The cause of the fire was under investigation.British Columbia usually accounts for about 5% of Canada's total lighting strikes each year, but it has reported its annual number in less than 48 hours, Vagasky said.The figure is comparable to "what you would typically see on some of the bigger lightning days in really lightning-prone regions of the United States, like Texas or Oklahoma," Vagasky said and is unheard of for a region like British Columbia.The high number of lightning strikes was caused in part by the heatwave, which created high levels of moisture in the atmosphere in the form of melting snow and evaporation of water from vegetation, said Jonathan Bau, a meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.The moisture fueled the unusually fierce thunderstorms."We're not in the middle of summer where everything's dried out," Bau said, adding that more lightning was forecast for the weekend.The strikes caused several forest fires across central British Columbia, with 136 fires burning as of Friday afternoon, B.C. officials said at a briefing.The fires are expected to burn through 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) by the end of the weekend, officials said, a significantly higher figure than by this point in previous years - B.C. does not usually see its forest fire season ramp up until late July.Over 1,300 homes have been ordered evacuated, and it is not known how many people are missing. The Red Cross is running a phone line for family reunification, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lightning-strikes-in-western-canada-increase-tenfold-may-fuel-forest-fires-101625274179561.html

03-07-2021||World||Firefighters make progress in efforts against California forest fires||Firefighters were making progress Friday against Northern California forest fires that burned several homes and forced thousands to flee communities even as authorities prepared for a hot, crowded Fourth of July weekend that could bring the threat of new blazes.Three wildfires near the towering Mount Shasta volcano an hour's drive from the Oregon border have burned around 60 square miles (155 square kilometers) of land.Damage was reported at the Salt Fire, which broke out Wednesday near Interstate 5 and prompted evacuations for some roads in Lakehead, an unincorporated community of around 700 people north of the city of Redding.A reporter for the Redding Record Searchlight saw at least a dozen buildings destroyed south of Lakehead, including homes, garages and outbuildings, the paper reported.Alexis Hohimer and her son, Michael, ended up at a Red Cross shelter in the city of Shasta Lake after authorities ordered their trailer park to evacuate early Thursday.“So all we can do is hope and pray right now. Keep our fingers crossed,” she said.The Salt Fire was slightly larger early Friday, covering nearly 8 square miles (21 square kilometers), and was 5% contained, said Adrienne Freeman, a spokeswoman for Shasta-Trinity National Forest. She said official damage assessments will be made by local authorities.No building damage was reported from two other northern fires, which erupted as California and the rest of the U.S. West is enduring a historic drought tied to climate change.“Fuel conditions this year are looking a lot more like late August than early July,” Freeman said.To the north, the Lava Fire burning partly on the flanks of Mount Shasta covered more than 37 square miles (96 square kilometers) but was 27% contained. Several thousand residents of Lake Shastina were allowed to return home late Thursday.Firefighters were doing mop-up on the western side of the fire and making good progress on the most active eastern portion, fire official Pat Bell said in a morning briefing.To the northeast, the Tennant Fire in the Klamath National Forest grew slightly to more than 15 square miles (40 square kilometers) but progress was also reported there. Mop-up began on the western flank while the east side remained active. Evacuation orders and warnings continued in nearby areas.The blazes erupted during an extreme heat wave in the U.S. West. The heat has since moderated but temperatures in the Mount Shasta area were still expected to reach nearly 100 degrees (38 Celsius) over the weekend.Arizona, New Mexico and Utah have been forced to battle wildfires and California is bracing for what some experts fear will be one of its worst fire seasons yet.Last year, California wildfires scorched more than 6,562 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of land, the most in its recorded history. And just three years ago, a fire in Butte County in Northern California killed 85 people and largely destroyed the town of Paradise.This year, many of California's national parks have restrictions on campfires, cooking and smoking because of fire risks in the hot, dry summer. The parks are bracing for large crowds over the holiday weekend.Fire authorities throughout California also have stepped up campaigns urging people not to use fireworks to celebrate the Fourth of July, citing both the explosive dangers and the threat of wildfires in the withering conditions.“The fuels are bone dry,” Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said. “We are extremely concerned about the use of fireworks of all kinds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firefighters-make-progress-in-efforts-against-california-forest-fires-101625256687281.html

There is no work... there is no business," said Fazal Karim, a bicycle mechanic.Over the years the mini-city has been visited by hundreds of thousands of US and NATO service members and contractors.At one point it boasted swimming pools, cinemas and spas -- and even a boardwalk featuring fast-food outlets such as Burger King and Pizza Hut.The base also housed a prison that held thousands of Taliban and jihadist inmates.Bagram was built by the United States for its Afghan ally during the Cold War in the 1950s as a bulwark against the Soviet Union in the north.Ironically, it became the staging point for the Soviet invasion of the country in 1979, and the Red Army expanded it significantly during its near-decade-long occupation.When Moscow pulled out, Bagram became central to the raging civil war of the 1990s -- it was reported that at one point the Taliban controlled one end of the two-mile (three-kilometer) runway and the opposition Northern Alliance the other.As of May 2021, there were about 9,500 foreign troops in Afghanistan, of which US troops made up the largest contingent of 2,500.So far Germany and Italy have both confirmed the full withdrawal of their contingents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-complete-us-troops-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-by-end-of-august-101625250681719.html
03-07-2021||World||Unfavourable views regarding China on the rise across developed economies, Pew study shows||A study conducted by the Pew Research Center revealed that several developed countries showed a negative attitude towards China due to its treatment of minorities, the Chinese government's restrictions on freedoms and rights of its own people as well as Xi Jinping’s handling of international affairs.The research was conducted by taking the opinions of 18,850 people from the people of Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the UK, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.Xi Jinping warns foreign foes not to mess with ChinaUnfavourable views of China increased in several of these economically developed countries, according to the study. In Japan, Sweden, Australia, South Korea and the United States unfavourable views of China are currently at near historical highs, the study showed. Countries like Australia, Sweden, the UK and Canada saw an increase in negative attitudes towards China due to the bilateral tensions in 2020.Every four in 10 respondents from the US and Canada held a highly negative view of China. In the US and Canada, 76% and 73% of the respondents had an unfavourable view of China. Among European countries, at least 70% of the respondents from Sweden, Netherlands, Germany and more than 60% of the respondents from Belgium, France, the UK and Italy harboured adverse opinions toward China.Date yet to be fixed for next India-China military commanders’ meetingChina failed to impress in its own neighbourhood as more than 75% respondents from Japan, Australia and South Korea said they have an unfavourable view of China. Notably, 80% of the respondents from Japan harboured unfavourable views on China. At least roughly nine-in-ten surveyed see China negatively in Japan while two-thirds or more respondents in Australia, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand hold similar views.Exceptions were seen in Singapore, where 64% of respondents see China favourably and while in Greece 52% of respondents have a favourable opinion towards China.Personal freedom of Chinese citizensMajority of these respondents believe that China does not respect the personal freedom of its own citizens. Barring Singapore, a large number of respondents feel that China does not respect the personal freedoms of its people. At least nine out of 10 respondents from Sweden, South Korea, Australia, the Netherlands, the US and Japan said that China does not respect the personal freedoms of its people. Singapore remains an outlier here as well but even then 60% of the respondents feel China does not respect the personal freedoms.100 years on, how the communist party dominates ChinaEconomic ties with ChinaPost Covid-19 pandemic, as perceptions against China turned towards the negative, nations could not ignore China’s hold over the global economy. Respondent from Canada, European nations and surveyed countries from the Asia Pacific region said that they would prefer to hold closer economic ties with the US than with China. However, a few respondents from Germany, France and New Zealand feel that ties with both nations are equally important.Xi Jinping’s handling of international affairsAt least 80% of respondents in the US and 78% of the respondents in Canada have little or no confidence in Chinese president Xi Jinping’s handling of global affairs. Eight in 10 residents have expressed concern over Xi’s way of working. European respondents also shared a similar response with at least seven in 10 adults expressing lack of confidence in Xi Jinping. The point worth observing was that the number rose following the Covid-19 pandemic.In the Asia Pacific, Japan, South Korea and Australia all the respondents displayed lack of confidence in Xi’s way of working. Japanese respondents share strongest distrust for Xi Jinping as 80% of the respondents view his handling of international affairs negatively. At least two-thirds or more feel the same in South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Taiwan.A century later, the Chinese Communist Party is at the crossroadsThe highly negative views regarding the Chinese government comes in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, its continuous efforts to alter the status quo in eastern Ladakh and the South China Sea and also over suspicions that China tried to meddle with the investigation into the origins of Covid-19.Unfavourable view of China have been fuelled by its worsening bilateral relations with Japan over South China sea and its trade beef with Australia but US’ raising concerns over its treatment of minorities have also led to downgrading of how developed economies view the Asian economic powerhouse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unfavourable-views-regarding-china-on-the-rise-across-world-pew-study-shows-101625248609979.html

And when he goes, Branson would become the first billionaire to do so, as fellow billionaire and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has his trip planned only nine days later on July 20.“I’ve always been a dreamer. My mum taught me to never give up and to reach for the stars. On July 11, it’s time to turn that dream into a reality aboard the next @VirginGalactic spaceflight,” Branson announced in a tweet.I’ve always been a dreamer.

Because space belongs to us all,” he further said in his statement.Also read | Thousands sign petition to stop Jeff Bezos from returning to Earth after space tripSpace raceBranson and Bezos are both popular for their interest in space and commercial flights. However, Bezos was the first to announce his trip back in last month.On June 7, 2021, Blue Origin, the company founded by Bezos, announced that Bezos along with his brother Mark would join the winner of the auction for New Shepard’s first human flight on July 20, 2021. He would also be joined by Wally Funk, 82 years old and one of the 13 women who passed Nasa’s astronaut training program in the 1960s.Notably, Branson has himself said that he was not interested in “racing” to space. In an interview with CNN Business, he said “People have turned it into a race. It would be very dangerous to say turn it into a race. And the moment we have every box ticked, I will go up and then we will invite some of the people who have signed up to go with us — but we honestly don't see it as a race.”The DifferenceWhile both the spacecrafts developed by Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin will give the passengers ultimately a similar experience of a few minutes of weightlessness, they are different from each other.The Blue Origin offers a rocket-like experience with a vertical launch followed by a capsule separating from the booster, spending four minutes at an altitude of over 100kms. Passengers could also observe the curvature of earth.However, the Virgin Galactic is not a rocket but a larger carrier airplane that travels to a high altitude and then releases a smaller spacecraft which would reach suborbital space and glide back to earth.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/richard-branson-to-fly-to-space-on-july-11-in-virgin-galactic-spaceflight-9-days-before-jeff-bezos-101625239112504.html
