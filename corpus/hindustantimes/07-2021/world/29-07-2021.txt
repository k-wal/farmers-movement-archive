This badly flawed government programme should be eliminated,” said Paul Gosar, one of the four members of the House of Representatives, who moved the legislation.The other three are Representatives Matt Gaetz, Mo Brooks and Any Biggs. All four are staunch loyalists of former president Donald Trump, who, while in office, had pushed for and effected hardline anti-immigrant polities in the name. Among other things, he had introduced measures to tighten the H-1B programmes.Gosar, Biggs and Brooks also face questions for their role in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol by Trump supporters who wanted to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s election.There was talk the Trump administration had wanted to end the OPT programme, which has been popular with foreign students, including many from India. It allows foreign students to apply for part-time or full-time work either during the course or after for a year. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students are allowed two more years.The Fairness for High-Skilled Americans Act 2020, as the legislation is called, will have to be passed by the House and the Senate - both of which are controlled by Democrats - to reach the president’s desk for enactment, the chances of which appear extremely dim. To become law, it will need to be signed by another Democrat, President Joe Biden, who has shown no inclination to support any of Trump’s hardline immigration policies, and has, in fact, rescinded many of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-moved-to-kill-work-programme-for-foreign-students-in-us-101627578957442.html
29-07-2021||World||Clays likely source of Mars 'lakes', setback to liquid water hypothesis||The evidence of ‘subsurface lakes’ deep below the ice cap at Mars’ south pole could be due to clay, a trio of new studies have unravelled the mystery. For a long time, scientists have been probing about possible evidence of life on Mars and any evidence suggesting the presence of liquid water on the cold and dry planet tantalizes them.Citing evidence collected from a radar instrument aboard the European Space Agency Mars Express orbiter, a team of scientists from Italy had suggested the possibility of subsurface lakes below the ice caps at Mars’ south pole. According to Nasa, radar signals change when they are reflected off different materials.In this case, the radar signals from the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding, or MARSIS, produced bright signals beneath the polar cap, which, the scientists said, could be interpreted as liquid water.Shortly after researchers from Italy’s Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica published the paper on the lake, about 80 Martian polar scientists met for an international conference in Ushuaia, a seaside village at the southern tip of Argentina. Lots of talks centred around the subsurface lakes as they discussed the possibility of brine lowering the freezing point of the water enough to keep it liquid, said Nasa.Jeffrey Plaut of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Aditya Khuller, a doctoral student who was interning at JPL analyzed 44,000 radar echoes across 15 years of MARSIS data and turned up dozens more bright reflections similar to the 2018 study. They found many of those bright signals in areas close to the surface, where it should be too cold for water to remain liquid.Another theoretical study conducted in a cold laboratory indicated that a group of clays called smectites, scattered in the vicinity of the south pole’s ice cap, could be the reason behind the bright signals.While the possibility of a potentially habitable environment for microbes excited the scientists, a closer look at the data along with laboratory experiments on Earth may have dried up the lakes hypothesis. Some scientists now think clays might be creating those bright signals.“In planetary science, we often are just inching our way closer to the truth,” Plaut, one of the scientists who travelled to the conference, said.“The original paper didn’t prove it was water, and these new papers don’t prove it isn’t. But we try to narrow down the possibilities as much as possible in order to reach consensus,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clays-likely-source-of-mars-lakes-setback-to-liquid-water-hypothesis-101627576574113.html

The ministry said the third dose will be given to those who have been vaccinated with both doses at least five months ago.Following this announcement, Israel became the first nation to announce that it will give booster doses to prevent Covid-19 infections among vaccinated people. The move is also seen as an effort by the Israeli government to slow the spread of the Delta variant, news agency Reuters said, quoting Channel 13 TV and Kan public radio.The health ministry earlier reported a drop in the vaccine's effectiveness against infection along with a slight decrease in the protection the vaccine was providing against Covid-19. Experts told the Israeli health ministry that the Covid-19 vaccine’s effectiveness in severe symptoms among those aged above 60 years dropped from 97% in January to 81%. The ministry last week estimated that the vaccine was 41% effective when it came to preventing symptomatic infections over the past month though protection against severe diseases remained strong at 91%.An expert speaking to Haaretz also said that over 4,000 Israelis with suppressed immune systems have already been administered with a third shot and have not reported any side effects. Some experts however feel that Israel should wait a little longer to collect more information about the safety and effectiveness of the third Covid-19 jab.Vaccine maker Pfizer on Wednesday highlighted the need for administering an additional dose to ensure high protection against Covid-19. Pfizer also said that it will apply for US emergency authorisation for booster shots within August.Israel has vaccinated at least 57% of the 9.3 million population with both doses and vaccinated 64% with at least one dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-becomes-first-nation-to-give-third-covid-vaccine-shot-to-people-over-60-101627571943009.html
29-07-2021||World||AstraZeneca exploring options for Covid-19 vaccine business||AstraZeneca is exploring options for the future of its Covid-19 vaccine and expects greater clarity on the matter by the end of 2021, a senior executive told Reuters on Thursday.The review of the future of the vaccine comes after a series of setbacks in its race to produce a shot for the world. Executives emphasised it was too early to say what the decision on the vaccine's future would be.AstraZeneca agreed to work with the University of Oxford on its Covid-19 shot last year despite having no prior vaccine experience, taking on the project with a pledge not to make a profit during the coronavirus pandemic.While a $39 billion dollar deal to buy rare drug firm Alexion is much more integral to the company's business strategy, the Covid-19 vaccine has quickly become the public face of the company's efforts during the coronavirus pandemic."A small group of people reporting into Mene (Pangalos, research chief) and myself are thinking about: is this a sustainable business?" AstraZeneca Executive Vice President and President of the BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit Ruud Dobber said, referring to the vaccines business."We need to have that discussion with our senior executive team, and then with the board of AstraZeneca. We are exploring different options, but it is far too early at this stage to conclude that (process)."Dobber added that "before year-end, we will have more clarity"."Hopefully before the year ends, we will have a better view how to move forward in the next few years," he said."If you ask me, is the vaccine business a sustainable business for AstraZeneca for the next five or 10 years, that big strategic question is under discussion."FAR TOO EARLYAstraZeneca has been criticised by the European Union for its supply of shots, and is being sued by the bloc. The vaccine has also faced age restrictions due to rare clots linked to the vaccine and its application for U.S. approval is longer than expected.Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said he had no regrets over getting involved in COVID-19 vaccines as the company has made an "enormous difference".It has delivered one billion doses around the world globally and is celebrated by the British government as a national success story of the pandemic.Dobber said that AstraZeneca's "number one commitment" was to deliver hundreds of millions of vaccine doses that were covered by current contracts."It's not a distraction," he said.He added that the company would keep its pledge to deliver a broadly available and accessible vaccine. Soriot has said that the vaccine will always be kept affordable for low-income countries, even when the company moves away from a no-profit model.Results released on Thursday showed sales of the vaccine in the second quarter more than tripled to $894 million from the first three months of the year.But, unlike for rivals including Pfizer, it remains a drag on earnings overall, and Dobber said that if the vaccine business were to be sustainable, the company would have to stop making a loss on it."It doesn't mean that moving forward we will not make a bit of profit," Dobber said. "It's not sustainable to do it without profits, but it's too early now to speculate about that."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-exploring-options-for-covid-19-vaccine-business-101627565958659.html

It features a marzipan base and a sugar onlay coat-of-arms, colored in gold, red, blue, and silver, on top.The piece of cake was given to Moyra Smith, a member of the Queen Mother’s household at Clarence House. Smith kept it in a floral cake tin and with a handmade label on the lid reading: “Handle with Care - Prince Charles & Princess Diane’s (sic) Wedding Cake” which she signed and dated 29/7/81.Smith’s family sold the cake to a collector in 2008, but it is up for auction again Aug. 11. It is expected to fetch between 300 pounds ($418) and 500 pounds ($697), together with an order of service, ceremonial details and a royal wedding breakfast program.“It appears to be in exactly the same good condition as when originally sold,'' Chris Albury, auctioneer and senior valuer at Dominic Winter Auctioneers, said. “But we advise against eating it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/slice-of-lady-diana-s-wedding-cake-up-for-auction-101627570649485.html
29-07-2021||World||US lawmakers introduce bill to end guest worker program for foreign students on F-1 visa||A group of House Republicans has introduced a bill to eliminate a programme that allows foreign students on an F-1 visa to stay in the United States after their completion of studies under certain conditions. Congressmen Paul A Gosar, Mo Brooks, Andy Biggs and Matt Gaetz introduced the ‘Fairness for High-Skilled Americans Act’ in the House of Representatives to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act.Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, Optional Practical Training (OPT) provides for temporary employment in the area of study of F-1 students. They can apply to receive up to 12 months of employment authorization before completing their academic studies and/or after completing their academic studies. If passed, the law would affect thousands of Indians studying in the United States on F-1 student visas.“What country creates a programme, but not a law, that rewards its businesses to fire citizen workers and replace them with foreign labour to pay the foreign labour less? The United States. The programme is called OPT and it reflects a complete abandonment of our own workers,” Gosar said.About 80,000 Indian students are employed in the US through OPT and Gosar alleges that the programme circumvents the H-1B cap to allow over 100,000 foreigners working in the US after graduation. He argued that the F-1 visa holders are exempt from payroll taxes, making them at least 10-15 per cent cheaper than a comparable American worker.“At a time when American college graduates are struggling to find a job and many are saddled with student loans, our government should not be incentivizing foreign employees over Americans. This badly flawed government programme should be eliminated,” he added.The bill has to pass through the House and the Senate before it can be sent to the president to sign it into law. Since Democrats control both the Chambers of the US Congress, it would not be easy for the Republicans to eliminate the programme.“Landing that first job out of college will only become more difficult for young Americans as our universities formalise the role they play in crowding out opportunities once reserved for American graduates. For this reason, the OPT must be eliminated,” stated Kevin Lynn, Founder of US Techworkers, a non-profit pushing Congress to “protect” American workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-end-guest-worker-program-for-foreign-students-on-f-1-visa-101627570477888.html

The country also made vaccination mandatory for all public-sector workers and asked officials to get vaccinated by August 31, according to a report by news agency Reuters. The announcement was made by the National Command and Operations Centre (NCOC), a military-run body which oversees Pakistan’s pandemic response.Asad Umar, head of the NCOC, said at a press briefing on Thursday unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to enter government offices, schools, restaurants and shopping malls from August onwards. The government also said that teachers and students above 18 as well as public transport and retail staff would also have to get vaccinated by the end of August.“If you're not vaccinated you can't go to teach at schools and colleges from August 1. We can't put our children's lives at risk just because you're not ready to get the vaccine,” Asad was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases, dominated by the Delta variant, and finds its health infrastructure under extreme pressure. Pakistan’s Covid-19 test positivity rate stood at 7.53%, according to the NCOC.The NCOC said that Delta, Beta and Alpha variants of Covid-19 have been detected in Pakistan since May. The Pakistan government ramped up its vaccination drive. On Wednesday it administered 850,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines, Reuters announced. Umar said Pakistan aims to administer one million doses every day.Pakistan vaccinated at least 27.8 million with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine while only 5.9 million out of a population of 220 million have been fully vaccinated, according to NCOC. The nation recorded 4,497 new cases and 76 deaths in the previous 24 hours, taking the toll to 23,209.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-says-covid-vaccination-must-for-air-travel-announces-new-restrictions-101627565331876.html

A prehistoric solar observatory in Peru, an ancient Harappa city in India, and a railway connecting the Caspian Sea with the Persian Gulf were among the sites added to the list during the extended 44th session of Unesco’s World Heritage Committee.The committee didn’t meet last year owing to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, so they are reviewing the nominations for both 2020 and 2021. Unesco has listed ten selection criteria of which sites must meet at least one of them to be included on the World Heritage List.The UN cultural agency says the sites must be of “outstanding universal value” and meet at least one of the ten criteria to be included in the World Heritage List. The criteria include representing a “master of human creative genius”, and bearing a “unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared” among others.Also Read | Unesco World Heritage tag: Here's list of all 40 Indian sites after Dholavira additionIn 2021, the committee inscribed 33 properties on the coveted list which includes 28 cultural and 5 natural sites.Here’s the list of the newest World Heritage Sites:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unesco-adds-these-33-cultural-natural-sites-to-world-heritage-list-this-year-101627564288102.html

The antibodies were developed from the blood of alpacas, a species of mammals found in South America.For the study, the team immunised three alpacas with parts of the coronavirus spike protein. The animals then produced antibodies, while scientists also extracted a small sample of blood from them. Next, the team used bacteriophages (viruses which infect bacteria) to select the best antibodies from an initially vast pool. These were then tested for efficacy against SARS CoV-2, and improved in successive rounds of optimisation.“For the first time, these antibodies combine extreme stability and outstanding efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, including Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma,” said Dirk Gorlich, director at MPI for Biophysical Chemistry. These mini-antibodies, also called nanobodies, are currently being prepared for clinical trials, researchers said.The study, published in the EMBO journal, also noted that these nanobodies are “1000 times better” than previously developed antibodies in neutralising the virus. That these nanobodies can be produced at low costs and in large quantities could be a solution to the global demand for Covid-19 therapeutics, it further said.The research also witnessed participation from scientists at from the University Medical Center Goettingen (UMG), which, like MPI, is a German institute. “Our nanobodies can withstand temperatures of up to 95 degrees Celsius without losing their functions or aggregates. They might remain active in the body long enough to be effective,” said Matthias Dobblestein, director at the UMG’s Institute of Molecular Oncology.Antibodies help the immune system in fighting against pathogens. These can be produced industrially and used to treat acutely ill patients. Antibodies act like drugs, relieving symptoms, and shorten recovery period from the disease.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-develop-antibodies-1000-times-better-at-neutralising-sarscov2-101627564287282.html

They are from Quetta, Balochistan," Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police said in a statement in Lahore.The police claimed that they have established a "common link" between the incident and the blast outside the house of Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief and Mumbai terror attack mastermind Saeed in Lahore.Three persons were killed and 24 others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside Saeed's residence at the Board of Revenue Housing Society in Johar Town in Lahore on June 23.After the bus explosion in Dasu, China had rushed a special team amid confusing signals from Pakistan that it could be a gas blast. Islamabad later admitted it was a bomb blast stating that traces of explosive substance were found from the scene.The Dasu bus blast had accentuated Beijing’s concerns as thousands of Chinese personnel worked in installations and projects being built under the aegis of the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-work-closely-with-pak-prosecute-those-responsible-for-tragic-bus-blast-101627561799790.html
29-07-2021||World||US considers economic aid to be critical in preventing cross-border migration||The Biden administration is releasing its long-awaited strategy on addressing the root causes of migration from Central America as it continues to struggle with record high numbers of apprehensions at the US southern border.The strategy, spearheaded by Vice President Kamala Harris and the White House national security team, calls on the US to help expand economic opportunities in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in part by urging private-sector companies to invest there. It also includes programs to make agricultural operations that form the backbone of those nations’ economies more resistant to natural disaster and climate, which have caused people to flee.The document also outlines efforts to fight corruption, promote democratic governance and protect human rights as well as plans to counter smuggling rings, domestic violence and gender-based crimes.The strategy, according to a White House fact sheet, “is driven by the US government’s belief that all individuals should be able to find safety and achieve a stable and dignified life within their own countries. When that is not the case, asylum and other legal migration pathways should be available to those who need them.”Harris, in a letter, said that the coronavirus pandemic “and extreme weather conditions have indeed exacerbated the root causes of migration — which include corruption, violence, trafficking, and poverty. While our administration is proud that we have sent millions of vaccine doses and hurricane relief, we know that it is not enough to alleviate suffering in the long term.”She added that the administration had enlisted allies in the effort: “We have already received commitments from the governments of Mexico, Japan, and Korea, and the United Nations, to join the United States in providing relief to the region.”More than 150 businesses have expressed interest in making investments and charitable contributions to the region. Twelve companies have already done so. The UN also plans to issue a humanitarian response plan in September, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the plan.Another official said the administration’s goal is not to end migration from Central America but rather to ensure people come using legal means. The administration is exploring ways to make it easier for Central Americans to seek asylum in the US while still in their home countries, making more work visas and refugee slots available to Central Americans and working with other nations like Costa Rica to accept more migrants from the region.Biden, Harris and other administration officials have told migrants “don’t come” to the US-Mexican border, saying that it involves making an unsafe journey.US authorities have reported more than 1.1 million apprehensions at the US-Mexico border this fiscal year, including 188,000 in June, a two-decade high that has fueled Republican criticism of Biden’s policies.Yet more than a third of those who were caught were repeat crossers who had been apprehended by officers at least once in the past 12 months, according to US Customs and Border Protection. That is being driven by Title 42, a public-health authority invoked last year by then-President Donald Trump that allows authorities to quickly expel single adults and families. Biden administration officials have not said when they would lift that order.Trump and other Republicans have repeatedly assailed the Biden administration’s response to the surge in migration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-considers-economic-aid-to-be-critical-in-preventing-cross-border-migration-101627559584279.html
29-07-2021||World||Floods make thousands homeless in Bangladesh Rohingya camps||Days of heavy rainfall have pelted Rohingya refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, destroying dwellings and sending thousands of people to live with extended family or in communal shelters.Just in the 24 hours to Wednesday alone, more than 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) of rain fell on the camps in Cox’s Bazar district hosting more than 800,000 Rohingya, the U.N. refugee agency said. That’s nearly half the average July rainfall in one day while more heavy downpours are expected in the next few days and the monsoon season stretches over the next three months.“The situation is further compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is currently a strict national lockdown in response to rising cases across the country,” the agency said.The agency said it was saddened by the deaths of six people at the camps earlier this week, five in a landslide caused by the rains and a child swept away by floodwaters.Citing initial reports, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said more than 12,000 refugees were affected by the heavy rainfall while an estimated 2,500 shelters have been damaged or destroyed. More than 5,000 refugees have temporarily been relocated to other family member’s shelters or communal facilities, the agency said in a statement.Refugees said they were struggling to eat or drink properly.“Due to the continuous rainfall for the last four days, today my house is full of water,” says Khatija Begum, who has five children. “We are not even able to eat.” Begum says she fears her children will drown and die in their sleep.Cyclones, heavy monsoon rains, floods, landslides and other natural hazards are an annual difficulty in the camps. More than 700,000 Rohingya have lived in refugee camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began a harsh crackdown on the Muslim ethnic group following an attack by insurgents.The crackdown included rapes, killings and the torching of thousands of homes, and was termed ethnic cleansing by global rights groups and the United Nations. While Bangladesh and Myanmar have sought to arrange repatriations, the Rohingya are too fearful to return home.The International Organization for Migration says Cox’s Bazar district, where more than 1 million Rohingya refugees live, is one of the most disaster-prone parts of Bangladesh.It is a delta nation crisscrossed by many rivers that gets intense rainfall regularly due to its monsoon climate and location on the Bay of Bengal, where the warm waters can generate destructive tropical cyclones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floods-make-thousands-homeless-in-bangladesh-rohingya-camps-101627552188134.html
29-07-2021||World||China lashes out at Blinken’s meeting with Dalai Lama aide||Beijing on Thursday lashed out at the US secretary of state Antony Blinken for meeting Tibetan leader Dalai Lama’s representative in New Delhi, saying it violated Washington’s commitment to recognise Tibet as part of China.Blinken on Wednesday met with Ngodup Dongchung, a representative of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), also known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, who presented him with a scarf from the Dharmshala-based Dalai Lama.Blinken also met Geshe Dorji Damdul, director of Tibet House in Delhi, during an interaction with representatives from civil society groups.Blinken’s meeting with Ngodup Dongchung was seen as the most significant one since the Dalai Lama met then-president Barack Obama in Washington in 2016.A day later, the Chinese foreign ministry reacted sharply to the interaction, saying it was an interference in China’s affairs. Speaking on Thursday, spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the Tibet affairs were purely China’s own affairs and should not be interfered with by any outside forces. “The 14th Dalai Lama is not a mere religious figure, but a political exile who has long engaged in anti-China separatist activities and is trying to separate Tibet from China,” Zhao said when asked to respond to Blinken’s meetings.China, Zhao said, firmly opposes any form of contact between officials of any country and the Dalai Lama.The US contacts with the “Dalai clique”, and any form they take, violate the US commitment to recognise Tibet as part of China, he said. “Any formal contact between the US and the Dalai clique is a violation of the US commitment to acknowledge Tibet being a part of China; do not support Tibetan independence, do not support attempts to separate China,” he said.“We urge the US to honour its commitment to stop meddling in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of Tibetan affairs, and offer no support to Tibet independence forces to engage in anti-China separatist activities,” Zhao said.China, he said, will take all necessary measures to defend its rights and interests.Blinken’s meeting with representatives of the Dalai Lama comes weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished the Tibetan leader ahead of his 86th birthday on July 6 - a rare public messaging to him from an Indian leader given China’s sensitivities.China’s President Xi Jinping visited the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) earlier this month for the first time, beginning his visit from a village close to the border with the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.In May, China said it would choose the successor to the Dalai Lama through “drawing lots from the golden urn” with the candidate subject to the approval of the Communist Party of China (CPC)-ruled central government.Citing historical precedence, a government policy paper on Tibet said the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas has been subjected to approval by the central government since an ordinance passed during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).“The ordinance stipulated that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas had to follow the procedure of ‘drawing lots from the golden urn’, and the selected candidate would be subject to approval by the central government of China,” the White Paper, titled “Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity”, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lashes-out-at-blinken-s-meeting-with-dalai-lama-aide-101627559877459.html

While 21% of the 1,600 respondents said they believed prayer and vaccines were equally effective in preventing coronavirus transmission, only a quarter of them believed vaccines are more effective than prayer.South Africans living in high levels of poverty and those below the age of 35 are most hesitant to get inoculated. On the other hand, half of the respondents with no formal schooling were more inclined to get vaccinated than those with at least a primary education. People living in urban areas showed less willingness to get vaccinated than rural residents.Less than 10% of the South African population has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and the survey, conducted by Afrobarometer, shows the hurdle in the government's drive to vaccinate two-thirds of its citizens. The survey suggests that South Africans consider themselves well-informed about Covid-19 but do not trust the government to ensure the vaccines are safe.Afrobarometer said that the survey, conducted in May and June, has a 2.5 percentage point margin of error.South Africa has reported over 2.4 million Covid-19 cases and more than 70,000 related deaths. While about 7 million people have been administered at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, less than 3 million people have been fully vaccinated.The Beta variant of coronavirus, first detected in South Africa, was behind the country’s disastrous second Covid wave.A study found that the Beta variant showed widespread antibody escape for those vaccinated with the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.

He went around hospitals collecting body parts, starting with Tharwat's scalp, and buried his remains in a small coffin.Nearly a year later, Hoteit, a spokesperson for families of more than 200 people who died in the disaster, is still trying to call to account those he says are responsible for allowing the accident to happen.Earlier this month, during a protest outside the caretaker interior minister's house in the Lebanese capital, he said security forces used tear gas during scuffles with the crowd."We can't be deprived of truth and justice in the face of a crime of such magnitude," he told Reuters.As Beirut prepares to mark the first anniversary of a blast that flattened large swathes of the city, politicians and senior security officials have yet to be questioned in a formal investigation.In the latest twist, Tarek Bitar, the judge leading the probe, had a request to question Major General Abbas Ibrahim - head of the powerful General Security agency - turned down by caretaker interior minister Mohamed Fahmy.Ibrahim said he was subject to the law like all Lebanese, but the investigation should take place "far away from narrow political considerations".Fahmy's decision prompted some relatives of those killed to march near his house this month, carrying empty coffins covered in images of the victims. The demonstration turned violent.A senior interior ministry source said measures the security forces took were necessary to protect the private home of the minister.The relatives' frustration reflects widespread anger among Lebanese about the investigation and, more broadly, over how the country is being run.Lebanon's debt has spiralled, inflation is high, more than half the population lives in poverty and rival political factions have repeatedly failed to form a government.SetbacksMuch of the devastation from the blast is still visible. The port resembles a bomb site, and many buildings have been left in a state of collapse.Major questions remain unanswered, including why such a large shipment of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in bombs and fertiliser, was left stored in the middle of a crowded city for years after being unloaded in 2013.The immunity enjoyed by senior officials has raised suspicions among some families that there may never be accountability."How can you have justice if everyone from the smallest official to the biggest ... has immunity?" said Nizar Saghieh, head of the Legal Agenda, a research and advocacy organization.Fahmy's move to block the judge from questioning Ibrahim was based on the advice of a judicial committee at the interior ministry not to lift his immunity, according to a letter explaining the decision.The challenges Bitar faces are not unique.His predecessor, Fadi Sawan, was removed from the probe in February after a court granted the request of two of the former ministers he charged with negligence for the disaster - Ali Hassan Khalil and Ghazi Zeaiter - to have him removed.A copy of the decision seen by Reuters cited "legitimate suspicion" over Sawan's neutrality, partly because it alleged his house was damaged in the blast.Khalil and Zeaiter, along with a third former minister and the outgoing prime minister Hassan Diab, declared their innocence when Sawan charged them, refused to be questioned as suspects and accused Sawan of overstepping his powers.A document seen by Reuters that was sent just over two weeks before the blast showed the president and prime minister were warned about the security risk posed by the chemicals stored at the port and that they could destroy the capital.Bitar wants the government and parliament to allow him to question several top officials, including all those charged by Sawan, in addition to former Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk.With his request to question Ibrahim denied, the immediate fate of Bitar's investigation appears to rest on parliamentary immunity being lifted from Machnouk, Khalil and Zeaiter, all of whom are MPs.MPs met to discuss Bitar's request earlier this month, saying they needed more information to before deciding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-blast-investigation-stalls-again-families-still-outraged-101627553435357.html
29-07-2021||World||Imran Khan explains 'only solution' to Afghan situation, clarifies Pakistan is not Taliban spokesperson||Though Afghanistan now has two choices of continuing with the US military, which has been tried and tested for the past 20 years and to form a government with the Taliban, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said only one choice will lead to the solution. Then he added that Pakistan is not the spokesperson of the Taliban. Khan made these comments while interacting with the representatives of Afghan media that were aired on Thursday, the Dawn reported. A day before, the Pakistan Premier said the Taliban are normal civilians and not some military outfits that his country can hunt down."What the Taliban are doing or aren't doing has nothing to do with us. We are not responsible, neither are we spokespersons for the Taliban," Imran Khan said adding Pakistan has no interest to fuel civil war in Afghanistan. In his opinion, no one party will be able to take over Afghanistan and so whoever comes to power in Afghanistan, Pakistan will have good relations with them. "What interest could Pakistan have in backing someone to take over Afghanistan? Now, and especially in my government, we believe that Afghanistan can never be controlled from the outside. We have no favourites now," Imran Khan said."Now You have two choices. Twenty years of the military solution has been attempted to bring peace to Afghanistan and that's failed," Khan said adding that Afghanistan can continue with the US military if it thinks that it doesn't want Taliban to be part of the government. "But everyone knows that is not possible anymore. The other choice is a political compromise between Taliban and the government and to form an exclusive government and that is the only solution," the Pak premier said.Pakistan had nothing to do with the failure of the Nato troops in Afghanistan. "It's exactly like what the Americans did in Vietnam. When they failed in Vietnam, they blamed insurgents from Cambodia or Laos."A day before, on the question of providing safe haven to the Taliban in Pakistan, Imran Khan in an interview with PBS NewsHour said, "There are camps of 500,000 people; there are camps of 100,000 people. And Taliban are not some military outfits, they are normal civilians. And if there are some civilians in these camps, how is Pakistan supposed to hunt these people down? How can you call them sanctuaries?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-explains-only-solution-to-afghan-situation-clarifies-pakistan-is-not-taliban-spokesperson-101627551460236.html
29-07-2021||World||New Zealand best placed to survive global collapse, 4 other countries favourite||New Zealand is best placed to survive a collapse of global civilisation owing to widespread reversal of the trends, according to a study. The researchers said ecological destruction, limited resources, and population growth, with climate change serving as a “risk multiplier” has left human civilisation in a “perilous state”.The study, carried out by Nick King and Professor Aled Jones of the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), noted that increasing “globalisation, complexification, interdependency and the speed of fundamental societal support systems” creates significant global risks that could lead to large-scale failures.These factors could trigger a global societal collapse during a “long descent” or very rapidly in the space of less than a year without warning of the coming disruption, the study said.The researchers assessed the most favourable starting conditions to survive a global collapse by examining energy and manufacturing infrastructure, the ability to grow enough food for the population and isolation from large population centres to avoid unwanted mass migration.Also Read | Qatar Airways named world's best airline for 2021. Here's list of top 20 carriersThe researchers identified five nations that could act as a “collapse lifeboat”, with New Zealand having the greatest potential. The other four countries most suited to maintaining higher levels of societal, technological, and organisational complexity within their own borders are Iceland, the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland.The strong oceanic climatic influence and low temperature and precipitation variability in these five countries make them a favourite landmass for relatively stable conditions despite the effects of climate change, the study said. New Zealand topped the list due to its low population, abundant agricultural land, and ability to produce geothermal and hydroelectric energy.“Significant changes are possible in the coming years and decades. The impact of climate change, including increased frequency and intensity of drought and flooding, extreme temperatures, and greater population movement, could dictate the severity of these changes,” said Jones, co-author of the study published in the journal Sustainability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-best-placed-to-survive-global-collapse-4-other-countries-favourite-101627550314161.html
29-07-2021||World||Beijing records first Covid-19 cases in months||Beijing recorded its first two Covid-19 cases in months on Wednesday with authorities sealing communities and launching nucleic acid testing for residents in a northern district as health authorities scramble to contain a spreading Delta variant outbreak linked to the eastern city of Nanjing.Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province, has launched a third round of nucleic acid testing for all its 9.3 million residents in just nine days as new infections soared to 171 since last week.The citywide testing covers all residents, including those who are paying a short visit to the city, health authorities said on Thursday, adding that 18 new locally confirmed cases were reported on Wednesday.The outbreak linked to Nanjing has spread to at least five provinces and 13 cities including the cities of Beijing, Chengdu in southwest China and Dalian in the northeast of the country.China reported 49 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, down from 86 a day earlier, the national health commission (NHC) said.Local infections accounted for 24 of the cases that were detected on Wednesday, lower than 55 recorded for Tuesday, the NHC added. Nucleic acid tests for residents in Changping, a district in north Beijing, were launched on Thursday after a couple was found to be Covid-19 positive. More than 650 contacts of the couple have been traced so far.State media reports said the seven infected persons in Beijing, Dalian, and Chengdu, had recently attended a show in the tourist town of Zhangjiajie in central China’s Hunan province on July 22 where an unknown number among the 2,000-odd attendees had flown in from Nanjing.Nanjing, the second largest city in eastern China after Shanghai, has seen cases of locally transmitted Covid-19 soar since around nine airport workers tested positive for coronavirus on July 20.The workers at the Nanjing Lukou International Airport tested positive for the virus during a routine inspection.The official Xinhua news agency reported that tracing of the Nanjing outbreak suggested the source was inadequately protected staff who cleaned aircraft after international flights landed at the airport.Infections have since spread across the city and beyond including among university dormitory administrators, teachers, and taxi drivers, authorities said.The city now has classified four areas as high-risk for Covid-19 and 42 as medium-risk areas.Nanjing has been virtually sealed with inter-provincial transport links suspended.On Tuesday, the city’s centre for disease control and prevention said the virus strain behind the recent spike in Covid-19 cases has been identified as the highly infectious Delta variant.“Officials therefore have urged those queuing up for the test to wear masks, keep at least one metre apart and avoid chitchat,” Xinhua reported.Since the novel coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, China has taken a zero-tolerance approach to infections, quickly testing large populations, tracing the contacts of positive cases and locking down communities where needed to break the infection chain.The current outbreak will be a test of the efficacy of China’s vaccination programme under which more than 1.5 billion doses have been administered so far, fully vaccinating around 40% of the population.Total confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China stood at 92,811 and the death toll at 4,636 until Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-records-first-covid-19-cases-in-months-101627549615088.html
29-07-2021||World||Hong Kong radio host faces first 'sedition' trial after China's takeover||A pro-democracy Hong Kong radio host went on trial Thursday for sedition in the first use of the colonial-era law since the city's handover to China as authorities broaden their criminalisation of dissent.Tam Tak-chi, 48, is among a growing number of activists charged with sedition, a little-used decades-old law that prosecutors have dusted off in the last twelve months.It is separate from the sweeping national security law that was imposed on Hong Kong last year, which has also been used to prosecute dissidents.Best known by his moniker "Fast Beat", online talk show host Tam faces eight sedition charges for slogans he either uttered or wrote between January and July last year.He also faces other charges including inciting an unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct.At the opening of his trial on Thursday, prosecutors read out those slogans, as well as some pro-democracy speeches Tam gave, often littered with colourful Cantonese curse words.The slogans included "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times", "Corrupt cops, all of your family go to hell", "Disband Hong Kong police, delay no more" and "Down with the Communist Party of China".The trial is a watershed legal moment for Hong Kong because it will set a precedent for what political phrases and views are now deemed illegal as China looks to stamp out dissent following huge and often violent democracy protests two years ago.- Forgotten relic -On Tuesday, a Hong Kong court convicted a former waiter of terrorism and inciting secession in the first trial conducted under the new national security law.During that trial, judges ruled that the popular protest slogan "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times" was secessionist and therefore a national security crime.Tam's trial was delayed so judges could wait for Tuesday's verdict, which was from a higher court.In Hong Kong, sedition is broadly defined as any words that generate "hatred, contempt or disaffection" towards the government or "encourage disaffection" among residents.It was first penned by colonial ruler Britain in 1938 and had long been criticised as an anti-free speech law.By the time of Hong Kong's 1997 handover, it had not been used for decades and was a largely forgotten relic on the statute books in a city that had become a regional bastion of free speech.But China is currently remoulding Hong Kong in its own authoritarian image and the newly created national security police unit has resurrected the sedition law.Last week, five members of a pro-democracy Hong Kong union that published children's books about sheep trying to hold back wolves from their village were arrested for sedition.Three have since been charged and remanded into custody.Sedition carries up to two years in jail for a first offence.In contrast, the national security law is much harsher with up to life in prison for those who are convicted of serious offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-radio-host-faces-first-sedition-trial-after-china-s-takeover-101627546153820.html
29-07-2021||World||Israeli authorities conduct inspection of NSO Group’s office||Israeli authorities have conducted an inspection of the office of the cyber-security firm NSO group following allegations by an international consortium of journalists about the misuse of its Pegasus spyware around the world. The inspection was announced on Wednesday in a tweet in Hebrew by the Israeli defence ministry’s official Twitter account, which said: “Representatives from a number of bodies came to NSO today to examine the publications and allegations raised in its case.” The defence ministry didn’t identify the bodies that visited the NSO Group office or give more details. Israeli news website Calcalist, which first reported the inspection, described it as a “raid”. Reports said officials inspected the firm’s office at Herzliya near Tel Aviv. NSO Group confirmed the inspection in a statement sent to the media. “We can confirm that representatives from the Israeli Ministry of Defense visited our offices. We welcome their inspection,” it said. The firm, which has already denied the allegations of unauthorised surveillance of mobile phones using its spyware, said it is “working in full transparency with the Israeli authorities.” It added, “We are confident that this inspection will prove the facts are as declared repeatedly by the company against the false allegations made against us in the recent media attacks.” Also Read | Why I went to the SC on Pegasus: MP John BrittasThe international media consortium last week began publishing reports based on what is believed to be a leaked list of 50,000 phone numbers worldwide that were targeted by NSO’s customers for surveillance. Evidence of the Pegasus spyware was found on 37 phones that were examined by forensic experts, including in India. Journalists, businesspeople, critics of the government and politicians were among those allegedly targeted in India. NSO says its software is sold only to government customers after vetting by Israeli authorities. The Indian government has denied all wrongdoing and has also not confirmed or denied acquiring the Pegasus spyware. The report by Calcalist said the possibility of the inspection by authorities leading to “substantial sanctions on NSO is slim”. It added that the defence ministry and NSO have “complementary interests”, and authorities have in the past used their “power to protect the company from criticism and lawsuits”. Calcalist also reported that the inspection was coordinated with NSO and didn’t include an audit or examination of the firm’s computer systems or documents. NSO Group has faced increasing pressure from the world community, especially after the international consortium of journalists’ reports revealed that among the phones targeted for surveillance were those of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and French President Emmanuel Macron. The French leader has sought an investigation. Israeli defence minister Benny Gantz is set to meet his French counterpart Florence Parly to brief her on the findings of a government assessment of NSO’s exports. A statement from Gantz’s office said: ““He will also update the minister on the topic of NSO.” Gantz’s ministry, which oversees commercial exports of cyber-surveillance technologies, is part of a high-level task force assessing allegations about Pegasus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-authorities-conduct-inspection-of-nso-group-s-office-101627548114841.html
29-07-2021||World||Delta variant drives virus spread to three China provinces||China Thursday reported small coronavirus outbreaks driven by the Delta variant in three provinces as a cluster linked to an eastern airport spreads despite mass testing and a vaccination drive.The flare-up, which began after nine workers at the Nanjing airport tested positive on July 20, has seen 171 cases detected in Jiangsu province, while infections have spread to at least four other provinces.It is geographically the largest spread for several months, challenging China's aggressive containment efforts which have relied on mass testing, lockdowns and swift contact tracing.The virus first emerged in the central city of Wuhan, but China has extolled its success in largely extinguishing the pandemic inside its borders, allowing the economy to rebound.The new outbreak, coupled with cases seeping over the porous border with Myanmar, is threatening that record.Officials in Jiangsu have locked down hundreds of thousands of residents, Lu Jing, a member of the epidemic prevention taskforce, told reporters Thursday."Internet cafes, gyms, cinemas and karaoke bars and even libraries in Nanjing have been shut down," he said.The city has tested all 9.2 million residents twice, he said, adding that the highly contagious Delta variant is posing challenges to containment efforts.The southwestern province of Sichuan reported three new cases Thursday while Beijing reported two locally transmitted infections, the first in six months.The Beijing patients -- a married couple -- living on the outskirts of the Chinese capital, tested positive after returning from a tourist hotspot in central China, a health official said.More than 650 close contacts have since been identified and quarantines imposed."It is currently the summer vacation, a peak period of tourism, travel and gatherings... There should be no slack in prevention and control of the epidemic," Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the city's centre for disease control, told reporters.A high-end hotel in downtown Beijing has been locked down after media reported an imported case was found among the guests.Police and workers wearing PPE suits were seen outside the Legendale Hotel on Thursday.Most of the patients testing positive in the latest outbreak have already been vaccinated, raising concerns about the efficacy of vaccines against new variants.China is racing to vaccinate at least 65 percent of its 1.4-billion population by the end of the year.The country had administered 1.6 billion doses of the vaccine as of Wednesday, the National Health Commission said, without offering details on the number of people fully inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-drives-virus-spread-to-three-china-provinces-101627547395896.html

The new rules will come into effect from Monday.Currently, only people who received their Covid-19 vaccine in the UK can avoid quarantine when arriving from these "amber list" countries under the government’s traffic list travel system.However, India continues to remain on the red list which means even if fully vaccinated, the travellers from here will have to undergo compulsory 10-day quarantine upon reaching England. The next review of that status is expected by the middle of next week.Announcing the new rules UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, “We’ve taken great strides on our journey to reopen international travel and today is another important step forward. Whether you are a family reuniting for the first time since the start of the pandemic or a business benefiting from increased trade - this is progress we can all enjoy.”He said that further relaxations will depend on the latest scientific data. Since the UK is ravaged by the delta variant of the coronavirus, first identified in India, the change in status is expected to be difficult. France too is out of the amber list due to a surge in Beta variant cases in the country.India had last week urged the UK government to remove it from the red list. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, who went to the UK on a two-day visit, met UK foreign officials and told them that the pandemic situation in India is improving.Shringla said that Mumbai, Delhi are "practically free of Covid".Meanwhile, UK’s top epidemiologist Neil Ferguson has said that the end of the pandemic in Britain could be just months away. Speaking to BBC, Ferguson said he is positive that by late September, October time "we will be looking back at most of the pandemic".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lifts-quarantine-for-us-eu-travellers-india-still-on-red-list-101627534110057.html
29-07-2021||World||Animal life may have existed 890 million years ago: Canadian scientist||A Canadian scientist has claimed to have found evidence of the oldest form of animal life, in the form of sponges, on Earth, dating back 890 million years ago or about 350 million years older than what is currently the case.These findings were published by Elizabeth Turner, sedimentary geologist and professor with the Harquail School of Earth Sciences at the Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario. Her peer-reviewed paper was published by the journal Nature.In the paper, she stated, “If the Little Dal objects are truly sponge body fossils, they are older than the next-youngest undisputed sponge body fossils (Cambrian) by approximately 350 million years.”Little Dal refers to the area with the reefs containing the sponge fossils which were discovered in the northwest territories of Canada.Cambrian refers to the period approximately 541 million years ago which is associated with an “explosion” of the first animals on the planet, as per fossil records. According to an article in Nature accompanying the study, these included arthropods, molluscs and worms.In response to emailed queries from the Hindustan Times, Turner said, “If I am correct in my interpretation of the material, it establishes that animals were already present by 890 million years ago.” That would make these “350 million years older than the next-youngest undisputed sponge fossil”. Though this may seem a big difference, she said it was “actually not all that surprising. We already knew that animals must have had a lengthy evolutionary history prior to the appearance of mineralised animal body fossils (such as shells and exoskeletons) in rocks younger than 540 million years. Molecular clock estimates place the origin of sponges in the same time-frame as the age of the rocks I worked on, and so it is not surprising to find possible physical evidence of sponges at that time”.She explained that sponges are the most basic animal in the animal tree of life, so it would not be surprising that the earliest animals may have been sponge-like.Turner collected the samples as a student from the ancient reefs and has argued they display complex structures unlike cyanobacteria and algae. She said, “I initially discovered the material accidentally several decades ago while working on my unrelated PhD research.” The idea “gestated” in her mind, but what finally allowed her to publish was that there “have been a number of recent papers on how sponges get preserved, and that’s the information I needed to support the interpretation of my own strikingly similar but much older material”.According to an accompanying article in Nature, Turner examined her samples, slices of rock, under a microscope and saw “branching networks of crystalline tubes” which she “later realised” were structures resembling “the internal scaffolding of modern horny sponges, and line up with the expected decay and fossilisation patterns of spongin, a collagen protein that forms their scaffolding.” The argument forwarded is that these crystalline tubes seen in the rocks could have formed when the collagen-like skeleton of the 890-million-year-old sponges decayed and fossilised.Despite the adverse low-oxygen environment, the sponges could have survived on oxygen released by photosynthetic cyanobacteria and being nourished by the “organic ooze” these microorganisms generated.As the Nature study appeared, Laurentian University tweeted, “We should note Dr Turner’s discovery would be the oldest form of animal life discovered on Earth.”The Nature article also cited scientists questioning the findings and seeking further evidence before arriving at the conclusion these animals, the sponges, existed nearly nine million centuries back.Asked about her confidence in the discovery, she replied the evidence is “very distinctive to sponges, and does not compare favourably to other possible interpretations such as microbial, algal, or fungal”. While she is “reasonably comfortable publishing” the findings, she added her “main intent” was to “present a new type of evidence and a logical interpretation of it, and then open it up to the scientific community for discussions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/animal-life-may-have-existed-890-million-years-ago-canadian-scientist-101627534193270.html

The development comes amid a surge in new Covid-19 infections in the United States as the more infectious delta variant spreads like wildfire across the nation.“I think when someone says here’s $100 for you, that’s going to make a big impact,” the New York Times quoted de Blasio as saying. “The key is vaccination. We can talk about so many other issues with Covid-19, but if we're not talking about vaccination then we're not talking about the solution.”New York, as of Wednesday, had vaccinated nearly 71% of all the adults in the city, the report said, adding that around 59% of the city's total population have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. More than 65% of adults and 54% of New York City's total population have been fully vaccinated, the report added.The delta variant of the coronavirus is, however, making things complicated. Certain parts of New York look like they're once again on their way to becoming a Covid-19 hot spot, and CDC guidelines suggest that authorities enforce mandatory masking for both vaccinated and unvaccinated citizens.The new guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which arrived on Tuesday, recommend both vaccinated and unvaccinated Americans wear masks in those areas which have registered more than 50 new cases per 100,000 residents over the week prior, or where more than 8% of Covid-19 tests came back positive over the same period.All five of New York's boroughs tick the check-boxes under these criteria, according to the publication. While Brooklyn and Manhattan have recorded 78.1 and 70.4 cases per 100,000 residents, respectively, Staten Island clocked a staggering 109 positive cases per 100,000 residents last week.New York mayor de Blasio calls this "complicated information".“So our health team is reviewing, and we’ll have more to say on it in the next few days,” he was quoted as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-offers-100-to-whoever-gets-vaccinated-against-covid-19-at-city-run-sites-101627527305873.html
29-07-2021||World||Qin Gang, new Chinese envoy to US, vows to bring frayed ties 'back on track'||A close confidante of Chinese President Xi Jingping has reached Washington as his country’s new ambassador to the United States.Considered one of China's most prominent "Wolf Warrior" diplomats, Qin Gang, is taking up the new role at a time when ties between the two nations are at a low and he is likely to deliver a combative message.With two stints as an aggressive foreign ministry spokesperson, the new envoy has vowed to bring US-China ties "back on track"."As two big countries different in history, culture, social system and development stage, China and the United States are entering a new round of mutual exploration, understanding and adaptation, trying to find a way to get along with each other," Gang told reporters on his arrival in the American capital.The relationship has rapidly deteriorated in recent years, with the two powers clashing on a wide range of issues, including trade, human rights, cybersecurity and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.While President Joe Biden has lowered the tone since taking office, he has largely maintained his predecessor Donald Trump's stance on China and described it as the pre-eminent challenge to the United States.Gang, who accompanied Xi on numerous overseas trips as the foreign ministry's protocol chief, is among the diplomats who have vigorously defended China in the face of increasing criticism on the world stage. In February, he defended the style of diplomacy as a necessary response to "groundless slander" and "crazy attacks against China".The 55-year-old is considered more hawkish than his predecessor in Washington, Cui Tiankai. Fluent in English, the new envoy has spent years at the Chinese embassy in London.Beijing-based independent analyst Hua Po described Qin as "one of the backbone members" of the Wolf Warrior movement, with diplomats adopting an indignant tone to defend the Communist-led country and even promote conspiracy theories or openly insult foreign counterparts.However, Xi has urged top political leaders to help cultivate a "reliable, admirable and respectable" international image to improve China's soft power.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qin-gang-new-chinese-envoy-to-us-vows-to-bring-frayed-ties-back-on-track-101627529867592.html
29-07-2021||World||First sign of animal life on Earth may be a sponge fossil||A Canadian geologist may have found the earliest fossil record of animal life on Earth, according to a report published Wednesday in the journal Nature.Around a billion years ago, a region of northwest Canada now defined by steep mountains was a prehistoric marine environment where the remains of ancient sponges may be preserved in mineral sediment, the paper says.Geologist Elizabeth Turner discovered the rocks in a remote region of the Northwest Territories accessible only by helicopter, where she has been excavating since the 1980s. Thin sections of rock contain three-dimensional structures that resemble modern sponge skeletons.“I believe these are ancient sponges — only this type of organism has this type of network of organic filaments,” said Joachim Reitner, a geobiologist and expert in sponges at Germany's University of Gottingen, who was not involved in the research.The dating of adjacent rock layers indicates the samples are about 890 million years old, which would make them about 350 million years older than the oldest undisputed sponge fossils previously found.“What’s most stunning is the timing,” said Paco Cardenas, an expert on sponges at Sweden's Uppsala University, who was not involved in the research. “To have discovered sponge fossils from close to 900 million years ago will greatly improve our understanding of early animal evolution.”Many scientists believe the first animal groups included soft sponges or sponge-like creatures that lack muscles and nerves but have other features of simple animals, including cells with differentiated functions and sperm.To be sure, there’s very little scientific consensus or certainty about anything dating back a billion years ago, so other researchers will likely continue to vet and debate Turner's findings.“I think she’s got a pretty strong case. I think this is very worthy of publishing — it puts the evidence out there for other people to consider,” said David Bottjer, a paleobiologist at University of Southern California, who was not involved in the research.Scientists believe life on Earth emerged around 3.7 billion years ago. The earliest animals appeared much later, but exactly when is still debated.Until now, the oldest undisputed fossil sponges date to around 540 million years ago, an era called the Cambrian period.But scientists using a line of reasoning called the molecular clock — where they analyze the rate of genetic mutations to backdate when two species likely diverged — say that available evidence points to sponges emerging much earlier, around a billion years ago.Yet no supporting physical evidence has yet been found until now.“This would be the first time that a sponge fossil has been found from before the Cambrian, and not only before, but way before — that’s what’s most exciting,” said Uppsala University’s Cardenas, adding that the research seems to confirm the molecular clock estimates.Fossil evidence is scant before the Cambrian period when animals first developed hard skeletons, exoskeletons and shells, which are more likely to be preserved.“Those kinds of fossils belong to more complicated animals — obviously there has to be a back history” of simpler animals like sponges emerging first, said the paper's author Turner, who is based at Laurentian University in Ontario.The dating of 890 million years ago is significant because, if the sponge's identification is confirmed, it shows that the first animals evolved before a time when oxygen in the atmosphere and ocean reached a level scientists once thought was necessary for animal life. Yet recent research shows that some sponges can survive with very little oxygen.“Everything on Earth has an ancestor. It’s always been predicted that the first evidence of animal life would be small and cryptic, a very subtle clue,” said Roger Summons, an MIT geobiologist who was not involved in the research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-sign-of-animal-life-on-earth-may-be-a-sponge-fossil-101627525649268.html

New York, like other US states, has seen a rising number of coronavirus cases linked to the Delta variant.England skips quarantine of vaccinated visitorsFully vaccinated travellers from the US and much of Europe can enter England without quarantining starting next week.The British government said that people who have received both doses of a vaccine approved by the FDA in the US or the European Medicines Agency, can take pre and post-arrival coronavirus tests instead of self-isolating.Pfizer: 3rd dose boosts protection against DeltaA third dose of the Pfizer jab can increase protection against the Delta variant of Covid-19 - as compared with the protection given by two doses - according to data posted online by Pfizer, the CNN reports.The data reportedly shows that antibody levels against Delta in the 18-55 age group who receive a third dose are more than five-fold than after a second dose. In the 65-85 age group, antibody levels against Delta after a third dose are more than 11-fold, the report says.France to start anti-Covid passes for cafes, trainsFrance will from August 9 enforce new legislation that will make a health pass compulsory to visit a cafe, board a plane or travel on an intercity train, a government spokesman said. The legislation was passed by parliament during the weekend.Israel approves jabs for at risk children aged 5-11Children in Israel aged five to 11 at risk of serious health complications can be vaccinated against Covid-19 as of August 1, Israeli health officials said on Wednesday.“This is a special authorisation, and each vaccination will be studied on a case-by-case basis,” a ministry spokesperson told AFP on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ny-to-ask-state-employees-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-or-get-tested-101627504975225.html

Baradar, as per the Chinese readout, said, “China has always been a trustworthy friend of the Afghan people.”Meanwhile, Pakistan PM Imran Khan said the US “really messed it up” in Afghanistan as he questioned the US motive for the 2001 invasion and its attempts at seeking a political solution with the Taliban from a position of weakness. He said the only good solution is through a political settlement that is “inclusive”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-calls-upon-taliban-to-steer-afghan-peace-bid-101627504500869.html
